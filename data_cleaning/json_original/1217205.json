You could spend hours here or 5-minutes depending on your interests. The bull bar, Torre del Oro, is worth a stop. The places I ate at were not worth a visit. The best thing about this Plaza are the streets entering the square like a star. They lead to nice shops and restaurants and windy streets that can get you lost. I would suggest drinking at the bull bar and then walking down each street for a block or two and see where the road takes you.", "Date": "September 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Plaza\u201d", "Author": "Tracy R", "ReviewID": "UR137476205", "Content": "Easy to get to from central Madrid, the Plaza Mayor reminds me of St. Marks square in Venice.

Beautiful corner room with balcony overlooking the plaza into Plaza Mayor. Quiet at night and very friendly staff. The room was very clean and modern. 3 Large floor-ceiling windows and the corner balcony made the trip. Ask for a corner room and you can enjoy the balcony! Will stay again.

The most surprising aspect is that the hotel is very quiet given its location in a busy part of the city. The rooms are not very large but overall OK. The breakfast is very good and cheap when compared with what you pay in restaurants nearby. For dining the streets right behind the Plaza Mayor are great and within walking distance of the hotel.", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cPlaya Mayor is an amazing structure & place of history\u201d", "Author": "chapter1_andy", "ReviewID": "UR125641244", "Content": "I visited Madrid, Spain in 2011.

We stayed at this hotel both times. The first time we had one of the more expensive rooms which was fairly large. This time we decided to keep costs down, and went for a less expensive room. Both were a good value for the appropriate price. The location is excellent for walking to all major sights, and public transportation is convenient for those sights outside the central area. Breakfast is not included, as is typical of Spain. The buffet breakfast offered was worth the price for the two mornings we ate at the hotel. There are other places nearby for purchase of all levels of breakfast, and also a Starbucks (for those Americans who need that daily \"fix\"), which is about a ten minute walk..", "Date": "February 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "vermont", "Title": "\u201cGreat location for visiting Madrid\u201d", "Author": "jandmVermont", "ReviewID": "UR119801755", "Content": "Rooms are small but adequate \u2013 a trade off for its reasonable price and superb location right near the Plaza Mayor. There is a nice sitting area on the floor we stayed with sofas and bookcase full of books people had left to share. We picked up a couple current travel guides! We walked to all of the major sights but one could also decide to take the hop on and off tour bus that has a stop nearby. If you think the hotel breakfast is too pricey there is a caf\u00e9 across the square with less expensive choices. Parking is a bit difficult. If you arrive by car, try to find a temporary parking space on the street well before you get to the hotel so you can check in. There isn\u2019t a spot right in front of the hotel where you can park for more than a couple minutes. You can reserve parking in their garage for 15 euros. The garage is right around the block and easy to get to but you will need to get the opener from them. Like many European garages, parking spots are tight. We loved the hotel until the second night when a couple groups of people came in around 4am and woke us up. I\u2019ve always disregarded comments on the thin walls of some hotels but now I understand. We heard everything \u2013 keys in the door, footsteps in the hall and rooms, toilets flushing, loud voices, kids crying\u2026 I would probably stay there again \u2013 but try to remember the earplugs.", "Date": "October 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cIf you travel with a computer, do not stay here\u201d", "Author": "happytravelsKDM", "ReviewID": "UR48697914", "Content": "My sister and I stayed here last week while visiting Madrid. We will not return to this hotel. While it may be in a central location, it is a very touristy location. Calle Atocha is a rough street, and the nearby Plaza Mayor is notorious for touristy price inflation and terrible food. Let's say as two 20-something American girls we did not feel totally safe coming and going to the hotel at night, and found nothing nearby that interested us. I travel with a computer and rely heavily on Internet access. I was very disappointed to learn upon check-in that although the hotel has free wi-fi, it only works in the core of the hotel, not at the end of the hallways, which is where our room was located. I immediately asked to be moved to a different room, even if a charge were involved, but the man at the desk was surprisingly rude in an almost mean way, denying my request. I wished at that moment more than anything that I had limitless funds and could pick up and switch hotels. So I had to go sit in the lobby on my floor to use the Internet. And the energy saving hallway light timers the other reviewer mentioned? Well this meant that I could not plug my computer in while sitting in the hallway, and had to stand up and wave my arms every 90 seconds while I worked to avoid sitting in the dark. Be aware that the desk staff does not speak good English, which is always a huge plus in my book. The rooms were clean, spacious (we had an extra bed), and wholly sufficient, but in all honesty it felt like a hostel. And at nearly $200/night, in my opinion it should not feel like a hostel. We stayed in a 4-star in Barcelona for less. Because of my experience at this hotel, I will never again stay at a 2-star hotel in Europe, even if it means not being able to afford to travel as much. This hotel is just that bad.
