The hotel is located in the historical centre of Istanbul, near the Gulhane Park and the tram station and just a breath away from all the famous sights of the city, such as St. Sofia Cathedral, Top Capi Palace and the Blue Mosque. Access to the karakoy Pier and the Galata Bridge is both easy either on foot or by taking the tram (one stop away). The area is nice to walk and safe at night. We were given a double room in the 2nd floor, the interior of which compined french design with elements of the oriental decoration, which we found smart, luxurious and cosy. Especially the ottoman style sofa bed. Our bed had a comfortable matress and was very very very ... clean. It also offered a satisfactory mini-bar and complimentary tea every day. Highlight of the hotel is the roof-garden with great view of the city. Breakfast was served every morning there and we found it a great way to start the day. Breakfast buffet was a 4 star hotel one. Overall, we can say that Yasmak Sultan Hotell has been a great choice for travellers, who wish to go sightseeing and live the atmosphere of the historical peninsula and also value for money.

It deserves to be closer to the Tripdvisor top hotels in Istanbul since they give you much more in quantity and quality than other hotels in the area with the same level of prices. These are my reasons: First of all, its location is spot on right next to the principal sights -by walking distance- but also with a tram stop just around the corner for those wanting to move by local transportation. Premises: Every time I go to Yasmak Sultan Hotel I find something added or renovated in the building. The lobby is a broad and pleasant area where clients can relax by taking a drink. Rooms are clean, spacious, comfy beds and all necessary furniture to have a comfortable stay. Toilets are well equipped with lots of toiletries beyond what it is normally offered for hotels of the same range. For example, if you forgot something like razors, dental paste, etc they provide them for you. If you forgot your tooth brush then they provide you a dental kit, if you got a sewing problem then they give you a sewing kit, and so on. Breakfast: They offer a good selection of hot and cold food including different kinds of bread, pastries, sweet and salt items, vegetables and fruits with some types of hot and cold drinks. You can take as much as you can for a good starting. As a plus, people can eat enjoying the magnificent view at the Bosphorus from one side and the Hagia Sophia in the other side. Also, for those wanting to have dinner in the Restaurant, it is fair to say that the Chef has been awarded and recognised by top cuisine magazines in Istanbul. The meals there are based in a special combination of Ottoman cuisine with an international touch, as a result the cuisine is excellent with a peculiar taste. Another tip is that the restaurant is open 24 hours and they also offer room service late in the nights, that is something not common in many hotels around which tend to close kitchens earlier. SPA: The Yasmak Sultan is a sister hotel of the beautiful Sultania Hotel, they both offer an excellent level of service for Turkish massages, sauna, Turkish baths, plus the free use of the swimming pool and gym. Again, only few hotels of the same category can provide these additional services on top. Service: This is the key word for Yasmak, service, service, service. From the very beginning one enters the premises and up to the last minute to leave it, everyone and I mean everyone makes every effort to make people to stay comfortable. For reasons of space, I cannot praise every one; however, I want to particularly thank Engin- the man who solves any problem or concern there- ask for him as he is always willing to help. Ahmet, Orhan, Mesut and Hilmi (the reception guys ready to assist in their best way), Sedat, the cute boy at the Lobby bar (ask for him to prepare a nice Turkish drink named 'Salep') and the lovely Guest Relations, Pinar who goes beyond expectations to welcome guests. At the Restaurant, I want to thank Murat, Mehmet and Zeynep for being always smiling and taking care of me very well. For all the reasons above, I find the Yasmak Hotel as a place where it is possible to find everything you want and more as compared to other hotels of the same level and category. It is a nice building with an excellent environment and service, and that is why I don't hesitate to recommend it to every one!!", "Date": "February 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cA lovely enjoyable stay, with an incredible staff\u201d", "Author": "Kavegirl", "ReviewID": "UR124458311", "Content": "We recently stayed at the Yasmak Sultan for a few nights with our 11 month old daughter.

If you are going to spend the entire day outside and only come back to the hotel to sleep then this is an ideal place. The hotel doesn't have connecting room. But they will bring amenities like kettle, iron and other much needed tools if requested.Before i left, i was informed that sometimes the hotel would have AC issues but the rooms we stayed in didn't have any. Its a pretty average hotel that could turn into something good.", "Date": "January 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cgreat location\u201d", "Author": "Rashida H", "ReviewID": "UR122709240", "Content": "Great location and very helpful staff.

The hotel is located right in the heart of old city which is where you really want to stay to experience the amazing cultural heritage of the city. So it was within walking distance to the Blue Mosque, Aya Sofia and many other landmarks. But Yasmak Sultan exceeded our expectations in so many other ways. First of all we felt SAFE and looked after by members of staff: so the concierge made phone calls for us when we needed because we don't speak Turkish (taxis, and drivers where exactly we wanted to go and the price we had to pay, tickets bookings,), the restaurant staff were very attentive and the maid was just excellent, she even made our room look very beautiful for my birthday.The concierge made note of when we left the hotel and when we came back because my mother called to check on us and since we were rarely in our room gave her detailed accounts of where we were which was great and made us feel secure. The most important thing we didn't feel like people were going to rip us off. Prices are fair all around at the hotel: so if you want a very nice Turkish bath experience just book it there don't hesitate, it's reasonably priced and everything is super clean and tidy. The people who do the massages are a couple and they both are amazing, friendly and professional. Also we often drunk coffee/beer upstairs in the hotel restaurant which has very nice views that you see every morning when having your breakfast. Food was very good and well catered for vegetarians, which was great for me. So, we would most definitely stay there again and can confidently recommend it!

Because of low season the price was very attractive. The service was at high level.

When we landed and took our luggage, the transfer man came almost at that time and we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to wait. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so pleasant of hotel service.

So we had enough time to assess the room without hurrying. We booked a standard room; it looked like at the photo. The breakfast at the hotel was very good too. There were cold starters, hot dishes. In spite of the end of warm season there were sliced fruits and vegetables, fruit salads too.

This caf\u00c3\u00a9 on the roof has open aired and non-open aired areas which are very convenient when the weather is changing, sometimes it may be cold and windy, but other time it can be warm. Among advantages I also would like to notice that there are sauna and covered swimming pool, fitness center in this hotel. They all are situated together; also you can ask fresh juice from different fruits or other drinks for some pay and relax on the chaise longue. The people working in this hotel are very friendly and nice. I want to note among disadvantages that our room was small, and fresh juice offered at the breakfast and visiting sauna wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t included in the room fee, though it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unusual for European four-star hotels.", "Date": "December 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGood staff\u201d", "Author": "MohmmedAlmalki", "ReviewID": "UR121224790", "Content": "The hotel is very nice location and excellent staff good idea about car service and parking I recommended for stay at this hotel", "Date": "November 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Western Australia", "Title": "\u201cA holiday rescued\u201d", "Author": "AussieRichard", "ReviewID": "UR120645156", "Content": "For the second year running, my wife and I stayed at this hotel.

However, on the return journey, we had ordered a shuttle to take us to the airport for 16.30 as we had to be at the airport 2 hours before our departure to Europe. To our dismay when we had given up all hope of seeing the shuttle and I stressed that they would have to call us a taxi and pay for the fare, one of the staff members (I forget his name) went out and got his luxurious mini-bus and drove us in all haste to the airport. We appreciated this but it shouldn't have happened. Although we were late to arrive after schedule time, we were able to check-in. It kind of spoilt the trip to be so stressed in the end.

Although from there it was always possible to enjoy the wonderful views to the sea (from one side) and the Blue Mosque (from the other side), now it is even better because of the beauty of the new restaurant and breakfast room, with its modern seats in a minimalist style, clear colours and big screen TV for those interested in it.

The room also had a minibar but you had to have a deep pockets to pay for any drinks out of it......be wary. However it did have room to store you own drinks if required. The only downside we could see was small rooms. When walking to breakfast a few of the inner corridor room doors were left open by the cleaners. Looking in we were surprised how small they were......and when we say small we mean \"not much room to swing a cat\" small. If space is what you are after go for deluxe every time. I would stay at this hotel again as all in all it did what it said on the tin.

The rooms are comfortable clean and have all the necessary facilities, but not as large as say a Marriot, but the location more than compensates as you do not spend that long in your room. The restaurant is at the top of the hotel and has wide panoramic views of the Golden Horn and the city beyond, and from the lovely rooftop terrace you see Haigha Sophia in all its glory when lit up at night. The evening restaurant food is excellent and again service friendly and attentive. Not many hotels where the restaurant manager can find time for nice chat over breakfast. Breakfast is a superb running buffet that sets you up for the rest of the day. Walk out of the hotel turn right up the hill and you are only 10 minutes away from Sophia, Blue Mosque, Cistern Basillica and Topkapi. Leave the hotel in the opposite direction and you are 10 minutes from the Bazaar, Golden Horn and main station. Surrounding the hotel are many local bars, cafes where you can while away the evenings whilst smoking apple tobacco througha water pipe.

Like picking from the airport is 35 euros, where in other agencies around the corner offer it with4-5 euros and the public transportation works also well and the cost is then under 2 euros...

Room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comfort is too important for me. But we read really good reviews at Yasmak Sultan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website. Our all negative reviews changed after breakfast. Breakfast was really good, especially fresh foods, many kinds of bread, rose jam and apple tea. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget their breakfast tastes, but I cannot say same thing about dinner because of their poor menu. And also, we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget Pinar. She smile everytime welcoming us, and she took care us too much. Thanks to Pinar, she helped us to change our room. Front desk, especially Mr. Engim, and Pinar made our stay memorable one. Our new room was excellent and comfortable. We loved \u00c4\u00b0stanbul, and you should see \u00c4\u00b0stanbul\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great view at Yasmak Sultan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Roof Restaurant.

We'd booked the Ya\u00c5\u0178mak Sultan because it was close to all the sights of Sultanahmet, it was a good price and our first choice was fully booked. It was the weekend of the end of Ramadan, so hotel room were in short supply. They were excellent in dealing with my very delayed flight, picking me up from the airport. While my room was small, it was a single - the last they had available. The decor is a little dated, but the rooms are clean and comfortable, with great water pressure (Mark Hopkins Hotel SF, please take note...) The free hotel wifi was a little spotty at times, but a quick phone call down to reception would get the router rebooted, fixing most ills (again, British and American hotels please take note!).

The hotel is very comfortable, the staff were very helpful. Great location, a few minutes walk from Ayasofia and the Blue Mosque and within walking distance of the Grand Bazaar (unfortunately closed during our visit) and the Galata Bridge. We had booked a double room but were allocated a twin, the housekeeper was summoned almost immediately to rearrange the beds into a double, albeit still with the single duvets. The room was comfortable but compact, not very much wardrobe space and not much walking space. Everything worked, only minor signs of wear. A nice touch was the free safe which could be keyed to your credit card. A hairdryer was supplied in the bathroom and an iron and ironing board was available on request. The lobby bar was quite comfortable but a minor irritation was having to seek out the barman a couple of times. We were supposed to have been picked up from the airport by the hotel but the driver never appeared, we resorted to a taxi for the return journey. Breakfast was taken in the roof restaurant, great views over Istanbul, reasonable selection of food, not much in the way of hot food and when it was busy things ran out quickly. Great bread if you just wanted something simple.
