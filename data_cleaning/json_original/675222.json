The hotel is located on the street Kurf\u00fcrstendamm, which is considered the head of the street for shopping in Berlin. In walking distance from the hotel metro Adenauerplatts.

It is less than a 2 minute walk to the u-bahn (subway) station adenauerplatz, where also a lot of busses have a stop. Along the Ku'damm there are a lot of shops, the most nearest to the hotel are quite upscale, but also more chains are there. The side streets are full of restaurants, and very close to the hotel there are some bakeries and a bar. The walk to restaurants is a bit farther then one might think, since the Ku'damm is very long. But almost in front of the hotel there is a bus stop, where you can take a bus along the Ku'damm. If you have a welcome card of city card, you can access the bussess for free. The hotel ads say it is a 3 star hotel, but I would not rate it more than 2,5 stars. It is located on the first and 4th and 5th floors of an typically older Berlin building, with the building built around a central courtyard. There is a small elevator. There is no real lobby, next to the reception desk there is one chair and a display of some tourist flyers, with a drink and snack machine. There is a breakfast area. On the first floor, the rooms are located either on the reception side, or on the other side of the central hallway. The rooms on the 5th floor can be accessed by going to the 4th floor by elevator, and then taking the stairs to the 5th floor. The rooms are nothing special, perhaps some a tad outdated in design, but they are clean, with good beds, a seat, tv and small but clean bathroom. Don't expect fanacy designed or hip decors, but for a good night's sleep during a city trip, the rooms will suffice. I stayed in a single room at the courtyard. The room was not large, but there was enough space for a suitcase and moving around a bit, next to a single bed, 2 smaller tables and chairs and a closet. There was no noise from outside, only sometimes you would hear the taps from the nextdoor bathroom. The rooms on the Ku'damm had a bit more outside noise, but it wasn't very disturbing, but this was in winter. The staff was okay, they were helpfull when they could. I have read reviews stating they could hardly speak english, but eventhough I mostly spoke german with them, their english seemed more than okay to me! There is wifi, but you have to ask coupons for that, which are free, but only valid for 1 hour after logging in. Mostly I got more than 1 at a time though, so no problem there. All in all, for a (short) city trip, the hotel is okay, as it is clean, good located and mostly a fair price-quality comparison. As you pay less than in better hotels, don't expect superior amenities. For a city trip I would again consider the hotel, if budget was not too large.", "Date": "December 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oslo, Norway", "Title": "\u201cGood location averaged hotel\u201d", "Author": "TheAnotherTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR121656318", "Content": "The location of the hotel is very good, very close to a metro station.
