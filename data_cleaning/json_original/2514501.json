The rooms were very clean to the point that they were almost spotless. The hotels breakfast is not something to be considered. The two closest subway stations are about 7 to 15 minutes by foot but threre is a bus stop almost outside of the hotel. I would recommend taking the bus so that you can see more of the area and not spend your time in the outdated and dirty london subway.", "Date": "December 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Budva, Montenegro", "Title": "\u201cHotel was OK\u201d", "Author": "Markocg", "ReviewID": "UR121195179", "Content": "We stayed here 5 days.

The staff are pleasant and if you have to go to Acton for any reason like me, for a knock down price on late rooms or the like, it's worth it. The breakfast is not cooked...which considering it's a restaurant is a little odd. However, there's ham and cheese and loads of toast and cereal...more than enough to keep you going for the day. The big bonus is free parking outside. I'd stay there again but not if my London visit needed to be more central.", "Date": "November 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Worksop, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "SianWichmann", "ReviewID": "UR116212107", "Content": "Excellent hotel for the money.

The building has been recently updated but the restaurant seems to be permanently closed despite the sign suggesting it is merely a temporary closure. I booked a \"luxury\" room, which was fine , but not luxurious, quite large with huge TV & decent bathroom. It was located on the 2nd floor at the end of a corridor where extra beds & bedding were stored, just outside the door. Frankly, the room was ok but the noise was not - there was a party outside in the garden of the pub opposite until around 1.00 am, very heavy traffic noise & the bin collection at 6.00 am (Thursdays) which sounded like an earthquake. To be fair, when I asked to change the room, the staff were very pleasant & offered me the only other available option, the room directly below, which I accepted as the confiuration was different. In fact it proved to better all round. Breakfast is basic, but for me that's fine. The bus stop for Hammersmith is just outside the door & it is a 10 minute walk to Acton Central station. For the price it is a reasonable choice, but do try to get one of the rooms away from the main road.", "Date": "April 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "england", "Title": "\u201cVery welcoming and clean\u201d", "Author": "mandygilhooly", "ReviewID": "UR100313379", "Content": "I was a single female traveller staying 5 weeks at this hotel .The staff were very friendly and helpful.My room was cleaned on a daily basis and nothing was too much trouble. .Being female and booking alone I felt safe and secure .I would stay here again if working in the area.", "Date": "March 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "France", "Title": "\u201cWill return !\u201d", "Author": "Marge028", "ReviewID": "UR99208392", "Content": "Before leaving I read lots of bad reviews so I was a little scared but it was very good! The room was clean, the beds & bathroom too. The mini fridge was working & CLEAN so we were able to store our food in it, same for the coffee/tea set. True the hotel is away from the centre but there is a bus stop right in front of the hotel & you can't hop off at the wrong stop for it is the last of the line. Taking bus 70 you're 10 minutes away from the underground AND if you take a 7-day travelcard, it works on both the bus & the underground!! Money saver I have to say. Even though there is a pub as well right accross the street I did not heard much noise in the streets at night. The neighbourhood is quiet & there is a supermarket behind the hotel (plus lots of little restaurants in the adjacent streets) so if you don't want to spend lots of money on food you can buy sandwitches & salads & store them in your fridge ;) The breakfast was enough for me (tea/coffe, apple/orange juice, bread, butter, cheese, ham, jams, fruits & croissants) & the staff was very friendly, always asking how we spent our day & ready to help us find our way in the bus/underground. The only things I'm complaining about: the restaurant was closed when we stayed there & one day when we came back we had no hot water & no heater because they had a workup done on the boiler. But all in all our stay went well.", "Date": "March 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201ctop star stay\u201d", "Author": "1946Clark", "ReviewID": "UR72527196", "Content": "Very good value.The room was first class clean and tidy as was shower room.

The connection is fast. - The area is appears to be safe The so-so: - Basic continental breakfast, better than no breakfast at all - but will not hit the spot. No drip coffee, hot water and instant coffee are available. The not-so-good: - It is a 15 minutes walk from the tube (Acton Town) and uphill \u2013 You will remember every minute if you carry a heavy suitcase. There are mini-cabs available from the tube for 5 GBP. - It is a 30 minutes subway ride to Heathrow airport \u2013 A little long - It is another 30-45 minutes to go to downtown (tip: take the Picadilly line rather than the District line - Picadilly has more trains, less stops and less disruptions) - It is quite noisy with the traffic. I requested another room in the quietest part of the hotel. I could still hear some noise but it was bearable. - Although the room is clean, the carpet is dirty. In the former room, I was greeted with a heavy smell of smoke. Previous guests did not seem to be considerate in leaving the place in good standing. - There is very little partition between the rooms. One night, I could hear my neighbors talking past Midnight and one Sunday at 7 am, I was awaken by someone knocking at a neighbor\u2019s door. When I went out to look, it happened that the knocking came from the far end of the floor! - The neighborhood has very little to offer about London.

No smoking in the hotel, I had to get out and smoke in the street.
