We caught the train from Union Station to the corner of H&H, so saved some major dollars on taxi's to arrive into Hollywood.

The reason being that would probably stay closer to the beautiful Santa Monica, as getting around is not difficult so less emphasis on the location of attractions, but more for the beauty and elegance of Santa Monica. We arrived here on our first leg of a tour of fantastic California, and the location was perfect especially when travelling with a toddler, located literally on Hollywood Blvd with Kodak Theatre, good restaurants, walk of fame etc so location wise it is excellent, but do remember we hired a car so were driving from here to all over LA - and there was plenty of driving to be done to get to other areas of LA (4 nights). Oh and no real issues with parking, like some have moaned, we usually found parking outside the hotel or just around the corner, the world is becoming lazy! The hotel itself is standard - reminds me of a typical 3 star, the rooms for comfortable, clean and the bathroom did its job. The breakfast was basically, but the food was fresh, however we usually went out for a brunch as there is so much choice. The comments about the staff are inaccurate and probably unfair, they are nice people and do the job, always helpful perhaps could smile a little more.

Our room had a massive mural on the wall of the four characters from the Wizard of Oz, which added a certain fun to the place. From the glimpses we got of other rooms when they were being serviced, they all had the red murals depicting various films! Our room had two double beds in, a small area to eat, a wardrobe/dressing area (including a mirror with lights round it) and a bathroom. The one thing that let it down was that the carpet was pretty dirty - it appeared clean, but when we spilt some water and went to clean it up, the dirt that came up shocked us - yuck! Breakfast was simple, but sufficient for the three mornings we were there; toast, jam, muffins yoghurt, juice, tea, coffee etc. It was starting to get a bit boring by morning 3 though! The hotel was in an art deco style and had framed pictures and posters of hollywood legends in the corridors, Reception were helpful and sorted our tickets for Universal, as well as pointing us in the right direction for dinner when we arrived.

The staff were unfalteringly friendly and helpful - they offered me tips on where to eat where I could do my laundry, what streets in Hollywood weren't safe to wander alone, warned me against drinking the tap water, made change for me on several occasions, explained the best way to get to Santa Monica... they were wonderful! The room was lovely and spacious - the photos on the hotel's website are accurate. It has a dining nook (fridge, microwave, little table and 2 chairs) and a decent-sized bathroom with classic black and white floor tiles. Even though Hollywood Boulevard is literally around the corner, I didn't have any trouble with noise. I noticed there were some recent reviews complaining about the cable TV not working - I can't say I had any problems with it; I must've flicked through all 500+ channels after getting in each night and they all worked just fine. The free continental breakfast is perfectly adequate for getting you up and going in the morning - it consists of toast (with basic spreads - margarine, jam, jelly, marmalade), croissants, muffins (chocolate, orange poppyseed, raisin, bran), instant oatmeal, yoghurt, coffee, tea and juice. The coffee and tea are available 24/7 and there is fresh milk (which was a big plus for me - not such a fan of non-dairy creamer). There is free wireless internet which worked perfectly for me in my time there - the connection was very fast and it really helped me to stay in touch with loved ones at home. They also provide a cable in the TV cabinet drawer if you prefer a wired connection. Showers were hot with good water pressure. Everything was immaculately clean (ran my finger along the windowsill - not a skerrick of dust) and the room was made up promptly around 10ish each morning. I'm sure most reviews have already mentioned this, but I'll say it again - if you're keen to see the Hollywood sights, this hotel's location could not be better. It's around the corner from the Kodak Theatre/Hollywood and Highland Center, the middle of the Hollywood Walk of Fame and Madame Tussauds, and an easy walk (not more than 10-15 minutes at a leisurely pace) to the Hollywood Museum, Red Line Tours, Grauman's Chinese and Egyptian Theatres, and the Hollywood/Highland Metro station (on the red line). In my time there I also visited Universal Studios LA by riding the Metro one stop to Universal City (do this! it'll cost you $1.50 each way instead of $9 for a shuttle or more for a cab), and Warner Bros Studios, which was a $17 cab ride from the Renaissance Hotel cab rank (2 minutes from Hollywood Celebrity Hotel. There are heaps of dining options close to the hotel which was a big help to me as well (although I think they do have rooms that include a kitchenette, mine wasn't one of these). The hotel can also organise shuttles to LAX at a reasonable flat rate (do NOT take a cab!) All this at a price tag of under $125 per night for 2 queen beds? Can't complain at all!

The room I stayed in had a fridge, microwave and table, all I want is a fridge to keep my water cool. Maid service is daily and you choose if you want your towels changed by leaving them on the floor or hanging them up if you are going to use them again. They are equipped with a hairdryer, iron and ironing board. The tv has plenty of channels to watch, there is also an alarm clock radio and telephone. The telephone in my room wasn't working properly, I could hear the caller they couldn't hear me. I had about 6 calls from reception who couldn't seem to comprehend that the phone wasn't working properly and even had to check when I went to tell them. They asked me to return to the room to wait for someone to come up and check, I did this and was waiting 15minutes and no one came so I went to get my breakfast. Halfway through my breakfast the person came to check my phone and low and behold told me it wasn't working!!!! They changed it with a phone from another room. The breakfast is continental and complimentary and consists of bread for toasting, jam and marmalade, assorted cakes and pastries, fresh fruit, cereals, fruit juice, tea, coffee and water. They advertise breakfast is available until 10am and bang on 10am all the breakfast items are taken away. Just the tea and coffee are left which are available 24/7. Another plus point to this hotel is the free parking!!!!! A rare occurance in LA. The staff are helpful and knowledgable. The hotel is located in a quiet area, so noise when you are trying to sleep is not a problem. Although I did find the air con a bit noisy but I generally do anyway.

The hotel lobby is clean and the staff were friendly, even though it took an hour to get checked in because they claimed we had to pay for the room after I had pre-paid... They spent a lot of time messing around making phone calls to confirm all was in order... To be fair, they were not rude and there was obviously just a misunderstanding... After a long flight from Ireland, it was the last thing we needed, but it was comfortable in the air conditioned lobby and they apologised for keeping us before allocating the rooms... There is no elevator, so be prepared to haul you cases up a flight of stairs... The rooms were large and although dated, they were clean enough and comfortable enough for our short stay... Nothing special, but really OK. It was close to all the action, and a short walk down the street meant you were in the middle of a lot of shopping and restaurants... LA is huge, and you could easily end up a long walk from anything worth seeing... The car park was small and it was a tight squeeze to park the rental car up for the night and to get it out in the morning to do all the sight seeing... The breakfast was ok, with toast, juice, coffee, tea etc... But nothing special... There is no bar at this hotel. THINGS TO DO... Take a walk down the street where there is plenty do do, day or night... Drive up the the HOLLYWOOD SIGN... But be prepared to be unimpressed... You cant get as close as you would hope, but a short drive up all the interesting winding roads, past all the nice houses and you can get some good photo's and beautiful views of the city... Bring a Sat Nav... BRING. A. SAT. NAV. If you like Jim Morrison and The Doors, take a drive down Hollywood Boulevard and visit the Whisky a Go Go... There is also a motel (celta cienega) where there is a Jim Morrison room that he stayed in... There was no one in the room when we went, so we gave the guy a 5 dollar tip to let us look inside... It was very cool, and you can sign your name/messgae on the walls that are covered with messages from fellow fans... BEVERLY HILLS... Once again, be prepared to be unimpressed, but its still interesting... We bought a \"Star Map\" from one of the many people selling them on the street around that area... You can use your Sat Nav to go see the houses belonging all the biggest stars... The problem is, the are all super stars houses are pretty well hidden, but at least you can drive around all the mansions, and see how the other half live... VENICE BEACH... Its a 20 minute drive away, but it was excellent... Its just a really cool place... We wished we were staying around Venice Beach for a day or two... Lots to see, lots to do, street performers, shops, stalls, restaurants and plenty of characters... Really stood out for us... Don't miss it... T-Bag from the TV show Prison Break sat beside us and had his lunch... I could sit there all day having a few beers and watching the world go by. Al in all, the Hotel was a decent base, and we really only used it to sleep... We did have a few drinks in the rooms before we went out and it was quiet at night... We stayed in much nicer hotels during our trip, but it was fine, and if you want to be close to the action, then this is a perfect base.

The Hollywood Celebrity fit the bill. We had a king suite so that the kids (teens) could have their own \"room\" with the futon bed and a rollaway and still plenty of room in the living area to not feel cramped at all. FINALLY a hotel that understands the importance of mirrors outside of the bathroom. THANK YOU!!!! With 2 teen girls and mom all needing to do hair/makeup having 3 full mirrors was a godsend. Only thing lacking in this area were more electrical outlets. We solved that by a quick trip into a Rite Aid and buying a 6' $4 extension cord that is now going to be a permenant item to pack on all trips. Having the additional vanity area and the other two large mirrors made only having 1 bathroom for 4 people very easy. Our room was clean and large and the location can not be beat. Easy walking distance to Graumann's, Hollywood & Highland Shopping Center, Kodak Theatre and every other nearby attraction in that area of Hollywood without having to deal w/ driving in the traffic and finding a parking spot. The price could not be beat either. As for the breakfast.......... having the coffee downstairs was great. We stopped at Trader Joe's that is only a few blocks away and stocked up on some drinks for the fridge, milk, orange juice and ceral and we were set. I'd recommend the Hollywood Celebrity Hotel to friends and family no problem. We are used to very nice 4 and 5 star accomodations and having this nice, clean comfortable hotel in such a great location w/ a large room for a great price makes it very appealing. We all said they could easily do some major updating, become a very exclusive boutique hotel and raise the rates dramatically. They have the location, room sizes and layout to do it.

The wi-fi is free but it does not have a pool. There were two problems encountered this visit. Firstly, a huge group of young people who were staying at the hotel had no consideration for the other guests when they returned in the wee small hours of the morning, laughing and talking very loudly in the common areas. This is difficult for management to control, however extremely annoying. Secondly, I was bitten by bed bugs - I actually felt the bites (2) when I initially got into bed and the bite marks were huge. I know that I definitely did not have any bites on me when I arrived because I showered immediately, then went out for a walk around the sights before hitting the sack for an early night.

We were going to be spending an evening at the Magic Castle and wanted a location close enough that we could walk. The hotel is a converted apartment building--Quite cute with HUGE rooms--probably originally studio apartments. The location is great, the hotel is situated directly behind the Kodak theatre and approximately a half a block from the Magic Castle. My husband and I felt comfortable walking in the area both late at night after our dinner at the Castle and early in the morning (6am) on our hunt for the nearby Starbucks Coffee. The rooms had both a refrigerator and microwave. The hotel has Wi-fi but the signal was poor. Evidently a continental breakfast was offered but didn't start until 8am--far too late for us. Our only major issue with the hotel is the parking. Granted, parking in this area is at a premium, and I was VERY happy that they had a parking lot. In fact, it was a major factor in choosing the hotel, but be advised that the lot is small and that there is only one driveway in and out which means you cannot drive through and will have to back out onto a busy street to leave. The biggest concern is that they allow guests (and employees) to park in between the rows of cars which means you will most likely be blocked in when you need to leave. When we returned to the hotel after dinner at the castle we noted that two cars were blocking ours and since we planned to leave at 6:30am we mentioned the problem to the front desk. We were assured that there was another lot where they park their overflow and they had the keys to those cars and were planning to move them to the other lot in just a few minutes. We were assured that there wouldn't be a problem when we went to leave in the morning. Unfortunately, this wasn't true. When we went down to the lot at 6am to put our bags into our car there were now THREE cars (one of which belonged to the clerk at the front desk). The other two guests had been asked to leave their keys with the front desk so that their cars could be moved, but the gentleman at the front desk couldn't move them because he was the only one working. He assured us that someone would be coming in at 7am, and we delayed our departure until then, only to have that person not show up on time. My husband watched the front desk as the front desk clerk moved the three cars so that I could pull our car out. It took over 20 minutes before I was able to leave the lot putting us an hour behind when we had originally planned to leave. If you choose this hotel just know that you may be in a valet parking situation--either having to leave your keys with the front desk and/or waiting to be able to get your car. This hotel is a good value, with a great location, but if parking issues are important to you it's good to be aware of the potential for problems.", "Date": "January 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore", "Title": "\u201cFantastic location\u201d", "Author": "travelvern", "ReviewID": "UR89816321", "Content": "A nice cozy little place where I spent 3 nights in a nice little room with free wi-fi, free breakfast and free flow of coffee and tea for the entire day.

All odd numbers will be on the side of the apartment building but I am not sure if other rooms on this side found it noisy or not. I would definitely stay here again..

With only one night to spend in Los Angeles we wanted somewhere close to the Hollywood tourist sights. This hotel matched our requirements perfectly, located in a quiet residential street directly behind the Hollywood & Highland Mall, and five minutes walk from Hollywood Boulevard, Graumann, Kodak & El Capitan theatres, Walk of Fame, shops & restaurants. The hotel offers free parking, which is at a premium in the heart of the city; however the parking lot is very small, situated behind the hotel. It did not feel particularly secure, and we were concerned about being able to exit the lot the next morning for out flight. Luckily, we parked by the entrance, and managed to get out using a combination of Mr Fletche\u2019s 100-point turn and me running from one end of the car to another (\u201cLeft a bit\u2026STOP\u2026Right a bit\u2026STOP\u2026. Etc etc). The frontage of the hotel is bright and welcoming, with its canopy and neatly maintained patio area, and the lobby and corridors are bright, clean and modern decorated with movie posters and memorabilia. I was excited to see whether the rooms would carry on this trend \u2013 I was highly disappointed. Our room was basic, drab and well in need of a good update. After a succession of fabulously comfortable beds on our trip, we were presented with three paper-thin pillows on our queen bed, and what looked like a very old, threadbare comforter. When we entered, the A/C was turned off, and the room was swelteringly hot; the windows were open and what appeared to be a party with very loud music was being held on a balcony in the apartment block opposite our room. Luckily the A/C worked a treat and the windows were well sound-proofed. On the positive side, there was a fridge, and ample storage/vanity space. Please note \u2013 there is no elevator in this hotel meaning we had to lug two very large suitcases with along with all the junk we had collected over two weeks from the car park behind the hotel, up the steps to the lobby, up the steps in the lobby and then up a flight of stairs to our second-floor room. A complimentary continental breakfast is served each morning in the lobby with a good choice of items available, and coffee & hot water are available freely all day. The location and the free parking make this an ideal choice for being in the hub of Hollywood; however if I stayed in LA again, I would probably choose another hotel unless the rooms get a refurb.", "Date": "October 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cSo close to the action\u201d", "Author": "Simplythebest51", "ReviewID": "UR82228579", "Content": "Absolutely excellent location.

The window looked directly into someone else's apartment but having it open was better than the a/c. The comforter was covered in hair, not my hair, and something else which I'll leave to your imagination. If this was a hard copy letter I could have written it on the towels, they were thin as paper.

So much so that I mailed them in advance to query the problem. I got a great email back from the manager explaining that they had been brought into the hotel and they were heat treating all the rooms so we took the chance and stayed there anyway. Well, I have to say that we were in no way disappointed. I was travelling alone when I arrived so got a Flyaway bus from LAX to Union Station and then jumped in a cab. Cost was approx $28 for the taxi. I'm glad I did this as initially the hotel may not have been too easy to find. I was a bit nervous pulling up outside as it looked a touch 'uncared for' but the inside of the hotel was fabulous! There is an art deco theme throughout and the place was spotless. I was checked in quickly and efficiently to a room that was well sized with a kitchen area with a full sized fridge, huge bed, tv, bathroom etc. Yes the room was a bit dated but it was very, very clean and that was the most important thing. The hotel is a 1 minute walk from the side entrance of Hollywood and Highland Shopping Centre and 2 minutes from the Walk of Fame. It really has got an amazing location considering the room price. It is also 2 mins from the Hollywood and Highland Metro stop. The staff were all very friendly and looked after our every need (hi Alvin!!!!) and yes, breakfast isn't a 5 course hot affair, but there is 24 hour tea/coffee facilities, and from 8 in the morning, 3 huge trays filled with different flavoured muffins, croissants and all types of bagels. Plus Philadelphia Cheese and 5 types of juices and hot chocolate. There are toasters there all the time as well as a microwave. There is also free internet access in the lobby which is 24 hours. Not sure about wifi as we had no laptops. They also have a gym and steam rooms! We stayed for 6 nights and paid approx \u20ac80 per night for the two of us including breakfast. I nearly don't even want to tell you about this hotel to keep it a secret!! Yes the rooms are a little noisy. Well, we were in room 110 which was near to the lobby and outside there is a marble floor so with the best of intentions there will be noise. But we both used earplugs and got full nights sleep every night. There is HBO which is important to some too....again, all included in the price. If I had to think of a drawback, it would be that we asked the hotel to call us a cab one morning and the cab driver charged us $18.....on the way back someone else called us a metered cab and the fare was only $11 on the meter for what was a longer drive through traffic!!! Not the hotels fault but something to be aware of if you need the hotel to call you a cab for any reason. Before I finish I want to address the 'bedbug' issue! It seems to me as a 'Joe Soap' traveller that the hotel got unlucky with someone bringing these in. If you Google them you will see that they are scarily easy to transport from person to upholstery. I would be a typical person who bugs and mosquito's smell at 200 miles and go out of their way to bite and I can say hand on heart that I walked away from the hotel after a week with not one single bite! They seem to be trying to deal with it as efficiently as a hotel can, and I'm pretty sure that the room next to us was actually being treated for 12 hours one of the days we were there.

The room itself was comfortable enough and included a small kitchenette which was handy. The bathroom is a little dated, but was still OK. Parking is very tight, but we didn't have any problems, and I believe they have another parking lot elsewhere if the main lot (holds about 12 cars) is full. Breakfast is available in the lobby and consists of juice/tea/coffee and some dry croissants & muffins. It is barely edible, but I guess it is better than nothing. Some fresh fruit would be a huge improvement. There is a PC in the lobby for internet access too.

We certainly appreciated being explained about the parking situation in great detail. The free parking lot is adjacent to the hotel. Like the previous viewer indicated, \"it is a real mess\" The lot is a sardine can, but yet, somehow, someway, at least 20 cars are squeezed in. On the morning of our departure, at checkout, the front desk told us that the hotel staff would move any car(s) blocking the driveway. The room was very very large and clean but very very old. Our room on the ground level faced the back alley just a few steps away from the parking lot. The bed was comfortable and closet space was plentiful. The bathroom was clean BUT dorm like in decor. My wife and I opted to skip the shower facilities the next morning; not aesthetically pleasing to say the least. The location was superb. We were able to walk to the wedding event, approximately 0.3 miles from the hotel. The hotel is a stones throw away from the posh Renaissance Hotel where room rates are much much higher. The Hollywood Celebrity Hotel spells convenience in every sense of the word for most Hollywood endeavors/outings. The complimentary continental style breakfast was average.

The room looked out to the parking lot, which was always entertaining. The tiny parking lot is on a very busy street, and it is impossible to turn around, so you must back out into the busy street. Also, there is not enough room for all the cars, so if the lot is full, the front desk staff will park your car in this parking lot and block in all the other cars. In the morning, we would watch the \"musical cars\" as the staff had to move cars out in order to let earlier parked cars out. If you were in a hurry in the morning, this could be a problem.

Now I'm re-writing my review. Back in April I went on a roadtrip to Hollywood with my girlfriends to celebrate my birthday. I chose the Hollywood Celebrity Hotel b/c of the reviews here and it's great location to everything we wanted to do. Never did I delude myself into thinking that I expected a luxurious hotel stay here. All I was looking for was a simple clean room to take a shower and rest my head down at the end of the day; that was it. Sadly The Hollywood Celebrity hotel could not even meet these low standards. The one positive things about this hotel is it's location. It's located in a prime area convenient to all sorts of Hollywood attractions so I won't take that away from them. From the moment we checked in after our long day at Magic Mountain, we kept discovering bad things about our room that eventually led us to check out after our first night there. First when walking into the room, there was a very stale, musky odor... as if it'd been a while since the room had been occupied. Okay no big deal, my friends and I opened the windows to air out the room. The room was suppose to come with free high speed internet (via a ethernet cord you plug into your laptop) but our internet was not working. The front desk assistant couldn't figure out what was wrong and it couldn't be solved until the following morning. We'd have to use the wireless provided in the front entrance. As my friends and I were unpacking our things my friend noticed a disgusting puddle of something sticky on the vanity counter and on the built in blow dryer. Honestly I don't know what exactly it was but it was as if someone poured a thick layer of corn syrup on the vanity counter and let it sit there for a month. Just plain nasty. The maid service must have been asleep on the job the last time they cleaned this room. The final straw was when we needed to take showers and get ready to meet some local friends up for the night. We had a really long day of driving from San Francisco before the crack of dawn to going straight to Magic Mountain from there for some roller coaster fun. The sad part was that for some reason at 7pm on a Wednesday night there was NO HOT WATER LEFT. Yep, we all had to take miserable cold showers and it was not fun. After this we had no desire to bother asking for a new room. Just the few short hours we'd been there had left a bad taste in our mouth and there was no way the hotel could redeem itself. That night we ended up booking a room at the Hollywood Renaissance Hotel right down the road (which was a wonderful hotel and worth the extra money to stay at... read my review about it). The following morning when I checked out, I mentioned our bad experience to the front desk assistant, she was apologetic about our stay and asked me to leave my number so that the manager could contact me. They mentioned that the manager would be in that afternoon and that she'd get back to me as soon as possible. The manager didn't bother contacted me until a week after I checked out. That to me is simply unprofessional and sent a message to me that customer satisfaction wasn't on their list of priorities. Knowing that a guest had such a lousy stay, you'd think the manager would want to talk to me about my experience. Instead, the manager was rather rude and cold to me. She just flat out asked what I wanted after telling her my story, which confused me. Basically she just wanted to know what kind of refund I was looking for. She said she'd credit me $20 for our bad experience. Gee, thanks! The funny part is that I never saw that $20 credit go back to my bank account. I didn't bother trying to contact them to follow-up on this credit... why waste the time given the kind of attitude given to me by this hotel. I'm not sure how this hotel has so many positive reviews. I notice that there are a lot of people who've made only 1 contribution to TripAdvisor so who knows what kind of friends they're getting to write glowing reviews of them.

We paid $139 per night for the room. I will break this review in to the different areas of the hotel. Location: The location of this hotel is second to none. It is on a small cul-de-sac, literally two minutes walk from Hollywood Boulevard, so within two minutes you can be at the Kodak Theatre, Walk of Fame, Mann\u2019s Chinese Theatre, Hollywood and Highland shopping centre, the Metro stop and the start of the sight-seeing tour route. I can\u2019t imagine a better location for the price if Hollywood is where you want to stay. Checking in: Our first impression of the hotel was good. There is 15min limit on parking in front of the hotel, so there was ample space to pull up the car and unload our luggage. The lobby is nice, very bright, clean and airy. The man who checked us in was very pleasant and check in took less than 5 minutes, we were given a pass to place in the front of the car that entitled us to free parking in the hotel car park (more about this later). The room: We were in room 207, which was right beside the stairs, the hotel was quiet though and we were never disturbed by people coming and going. The room itself was huge, with a king size bed, which was extremely comfortable. The room is a little dated and lacks a bit of style, but it was clean and functional. The curtains had blackout lining, so no morning sun peaking through. The room had an air-conditioning unit, which was noisy, but kept the room at a lovely cool temperature. There was a small eating area with a table, chairs and fridge. I believe some rooms are equipped with a microwave and other kitchen equipment, but we did not need any more than the fridge, as we were only there 3 nights. There was a great wardrobe/dressing area with a huge, well-lit mirror, table, chair, iron, ironing board and hairdryer. Having this separate area was great as the bathroom was on the small side and it meant I could do my hair and makeup without crowding the hubby! The bathroom let the room down a little, it was very spartan and the fixtures and fittings were a little grotty and scratched. We were only left with two bath towels and then two hand towels that were too small to wrap around my hair (and I have quite short hair). It wouldn\u2019t be a big deal for them to leave more towels and save people having to ring down looking for them. The main problem we had with the room was the shower. No matter what we did, we could not get the water to a comfortable temperature, the minute you got it right, it would start running cold and then boiling hot. In all the showers we had, neither of us had one were we weren\u2019t scalded or frozen! Over all the room was fine, but could do with a little updating, very little expenditure could make the room beautiful. Breakfast: The room rate includes breakfast that consists of bagels, cream cheese, muffins, croissants, juice, tea and coffee. It is laid out in the lobby and you simply bring what you want to your room. It was very tasty and fresh and although simple, we found it got us up and running for the day and meant we could start sightseeing first thing. Parking: The hotel has free parking in a small parking lot just around the corner from the hotel itself. There isn\u2019t usually a problem getting a space during the day, but beware if you are taking your car out at night. We returned at about 11pm and the car park was full, as was the area in front of the hotel. We had to park in the Hollywood and Highland car park around the corner. The hotel did reimburse us for the price of the parking, but it was a bit of a nuisance. Still, free parking when they could very easily charge for it is a major bonus and they had no qualms about reimbursing us the price of the parking. Overall, this is a great hotel for the money. The staff are friendly and accommodating, the rooms are big and clean and the free parking and breakfast is a great perk. My only slight gripe is that the rooms and bathroom are dated and could do with a revamp, but then they would probably bump up the price to match!

There is a building next door that was noisy one night and could be a bit noisy over a weekend I would think, but it didn't bother us at all and certainly didn't spoil our stay. You walk out of the front door and through the building at the end of the street right onto Hollywood Boulevard. It was hustle and bustle there all the time and we were in the right spot to book tours etc. Will Smith had his premiere of his latest movie and we had a ring side view.

On one occasion we returned after midnight and found it full. We parked outside the main entrance to the hotel in a red zone. The chap behind reception (who I think was the manager) offered to pay for us to park in the multi-story or leave the car where it was and if we got a ticket, he'd pay for it! The room was spacious and included the biggest bed I have ever slept in. I found out from a friend who lives in LA that it was called a California King. It was huge and extremely comfortable. It included en suite bathroom with shower, dressing table with big bulbs all around it like something you would find in a filmstar's dressing room. The overall hotel cleanliness was excellent.

Check in advance what type of room you're getting, especially if you plan on 'cheaping it out' some nights by 'cooking' (which is what we intended, but we still managed by using the microwave downstairs.) -the couch we had was actually a sofa-bed which was cool (even though this didn't matter to us, as we were a couple, but definitely an advantage for families) -the bed was quite comfortable, although the pillows were rather small. We got 3 small pillows for 2 people, and thought it was a bit strange, but nonetheless, not too much of a problem. -our room landline didn't seem to work, in that calling the reception was okay, but dialing a local number didn't work (tried many times and either 'the number had been disconnected' or 'try again', even though the number would work 2 seconds later on a different phone) On the whole- hotel was great for what we paid.

Every hotel I have stayed in LA has been better than this place (definitely more than 7 others). It is like I stayed at a different hotel from these other reviewers. My wife was shocked when I told her this hotel was ranked this high. Two stars is generous for this hotel. I use TripAdvisor all of the time for my travel and have used it for hotel recommendations all over the world. This is the first time I have found the ratings to be so far from the reality I experienced. We paid $149/night and stayed in room 111 on the left side of the hallway as you enter the hotel. The rooms on this side face the pool area of an apartment complex next door. The rooms on the right side face a walkway to the remote parking area, then the wall of another building (this may be the preferred side). The first night (Tuesday), twentysomethings were partying outside our window at the apartment complex pool area until 5:00am and I could not get to sleep (should have used earplugs like my wife). I figured it was a \"special occasion\" celebration, but it started again the next morning around 1:30am. I called the front desk this time and it stopped around 2:30am. The place is very noisy. Marble floors down the long center hallway look great, but don't sound too great when baggage is rolling and high heels are walking on it. Although it \"appears\" clean, it doesn't \"feel\" clean. Dark carpeting and dark bedding can hide things. The room was in need of major renovation, including a new coat of paint. I have never had a room with no drinking glasses, so I had to take the sleeping pills required to get some sleep due to the ongoing noise outside with a handful of bathroom tap water. The towels were thin, gray and dingy, something we would use to dry off our car. The mirror in the dressing area was so low I had to bend over to use it (I'm only 5'11\"). The vanity was permanently stained and desperately needed painting. We felt uncomfortable setting our things on it. The \"celebrity\" wall hangings were spackled and looked horrible. We needed some bottled water and tried the vending machine in the hall. Tried twice for water and got 2 Cokes each time instead. Not the best thing to drink with sleeping pills. The parking area is as bad as previous reviewers have described. You will be required to leave your keys with the front desk so they can squeeze your car into a very small lot, blocking other cars. Do not take your personal car here or a very large rental. Our daughter just moved to the area, so we were trying a new hotel in this area. We have stayed in several hotels in the downtown area, much nicer and less expensive. Overall, the front desk people were very pleasant, however we were not asked anything about our stay when we checked out. We will absolutely never stay here again!

But where should I stay? Should I stay at the Celebrity Hotel or the Orchid Suites? Both have good reviews, were just meters apart and were both in my price range. A difficult choice. My solution? Divide my stay between the two hotels. Since my actual stay in L.A. would be divided into two by a short trip to San Diego and Anaheim in between, I decided to spend the first couple of nights at the Orchid Suites and the second bunch at the Celebrity. So having stayed at the Orchid Suites earlier, I was a bit disappointed at the Celebrity upon arrival. And the culprit is the parking area. Aside from it being full with cars (a number double parked), the gate is constantly open. And since my family with small kids arrived close to midnight, this did not offer much in terms of security. I also had to park the car in such a way that a small part of it's tail is exposed out the sidewalk. In effect, I had to repeatedly look out the sidewalk to see if there was anyone around as I opened the trunk. After the parking lot experience, I entered our hotel room not helping to notice that it was less appointed than that of the Orchid's. The kitchen in particular paled as it didn't have the same number of amenities. An in-room safe was sorely missed, too. While wi-fi signal in the room was poor, a wire for broadband access was present in the room. Neat. Aesthetically though, the room at the Celebrity looked better and newer. The same could be said of the hotel as a whole in comparison to the Orchid, which still looked like an apartment which was just converted into a hotel. The front desk personnel were helpful when I needed some info during our stay. Not as cheerful in my opinion, but still to the task. The biggest difference that the other hotel didn't have was the breakfast that came with the Celebrity's room rate. Though some may complain that it didn't offer much, to me the bagels, muffins and croissants together with juice and coffee were enough to start my day. I was also pleasantly surprised to find that the amount I payed for our stay here was actually cheaper than that of the Orchid's by $10/night. Surprised because the quotes here in T.A. are cheaper for the Orchid Suites. Lastly, I might be mistaken but I didn't see any elevators. So if your room is in the upper floors and have heavy luggages with you... So which to me was a better hotel? Let me sum it up this way: if you have a car, the Orchid Suites might be a better option. But if you don't have one, then let the free breakfast and cheaper rates sway you to the Celebrity instead. To expound on the parking situation, firstly, the number of parking slots in the Celebrity is not enough for all their guests. One night, I heard a European man giving his car keys to the person manning the front desk insisting that he park his car. I can tell that he was exasperated from finding a parking slot himself. The front-desk person did not take it reasoning that though parking was available, it is limited. Second, parking at the Celebrity is actually to the side of the hotel accessed via Franklin Ave. So if you are coming from the direction of Highland (as I always do) in heavy traffic, turning left to the garage entrance is impossible, not to mention illegal in the first place. Turn to Google Earth for a better picture. In comparison, the entrance to the Orchid's garage is along Orchid Ave., turning left to which from Franklin is aided by a traffic light. No problem. A solution to the Celebrity's parking woes would be to return late at night when traffic at Franklin is light (drivers at your back will honk at you for stopping to turn left into the garage). But since the garage gates are always open, and chances are yours will be the last car in, one can't help but feel unsafe with nobody around late at night in Hollywood. Third, if you park farthest from the gate the night before and leave the earliest the next morning, be prepared to wait a while since backing up all the cars blocking your way will take some time. But despite all this, I would have honestly considered coming back to this hotel. Afterall it is hard to disregard the free breakfast and the slightly cheaper rates. The parking- you get used to it. I however have a beef with the front desk person who promised to e-mail me the breakdown of my expenses since their printer was malfunctioning when I checked out. I've e-mailed them a reminder as I got back and still no answer to my request. I just have this impression that they are nice when they need your business but don't care when your business with them is done. So it's Orchid Suites for me by a whisker.

Neighborhood The hotel is on the 'back side' of the block that houses the Hollywood&Highland Center and the Kodak Theater (where the Oscars are held). In the same street (more like an alley) there are two other cheap hotels, \"Hollywood Orchid Suites\" and \"Liberty Hotel\". This is the nice part of Hollywood, with a lot of tourists and a lot of people even late at night, so you won't feel unsafe here. The expensive Renaissance Hollywood Hotel is around the corner (literally 150 yards). There are places in Hollywood where we'd feel unsafe at night, but this is quite ok. The hotel is close to Franklin Avenue which has some traffic, but the noise didn't bother us at all. Parking may be tricky in the hotel's small lot. We found a spot every time, but in the peak season, you may have to look for a spot further away. Room The room was large, with a big bed, a sofa and a table. The furniture isn't exactly new, but the bed was comfortable and the sheets were clean. The decor is a bit dated, but since we didn't go to Hollywood to stay in our room, that didn't bother us. There was a fridge and a microwave in the room as well. Bathroom The bathroom was nice, with black and white tiles, a tub, a toilet and a sink. Clean and practical. The shower cabinet was a bit hard to close, otherwise ok. Service The breakfast included consists of juice, bagels and muffins. Not a full buffet, but a quick bite before you start your day. It was nice to sit out on the patio and sip juice in the shadow of the Kodak Theater. There is a computer in the lobby where you can surf the interenet for free. Summary This is a clean hotel with a nice decor. It's comfortable, clean and reasonably priced for LA.

If thats your goal, then its a deal. For me, though, the negatives, as expressed by other reviewers, outweigh the positives. I too had a left-side room on a Friday night, and the partying at the apartment house next door was in full swing. The parking is a challenge as the lot is tiny and when it fills up, you trudge down to the Chevron station a block away, leaving your car out in the open in a tough area. On the positive side, the place was clean and the beds comfortable. Keep in mind this hotel is like a lot of LA properties that are over 50 years old, so the bathrooms are dated, but you get used to that if you stay around this area enough. In fact, one of th appealing things is the art-deco architecture of this place and others in LA. The rooms have both wired and wireless web access, and, like the parking, is free. Both of these can add up to a lot of money at the chain properties in this town. Front desk is accurate but robotic and not speedy. I still can't find the appeal of Hollywood itself as a reason to stay nearby. The crowd on this Friday night was young and tough and not for kids. While I didn't feel unsafe, its still adult oriented. It dawned on my that most of the other guests were European and didn't know of the option to stay elsewhere and drive to Hollywood and visit, but not stay overnight. The Boulevard may have been glamorous a long time ago but its not now even after being \"reinvented\" by urban renewal. The Hollwyood-Highland rail station is here too with all that brings to the neighborhood:) The breakfast is coffee, juice and small selection of pastries and not enough to rely on other than get you out the door. Orchid is officially a dead-end street off of busy Franklin, but you can sneak through the alleyway behing the Kodak theater and get out. A better option the next trip will be the Orchid Suites , which has secured basement parking and appears to be more modern, and is 2 doors down. It has the same price point as this place.

We arrived after a long day of airline cancellations ready to drop off our bags and explore Hollywood. The person behind the desk was very slow and confused. I wanted to use a different credit card than the one that I had reserved the room with and he had no idea what to do and just kept looking at the card, then looking at the paper, then finally called someone and asked them. When we got our key the room was on the second floor, so we lugged our heavy luggage up the stairs (no elevator), as we opened the door there was already someone elses luggage in this room. There were three of us, so one went down to get another room and the other two of us stayed with the luggage, hoping not to have to lug it back down the stairs. The new room was on the first floor, of course. As we walk in the room we realize that it only has a king size bed and we had reserved a room with 2 beds, plus there is trash in both the trash cans in the kitchen and in the bathroom, then there must of been like a bachelorette party or something because there was confetti in the shape of a male body part all over the room, which actually was the first thing that had made us laugh in quite awhile and ended up being the joke of the whole trip. We went out to complain and were pretty much told that it was the last room and if we didn't like it we could go somewhere else - on a Friday night at 8:00 p.m. We asked them if they could at least change the trash and they came in and did that. There was a pull-out sofa, which neither the bed or the sofa was comfortable at all, we all woke up with back aches. Tired and hungry we went and explored Hollywood a little bit and ate dinner at a really cute little italian place, which ended up the highlight of the whole day. The next morning when we woke up, I wasn't sure if I wanted to take a shower in this place, there wasn't very good water pressure for the sink so I wasn't very hopeful for the shower, but my friend decided that she would try it. She turned on the shower and water started pouring out, she yells out to us \"There's no show head\", - say what? we go in there and there is just a metal pipe with no shower head on it. Huh? You've got to be kidding me. So, we call and are told that maintenance doesn't come in until 7:30 a.m. and it is 7:15 a.m., so there is nothing that they can do. So we get ready and go out and get a muffin at 8:00 a.m. when the breakfast opens up, which is just a mob of people with no order. Then as we are sitting and eating at about 8:15 a.m. they finally call and ask about fixing the shower, by that time we had given up on it and just gotten ready for the day. We ask about a discount for everything that we have been through and are told that she will call the manager and let us know at check out. We leave and go do a Double Decker Tour bus, which was fun. When we go back to check in she tells us that the manager says not to charge us for tax, so we end up with about a $20 discount. I just don't understand all the great reviews for this place, I was so excited to experience that and be able to write one of those good reviews.

The following represents positive aspects of the hotel: 1. Location: For anyone visiting LA who wishes to see the tourist sites, the location is pretty superb. There are a number of tourist sites in the vicinity, including Hollywood Blvd., Chinese Theater with celebrity handprints, Kodak Theater, Hollywood and Highland shopping complex, Jimmy Kimmel show, Hollywood Bowl, Mulholland Drive, and Universal Studios. And it\u2019s somewhat central for other tourist attractions that are further away, including downtown LA, Burbank (for studio shows and tours), Paramount studio, Sunset Strip, and Beverly Hills. Also, there is a subway stop right at Hollywood and Highland, close to the hotel. 2. Condition & Environment of Hotel & Room: The front lobby is quaint and welcoming. The hotel has a nice Hollywood retro 50\u2019s theme going on. There is a nice outdoor patio with tables and chairs. The rooms seem large (we were in room 203) and spacious, and included a sofa seating area with a glass coffee table, and a small dining area with table, chairs and bar fridge. There was also plenty of open space to open up large luggage. The room and washroom condition was better than expected. I did not see any problems with the room condition. It is nothing fancy, but more than adequate. 3. Hotel Breakfasts: Free hotel breakfasts are a major perk. I\u2019m a little confused about the reviews here that are critical of the breakfasts \u2013 what do you expect from a budget hotel that is not obligated to provide any breakfast? If you want bacon and eggs, or health-conscious options, how could you book with a budget hotel expecting these kind of options for free? Anyways, the week we were there they had croissants, bagels with cream cheese, muffins, coffee, tea, about 4 juice options, and a toaster for the bagels. 4. Internet/Computer Access: It was great having access to our e-mail accounts through this free internet service in the lobby. There is only one computer, but we rarely had to wait for anyone to finish. The internet connection was very fast. Because we had this internet access, I was able to get us last minute tickets to a taping of David Spade\u2019s Showbiz Show, and look up LA events for that week. 5. Price: Given the above-mentioned factors, the price is right. We paid, on average, $104 US/night including taxes, and we were there for 7 nights. This was a government rate. Negative attributes of this hotel: 1. Payment process: I really only had one disappointing experience at this hotel. Since we had a very early morning flight to catch on the Saturday, I wanted to pay the night before in order to save time and have less worries on Saturday morning. But for some reason the desk worker would not let me pay on Friday night (March 16, 2007), and insisted that the payment process would be a quick and simple process in the morning. So the following morning at about 6:30 am, I tried to pay the front desk worker (there was a different person working at this time, \u201cArthur\u201d) who was having difficulty getting the credit card machine to work. He fumbled with it for some time, and in the mean time our cab showed up and we were getting behind schedule. Because of the machine problems, I had to sign a billing statement that totaled more than what we actually owed. It all worked out, and I was not over-charged in the end \u2013 but this was an irritating experience. I would have given a perfect rating had it not been for this incident. 2. The Gym/Workout Room: I saw in a posted picture that this hotel had a weight machine, and I was looking forward to using it. But it was broken and useless. Tips/Suggestions: * Breakfast is served at 8:00 am. Stack your paper plate and take it to the outdoor patio out front \u2013 pleasurable experience! * As already mentioned on this site, there is a shortcut to the Hollywood & Highland shopping centre. At the end of this hotel\u2019s street (Orchid Ave.), it looks like a dead end. But if you turn left to the area that looks like a loading dock, you\u2019ll find a large, open entrance on the right that goes directly into the shopping centre. * If you plan on going to some tourist sites, take the tourist brochures from the hotel lobby. Some of them have discounts on the brochure (such as the Paramount studio tour). Other Tips/Comments Not Relating to the Hotel: \u00b7Studio Tours: Seeing some studio tours was a priority for me. We saw 3 of them \u2013 Universal, Warner Brothers, and Paramount. In my opinion, Paramount was the best. It is a small, intimate walking tour of about a half dozen people, and everything you see is authentic - not staged. The Universal studio tour was very disappointing. It is more of a \u2018thrill-ride\u2019 than it is a studio tour. You are on an enormous golf cart with a couple of hundred other people, and you encounter staged situations that have nothing to do with the studios. For anyone that has been to Universal Orlando, the Jaws, Earthquake, and King Kong thrill rides are all a part of the Universal Hollywood studio tour. Universal Orlando is better than Universal Hollywood \u2013 if you\u2019ve been to the former, don\u2019t bother going to the latter. \u00b7Show Tapings: This was also a priority on our trip. If it is a priority for you too, start booking shows on the internet 1 to 2 months before your trip. Some shows fill up the same day they become available on the internet, so you need to monitor their websites daily. Also, you should book more shows than you intend to attend. You will find that for one reason or another, you will not be able to attend all the shows you booked, so it\u2019s nice to have back-up options (for instance, one show did not get back to us about tickets; Jeopardy cancelled all tapings for our vacation week two days before our trip; for Ellen\u2019s show, we did not get in line soon enough to secure a spot). Be prepared to wait in line for hours, even though you got your ticket in advance on-line. The earlier you show up, the better your chances of getting into the show. The shows we got into included Dr. Phil, Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Jimmy Kimmel, and the Showbiz Show with David Spade. \u00b7Getting Around: There is a lot to see and do in L.A., but it is all spread out everywhere. We decided to stick with walking and public transportation, but this was tough. Overall the transportation system was good, especially the subway. But the worst part was the bus transit system in Burbank. They don\u2019t seem to know what a schedule is. \u00b7Touristy Activity Suggestions: Studio tours, like Paramount; TV show tapings; Ride the ferris wheel at the Santa Monica Pier & eat on the patio at the Mexican restaurant at the end of the Pier; Check out the shops, street performers, and crazy people along Venice Beach; the Tar Pits; Hollywood Forever Cemetery (many celebrity resting here); Watch a movie at the Chinese Theatre; Check out the costumed movie characters and performers along the Walk of Fame where the hand-prints are located; Walk along Sunset Strip and see where the celebrities shop, party, and sleep/trash hotel rooms; Hike the trail that gets you close to the Hollywood sign (which is one thing we didn\u2019t get to do). \u00b7Shopping: Maybe our timing was bad for sales, but shopping was very disappointing in LA. We normally purchase quite a bit when travelling to the USA, but not this time. Perhaps you need to travel away from the touristy areas to get the deals. I was looking forward to the vintage clothing shops in LA, such as along Melrose, but everything was really over-priced. Ironically, I\u2019m able to get better deals and selection on vintage clothing through a well-know on-line auction site \u2013 and a lot of it comes from LA!", "Date": "July 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Strasbourg", "Title": "\u201cLove this Hotel !\u201d", "Author": "rk67fr", "ReviewID": "UR8057116", "Content": "Absolutely great !

The hotel is located on Orchid and is right behind the Kodak Theater and next to the Renaissance Hotel. There is a little passage way that connects you to the Hollywood and Highland shops. (No more that a 2 minute walk) It's funny w/ all the hustle and bustle of Hollywood Blvd., you can slip away into a quiet little quaint neighborhood. Very cute! The hotel has 2 floors (no elevators) w/ 20 rooms per floor. Our room (#210) had 2 queen beds , a seperate dining area w/ a table, 2 chairs, a microwave oven and a refrigerator. Lots of closet space and the bathroom is long and narrow w/ a sliding window. Very clean,bright. Bring own shampoo, conditioner and soap if you don't like the basic/generic stuff. The bedroom also has a window but both windows overlook the neighboring building windows. The room overall was very spacious. The hotel has an art-deco theme and the rooms are painted a soft yellow. The bed is soft and comfy but pillows are a bit flat and the comforter needs to be updated. There is continental breakfast served - muffin, bagel,crossaint along w/ 4 different kinds of juice, and coffee. The hotel has a steam room and an exercising room which has 3 machines. Parking lot area is small and it is first come first serve (entrance at Franklin). At night, the front door is locked and you must be buzzed in. Internet service is free (and fast) but just obey the 15 minute rule. What impressed me is the staff's (front desk) service. I called last minute and asked for a room but none was available due to the holiday weekend. I was surprised Alvin called back at the time he promised to call if another guest did not take the room. Also, we arrived back from clubbin late (after 2:45a.m.) No parking in the parking lot and no street parking. We asked the front desk to suggest any parking area but he just simply told us to park in front of the loading and unloading zone and he will move the car for us if a space is open at the lot. This hotel is run as if it was a bed and breakfast /mom and pop hotel. They take care of your needs and are very hospitable.

This worked GREAT and as a result cut our driving time and we drove right up into the parking lot. We booked on line at their website and got a great rate. We received the room we ordered, which was clean, very large, appointed with 60-70's era furnishings. The room was a low end 3*** in our view - but very acceptable. Toiletries were of a better than everaghe quality. The continental breakfast was basic: muffins, bagels, juice, coffe. No jam etc. There is free parking in the back, but it is as available, and our car was blocked until someone from the hotel came to move it which happened right a way - so no problems. the location of the hotel is incredible - and is the best reason to stay here. The metro is 150 feet through the mall - one stop to Univeral and no hassles to use. Front Desk provided tourist information as requested, but were generally invisable if you were not at the desk.

I stayed eight nights, with no major problems at all. The hotel staff is friendly and knowledgeable, the location is incredibly convenient, and the accomodations are clean and comfortable. This is a superb value for the money. I stayed in a room with a kitchen, and it was stocked with the various cooking necessities, so it was incredibly convenient to cook a few of own meals. Housekeeping staff was great. For example, not once did they wake me up even though I slept in late. They just took note of when I left, then tidied up the room. The lobby has a computer with Internet access, but I brought my own laptop, and each room has free internet access via an Ethernet cable. The cable had to stretch across the floor to the table, but this was a small inconveniece to pay for broadband access. The continental breakfast each morning was spartan but nice, with four different juices, coffee (regular and decaf), fresh muffins and croissants, with condiments. The hotel is located on a quiet side street nestled in the hills behind Graumann's Chinese Theater, the Kodak Theater, and the Hollywood & Highland (H&H) Mall. There is a Metro train entrance there as well. The Walk of Fame is right there. Hollywood High School is a block over. I loved the daily parade of characters in front of the Chinese Theater. Within walking distance to many shops and restaurants, tour companies, etc. The hotel has a nice patio to sit and enjoy as well. The rooms were actually fairly spacious and quiet (tip: run the A/C fan to drown out the slight traffic noice in the morning). Hotel was usually very quiet, even early morning. Try and stay on the first level towards the rear (no elevator and it is quieter). Some more tips: there is a shortcut through the mall...find it. If you have a car, there is a hidden shortcut to Orange Street as well. Even though the hotel has a fitness room (with a steam room) I needed a larger gym and there is a huge LA Fitness one block over that was only $40 for the whole week...nice club and definitely a bargain. Another tip: prearrange transportation online from LAX via a shuttle (Super Shuttle or PrimeTime Express)...will save you tons of money over a cab ride. $31 for two people. I know someone who also stayed there and paid $80 for a cab ride from LAX. The parking lot is very small, so a smaller rental car might be better. Be careful backing out onto Franklin, and park closer to the street so you don't get blocked in (there were a few mornings where there were more cars than spots).. More tips if you have time: see the Getty Center, Rodeo Drive (run into Heidi Klum there), Santa Monica Pier, Venice Beach, Malibu/PCH (someone I was with saw Sting and his wife there), drive Mullholland between the 101 and the 405...stop at the overlooks. Breathtaking homes and views..slip into a canyon road (watch out! locals drive fast in their beautiful exotic cars). Take a studio tour (Warner Bros is the best). Also try and see a show taping (Jimmy Kimmel is across the street). Also, there is usually someone handing out free tickets in front of Grauman's daily. Or check www.tvtickets.com or tvtix.com to see what's taping. Buy a stars map. See what shows are playing...esp. in West Hollywood. have a drink at an 'old' Hollywood club like the Formosa. Or, hit a hot club like the Cabana Club on a Thurs. if you can get on the guest list (search and ask for stuff like this). Take an hour to drive down Sunset Blvd. past Beverly Hills and Bel Air and UCLA to the ocean. During rush hours, avoid the freeways at all costs. Main side roads are usually quicker. Again, this was an AMAZING value ($109 with AAA discount) for a two queen room with a full kitchen in the heart of Hollywood!!!!!", "Date": "May 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "long island ny", "Title": "\u201cNot what I expected, from reading all the great reviews\u201d", "Author": "raindrops27", "ReviewID": "UR7429434", "Content": "Ok, now all the reviews for this hotel.

You end up having to park behind other cars, all the way almost to the street, and hand off the key to reception in case they have to move it (so they won't have to wake you up early in the morning to do it). Or, you might want to go out for a late night / set off early morning and find yourself parked in. - The breakfast is free but really crappy.

I made bookings over the internet after liasing with a staff member (whom I have now come to believe is the manager/owner\u2019s wife). My friends and I booked for 5 nights in total but with a gap after the first night as we were going to visit Vegas. The staff member offered us a AAA members discount (I think it was about $5-$10) despite the knowledge that we did not hold such membership. Upon our arrival, we were greeted by its friendly staff and were presented with keys to our room which was clean, spacious, cozy and had a full kitchen. The location was excellent, within walking distance to the subway station, the Kodak Theater and the Chinese Mann Theater, in the heart of Hollywood. We checked out the next morning as we were heading to Vegas for 5 days. When we came back to the hotel after our Vegas trip, we were confronted by the hotel manager who insisted at the counter that the rates we were quoted shall be increased for the remaining 4 nights as we were not AAA member. I was prepared to show him the email with the quote but he didn\u2019t seem too interested. After some argy-bargy, he finally said that he would let it go. The room he gave us was on their top level right down the other end of the corridor. Noone must\u2019ve stayed in that room for months \u2013 it smelt horrible and the bed-clock was set 5 hours late. When we tried opening the windows to let some fresh air in the traffic noise was so loud, we had to close them. The bathroom door would not close properly either. In addition, the room did not have a full kitchen, just a microwave and a small fridge. So even though he did not increase our rate, we got a crappier room than what we paid for. Over the next few nights, I received dozens of bites all over my body from bugs most likely from the bed sheets. They were so itchy they kept me up all night, and the worst thing was they spread and can be passed on by skin contact. I will upload some pictures later. We were duly transferred to another room when I showed the bite marks to a staff member on our last night. It was still not the same standard as the one we stayed in on our first night but by then we\u2019ve half given up on the place. The owner came and offered me $30 cash. That was not even enough to cover the ointment and tablets from the pharmacy (they were that bad, I had to take 2 packets of tablets). Having said the above, the location was really good, the staff members (other than the manager) were super-lovely and helpful, and the cost of accommodation included a generous breakfast. I wish the other 4 nights were like the 1st, because I would have highly recommended the place. But the fiasco with the owner/manager really pissed me off and the bug bites were so disgusting I ended up chucking out some of my clothes. I mean who wants to take tablets when they are on holiday, I felt like a sick patient and I had to be so careful around my friends as to avoid passing them on. All this because the owner wanted to charge us $40 ($10/night) more than what we were legitimately quoted. If the owner/manager is reading this \u2013 if you feel like you outsmarted us by giving us that crappy room, maybe you have, but at the end of the day, you got yourself 3 very unhappy customers.", "Date": "January 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austria", "Title": "\u201cin one word: great!\u201d", "Author": "sandhop", "ReviewID": "UR6649560", "Content": "I went to LA for one week and stayed at this hotel.

Upon arriving, at 10pm PST, my wife and I were informed that our room would be located directly adjacent to the entrance of the hotel. But we were assured that the sleeping quarters were near the back of the room and that the noise of people entering and exiting would hardly be heard if we noticed at all. I could not help but notice that the door to our room was slightly blocked by the service door to an employee basement (service area). The clerk was very friendly, this did help. We entered the room; it was spacious, clean and sadly reeked of natural gas. I am not a paranoid person, being a former employee of a restaurant that used natural gas I immediately knew the odor. My wife and I asked if we could have a new room. The clerk, who was very friendly, sadly informed us they were sold out for the night. After I informed him of our problem, he first attempted to turn the oven, off himself instead of calling someone in. I had to inform him hours later that his plan did not work. The clerk said at that point that he would have maintenance look at in the morning. We shared an awkward moment of silence, then I asked if they had a sister hotel were we could stay instead. I was told there was, I was refunded for the night at this hotel and charged for the night at the sister motel which was located at the end of the same block. The entire exchange took until 1am. Both clerks at both Hotels were friendly but neither offered more than verbal compensation for my displacement or troubles. I was happy they were both sorry for my trouble, but I would rather have been sleeping rather then trying to work out how to solve their gas leak issues at 1am, and then trying to find a place for my wife and I to sleep for the night. We were actually quite lucky I knew of the problem, the dumfound clerk had no such experience with natural gas and had asked that we just sleep in the room anyway. Granted he suggested we leave a window open, and even that we put a fan near the window. But if we had done so we may have gotten deathly ill or worse. What I do know of natural gas is from Avista. Avista (a power company in Washington state) has told its customers that if you smell natural gas, GET OUT! And stay out until their technicians can look at the problem. Not go inside your house and sleep on it until maintenance can look at it in the morning, oh and put a fan in the window. I repeat, he was a really nice guy and meant well. End of Day 1 We stayed for another 6 days, instead of giving you a play by play of each day, as I had above. Let me sum up. Positive comments: All employees and managers were very kind and also acted as quickly as possible to serve us as they could. Negative comments: \u2022 Unfortunately, our room was not serviced until we called at 7pm on one day. \u2022 The toilet didn't work on 3 different occasions, and the service toilet they have for just such an occasion was also out of order. \u2022 Bed sheets shorted every night \u2022 Not enough electrical outlets. I own a CPAP machine which requires an outlet near the bed, no outlets located near the beds. Only behind them which required my wife and I to move the bed before I could use my medical device. \u2022 No working clothes iron in the room. They did have one, but it didn\u2019t work. And after the week we\u2019d had so far I was sure they\u2019d give me another one, but I didn\u2019t want to risk what it might do to whatever I would try to iron. \u2022 No elevator to the 2nd floor (which normally wouldn't be an issue, but I didn't pack expecting to be lifting that kind of wait up a flight of stairs) \u2022 Poor cable TV reception, I'm not even sure how you get back Cable reception. It's cable, how do you get bad cable reception? I don't know but somehow we didn't get all the channels that were listed in their hotel guide book as \"local\" \u2022 Moldy sponge in which to clean the dishes provided by the hotel \u2022 Had to run the taps for a while to get hot water, then couldn't get cold water, even though they ran out of two different faucets. \u2022 The toilet seat would tip as you sat on it, so if you didn't try to balance while you were using it you might tip it over. More Positive comments: But don't let all these negative comments fool you. If you don't rent a car, and you want a location that is close to the metro (rail and buses) as well as a place that is within walking distance to many attractions,** and a friendly staff. This hotel will have what you want. The staff is very friendly, and so is the management. Summation: In summation we were within 10 minutes of so many excellent LA attractions it almost made the hotel room worth it, almost. Our trip was schedule for a total of 9 days 8 nights, you might have noticed above we only stayed 7 nights. We decided it would be more cost effective to pay $100 to fly home than pay $129 to stay another night at the Hollywood Celebrity. Footnote **Man\u2019s Chinese theater is awesome! Make sure to stop there on a weekend evening or a Friday night. The street performers are something else. And sign up to see the Jimmy Kimmel live show, its right across the street!

The room was very spacious with a separate eating alcove with fridge and microwave, and even a dressing area. It was very clean and on the top floor. Due to the hotel's situation on Orchid Street, views were not to be had. The AC was welcome in the heat of LA and we heard not a sound at night, despite being within 5 minutes of Hollywood Boulevard and all the major attractions along that road. We had free internet use on a computer in the foyer. The only slightly negative comment was the very basic breakfast which consisted only of bagels and cake with tea, coffee and orange juice.

The hotel is an old 2-story building that has been well maintained and has a GREAT location right behind Hollywood Boulevard where Grauman's, the footprints, the stars on the sidewalk, El Capitan, the subway station, Kodak Theatre and the Hollywood/Highland Mall. The location can't be beat. It's less than 100 steps from the hotel, down the street to the walkway that goes into the Hollywood/Highland Mall. It's that simple. The street is a cul-de-sac (not a through street) so the traffic is just local and the area is well lit and feels very safe. No seedy characters or anything like that. The Renaissance Hotel adjoins the mall so there is some hotel traffic down there with the service trucks and workers but it can't be heard from the hotel. The Hollywood Orchid Suites, the other one that everyone also raves about is at the end of the block, close to the walkway so they might hear the service trucks and mall activity. The hotel lobby and hallways are very nicely decorated and bright. The decor is whimsical and quite cute in the lobby area. The hallways have large framed movie star posters. There is \"free\" internet access in the lobby and a seating area with magazines on the coffee table. Along one wall is a table set up with a toaster, microwave and coffee dispensers for the free breakfast in the morning between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m. The toaster and microwave stays there all day so you could easily heat your own things up. Breakfast is a large supply of bagels, croissants and muffins along with little packets of cream cheese and margarine. Beverages are also provided. Every single day the breakfast items are identical so it might get boring if you stay too long. For a week's stay, it was fine and a good cost savings if you take advantage of the breakfast offerings, however boring. Yeah, they could add a bit more variety but hey, it's free. Being an old building has its advantages. The room itself was exceptionally large. We had a king-sized bed that seemed tiny in comparison to the huge room. Two comfy sitting chairs with a coffee table is at one end near the window and a little cut-in room with a small dining table, 2 chairs and a decent sized mini fridge. The tv is housed in a large wooden cabinet in front of the bed with storage drawers and cupboard. There is a cheesy painted Hollywood mural at the head of the bed. It's very fitting to the old-time Hollywood \"celebrity\" image that the hotel is doing. The washroom was adequate with great water pressure. It wasn't hot enough to require air-conditioning so we didn't test that out but the windows all have screens and window bars so that gave us fresh outside air as well as a great sense of security especially since our room was on the ground floor. We really enjoyed our stay and thought the room was exceptionally well-maintained and very clean. It wasn't seedy or anything like that. It looked quite nice and we felt comfy in it. It's not a Hilton or anything modern or fancy. It's basic but very nice. The hotel staff are very friendly and helpful. That said, here's what we didn't like but it was okay enough to tolerate for a week's stay. The hotel is \"old\" and wooden so that means that there will be lots of noise! Everyone upstairs when they walked sounded like herds of elephants stampeding. Do elephants stampede? Heehee. It really was quite loud but we were in vacation spirits and didn't let it bother us. The other noise that woke us the first night at 2 a.m. was this repetitive thumping sound. At first we thought it was someone playing bongle drums outside. After investigating because it was such a strange noise, we discovered it was water coming down the gutter drain pipe outside our window. The funny thing is that it wasn't raining at all so we don't know where the water was coming from but it was gushing down the drain pipe, making loud ticking noises. There are drain pipes outside every other suite! I don't know if any of them were making noises but you might want to watch out for room 110. Occasionally the people upstairs turned their air-conditioner/heater on and water dripped from their air-conditioner/heater onto ours, making ticking noises on the metal housing. If you're the type that gets very agitated by a lot of noise, you might want to try to get an upstairs suite. It should be quieter. We did request an upstairs non-smoking room when we booked but a non-smoking one wasn't available when we arrived. The entire first floor is all non-smoking and the top floor is mixed so we chose non-smoking. It was noisy but we expected to have a fair amount of noise being the hotel is in a central location in Hollywood. The outside street noise was actually quite low because the hotel is in the back of the mall complex which blocks out the traffic noise. It was just the inside noise that was most noticeable but tolerable enough for us because we chose to let it be that way but if you're the type that doesn't like noise, you've been warned but don't let that be the decision that steers you away from the hotel. It really is a nice hotel. You'll enjoy your stay. You can always bring ear plugs just in case but I don't think you'll need them. It is a great hotel for the price and we would stay there again. Oh yes, parking is provided \"free\" which is a great bonus for such a central location. It is a small lot so it fills up quickly and sometimes there are cars double-parked so that you can't get out in the morning but the hotel staff will quickly send someone to move the cars so that you can get out.", "Date": "January 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Limerick.

When we arrived, the hotel told us that they had a \"plumbing problem\" and offered us a room at their sister property the Hollywood Liberty Hotel across the street. They told us we could have a room at the Celebrity if we wanted to wait until 10 pm for it. This was not acceptable for us, as we had just driven for seven hours and needed to get ready to go to a party. I took the room they offered at the Liberty out of sheer exhaustion, I wish I had inspected it more closely before I agreed to spend a night in this dump. The halls and rooms smelled like cigarettes- despite the signs indicating that the hotel was non-smoking. What can I say about the room- my attached photos tell most of the story. The heat was a space heater! The shower didn't have hot water until the manager came in and said, \"You have to find it...\" and then calibrated it just so until a lukewarm trickle came out. The bathroom looked like it had been outfitted on a trip to the Dollar Depot, with a cheap plastic pink tension rod to hold up the shower curtain (actually it was just a liner). The bathmat was a hand towel. The coverlet on the bed was obviously stained and yellowed when we turned it down. The bed had no fitted sheet on it, so within five minutes of lying in it, the sheet was off and we were lying on the mattress. The most disgusting feature of this room was the walls. The walls were heavily stained with and looked as if they were last painted in the Nixon administration. There were cigarette ashes pooled in the windowsill of the bathroom. The biggest affront was that this room was supposedly comparable to the Celebrity. This room made the Super 8 seem like a four star resort by comparison. I never saw any of the rooms at the Celebrity but I can guarantee there was no steam room at the Liberty! I can't believe the owners have the gall to charge more than $40 per night for this place. The most outrageous thing is that Hollywood Celebrity offered no apology, no discount off the room or a free night at a later date, which would have been totally appropriate. They basically told us we could still come over for the continental breakfast at the Celebrity. No effort was made to refund any of my money, even though I had pre-paid a higher rate for the Celebrity. I hate to say it, but the way in which management treated us, I had the sinking feeling that they didn\u2019t really have a plumbing problem, but that they had overbooked and given our room to someone else.
