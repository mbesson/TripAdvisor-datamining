Also, as great as the shuttle from the hotel to the city was, we were a little annoyed on our last day when the bus went without us despite booking it the day before. There was barely an apology and no alternative but to pay for a taxi into the city. Taxi prices were always around the 20 Euro mark which we considered quite good between three of us.

I've listed the pros and cons below, but let me say we really appreciated the closeness to the airport when we were leaving, and after staying in some places with uncomfortable beds, really appreciated the facilities here! The only real disappointment was the inconvenience of getting into the city itself, thought they do offer a shuttle. PROS: Many of the staff members at Husa Nuevo Boston speak English, and some speak other common European languages. They were very helpful with getting us to and from the airport, into the city on the weekends, and giving us guidance with the buses when they did not offer shuttle services. When you arrive at the airport they will come pick you up as soon as you have landed and call them. When getting a ride to the airport, the shuttle leaves hourly from the hotel. They have a nice pool and outdoor lounge area, which is nice for families. Free WifFi is great. On weekends they offer a shuttle into the city at different times so you don't have to take the bus, but if you do need to use public transport the day (and even night buses) are only a block and a half away. They let us check in early, and the room was great! Comfy bed, and very clean. Despite being close to the airport, we never heard planes....though we did hear the soft clinking of dishes sometimes, regardless of the distance between our room and the dining area. Not distracting, but weird! CONS: If you want something close to the airport, Husa Nuevo Boston is great, but it's inconvenient for getting into the city. Madrid's normal metro/bus pass does not cover the zone the hotel falls into (barely), so every time you want to go into the city, you have to pay \u20ac2 each way! The night bus costs \u20ac3.50 (also one-way). TIP: When heading to or from to the hotel, the easiest way is to take the bus to/from Avenida de America. When coming back home, get off at the first stop after the big roundabout/Canillejas. There aren't really any restaurants in the area (I think I noticed an English pub a few blocks away when we were taking the shuttle into town once) and the hotel's dining options were a bit on the pricey side for my boyfriend and I. Also, as great as the room was, they have the stiffest toilet paper--almost like small paper towels. Just seemed kind of odd since everything else was great. I recommend signing up for your weekend shuttle times early before they fill up, and you should note that they do not offer a laundry service and we found no public laundromats in Madrid.", "Date": "July 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Algiers, Algeria", "Title": "\u201cA perfect transit hotel...\u201d", "Author": "Roro-de-Bab", "ReviewID": "UR133454915", "Content": "Good sized and clean rooms.

Very good 4**** room with good size, minibar, safe and proper equipped bathroom. Close to the airport and free shuttle (but only running 1 x per hour) and in the weekend also free shuttle to the city centre. As I was only for 22 hours in Madrid as there was no proper connection on the same day for my travelplan (Marrakech-Madid-Dublin) I only used the hotel as a 'stop-over' place to sleep and het through the day: arrived there around 2100, had a quick drink in the garden and a snack in the restaurant and then enjoyed a good sleep in the hotelroom. The next day did pay for the breakfast which offered a proper buffet style breakfast: although I would have like the opportunity to order once eggs as you like them and then made fresh to order: but we only had (hard) fried eggs or scrambled with undercooked bacon: but apart frm that good buffet. (If you can get a deal with breakfast included it's worth it, but also paying for it gave reasonable value for money). My only complaint is the \"Ryanair style\": BF not included was for the deal I booked (also offers that included BF were available), but also WiFi internet access was payable, internet-access via the TV in the room was payable at 12,50 per day: and I didn't even check for the costs of movies or adult movies. Imho a different selection of the 30 \"free\" TV channels would have been nice: the news channels are fine (BBC World, Al Jazeera [en + arabic], CNN, CNBC and France24 (french and english). But an English language \"non news\" station would have been nice (and drop a German or Spanish channel).

My daughter told me not only would they not provide any, but they were not nice about it either. When my daughter checked out of the hotel, I was again disturbed be her having to call me (at my expense) because they gave her a hassle. I had given them my Amex (which they required at check-in and also signed for my stay). Their front desk people are incompetent. Oh, which reminds me. When we checked in we were given the key to \"our\" room. After traveling all day and looking forward to plopping down for a minute on the bed, we opened the door only to be greeted by a man screaming at us, followed by a lady in her thong running to lock the door again behind us! Ooopsie, they gave us keys to an occupied room. The reception not warm, the service was not hospitable, the employees not particularly pleasant, and I did not enjoy this hotel. It was however, a clean and comfortable place to stay by the airport as long as you don't need tissues.", "Date": "November 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winston Salem, NC USA", "Title": "\u201cNear the airport, shuttle service, breakfast\u201d", "Author": "gearheart", "ReviewID": "UR120033386", "Content": "We chose this hotel because it was near the airport and had a shuttle service.

It was very late at night and check in went very smoothly . Our room was very spacious , modern and clean the bathroom was very modern too , although the door to the abthroom did not shut properly i classed this as a very minor issue in the scheme of things and would not be deterred. It was quiet the stay and most enjoyable . The following morning we took advantage of the free shuttle that travels at set times down into Madrid City centre , this again was very punctual and I could not fault ,Madrid is a lovely city with plenty to do. We also spent some time at the hotels pool which is very nice and secluded however it did feel like in the afternoon when some business guests who had paid for the extra service that we were not welcome at the pool. We had an evening meal at the hotel and althought the food was good the service could have been a bit better .

Not great at the height of the summer and perhaps better to put up a sign that the pool area was not available to guests all week. I eventually managed to get a late check out until 3pm which took several discussions and some negotiation.

The Hotel Husa Nuevo Boston is located 1.8km from the airport near many of the other airport hotels.

There is free wireless internet, and computers are available for those without a laptop. Unlike other properties, the staff at this hotel were extremely professional. Even though I speak some Spanish, the hotel staff spoke to me in English since they knew I was from the United States. The hotel restaurant was surprisingly good and very reasonable considering guests are almost forced to eat there. A 3 course meal with an appetizer, main dish, dessert, drink, and coffee was less than 20 euros. Guests should know that you must call the hotel on arrival to get picked up at the airport. This is easy to do, but you must use a pay phone since hotel airport phone connections are not available in the Madrid airport. If you forget the phone number, it can be obtained very easily from the visitor information desk at the airport.

That was great because I didn't even need to wait for the shuttle! The only problem was that my cab driver tried to cheat us by taking us through a really long, convoluted route-- the meter was up to 40 euros! As the hotel promised to pay for it, everything turned out OK but I was just a bit worried sitting in the cab not knowing what they guy intended to do-- just take us for a ride to charge us extra or kidnap and rob us! Luckily I called the hotel when I figured something was wrong (ride was suppose to be 5 mins but we still didn't arrive after 15mins) and the concierge talked to the cabbie and demanded he drive us there immediately. Anyways, despite the adventure with the cabbie, the stay itself was great. The hotel had great service. To compensate me for the cab drama, the hotel upgraded us to a bigger room. Decor was modern, room very clean. Free wifi throughout hotel as promised. Didn't try breakfast as we thought it was a bit expensive, but turns out all hotels in Spain charge you around 15 euros for breakfast.
