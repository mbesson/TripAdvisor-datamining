The owner owns several of the hostels in Block C at Chungking Mansions and as a result we actually ended up in the \"Garden Hostel\" on floor 16. The Hostel was absolutely perfect for our needs. We had an immaculate room, which was cleaned daily by the friendly and helpful staff. The room is small, but there is plenty of room under the beds to store cases etc. The bathroom again was small, but perfectly equipped with a lovely hot shower. The Air con worked perfectly and there was a good size TV and free Wi-Fi. Given the location and price, visitors should expect small, neat things. The cleanliness and friendliness of the staff however were WELL above our expectations. We've spent time in countless Hostels across New Zealand, none of which come close to this hostel for cleanliness, convenience and comfort. The location is perfect, and we really can't understand why people give Chungking Mansions such a bad press. We had done our research and expected the hawkers (which were very polite and no trouble), small lifts etc etc so there were no big surprises. Chungking Mansions is not a threatening place although people may not have experienced this kind of environment before, so do check it out in advance. The curry restaurants are excellent and there are some of the cheapest snacks and drinks in all of Hong Kong on the ground floor! We would DEFINITELY stay here again. We're posting this review on both \"New Hong Kong Hostel\" and \"Garden Hostel\" as we're not 100% sure which would be best to review!", "Date": "August 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Zhuhai, China", "Title": "\u201cLook somewhere else first.\u201d", "Author": "derektrips", "ReviewID": "UR116020838", "Content": "My experience at the New Hong Kong Hostel is very similar to the bad reviews already posted. I would have to tell travelers to look somewhere other than the Chung King Mansion. If you want to rough it out or don't care about the shabby accommodations this place is fine.

Although I knew that place was no so good, I have no options. I gave a chance and stay there. We arrived at midnight, the entrance is full of people with no good appearance. The room and bathroom was so unpleasant. Besides that, there are 3 guys sleeping in the floor in the hall.The pics showed in the internet was not real. My 1st time in HK was great, I booked other hostel. So, I advise you booking early and avoid bad experiences.", "Date": "May 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cRough!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR86144882", "Content": "As you walk into the ChungKing mansions you will inevitably be met by several men all gunning for your business! Despite the fact we had a prior booking for this place we were still quizzed at the lift door by a man askin which hostel we were booked into. He asked if it was our hostel and we agreed, he then followed us up in he lift to a very dubious \"reception\"! All the while complaining that we were late for 'check-in'! On booking we had confirmed we would be arriving at 10pm and arrived at 9:50pm!? The room we were given was infact in The Osaka guest house on the 12th floor! The rooms are minute with no windows, anywhere to put clothes or bags etc. No floor space at all infact! The place is well dodgy - except to be quizzed on your way in & out about where your staying, where your from & whether you want a fake Rolex!!", "Date": "November 6, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "New Hong Kong Hostel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g294217-d1198896-Reviews-New_Hong_Kong_Hostel-Hong_Kong.html", "Price": "$44 and up*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Flat C1,Floor 6,Block C,Chung King Mansion,Nathan Road 36-44,Kowloon</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Hong Kong</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">China</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1198896", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/87/2c/c1/triple-room-1-double.jpg"}}
