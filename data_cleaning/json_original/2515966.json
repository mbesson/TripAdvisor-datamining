That was exactly what happened but also the hotel was so much more! We loved this small hotel in so many ways and I would recommend it to anyone travelling with young children. The posiiton was perfect, an easy walk to the piers to see all the sights, and surrounded by great restaurants. The bedroom was spacious, the sitting room even bigger. There was plenty of room for the sofa bed and a rollaway bed too, for the children. Having a kitchen was wonderful for jet lagged children in the middle of the night or very early morning, a bowl of cereal or a hot drink for us, brilliant! The staff were all so sweet, really helpful and child friendly. The roof terrace was stunning, with a fabulous view across the bay to Alcatraz, the GG bridge and more..... a wonderful place for afternoon tea after a hard day's touring. Even better, the sushi and noodles from Grandeho Kamyeko, a few doors away, was the perfect takeaway dinner to feed to tired children, before they went to sleep while we enjoyed a bottle of wine. A perfect base.

Some will say that the hotel is dated and lacks ammenities found in mega hotel chains. But, these things only add to the beauty of this place. The hotel seems as if it is a converted apartment/condo space. All of the rooms are at least a one bedroom suite. However, the place feels more like an apartment or home rather than a sterile hotel room. It was clean and inviting with no troubles. There is no pool, but the advantage to that is there are less children in the hotel. In fact, I only saw 2 during our stay. That is a plus for couples and adults that want to get away. Instead of a pool, this hotel has a rooftop lounge area with an unobstructed view to Alcatrez and Ghiardelli Square. You can also see both the Golden Gate Bridge and the Bay Bridge from there. The rooftop is worth the price of admission. Now let's discuss the location. There isn't a more perfect location. The hotel is 2 blocks from the Wharf, one block from Ghiardelli Square, and two trolley car stops from Lombard Street. It is situated on a corner that has a trolley stop and many bus routes. We used the buses and trolley to tour the entire city. The location cannot be beat! It was away from most tourists to be peaceful, yet close enough to feel safe walking around the hotel. There are plenty of restaurants and shopping nearby, as well as grocery stores to stock up the kitchen. The fully functional kitchen was perfect for a week long stay. The service at this hotel was top notch. The front desk staff provided excellent recommendations and knew how to navigate the city efficiently.

The room was very clean and nicely decorated, the kitchen was stocked with brand new utensils and cookware and we had a balcony with a peek a boo view of Alcatraz. We found this location to be perfect for all the sightseeing we did in our two days. Friends of mine had suggested that maybe Union Square was where we should stay, but we loved this location and only went up to Union Square to do some shopping once. While we were in San Fran the weather was pretty cool and windy, so unfortunately we didn't get to sit up on the rooftop deck and enjoy the view. We barely got to use our own balcony, but it was sure nice to be able to step up and feel the temperature to decide on what to wear before venturing out for the day. The hotel is only a few blocks walk to Lombard (the crookedest street) and one block to Ghiradelli Square's delicious chocolate shop and a couple blocks to fun Fisherman's Wharf.

While there is onsite parking at the Suites, a car really isn\u2019t necessary (or first choice) in getting around the city. Two major SF Muni (bus) lines (30 & 47) pick you up and/or drop you off right in front of the building (or diagonally across the Hyde/North Point intersection), making it easy and cheap to get downtown (shopping, theatres, restaurants), AT&T Park, the Castro, the Haight Ashbury, and Golden Gate Park (including the De Young Museum).

The room itself was very nice, although the bathroom was small(not really important). Very well furnished, full kitchen if you need it, dining area, a balcony overlooking the street, and a rooftop with tables and chairs with views of the bay. We opted for the on-sight garage for 2 days and felt very safe where we left it. This is a really nice hotel. Desk staff very happy to give info, maps, directions etc. without an attitude. Kudo's.

Now that we've stayed at the Suites at Fisherman's Wharf, we'd pick it over a hotel any time. The location is fantastic. Just a couple of short blocks up from the Hyde Street pier, the Maritime Museum and the start of the cable car line. And the Suites are just at the edge of a residential area, so the neighbourhood is lovely. We could easily walk to all the waterfront sites (Pier 39, Pier 33) and Union Square was just a very short bus/cable car ride away. There are ,any restaurants along High Point and Jefferson Streets, just a block or two away. There are numerous buses and a cable car line that stop right at the door, so getting around is easy. The units themselves are extremely well equipped, despite having fairly small kitchen and bathroom, and a family of four could easily and comfortably live in them for a week or more. The kitchens have combo microwave/convection ovens plus hot plates and all the cooking tools you could want. Large living room; big screen televisions in both living and bed rooms. The apartments are located off of a central atrium, filled with comfy chairs and lush plants. There is a \"business centre\" in the front lobby with access to free (if a little slow) internet and phone. There are four first floor units that have access to a private, shared patio, which is an oasis of calm, featuring teak patio furniture and potted plants. Be sure to ask for one of these when you book. Most of the other units have patios overlooking High Point Street or no patios. The top floor deck has incredibly comfortable Muskoka (I think Americans call them Adirondack) chairs and an amazing view of the city. The on-site laundry facilities are clean, handy and cheap. A great convenience for a family travelling light or taking a longer trip. The front desk staff were extremely knowledgeable about the city and very friendly and helpful. They easily rivalled the skill of the concierges at the better hotels around town.

What you do get is more space and kitchen facilities, which I prefer. It is great to have your morning coffee and breakfast and relax before a busy day of sight-seeing. We had a 1 bedroom suite on the 1st floor, which had a kitchen, living area with dining with access to a patio that is not private, 1 small bathroom with tub and shower. There is a small elevator, similar to what you find in European hotels that is fine for getting your luggage to your room - actually larger than some European hotels I have been to \u2013 LOL! There is a nice roof top patio that we enjoyed, it has a great view of the harbor and Alcatraz. The room was very clean and we really liked the location. It is a short walk to Fisherman's Wharf with a great selection of restaurants and the cable car stop is right outside the door. We did rent a car for two days because we made an overnight trip to Monterey, but you do not need a car if you plan to see the city sights. The MUNI system is great and day trips to wine country are available online or ask the person at the front desk for info . We found the front desk personnel very helpful .

If you're looking for a new modern luxury resort, this is not the place for you. The style is what you would expect considering its vintage, the bathroom and kitchen are small but functional and the railings on the balconies are slightly rusty metal. Also it is on a major bus route and beside the trolley tracks so there is lots of street noise. For this part of our trip, it was the perfect hotel for us (two adults and a teenager). We had stayed overnight at the airport and arrived at the hotel at 10 am, they provided us with secure luggage storage so we could enjoy our day. When we checked in that afternoon we found our room to be very roomy and very clean and the staff friendly. We stayed in room 301, a one bedroom suite for four nights. The elevator was interesting but slow so I wouldn't recommend the third floor unless you are fit enough to use the stairs, which we did. There was an in-room safe plenty large enough for the laptop and other stuff. The kitchen and bathroom were dated but clean. The bed was comfortable and the sofa bed was very good with a real mattress and good canvas support. The balcony was functional and the roof top deck was great, we even ate our supper there one night (very good vietmamese take out from Grandeho's Kamekyo less than 1/2 block away). The do allow smoking on the roof top deck which we didn't like. We didn't have a car for this portion of our trip but we did buy a multiday transit pass which worked out great. There is a lot to see and do within walking distance, we used the transit system to go to the Academny of Science which was amazing, the cable car museum which was great also and to Little Italy for an amazing authentic Italian lunch at the Original US Cafe. We took the Mr Toad 90 minute \"Hop around the City tour\" on our first full day which gave us great information about the city and the recommendation for the Original US Cafe. Michaelis Food Store just a block west, had a great selection of wine and beer. Lori's Diner in Garadelli Square makes great milkshakes and homemade apple pie. The Pier Market had very good Red Curry and Coconut Mussels and Scoma's makes really good clam chowder. We had Vietnamese from Grandeho's Kamekyo twice because it was so good.

Unfortunately this place didn't have any rooms available and we ended up paying way too much at another hotel just one block down the road. Luckily this place had rooms open for our last two nights. The outside of the hotel looked a little dingy, but the inside was amazing. It was the best place that we stayed during the entire week and a half visit to California. I'm only sorry to say that we didn't find any other places like this. The room was very spacious. It wasn't like the other places that you walked in and it was just a room and bathroom, this place had a full living/dining room with foldout couch, a kitchen with a convection microwave, dishes and full sized refridgerator, and a seperate bedroom. Everything in the room was very modern and didn't look outdated at all. It was the only hotel that we stayed in with flat screen tv's. We were able to request a balcony room so that we could sit out and watch all the hussle and bussle. Not only did we have a balcony, the roof was also open to guests, and the view was stunning. For all the smokers out there, San Francisco is very smoke free. You are not able to smoke on the balcony here, but we were allowed to smoke on the roof as long as we didn't offend any other guests. Most of the other hotels wouldn't even allow you to smoke anywhere on the property. We were only a very short 3 block walk to the main strip of the wharf, and very close to Ghiradelli Square. We have 3 boys, and have already decided that when we come back we are going to make sure that we book this place well in advance, as the kitchen area will help keep the food & drink costs down. There is a very elegant chef owned restaurant across the street (SW corner of Hyde and Bay), so if you enjoy fine dining be sure to bring nice attire to wear. The parking is very affordable compared to other places in the area (1/2 the cost). The hotel attendants were wonderful, even called to let us know that they were there to help if we needed help with anything in the area.

One thing that highly impressed me was, upon my return I received a survey regarding our stay. I responded, although I generally feel these are very generic and may or may not be read. I only had a couple of negatives to report. Within a day, I received a response back from the manager addressing the specific comments I had made. One being the internet connection dropped on occasion and was told their IT dept was in the process of changing providers as they were aware of this problem. The only other comment suggested adding a table to the laundry room and the response from the manager was he had gone out that day and purchased supplies to build one and could not believe in their remodeling the laundry room, had overlooked putting one in.

We now have a new favorite hotel ! The location was as convenient as the Argonaut (two blocks away), near our beloved Buena Vista, many of our favorite restaurants, and a block from the Cable Car turnaround on Hyde Street. What set the Suites at Fisherman's Wharf apart from all others was the personal service of the incredibly friendly and helpful staff. The hotel itself is small, but well appointed. The suites were clean and the beds comfortable. The full kitchen was a bonus which we really didn't take advantage of on this trip, but will remember for next year. There is a wonderful rooftop patio with a great view of the bay that we greatly enjoyed, too. Our trip this year was flawed in some ways, however, as I had not planned on the S.F. Giants having a playoff game that week, and had not foreseen that the weather, for the first time ever, would be a problem. We could not get a reservation at our chosen restaurants, and taxis were almost impossible to find. The city was simply packed. But, while the weather outside was frightful, the hotel staff was delightful ! The got us into their recommended restaurants, and somehow found us a taxi every time we needed one. They treated us like we were family from out of town ! An example: Being from Oklahoma, I was counting on watching the Oklahoma Sooners play a nationally televised football game on Saturday night. About 30 minutes before the game started, we realized that the station the game was on had no sound. I called Chris at the front desk, and immediately someone was at the room to correct the problem. But it seemed the problem could not be fixed, so they brought in another brand-new T.V. and hooked it up. It still had no sound, so they brought in ANOTHER new T.V. and hooked it up to no avail. With the game starting in 5 minutes, they switched us to another suite where the sound worked...and sent us up a bottle of wine ! Despite the weather, the staff of the hotel made our trip successful, and we had a wonderful time. We will definitely return !

The hotel has washing and drying facilities for clothes by the car garage which are efficent and are $1.50 for a wash and $1.50 to dry. Shopping for food is expensive but if you get a Safeway card as soon as you arrive in the supermarket (on Bay street) you will get discounts on everything and save loads of money. The roof terrace is great for a spot of sun worship and fabulous views fog permitting although you will need summer clothes for the day time and coats scarves and boots for the chilly evenings. Get your self a 3 or 7 day pass just down the hill at the cable car terminus and get around with ease, once you've done the touristy bit on the cable car. The buses and trolley buses are quicker and more frequent although the cable car is a must do down to Union Square experience the thrills of the hills!! Try out the Zuni cafe very good eating out spot. 'Bike the bridge' which you will hear a few hundred times a day is well worth the money we left at 11am from the wharf (just down the hill from the apartment) cycled across the Golden Gate bridge to Sausalito and then onto Tiberon to get the ferry back we arrived back around 19.30 having had a great day and cycling about 20 miles (although the ferry back from Sausalito is also a much less energetic option). Wine tour via the Muir Forest is also worth a trip (leave the kids at home!) plenty of opportunity to sample and buy really good wine and the forest is amazing. The Japanese Tea garden in Golden Gate Park is lovely and free to enter on Monday, Wednesday and Friday between 9 and 10 am. (Get the number 30 bus down to union square and change onto the no 5 to the park).

The 2 room suite is right on the cable car route side of the hotel, so it is a bit noisy. The cable car runs very late and starts early, so if noise is a problem you won't want a 2 room suite (there are only a few of these and were told they are all on the same side of the hotel). We had an issue with the television, which was not resolved during our stay--it was Christmas. The manager adjusted our bill to make up for the inconvenience. I know--you might be thinking who cares about the TV, but Husband is a big sports fan, so he was not happy about missing some good games. We were there to see our daughter--not so much for sightseeing, so we enjoyed having more room than a typical hotel. It was plenty roomy. One bedroom had a king bed and the other a full size. There was a living/dining room area, and a balcony (overlooking the cable cars). The kitchen was fully equipped with dinnerware, flatware, etc., but there is no oven. There is an oven downstairs, but I had hoped to cook Christmas dinner in our suite. We had to go out for dinner...darn ;-) We were able to make breakfast and other things on the stove top. The dishwasher was extremely loud, so we turned it on when we left. There was a full-size refrigerator, too. The location is excellent for transportation. There was a Walgreen's just a few blocks away, and there is a Safeway grocery a little farther. We bought groceries and rode a bus right back to the hotel.

As soon as we walked into the lobby, instead of asking, he told my guest and I that he needed to talk to us in such a tone that we thought was rude and demanding, hhhmmm...no, rather it's if I want to talk to u or need ur services I will, but to tell me u need to talk to me, especially if ur suppose to be a conciere and we hadn't even checked in yet.......well no. Fortunately, I saw it this morning while getting ready to leave the hotel, but under the coffee table there were cut toe nail trimmings from someone who had stayed there. It tells me that the cleaning lady was lazy and didn't vaccum under the coffee table, which is unacceptable. Makes one wonder what else wasn't clean, hhmmm? Also, while using the hair dryer the fuse blew so it shut the power off to the entire unit except the refrigerator. I had to test the GFI and fuse box to finally trigger the power back on. There's a reasonable expectation that someone will use the hair dryer so why not upgrade the fusebox to accomodate the power surge?! In todays times, this should not be happening. As for the room itself, I realze they're old and for the most part the room was fine. I do like the idea of having a kitchen and separate bedroom/living room so if someone wants to nap or sleep they can without it bothering anyone. U don't find these types of places much. The roof top wharf view is nice and it's close to areas of interest that walking to and from makes it easy instead of driving everywhere. Value wise, it's very affordable for what ur getting, which is why I gave it a 5 star. As far as recommending it, well, not so sure.

It's the little things that matter and rudeness before u check in, power going out because of a hair dryer and toe nail clippings.....I'll look elsewhere.", "Date": "June 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stockton, CA", "Title": "\u201cGreat service and location\u201d", "Author": "elllpeee", "ReviewID": "UR30303375", "Content": "Every staff member we encountered was extremely friendly and helpful, and this set the facility apart from others. The location was perfect, 1 block from Ghirardeli Square and the Hyde Street Cable Car and 2 blocks from the waterfront. The room itself was slightly dated, but was not lacking. The bathroom was a little cramped, but all in all, the room was comfortable. The interior courtyard provides a pleasant place to sit and meet with others and the rooftop patio is very nice, if the weather cooperates. The patio does provide a perfect view of the bay and Alcatraz. The kitchenette and living room were nice, but we did not take advantage as we were there for only 1 night. Would highly recommend for a longer stay and will definitely look at this property again if we are staying in the city. Parking is very limited, as it is everywhere in San Francisco. Overnight parking fee of $20 is quite reasonable compared to other locations, but the enclosed structure has only a few spaces and is very tight.

The hotel rates were competitive to other standard rooms in the motels/hotels in the area, but the rooms were suites (much better value) and the parking was half the price of the other hotels (be sure if you're looking for a hotel in Fisherman's Wharf to ask about the parking price - some hotels charge an additional $50 per night over and above the room rate - the parking here was $20 per night, and was secured & covered - in the basement of the building). We stayed in a one bedroom suite, with living room, kitchen & bathroom. The Living room had a Queen-sized sleeper sofa. Bedroom and living room had a TV with a dvd/vcr in the livingroom. Kitchen included a full size refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker (with complimentary coffee) , dishes and dishwasher. The bed was comfortable and rooms was clean. This hotel exceeded our expectations, and we'll definitely try to stay here again when we visit next time. This hotel is part time-share, part hotel (we didn't have to sit through a sales pitch if you're wondering), and is well maintained, conveniently located next to several bus routes and the Hyde street trolly - ((Check into getting a city pass when you're there - but if you plan on going to to Alcatraz, buy the City Pass from the Alcatraz booth on Pier 33. The Pass gives you 7 days unlimited use of the muni bus, cable cars and trolly's, gets you into Alcatraz, the California Acadamy of Science, the Exploratorium, Yerba Buena Gardens, the Aquarium, plus discounts on other attractions. You save about 50% off the entry into those attractions, plus get the value of the bus lines!)) Anyway, back to the hotel, there is a viewing area on the roof which is great for pictures.", "Date": "April 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "fishers, in", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and service\u201d", "Author": "danthemanpurdue", "ReviewID": "UR27806213", "Content": "The rooms are a little worn but the staff makes up for it with very friendly service.
