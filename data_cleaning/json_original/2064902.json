We ended up on the \"La Esmeralda\" side which is for families. Having our room on that side was fine -- it wasn't loud or anything, but we spent our time around the adult pool at \"La Perla\" and it was quite a long walk -- OK at the beginning and end of the day, but too far to \"pop back to the room\". So, if you're a couple, stay at La Perla. The food was tremendous. Breakfast buffets were extremely varied and tasty. There were lots of options for lunch, including buffet. There were more dinner restaurants than we could visit in a week, and they range from Argentinian grill to Japanese. Passions restaurant is an extra charge of USD 40 per person and is the best deal you will ever get for that quality of food. Have the tasting menu and come hungry! We are fortunate enough to have eaten at the French Laundry in Napa Valley, and Passions is as good, in my opinion. The staff were attentive, well trained and very friendly. We did not buy the upgraded Royal Service package, but still, we were personally greeted by Karla, and she took care of us throughout our stay, making our reservations and making sure we were happy. She's a lovely person and I hope we see her again when we return. For beach lovers, the walk to the beach may seem a bit long. There is no view of the beach as there is a stand of mangroves between the resort and the shore. However, if you're concerned about the environment, this should make you very happy. The mangroves have been left standing to protect the precious environment. I'd like to say I understand how this works, but we were unable to take the eco tour because we had a couples massage appointment. The spa was wonderful and the therapists were excellent. The price was also very good, as it was the featured treatment. We are not big activities people, and we were pleased that we were offered all the activities (eco tour, water aerobics, beach volleyball, etc.) but were not hounded to participate. On St. Paddy's day there was a beach party by the pool, and it was excellent. The staff really know how to lead people in having a good time. There are abundant pool loungers, beach towels and bali beds. The rooms were beautiful, both in design and furnishings. There are fluffy white bathrobes and matching slippers, which I always like. We stayed in the most basic room, and it was pure luxury. The swim up suites look amazing. We might try one next year.", "Date": "March 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint Louis, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cAwesome property, some kinks to iron out.\u201d", "Author": "crackedpulse", "ReviewID": "UR126599130", "Content": "Stayed here over a period of 3 days in March. I was in the Royal Service portion which included butler service. Overall this place is pretty impressive. After a 40 minute drive from the airport, you drive thru a very poor area and Paradisus then appears like an oasis in the desert. The entire property is extraordinarily beautiful and immaculately clean. The staff is very very friendly but seem to speak less English than similar resorts.. At least a little more broken English. Upon arrival we were taken by golf cart to the exclusive royal section. Check in was smooth and the butler took us to our room and explained the ins and outs of the resort. Rooms were beautiful, well appointed and well stocked with premium liquor. The resort has about 10 restaurants, one exclusive to royal service which we enjoyed one night. Food quality was high and portions were good. The breakfast buffet restaurant, Hadar, was excellent as well. Plenty of available cabanas, swim up bars and suites. The beach area was kind of small and full of seaweed but was beautiful as well. Only issue with the resort, and probably just due to the newness, was some lack of or miscommunications among the staff. Several times I called down to the butler to ask a question and I would be transferred to a dead extension or my request would go ignored. I never did get the pillows I ordered after 4 attempts. Overall, great place, would go back...

I felt like I had landed in the lap of luxury, its so beautiful and modern. Yes it is true that it is huge but I was so happy for the exercise, cause lets face it ... who really wants to go to the gym (gorgeous as it was) while they are on vacation??? I had no problem with kids in the adult areas, it was so peaceful and relaxing and the service is impecable, the bartenders even remembered what we were drinking (how cool is that). Thanks guys. Also the selection of drinks is amazing and top quality alcohol (I love Jose Cuervo Traditional). There were lots of different activites to do at the pool and a variety of music for every kind of taste. I was especially loving the morning relaxation music!!! There are a great choice of restaurants and Fuego was one of my favourites as well as the Tapas at Gabi Club (especially the coconut shrimp). We have to give a big shout out to Carlos (charlie) the manager from Gabi Club, this guy works so hard and he treated us like royalty, he brought us the different foods to try out and his english was amazing (as was so many other staff members). We spent a lot of our evenings in Gabi Club so we got to know him pretty well and he rocks!!! He also told us what was best to do around the area and he recommended Coco Bongo (wow). Thanks Charlie :) So many other staff memebers were awesome and I wish we could remember all of their names, to name but a few, Mario from front desk, Karen from the restaurant, Edwin the butler (I could just hug you) and so many more who made our trip so pleasant. Please remember to tip the staff, these guys are not making lots of money (I know this because I have worked in the hotel business before in different countries) and they also work their butts off! It is just nice to tip someone if they have helped make your stay that little bit more pleasant. In the end I will be recommending this resort and I will be back.", "Date": "March 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Surrey, Canada", "Title": "\u201cThis Resort is Paradise\u201d", "Author": "jowels10", "ReviewID": "UR126527663", "Content": "Most of the reviews I read on here I found were useful, except I always wished I knew more about the people who wrote them. If you're a 80 year old couple, a review written by an 18 year old probably isn't going to be very relevant or useful, and vis-versa. I travelled for a week in late march with my girlfriend. I am 34 years old and would consider myself an active person, who's a social drinker, and enjoy hanging out with family friends on a regular basis. I've worked and partied in night clubs growing up and have outgrown the need to act like a drunk 19 year old, but definitely like to have some drinks and listen to all sorts of music (from rock, to hip-hop, to house, top 40 dance and even some opera and classical). I guess me and my girlfriend like nice things (like designer clothes, good food, etc) and the contemporary/chic look of this hotel is what drew us in. Let me start by saying I am not one to ever write reviews, but I was so impressed by our stay here I felt compelled to write one. I've been to mexico 5 times and this was by far the best resort I have ever visited. There were several reviews on here that made me question whether or not we should even book at this resort, but after staying there a week I feel the need to address those poor reviews. There were a few reviews that stated the resort was so big it took forever to get anywhere and took too long to walk. I'm sorry, but unless you have a physical disability I have no clue why you would say that. You would have to be the laziest person on earth to feel that way. I could have crawled from my room to the restaurant in under 5 minutes. This is a 'resort', not a hotel. I'd much rather have it be a bit on the larger side so I don't feel like I'm crowded by other guests. This resort in my opinion is the perfect size. We were on the furthest building to the south and it took us no more than 2-3mins to walk to any of the restaurants (which by the way are located very smartly in the centre of the resort and all connected). Not to mention the resort is stunning to walk through and every walk we had we enjoyed. The next confusing comment was that the resort was too dark at you couldn't see at night. Wow. Really?? The resort does an amazing job of dimming the lighting and setting the mood for an elegant evening. The lighting is perfect, and gives the entire resort a relaxed romantic feel. Unless you're a bat who's radar isn't working, you should have no problem navigating at night time. The next baffling comment was about the music and that it was sedate and spa-like. I'd love to see what these people would play if they ever ran a hotel/resort. During the early morning they play calming, almost elevator music. Which I think is awesome, because who wants to wake up and eat breakfast listening to Lady Gaga. Its also not 'Blasted' throughout the entire resort (maybe turn down your hearing aid).Its played quietly in the lounges, the restaurants, and the pool area. At noon, they do water aerobics in the pool for about 30-45mins and they play more top 40 during this session (LMFAO, madonna, pit bull etc) and until about 4 or 5pm the music is more upbeat (dance, house, top 40). It sets a good fun vibe around the pool. Then for dinner they set more of a calming dinner music around the resort. I thought they did a great job catering to a huge range of people. So unless you are 15 and want to hear Justin Bieber, the music shouldn't be an issue. The next review that confused us was that there were children on the adult side. The entire time we were there I only saw a handful of children and they were in Ghabi Club watching the nightly entertainment (which is allowed). They are also allowed into the restaurants from 6-8pm I believe. So if you want to avoid kids, eat at the Adult only restaurants, or have a later dinner (which we did). As far as seeing children throughout our stay on the adult side we never did (except for one girl who got lost trying to find the 'kids zone'). Some reviewers also said they had no idea where or when events/entertainment were going on at the resort. Not really sure how the resort could make it any more clear - they gave us an itinerary of the events for the entire week (Event, time, and location). Everything was on there - wine, tequila tastings, yoga, shows, dance lessons, etc. If you still can't find something or want to know whats going on, call the front desk or ask any staff member. We didn't do the Royal Service, and not sure we would. We kept seeing the royal service people at the main pool most days because their pool is super quiet. So if you want to be more secluded by all means go for the Royal Service. Other than having a separate private section and your own butler I don't see much of an advantage. You get to eat at all the same restaurants, and get the same level of service. I just hope the management keeps that consistent. The pool is definitely a bit cool, but very refreshing on hot days. Once you dunk yourself in, you get used to it and you could sit at the swim-up bar all day without even noticing the water temperature. Not a deal-breaker at all, however, heating the main pool slightly would make it a bit more enjoyable for some people. The beach is not wide, but seriously, are you running the 100 yard dash across it? How wide do you need the beach to be? You can't swim in front of the the La Perla side because of rocks and coral, but walk 2 minutes up to the la Esmeralda side and swim away. As far as the issue with seaweed washing up on the beach goes, I need to shake my head. Its an Ocean. People complain about the dumbest things. There are constantly workers cleaning it off the beach and short of hiring a team of scuba divers with nets to keep it from getting washed to shore, I'm not sure what you expect the hotel to do. There were also several reviews saying that Playa del Carmen (5th Avenue) was not walkable from the resort. I'd like to get some type of award or medal then, because we walked there....and back! We actually talked to several couples at the resort who did it as well. I'm not sure I would walk through the town (the way you come into the resort), but the walk along the beach is gorgeous. Totally safe and you actually walk in front of a bunch of other hotels/resorts etc on the way. Depending on how fast you walk, its about a 20-30minute walk. The staff at this resort was wonderful. I wish I could have remembered all the names, but here are the ones who I can remember and that stood out. Adolfo at Ghabi bar was awesome. Super friendly and helped my girlfriend find her new favourite tequila (Jose Cuervo Tradicional). Fanny was also fantastic in the lounge. Very, very friendly and takes pride in her job. Wonderful customer service and took good care of us. Marisol at the pool was also great - helped us discover the tamerine daiquiri, along with others. The bartenders at the red lounge outside of Fuego were awesome too...pretty sure I have them to thank for the hangover on saturday. Nicholas at Fuego was also great - very friendly, and great customer service as a waiter. I'd also like to mention that these workers do work extremely hard and do not get paid a lot. Please tip them. Many of them depend on tips to feed their families - If you can afford to stay at a 5 star resort, pretty sure an extra dollar isn't going to break your bank. You don't need to throw $50bills at them, but a dollar here and there goes a long way for them. I know the food has been mentioned throughout many of the reviews on here, but I'm going to mention again. It is awesome. It was one of the things that for us is very, very important. A few people complained about things like the hamburgers not being great. Its a thick juicy, all beef hamburger. I thought the hamburgers were good. It's by no means a gourmet $25 hamburger, but for midnight room service or while you are by the pool, its awesome. We did not have a single bad or even so-so meal. Every breakfast, lunch and dinner was amazing. You will not be disappointed by the food at this resort. If you are, I feel sorry for you. You must to go through life being a very unhappy person and impossible to please. Also, some people complained they didn't like or didn't know they had to dress up for dinner at some of the restaurants. Its on the website. Plus, I think its great. I don't want to be having dinner sitting beside someone in sand-filled flip flops, and a sweat stained corona t-shirt. If you are too tired or lazy to take a shower, put on some pants and shirt, stay somewhere else or order room service. Few tips for restaurants/food: Try the tapas at Ghabi bar. We discovered them on the 2nd to last day. Wonderful for a mid-day snack. Passion is the one restaurant you have to pay to eat at ($40/person). If you go, rather than the tasting menu, have the steak (if you like steak), it was unreal. Fuego - all around great dinner. Bana - sushi was so good - the spicy tuna roll is delicious. The rooms are exactly as you see on the website. Super roomy and clean. Beds are super comfy. Not really much more to say here. We basically slept and showered there, the rest of the time we were by the pool or in and around the resort. There are loungers, beds, chairs all over the place, which is great. A million different places to just relax. If you want a super trendy, upscale, resort with great food and atmosphere, this is your place. Don't come here if you are looking to have a crazy Cancun (Coco Bongo) type party. They have a club with a DJ within the resort and they actually play some pretty good dance music, but not a bunch of drunk teenagers. Its a adult oriented resort (mid 20's and up), and they do a great job catering to that. I think its ideal for couples ages 25 - 50 looking for that relaxing holiday in a great environment. This resort will be sold out by this time next year if it keeps doing what its doing. The couple bits of advice I would give the management would be to have the person working the towel shack to let the guests know to put their towels in the bins once they are done. Quite often people would lay on the chairs, then leave, but also leave their towels on the chairs. Since the staff doesn't know if you are coming back or not, they don't move them, and other guests assume the chair is taken. Once the hotel gets busier I could see this being a bit of a problem. Hopefully this review helped and I would just like to commend the staff and management at the resort doing a great job and making our week there one of the best vacations we have ever had.

They said they offered \"free\" room service with a $5.00 flat delivery charge; however, there were no menus in the hotel room and when we called the number from the room phone, it never worked. The pools are great, but there are definitely not enough chairs around the pool. We went during a relatively low point in the season, so I can't imagine there would be enough chairs during the summer. We spent a few hours at the spa and the service there was excellent, except for the ladies room \"manager?\". She made me feel rushed and very uncomfortable.

I was starving by the end of the trip! The last rant is that their resort is split between a family side and an adult only side- the kids were not supposed to cross over; however, kids were all over the adult side.

Fabuloso!\u201d", "Author": "Wendymath", "ReviewID": "UR126325620", "Content": "We spent 4 nights and 5 days at the Paradisus La Perla (Royal Service) in late February 2012. Let\u2019s get the 2 drawbacks out of the way. Yes, as others have noted, the streets you pass through to get to Paradisus resemble a bombed village. But once inside the walled resort, you are completely safe. In my experience, all-inclusive resorts are typically an oasis in the midst of dire poverty. And yes, the beach is off-putting with all the rocks. Yet work is underway to improve the beach. Nevertheless, plenty of people seemed to be enjoying the beach, the lounge chairs, towel service, and the same drink service that those of us at the pool enjoyed. ROOM: Room 1398 in Royal Service had an amazing view of the ocean. For us, being higher up was a better deal than the swim-up rooms which offered only a view of the mangroves. Everything about the room spelled luxury: comfortable bed and pillows, luxurious linens, thick towels, beautiful tile, well-stocked bar complete with snacks as well as a variety of liquor, espresso machine, large shower with both hand-held controls and rain shower head. The safe was easy to use. You create your own code and can change it as often as you like. SERVICE: We were very pleased with the service overall. Elinit was a delightful and helpful butler. On the day of departure, she printed our boarding passes, which turned out to be a wonderful time-saver at the airport. Valet service at the pool was amazing. The waiters seemed to remember everyone\u2019s drink of choice. We had turn-down service only twice, but that\u2019s probably because we\u2019re such party-poopers that we turned in before they could turn-down! We don\u2019t care about pampering that much anyway, but it is an expected part of the resort experience, and the Paradisus folks do it well if you don\u2019t get in their way. Waiters at the restaurants were attentive without hovering. Water and coffee were refilled frequently. Overall, we found all employees to be cheerful, friendly, warm, and eager to please. FOOD: Several of our friends thought the food was \u201cjust ok.\u201d But recognizing that resorts have to appeal to the tastes of a wide variety of people from all parts of the world, we thought the food was good. Breakfast each morning was at Hadar. The buffet was huge offering all kinds of cereal, eggs, meats, fruits, yogurts, juices, pastries and breads. There was a station for made-to-order omelets and one for Smoothies. You could even make a Bloody Mary or Mimosa. We had delicious chicken and steaks at both The Market and The Grill. Probably our favorite meal was the Japanese hibachi dinner at Bana. It was a different kind of social evening as we were grouped with a couple from Oregon and a couple from Argentina which made it all the more fun. The food was excellent including spring rolls, sushi, fried rice, grilled vegetables, chicken, steak, and HUGE shrimp. As Rachel Ray would say, YUMM-O! But if you\u2019re looking for authentic Mexican, you have to go off-site. POOL: The towel game was alive and well at the pool in Royal Service, but there was plenty of room and we never had trouble finding a lounge chair. However, we managed to snag a cabana only once. The best part of the pool \u2013aside from the swim-up bar\u2014was the built-in pool lounge chairs. They offer a wonderful way to catch the rays and stay cool at the same time. GROUNDS: The place is just beautiful. The d\u00e9cor is modern but not cold or sterile. Common areas, walk ways, lobbies, bars, restaurants \u2013 everything was interesting to look at, whether it was seating, lighting, or artwork. The strange metal sculptures (which look like huge whisks) are gorgeous with special lighting at night. Plants are young, but soon the place will be lush with blooms. I like that many of the flowering plants are purple, which goes along with the purple pool towels. Yeah, I\u2019d say we had a wonderful time at Paradisus La Perla.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "yonkers ny", "Title": "\u201cBest Spa Environment!!!\u201d", "Author": "maria g", "ReviewID": "UR126294543", "Content": "This resort from the outside was not very impressive after driving close to an hour to arrive....but once you entered through the doors...it was as if you were in another world!

BUT beach and service needs work.\u201d", "Author": "LS_Boston2012", "ReviewID": "UR126179359", "Content": "This review is going to be long :) My boyfriend and I booked this vacation with another couple. Unfortunately, due to some events, the other couple ended up traveling with their kids, so they moved themselves to La Esmeralda. That made our stay a bit more challenging, because the resort is very large, and walking from one side to another every day was not all that much fun, although it was the only exercise we did all week. However, we got to see both sides of the resort, but I will only talk about La Perla here. 1) SERVICE by the pool and beach is very good. But SERVICE in restaurants can use some TRAINING. They really do try hard to please every single person, and we appreciated that. A couple of times, the waiters seemed a bit abrupt, but it may be a cultural difference, and what seems natural to them, may sound rude to us. I wasn't bothered by it. In fact, I find it fascinating how different cultures interact. (I am Russian, and in my culture, we don't use facial expressions much when we speak. So a lot of people think we're angry and rude. I find that hilarious, because it's so far from truth.) In restaurants, some waiters were overwhelmed when more than 4 tables were taken. One time we were told \"I'm going to be very busy now, but I find time for you.\" I hope I'm not wrong when I think that that was how he translated that phrase from Spanish to English. But still, we understand he's busy, but we would really appreciate him just taking care of us, instead of making us feel like we are taking him away from someone more important, and he's making an exception. In this case, action would definitely speak louder than words. 2) ROOMS are gorgeous and very sexy. Although the mattress was a bit too soft for me, I still felt like I was a princess every night I got in it. It is very luxurious. Two robes and two pairs of slippers await you. I love the fact that the toilet is in a separate room. Huge shower with two rainshower heads. Modern tub lights up from the bottom. JUST ONE THING: the hairdryer is not good. It is in between one of those travel sizes and the regular size, which might as well be a travel size. It is very loud and serves no purpose. And bringing your own hair dryer not only adds weight to your luggage but also shouldn't be necessary at a 5-star resort. The turndown service is great, except it wasn't consistent. Once, no one came in, and another time, we had to remind them. This may sound like nitpicking, but in my opinion, if the hotel offers a particular service, then it should be done properly. I wouldn't care if there was no turndown service at all. It's the principal in this case. 3) POOL is very nice. Not too cold and very refreshing. The built-in beds are perfect and very comfortable. The water level is so perfect that the \"side table\" next to the bed never gets wet. So your drink will never float away. One of the days, there was a pool party with a DJ. Music was INCREDIBLE! I realize that some people may not like that style of music (trance-like) but for us, listening to it outside with a drink by the pool on vacation? is awesome. 4) BEACH is NOT good. I personally like small beaches. The ones that don't require you to walk half a mile until you reach the water and another half until it gets deep. And this beach has the potential to be just that. But those huge rocks are such a negative. I wouldn't care that much if they were only on the shore, but they're in the water! Because of the waves, the water wasn't clear, and you cannot see where the rocks are. Many times my feet would be surprised by huge and sometimes SHARP rocks. Definitely not a good feeling to have. The beach needs FIXING. 5) FOOD is INCREDIBLE, with just one exception. The Mexican restaurant Mole just wasn't good at all, which makes it strange, because we are, after all, in Mexico. There were four of us, and each one ordered a different meal. I can't say we hated it, but we left completely unimpressed. All others, on the other hand \u2013 Fuego (ceviche, yumm), Bana (sushi), Passion (French, $40 extra pp) and Vento (mediterranean) are DE-LICIOUS. SIDE NOTE about Passion: It was my birthday, and we planned on going there, since we heard great things from our friends who stayed at the resort in December 2011. The nine-course dinner was delicious prepared by a famous chef. At first we laughed at the tiny portions, but by the end of the meal, we were stuffed. We were very impressed with the food and mostly impressed with the wine pairings. HOWEVER, what we didn't like is that we were never told that wine pairing is not included in the extra charge. Yes, it is never included in restaurants in the US, but this is an all-inclusive resort, and we are already paying extra $40/pp. When we asked for the wine pairing, we should've been told that it is going to be extra. We ended up paying an additional $100. We did not appreciate that. Also, my boyfriend had asked for a cake to be brought out for me, and it was, but there was not even a candle in it. When he asked for one, he was told that they don't have any. In a hotel of this caliber, you go and you get one. My boyfriend literally lit up a lighter and held it over the plate, so that I can blow out my candle. NOT GOOD. 6) SPA is amazing. My friend and I had massages by different therapists, and honest to God, they were the best we have ever had. The attention paid to every muscle was just beyond satisfying. My therapist, David, was very professional. He was so quiet moving around in the room, that I literally fell asleep 3 times. We also used the facilities - the sauna, steam room, warm pool, jacuzzi. All were great, except the jacuzzi, which was pretty cold, and I'm not sure if that is intentional. 7) GROUNDS are beautiful. Sometimes I felt like I was in a retreat in Bali, that's how serene it is. The relaxing music, the warm colors with an asian-like feel is very nice. There are only three colors - chocolate brown, beige and red. Occasional pop of olive green in the hallways. LOVED IT. 8) ENTERTAINMENT is okay. I can't say it's bad, and I can't say it's amazing. Some shows were great, some too amateur. For instance, in the fire show, the men were really great, but the women looked like they weren't trying hard at all. I would suggest they come up with a more impressive routine. Overall, though, all shows were fun to watch. What I really loved (and this may just be my preference) is that they built a stage right at the South or North Bars or at the Gabi Club. I didn't need to walk to a separate theater to watch a show. Pure relaxation. 9) LOCATION is....let's just say I wish it was better. I think every single person will make comments about this. I realize there are \"interesting\" parts in every city, but it isn't something you want to be in when you're at a 5-star resort. The good thing is you forget about it as soon as you drive up to the gate. The security is so strong, that I felt safe right away. Overall, it is a Very Good resort with potential to be Excellent. The management MUST take care of the beach (both the La Perla and La Esmeralda sides) and constantly train its employees. Otherwise, these things will drive people away.", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bethlehem, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cSadly Disappointed, but it depends what you are looking for!\u201d", "Author": "traveler1932", "ReviewID": "UR126159146", "Content": "We have been to other Paradisus resorts and were interested to try this one at our travel agents suggestion. We have traveled in Mexico several times and were eager to check out this new adult only hotel, rest, have some peace and quiet, relax, enjoy delicious meals and soak up the sun. We had pre arranged airport transportation, waited a long time for our shared van and then had a trip of over an hour to the resort. Stopped at 2 other resorts on the way dropping other passengers off, then it became clear that our driver did not know where the resort was. Stopped at one wrong resort, then drove around for another half hour while he got directions on his cell phone. We checked in and went to our \"Oceanview\" room. We could only see the ocean if hanging over the rail of the balcony; what we actually could see was an undeveloped lot with a fence around it. That was disappointing, but we were ok until looking closer and realized that there were fingerprints on the glass enclosure around the tub, around the sink area and dirt on the floors. We asked to be moved, and Filipe, who was very apologetic, took us to a similar room. Again, we were not happy with the view, but we were shocked that once again, the carpet was dirty,and there was a smudge of unidentifiable brown stuff on the bathroom floor. We were taken to a third room, where thankfully it was clean and actually had a lovely pool and ocean view. We were too late to make a reservation for dinner, but walked into a restaurant and had a lovely meal. The resort is beautiful. Rooms are comfortable and modern, very pretty, has all the amenities you could ever want. Eric, our concierge, was very helpful. Next morning we settled in one of the fabulous covered Bali beds by the pool and were were happy until the pool activities began. We found the music and noise accompanying the pool activities to be very loud and it intruded on our ability to relax and enjoy the poolside. There was no where quiet to go, we asked about paying extra to go to Royal Service which has a quiet pool area, but it was fully booked by a private group. Once the Pool Party began, we had to leave, it was just not how we relax! We went to our room, but with a poolside view, we could not shut the noise out. It seemed that most of the couples were enjoying the party and having a good time. The pool bar was doing brisk business and there seemed to be a lot of shot drinking contests.....we realized this was just not the place for us. This \"Adults Only\" is for young adults who want to party! We left that evening and were very happy for the rest of our vacation in a much more sedate resort!", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cIncredible Resort!\u201d", "Author": "Penguilino", "ReviewID": "UR126139895", "Content": "This is an incredible resort - it's hard to imagine that there's nicer resorts out there. The finishes in the common areas, restaurants, outdoor spaces and rooms are incredible. The food was great most of the time and good sometimes. I would recommend Bani, Fuego and the less known Tapas at the Gabi Bar. The breakfasts were amazing and there was lots of good food in the buffets. We had zero issues with children on the Adults side despite some of the reviews that had me concerned. The pool area was incredible and the cabanas were the best! The service around the pool was great and the servers were very personal and helpful. The beach is only alright and isn't that popular. They were pulling rocks out of the water when we were there so it should be getting better. There was definitely an issue with plant debris washing up on shore and on one day the beach was covered. The water was pretty rough but still warm and enjoyable. If you're a beach person it's not awful and I think you could spend a day there because there are lots of chaises and there is a choice of drinks down near the entrance to the beach that has cans of beverages including beer. There are only a few things I didn't like. Number one were the hostesses at every restaurant. They are very unwelcoming and they will honestly say that they are booked when you can see the restaurant is only about 25% full. We never saw a restaurant more than half full during the entire trip (except for breakfast but no reservations required). The restaurant reservation/hostess issue is a VERY strange one and was common to everyone that I spoke with. None of us could figure out why they were tight about this when they were nowhere near capacity. Entertainment and activities are nearly non-existent, but we were going for a relaxed romantic getaway so I didn't care. The fire show was pretty awesome and that was only thing worth watching (and the only crowd we saw all week). One note to La Perla, the food at the Sunset Grill is not good at all - it's actually pretty bad. Since that's what services people poolside and most people are poolside, better food would be appreciated. The alcohol was excellent, though - keep that coming. Some of the reviews that I read before going to the place were silly. There was no issue with kids on the adult side. If you feel the need to wear to cargo shorts and sandals to dinner at a beautiful restaurant in a 5 star Adults only resort - then maybe stick to the buffets (clown). When I go into the ocean, I generally float and swim and am not going for a walk - so the swimming shoes are not necessary - its mostly a sandy bottom save for a 1 foot stretch at the shoreline. Walking along the beach is great - very beautiful and you can clearly see Cozumel. Yes, the area around the resort is confusing for drivers and there are Mexicans living there. It's not the slums, there are no gangs - they are Mexicans and you are not at Newport Beach. In sum, I cannot imagine a nicer resort. They absolutely have some work ahead with staff and figuring out the restaurants, but everyone working there was very nice and generally helpful. I liked the staff a lot and found them very genuine. I will guarantee that our vacation this year will be about $800 to $1000 less than the same vacation next year at La Perla.

I sure miss waking up and eating fruit every morning. Also, the drinks were awesome too. All top shelf alcohol. The resort also has a ton of different bars. There was not a lot of people at them though, which sort of sucked. If there was more people it would be better. But we still had a blast every night after dinner. We also went to a couple of the show the hotel put on. The decor of the resort was awesome! Everything was decorated really original and every bar / restaurant had a theme. It was sooooo nice. The pools were awesome too. The beach had these bed things which were really awesome too. The water was absolutely beautiful as well. The beach was not very big but it was still really nice and relaxing to go down there. Also, they have a really really nice gym.

Things about this place that are excellent: 1) High end design of the resort. Its brand new and in top notch condition. The building materials are of very high quality, high end decor, excellent fit and finish. Nothing feels cheap or that they have short changed the building quality in any way. Perhaps not on the level of a Four Season or Ritz but pretty close. 2) Outstanding rooms - brand new, I don't think mine had been used by a prior guest. The junior suite I had was massive and had so many amenities, to the point that I did not take advantage of some of them, such as the hot tub on both the exterior (on the balcony) and in the bathroom. My suite had 2 hot tubs, 2 tvs, very nice bathroom/shower, kitchenette, great king size bed. 3) Food was excellent - from discussion among the guests there was uniform opinion that the food was a definite strong point compared with other resorts. It does not rank up there with the best north american city restaurants but pretty close. 4) Gym facilities were excellent and appreciated by many guests. 5) Service - lots of staff that consistently greet you warmly and attend to your needs. Weak points: 1) Beach - while they offer standard beach club amenities like lounge chairs, and drink service, the drawback of the beach - and its a big one - is that the swimming area contains coral reefs. As you enter the water, the first 10 feet are fine but then you hit the rocks and reefs and it is very uncomfortable from this point onwards. After my experience on the first day, I cut my swim short and never went back in. Given the beaches available elsewhere in the Caribbean and Mexico, this was a disappointment. 2) *Overall vibe/tone of the resort*. If your main goal of a resort vacation is to de-stress at the pool during the day and eat great food at night, then this is a good resort. However, if you want a little bit of a 'scene' or something to stimulate you on a cultural or social level - this is the biggest weak point of this resort. A large percent of hotel guests were there in groups of 100 or 200 as part of corporate retreats and sales incentive trips and these folks naturally kept to themselves. So when you deducted them from the totals, there were insufficient 'regular' travellers to create a decent social scene. So while the staff claimed high occupancy rates, the place often felt dead (further to similar comments made by other reviewers). The isolated vibe that the place gave off was also due to its bad location in a sketchy neighbourhood on the outskirts of Playa. In summing up, I would say that while it ranks very well on most of the attributes typically used to score resorts, there was no personality to the place, and it sometimes gave off an empty and disconnected vibe.", "Date": "March 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toledo, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cBeyond compare !!!\u201d", "Author": "watermommy6", "ReviewID": "UR125850113", "Content": "I am a travel agent and stayed at this resort right after they opened in November 2011.

The evening entertainment was unique and varied, but always enjoyable. The spa was completely beyond my expectations - - you could spend an entire day there easily !

The hotel has good facilities, including about 10 restaurants and direct access to the beach. The construction problems that were reported in the first comments here on tripadvisor have definitively been solved. I was travelling alone and my room was in the Royal Service building. The room was very spacious, with a large 2-person shower, a large bath-tub and a big Jacuzzi on the terrace. The terrace itself was very big, with 2 armchairs and 2 deckchairs for sun-bathing. The room was very quiet. Only once there was a problem with a neighbor, which was dealt with immediately by the butler. Food I tried most of the restaurants in the resort, except for the Japanese and for the 2 ones that required elegant clothes, because I had no elegant clothes with me. (Thank you Travelplan for not advising about that despite my explicit question on this matter before starting my holiday.) Food was great in all restaurants that I tried, in particular in the \"Lapalapa\" restaurant which is, in my opinion, the nearest to the European taste. Service in restaurants The service is good in all restaurants. There are plenty of waiters going around, although this gives sometimes a sense of \"anarchy\". Sometimes 2 waiters in a row would come to take my order, or the food would arrive twice. Again I must say that although the service is generally good in all restaurants, \"Lapalapa\" deserves a special mention. Felipe at breakfast and lunch and Karla in the evening are excellent people that take absolute care of the customer and make him/her feel completely at ease. Wines The selection of wines is very good. Try the \"Caba\" white sparkling wine before dinner as appetizer! It's really worth it. Reservations This thing that you needed to reserve a place in restaurants was, to be honest, quite a nuisance for me. Especially when you saw that restaurants were half empty. But what can we do? As I said service was quite good, so maybe the reservation has the purpose of keeping the number of customers within certain levels at all times to ensure the best service. Butlers and reception But the best thing about the resort is the butlers and reception staff. THEY ARE JUST GREAT. All of them. I can mention Elenit and Karen because they were the ones that I dealt with the most. But all the butlers and the people at the reception were always available for all sorts of suggestion and help and would inquire continuously about how happy I was with everything. Critical points I think that the most critical point of this resort is that they are targeting two completely different types of customers: the ones that look for peace and rest and the ones that look for parties. I stayed for 14 nights and in this period I have noticed that the pool by the \"Lapalapa\" restaurant is normally quiet, but people shouting, playing with rugby ball in the water or in general showing loud behaviour are also accepted. Some rooms have direct access to swimming pools. In one of them I\u2019ve seen people turning the music very loud while partying with drinks in the swimming pool right outside the room. The hotel tolerated this, and sent its staff to clean the pool and the grass nearby afterwards. This is in my opinion a very bad message that the hotel gives to the other guests. The message is that you can do whatever you want in your room and the hotel staff will even come and clean. I understand that it is not easy to turn down guests or to tell them that something is not allowed. But you need to make choices. Personally I was very disturbed from seeing people use the common areas as if they were their property or from having to change pool because the people were loud. I think a good compromise would be to define which areas are for partying (for instance the beach) and which ones are for relax, but then this decision should be \u201cenforced\u201d. I think that Paradisus La Perla, which only opened in November 2011, will find a way to reconcile these two guest types.

We stayed on the top floor, 3rd floor, (NOT ROYAL SERVICE) and felt it was the best floor to stay unless you feel that you really need the swim-up rooms which are more expensive. You can see the ocean from there and see the entire pool and garden area. It was a little hard to find your way around at first, as it is a huge resort. The food was very good and we enjoyed the variety with so many different types of food. The breakfast buffet was always good. All the staff was very friendly and tried their best to make our stay as fun as possible. We took the ferry to Cozemul one day (just take a cab to the dock -about 10 minutes-$10 ride). The ferry is $12.50 each way. Just get a one way ticket over and then you can buy your ticket back when you get ready to come back so you can come back whenever you want. We also chartered a sail boat and snorkeled from Cancun to the Isle of Mujeres and took a day trip to Chichen Itza, the Mayan Ruins. Although the weather was cloudy and a little rainy at times, it was warm and the ocean water was nice too. The pool water was cold, but the swim-up bar and bartender made up for it. I would definitely recommend this hotel as there is something for everyone. The LaPerle side is adult only, but there is also a family side of the hotel as well. The landscaping will be beautiful as it is still in the works, this being a new hotel opening last November. We felt very safe at the hotel and in PlayadelCarman shopping as well.

We stayed at the Perla and did the Royal Service, we loved it. It was very private which is what we were looking for. If you want the ocean view but don't want to pay the upgrade request room 1403...the tarrece is HUGE, there is only 3 with tarrece's that big, but only 1403 has the ocean view. I have nothing but great things to say about our room. Bed was so comfy, shower was HUGE, and the nescafe machine in the room was realy nice. 24 hour room service was great. Favourite was morning pot of coffee with warm chocolate cruissonts (spelling sorry). Our experiance with the tempature of the pool water was just fine, not sure what everyone else is talking about....how flippin hot do you want water when your in 90 degree weather??? All the restaraunts were great. Downtown is serioulsy 35-40 minute walk on the beach...it's so nice!!!! Only thing that could be better is the beach. We didn't swim much in front of our resort because it was rocky, but don't worry you have miles of beach front to select from. Also, ALL the butlers are great. Don't go in there selecting one because of post's on here, we did that and realized that they are ALL fantastic. Tip them, tip the bartenders and the pool guys/girls bringing you food. I can't beleive how cheap some people are. Seriously book, you won't be dissapointed. I keep telling my girlfriend that trying to book a trip after this one is going to have to be just as nice of better :) It really was amazing!

We simply loved this resort. When we arrived, we were greeted right away by very friendly, helpful staff. We originally booked a junior swim up suite but they upgraded us to a one bedroom swim up suite with concierge at no extra charge. This was a nice surprise. The bellboy took us to our suite and when we walked in, it was gorgeous. Huge tub, large double rain shower stall, double sink vanity, marble floors, dining area with wet bar, fully stocked fridge, large sitting area, 2 plasma TV's, iPod dock system, jacuzzi on the patio etc. etc. Can't say enough about the suite...oh almost forgot, very comfortable kingside bed with comfy sheeting. The room was 5 star. The restaurants, food and service were also 5 star. We ate at The Grill, The Market, Gabi Club, Mole, Sunset Grill and the buffet and every meal was delicious. The waiters were all so friendly and attentive. The pool area was fantastic. Lots of chairs, bed huts, towels and great service. There were always waiters around to serve drinks and snacks. The music could have been a little more up beat but none than less I guess it was in theme of the resort...zen and relaxing. The pool water was warm not cold. The beach area was okay. Like some of the previous reviews, it was small with lots of rocks but when we were there, we could see staff working on removing large rocks and in time they will have this fixed. There were however lots of chairs and waiters available to serve you drinks and food. We didn't spend time on the beach, as we preferred to be by the pool or at our swim up patio laying in the pool beds. Other positive notes we liked was the decor and design of the hotel. The furnishings, sculptures, lighting, music throughout all areas of the hotel, entertainment at night (especially the fire show), Gabi Club, guest bracelets, lounge areas with comfy beds everywhere, and very friendly staff always greeting you with a smile. Our only complaint we would have was with the housekeeping. The first 2 nights our room was never done before 4pm and in fact the 3rd night, we had to call the front desk at 7pm because it still hadn't been done. They apologized and quickly came to clean our room but it should not have happened. We found that the attention to detail such as not emptying garbage cans,refilling the Kleenex box, or washing the coffee cups was not 5 star and more training is needed. We let the front desk know and the service was much better the last 3 days. All in all, we really enjoyed our stay and would love to come back again. We've stayed at many all-inclusives in Mexico and the Caribean including the Paradisus in Punta Cana and this by far was the best one we've stayed at. They're opening another Paradisus in Costa Rica in 2013 and if it's anything like La Perla, we'd like to go there as well.", "Date": "February 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toledo, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cGreat place with great staff\u201d", "Author": "billc6660", "ReviewID": "UR125407481", "Content": "Mario at the Front Desk Fernando in charge of dinner reservations Gabrielle who works at the adult pool were all wonderful!

We had a swim up suite which was great, Double shower and a big tub. The bed was very comfortable as well. Everyone was super friendly, guests and staff. The Pool was amazing. The alcohol is all top shelf and the food was great as well. The decor is very modern and cool and the ability to chill out on beds/love seats just about anywhere on the resort, helps to keep the mood relaxed. Staff was super cool, especially Rajiv, Aaron and Ivan. They helped to make the trip even better. With all that said, the only major drawback is the beach. Its not as nice as many of the other beaches i have been to in the Caribbean. Its is very small and not very clean (lots of garbage) I love hanging on the beach when i go away, but this time i stayed by the pool all day. Again, the pool is awesome and it wasn't a bad experience at all, but being a beach bum, i usually choose beach before pool. The internet wasn't always consistent. You would have to try and connect and reconnect several times before getting a stable connection and it may only last 10 minutes at times, but really you shouldn't need to be online, if you are on vacation. Some people complain about the surround area. While not super easy on the eyes, it was not unsettling at all. I did not feel in danger at any point during the vacation, whether on the beach or in town. Finally my last suggestion is, you need to go to Coco Bongo! It is a one of a kind experience. Its not just a dance club, but the shows that go along with the music and dancing is a site you have to experience if you are in Playa del Carmen!", "Date": "February 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cA Real Gem in Playa del Carmen\u201d", "Author": "KraemerInDallas", "ReviewID": "UR125263565", "Content": "Visited on a business trip with over 100 of my co-working friends and spouses. We had several meetings during the day but ample time to enjoy the food, the pools, and spa in-between. We enjoyed our One Bedroom Swim-up Suite directly across from the main pool bar. If you have the option, swim-up is certainly the way to go. So nice to change into your suit, step out to your patio and down into the pool. Not all swim-up rooms have access to the main pool, but ours did. Be sure to ask if you want access. Jacuzzi tub on the patio was nice. It does take 15-20 minutes to fill and will empty just as quickly if you leave it not running. So, plan accordingly if you're wanting to enjoy the tub. We were part of a very large group, at least 200 of us in total. I'm over 40, but it felt like a high school trip or spring break - we already knew just about everyone in the pool. The restaurants were fine. Probably not places I would go out of my way for, but considering they were all-inclusive the quantity more than made up for the average quality. Regardless if you have reservations for services or not, do take advantage of the Yhi Spa. On our last day, we had to check out at noon but our bus didn't pick us up until 2PM. So, my wife and I had lunch by the pool, then visited the spa to swim in the bubble pool and relax in the hot tubs. After an hour or so of relaxing, we were able to shower in the comfortable changing rooms and change into clean clothes for the trip home. A great ending to a wonderful stay. If you need a tourist-fix to feel like you're actually spending time in Mexico, we also highly recommend the Selvatica zip-line / cenote trip, and taking a $10 taxi ride down to 5th Ave and Constitution in Playa del Carmen. There you'll find all the shops and nightspots in town, as well as the public beaches that have an amazing view of Cozumel and the Caribbean Sea. Folks complaining about the road in probably haven't been to Mexico before. The neighborhood is not the same standard of living that guests at La Perla are accustomed to, but they are not horrible slums either. It's a working-class area that's actually showing signs of growth and improvement with new residences being built surrounding the resort.", "Date": "February 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cPoor Ocean views with dirty Beaches and a Beautiful Web Site misleading.\u201d", "Author": "dw2360", "ReviewID": "UR125144402", "Content": "Do not recommend .

From arrival and an offering of Cava to departure, everyone at the resort went out of their way to accommodate us. We had an Oceanview Royal Service Suite with Edwin as our butler. He was wonderful, and no request was too much, down to bringing me milk for my morning Nespresso. Yes, the rooms have their own Nespresso machines. The Royal Service Lounge, is so beautiful and comfortable. It is stocked throughout the day with snacks and drinks. Poolside with Arturo was also such a treat. He brought water and drinks throughout the day (it must be 5 o'clock somewhere!). On a couple of days we even had lunch brought poolside. Delicious. Also, check out Jose's poolside concoctions. He was so much fun to watch and obviously loves what he's doing. We didn't eat at any of the buffets, but they did look plentiful and good. The Royal Service restaurant, La Palapa was a treat for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The waitstaff all work hard to please and by the end of the week know you by name. We had dinner twice at Fuego. Don't miss their different ceviche's and great veal chop. Wonderful servers there. Also had dinner once each at Mole and Vento. Men, don't forget a long pair of pants, a few of the restaurants require them. Last night there we ate at Passion. Very nice presentation of a tasting menu. All in all, you will not go hungry or thirsty! Had a couples massage in the spa. Great experience and very relaxing. The spa is beautiful.

We stayed from February 3rd - February 12th. We are in our early 30's & 40's and think of ourselves as a relaxed, but like to have fun couple. This trip was to celebrate our 12th anniversary. The hotel is gorgeous! A lot of extra detail was involved, and you can tell they spared no cost. Everything is top notch. Here are a few things we wanted to share as other reviewers have helped us with what to expect on our trip. First off, We are not complainers or high maintenance, but we do expect what we pay for, which is why we only stay at 41/2 and 5 star hotels. I will say that 95% of the reviews we read before the trip were spot on. There are dogs barking, mosquitoes (alot of trees), and children on premises at times (Adults only section) For the ones who wrote on their reviews that this was not the case, they probably didn't walk around much, and more than likely their rooms were not at the back of the hotel, which is where you will experience this issue. We personally did not hear anything because our room was centrally located, but while out for an evening walk around the hotel, you can hear dogs barking from the homes across the street so unfortunately for those who had a room on that end of the resort could have been justifiably annoyed by this. Check in: The check in was frustrating. It wasn't a good way to begin vacation. We continually had to mention or ask about amenities we were supposed to receive for booking in December, like our resort credits, which to us were pretty useless. Then they tried to up-sell us to a one-bedroom suite. We respectfully declined. The front desk attendant kept going back to talk to his boss about the price. We mentioned that we did not need the larger room since it was only the 2 of us and were hardly going to make use of the room. After 3 different prices, starting at $1200 and us declining, they basically begged us to take it for FREE! This is the part where both my husband and I (both very mild tempered people) lost it! We figured out that the original Jr Ocean view Suite we originally booked were taken and the only 1 room left was overlooking the mangrove trees and some run down house across the street-Not a pretty site, So we ended up accepting the pool view-one bedroom. Just very tacky and unprofessional how they tried to first SELL it to us, then decide to give it to us for free. Very poorly handled and a huge waste of time. Needless to say the day pretty much remained sour. The trip was to celebrate our 12th wedding anniversary and prior to our departure, I emailed the manager of Melia hotels to see if he can add a note to our account noting the occasion, maybe a cake or something just to acknowledge our special day, and that too was not noted after he said they would, So it was a very poor start. Eventually after mentioning this as one of the many reasons we wanted to cancel and go somewhere else, did they decide to send a bottle of champagne to our room, which gave us the impression that it was only because we mentioned it, and we didn't even appreciate it then. Room: The one bedroom suite was nice and spacious but our room wasn't cleaned properly from the previous guest (not that big of deal). The shower knob was broken and our AC wasn't working properly so add this to already went wrong!! By now, we were just pretty sad and wanted to leave. Keep in mind this was not a 5 day trip; we were stuck here for 10! We discretely contacted a manger to check into the cancellation policy. The guest service rep apologized and wanted to try to make us happy. We were always calm, respectful and hopeful, but they just didn't seem organized. He told us he would get back to us in 2 hours with an answer. We waited\u2026 No answer. The next day we contacted someone else, and they too assured us they would get back to us, still no answer! On day 3 we had to re-explain everything to a different person. Our travel agent stepped in and she spoke to yet another person. We felt bad because we did not want to come off as a problem. Even when speaking to other guest we met, we never complained or spoke badly of the resort. We didn't even mention the issues we were experiencing. Eventually someone did get back to us on day 4 to explain that their cancellation policy would be the whole stay. Obviously we weren\u2019t going to take that loss, so we stayed and made the best of it. We met some really nice people and tried to have a good time and put it all behind us. Staff: ALL excellent. We never came across a rude person. Maybe busy, or not as attentive in some places, but on certain days, they had large groups to tend to so we were mindful of that. Everyone always asked how our vacation was, and if there was anything we needed or wanted. Pool: The pools are COLD! However, the temp's were pretty high when the sun was out in full blast so the water is refreshing then, and it warms up later in the day. The pool is gorgeous, and have cool beds you can sunbath or relax on while in the water. The swim up bar doesn't get overly crowded but depends much on groups. \u201cMiguel\u201d from the pool bar was amazing!! Such a sweet person, and the service around the pool area in general was excellent! These people really go out of their way to make sure you are happy. They certainly made up for a lot of the bad experiences we had at first. Pool/Activities/Music: There are basically no pool activities. They have water aerobics everyday around noon (with \u201cIvan\u201d, who is energetic and fun), and salsa lessons at 4pm. The music for aerobics and salsa is fun and \u201cupbeat\", however, the music at the hotel and pool in general are very relaxing, but by noon they should change it up. It is pretty boring and dreary. Cheesy remakes of Madonna songs and other artists. Everyone complained about this. On Friday\u2019s they have a pool party. Music is good for the pool crowd and was pretty fun. There are plenty of bars inside the hotel too. You can always get a drink or relax in the lobby area where they have nice/clean sofa\u2019s and beds. \u201cMauro\u201d at South Avenue bar makes awesome drinks. When we wanted to try different drinks, he always created something nice and tasty for us. Royal Service: We did not upgrade because we didn't think it was necessary. While booking this trip, it was offered to us for $400 dollars extra but just thought it would have been a bit much having a butler especially since we wouldn't know what to ask for aside from dinner reservations? What we did not like about this \u201cExclusive section\u201d was the class distinction. Some of us who paid the same money to stay at this resort (which was not cheap) were treated differently. Everyone had to wear bracelets. The color of your bracelet tells the waiter and hotel concierge when you arrived, and what \u201cclassification\u201d you are in. We noticed a few times that royal service guest were approached by restaurant managers and waiters first, and checked how food/service was and if they needed anything. They have a heated pool also, which is nice but most of the royal service crowd was by the main pool during the day. They do have a secluded section, so the fact that some reviewers wrote they didn't see things such as children on premises, was probably due to the fact that they stayed in their section. Just really hit or miss with this place. But can respect why some may have not had any issues at all. Too many inconsistencies. General info: The lighting is very dim throughout the hallways, and it is easy to get lost first 2 days there. It is humongous. The marble floors are slippery. We met a lady who sprained her ankle walking back to her room from the pool. The beach isn\u2019t much to be desired whether you\u2019re in royal section or not. It\u2019s very short, rocky and dangerous if not careful but nice to lie out and enjoy some quiet time away from the pool. Food: food was great! We are not foodies, so we really can\u2019t judge some of the restaurants we did not like, but tried all of them. Our personal fave was BANA. They have 3 sections. One of them is a hibachi style dinner. Awesome and entertaining, a must try. We ate there 4 times. The buffet at breakfast is great too. They have plenty for all types of people, even the health conscious. For lunch the \u201cMarket or Grill\u201d are great. They have a nice salad bar and plenty of options for lunch. Gym: nice sized gym. Have about 3 elliptical trainers, a few treadmills, free weights, and spin bikes. They have classes in morning, and evening (yoga & Spin). Did not use spa but heard good things from others who did. Tips: We know it is all-inclusive, but these people work HARD, and take home in a month what some in the states make in a few days work. It doesn't hurt to tip a few dollars, and they appreciate it so much. For every 2-3 drinks, we always left a few bucks to say thank you. Regardless of this fact, the service never wavered for those who did not tip. If it did, maybe that is because some were rude to them, which we even noticed at times. Overall we had a relaxing time. We will not be returning to Paradisus. We get one good vacation a year and there are plenty of great hotels to chose from. Don't pay attention to the weather reports, it will drive you crazy! It did rain more than usual (for Mexico), but overall sunny most days!

Staff was awesome and was always looking for a way to please.. The room , was outstanding . we had a 1 bedroom suite in section A ,overlooking the pool and out to the carribean.,. now the shore line is not visible as they have left a bumper of native jungle between the property and the beach, but the beach was a quick walk down a wooden bridge and walkway. awaiting is the staff mixing drinks , providing towels and beach food service.

Overall it was well worth the premium price and I would likely consider revisting them on our next trip to the Cancun area. A couple of recommendations. for the transfer we used USA Transfers. $102 for 2 ,round trip, not shared., so no stopping at other hotels on the way in or out.. Even though it was all inclusive, we tipped which was very much appreciated by the staff. Bring dollars ,, small denominations..

We did find the layout of the front desk and restaurants confusing at first and it took several days to find our way around. But no worries - we were on vacation and made an adventure out of it. A better map and a few more directions on where and how to eat and make reservations would be great. We never had a bad meal - the variety of restaurants was great - so we didn't have to eat buffet style everyday, therefore we never tired of the food. Wow I love fresh fruit. We ate lunch poolside at the Sunset grill nearly everyday and absolutely loved our hard working waiter Jorge. We participated in some of the hotel activities and Isreal and Ivan did a great job getting us to try new things or entertaining us by the pool, beach volley ball, dancing etc. We loved watching the evening shows - the mayan and fire dancers were amazing and dancers in the Gabi club did an awesome job. We didn't dance as the music felt a little to young for us - maybe mix in some 70's and 80's for those of us in our 40's. I think as this new hotel works out the kinks they will start to serve alcohol in plastic glasses at the club as those over-indulgent dancers - kept droppping their glasses outside in the sand and on the dance floor. Wear your sandals! The white sand beach was wonderful. The waiters and waitresses have a tough job walking through the sand all day. They need golf carts or something to make their job faster and easier and safer for them in the heat. I couldn't believe the garbage that was buried in the sand or that washed up on shore - I think the hotel could take a little more time and be sure to keep the beach cleaned up of garbage and weeds throughout the day.

The first small surprise about this resort is that the road to enter this hotel is not complete. Not a big deal but it made me wonder what else isn't finished at this hotel? I arrived in the lobby and was greeted by the clerk and offered a drink. Just scanning the area around me looking into the hotel it was really modern, very clean, but also very dead, yet we were told this hotel was fully booked. I was surprised not to see people having fun and for that matter people in general. We checked in and were escorted to our room which again was very modern, well appointed with a beautiful two person rain shower, huge tub and cool blue LED lighting. Another little surprise was the pictures of the suites showed what appeared to be a salt water tank over the beds, this is merely a backlit photograph. A silly assumption on my part I guess. I also found it strange that the rooms do not have a clock. After the bellboy closed the door behind him I heard a huge crash from near the doorway. I ran over to find a glass framed piece of artwork on the floor. After looking at the frame I noticed the hooks did not line up with the frame, so I hung it back on the wall and reported it to the bellboy. I decided to then turn the TV on to see the weather for the week only to discover the batteries in the remote were dead. I know these are minor details but they all add up to your experience. My girlfriend and I being early thirties decided to wonder down to the bar area to see what was happening at 10:30pm on a Friday night. Walking through the main pool area we found the resort to be well laid out, beautifully lit up with LED lights and modern art sculptures that did fit the theme. As we entered into the entertainment area of the hotel we noticed that hardly a soul was around, the bars were open but echoing throughout was this kind of mellow contemporary music like you would play when doing yoga. We kind of looked at each other wondering what the hell have we got ourselves into, a fun all inclusive vacation or a serenity spa? We each had a drink at the bar and decided to call it a night, a little disappointed but willing to give the place another chance. We retired to our room which has an amazingly comfortable king size bed and to sleep we went. In the middle of the night I decided to use the bathroom, keeping in mind that the toilet is in its own completely separate room to the bathtub,sinks and shower which I find a little odd. Trying not to wake my girlfriend up I carefully sneak out of bed and into the toilet room. Keeping in mind it is 2am, the room is pitch black and I gotta go. I flip the switch and nothing. So I feel around in the dark at other switches and find the only other switch possible. Unfortunately it turns every light on in the room including blue LEDs, potlights, under valance lights, and of course the bathroom light like a comedy show. Now my girlfriend is pissed, I quickly do my business and decide that there must be an electrical engineers lighting manual for this room as there are three sets of master switches located all over the room. Day two arrives we wakeup about 9am and open the blinds to the balcony of our room. We have the junior tropical suite with a very partial ocean view along with a rubble filled field with wild dogs and a wonderful view of the Mexican slums at your doorstep, believe it or not I had a worse view than this visiting Jamaica. Again we said \"who spends time in their room anyway\" lets go out and see what this place is all about. Breakfast time arrives we go into the standard buffet breakfast where we are greeted by a concierge who is to show you to your table. She tells us to wait while she gets us a table she dissappears somewhere and people are now collecting in line behind us. About 5 minutes of standing around goes by and we are looking around noticing at least 50 empty seats if not more. We just got fed up and went in another doorway got our plates and did what you do at a buffet, get your food sit down and leave. The food was your standard prison issue runny scrambled eggs, moist uncooked bacon and barely edible pancakes, on the brighter side the omelettes made to order were decent. I had previously stayed at the Iberostar up the road and found the breakfast to be much better and they serve breakfast in a bright airy poolside restaurant rather than a dark gloomy interior setting. After breakfast we got changed into our gym clothes and went to the fitness facility which was the best I have seen at any resort. After this we showered and headed out to the pool area. There was no problem finding seating, plenty of comfortable chairs a nice touch are the tiki bed huts where you can lay poolside as a couple. The poolside waiter Raphael was excellent and very attentive, one of the best people at the resort. As high noon rolled around we noticed that the same yoga music from the night before was playing around the pool area even at the swim up bar. We overheard a late fourties couple request some upbeat music the bar tender told them it was against management rules to play anything different. This absolutely killed the atmosphere for us and many other people. I fully understand that people don't want to hear pounding bass all day long but every resort I have ever been to plays popular music between 11am and 6pm. We quickly realized that this place should be called Paradisus El Lamo. As the poolbar got busier throughout the day we realized that they were severely understaffed. There are up to 10 minute wait times to get a beer, this I have never seen at a 5 star hotel. After talking to several other people we discovered there were large corporate groups from the US staying there, perhaps some service priority went to the large corporate events? Finally dinner time rolls around we had made a booking at one of the several a la carte restaurants and again a very strange experience. Like any fancy restaurant you check in with the concierge, who confirms your reservation then escorts you to your table. Here is the problem, once you are seated the concierge does not tell any of the waiters that you have arrived. This was a reoccuring problem at every a la carte restaurant we attended at this hotel. We waited up to 15 minutes just to have a hello and a drink order. I was also shocked to order an item on the menu, crab ravioli which was apparantly not available. This was also the first 5 star hotel that did not offer lobster at any of its restaurants. I found the service atrocious and almost felt that the waiters were somehow helping out in the kitchen as they would disappear for extended periods of time. Three a la carte dinners during my stay were offered with only one alcoholic drink and water service and then you are forgotten. In my eyes this is where this hotel really is very weak, this is what people remember. To get back to a more positive note, as the week dragged on things did get better. They sent a different, more experienced bar tender Philberto \"Dr. Phil\" who was a hit with the guests, funny enough he came from Iberostar Hotels. Thursday night they had a fire show for entertainment which was excellent, then opening the main bar at the back of the hotel with a dance crew and a dance party and dj. Finally they breathed some life into this place. I might add that they should not have closed this dance area at 11pm and moved to the Red Lounge. They went from over 100 people dancing to five once they moved to the Red Lounge not to mention the Red Lounge sucks and should be converted into a storage room. Friday, the day we were leaving they brought in a Brazilian drum/dance team to the pool area and really got the pool area hopping with the right atmosphere. These two last days were the saving graces for us for this place as there were too many negatives in our equation. I hope they take this review and take the good and the bad to fine tune for future guests. Paradisus is a big name hotel and does it right in other places like the Dominican just not in Playa Del Carmen.

We wanted the phone so our daughter could call if she needed us. If we used that phone to call our butler, it always sounded like he had just woken up.

We had requested someone to come take a look but the comment we got was \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t spray the water\u201d.

We spent 2 hours doing this and didn't receive as much as an apology when the resort realized their mistake. 4. Our friend slipped and fell in the shower (due to the faulty construction). While falling he injured his leg and broke one of the doors. The resort told him that he had to pay for the door which cost in excess of $1,000.

The room was beautiful and spacious. The bed was extremely comfortable. Everything was spotless. The food was probably the best of any AI we have stayed at. We normally do not stay at resorts that require reservations as we don't like to be on a set schedule but the food really made up for it. Every meal we had was outstanding w the exception of a cheeseburger my husband had at La Palapa. We did the tasting menu at Passion. It was a wonderful experience. Fuego was outstanding too. The service all around the resort was very attentive. I have found this to be true at every resort I have stayed at in Mexico. Truly the hardest working / sweetest people. The resort is very swanky with a South Beach vibe. It's especially beautiful at night. There is a lot of really great lighting around the resort, Especially Gabi Club and Red Lounge. The martini's at M Bar are unique and exceptionally good with fresh ingredients. We had a lot of fun sampling them. I knew going in that the beach wasn't the greatest which I'm ok with as we are pool people.My complaint though is that you cannot see the water from the pools or any of the restaurants. The main reason I am not giving La Perla five stars is because of the Superbowl. We go away the same week every year and it's always for Superbowl Sunday. Every resort had a Superbowl party ( SMB, EPM and the former Secrets Sanctuary Cap Cana in DR to name just a few). We have never had to pay extra for them. La Perla charged us $50! Very similar setup as the others ( beach lounger & BBQ, big screen on beach). What's even worse is my husband ordered buffalo wings and a red bull and they wanted to charge extra for that! He told them to forget it. The cushions on our lounge chair were soaked and even though we put towels down our backsides were soaked all night! Very uncomfortable feeling. A true 5 star would not have charged extra. There's not much going on at night but the belly dancing show was really good. Not sure I'd return but I rarely return to the same resort twice.

This was our 8th time to the PDC area and we have stayed in a different hotel each time. This hotel will very shortly be battling it out for first place w SMB. Check-In: We booked \"Luxury Jr. Suite, Royal Service\", we discussed w our travel agent on whether or not to book the oceanview and take our chance of being able to upgrade, we decided to take our chance. When we arrived we where carted off to the royal service lobby and Ava checked us in, we actually had to ask her before she gave us our room key where the room was located and if we could upgrade to a room with an oceanview, we really wanted an oceanfront, one was not available for that night but one would be for the next night, so she allowed Edwin our butler to take us to see both rooms and we could decide, Edwin said, i'm not even going to take to the other room, because the second room is much better with a better view of the ocean. He was right, we had a south facing room, which was close to the front east end of Royal Service building, view was incredible of the mangrove directly to the south and the ocean to the east, I bet the sunset from this room was incredible...but we decided we really wanted that oceanfront room, so we used out $400 updgrade coupon and paid another $400 to get what we wanted. The next day we put our bathing suits on went to the beach and about 3 hours later Edwin came to find us to take us to our new room, he'd already moved out suitcases for us!!! The room was beautiful, the view was just what this landlocked girl needed. Rooms are just as they appear in the pictures so no surprises in the rooms. Pool: I will only comment on the one I used...The Royal Service Pool is HEATED FOLKS!!!!!!!!!! Since we are from Colorado I'm not much of a pool person, but I did use the pool and can verify that it is heated, because I got in it! Other guests confirmed it saying the regular pool was much colder! They have these power showers that shot high intensity water out, which were awesome to get those kinks out of your neck and head from the previous night of fun! Arturo the main server at the Royal Service bar is fun and even though we didn't spend more than an hour with him a day he made sure to say hello to us in the morning on our way to the beach and would get us our afternoon drinks when we headed to the pool! REALLY AWESOME. Beach: This beach is NOT like the beach at Secrets Maroma, but this beach is beautiful, it has everything you just might have to get out of your chair and walk it to see all that is has to offer, the La Perla side is the coral side, so it is nice on clear days to walk in to your ankles and see what there is to see, the swimable beach is located on the Esmeralda side! For the life of me I can't complain about it...again I'm landlocked so the ocean to me is beautiful! We spent everyday on the beach! Service could be a little better on the beach, but honestly there we maybe 6 couples on that big beach so I understand why they aren't there, there is no one to serve, but once we did get service, which really NEVER took too long, they were very attentive. They will serve food on beach as well as drinks. Restaurants: I'm not a good person to give a full on review of the food, because well it's resort food. It was good don't get me wrong...just going to the area as much as we have...it's kinda all the same! The service however was incredible, except for one night...but that didn't bother me as much as it did my husband...took 2 plus hours for dinner, I think our waiter was a touch overwhelmed. Service: I can't begin to tell you how impressed I was with this aspect of this resort...we didn't have to worry about ANYTHING Edwin took care of it! He treated us to not one but TWO nights of filling our tub with rose petals, champagne and chocolate covered strawberries, the topper... we weren't celebrating anything, he just wanted to treat us special. We did meet other guests who complained about their butlers not doing anything for them, but I'm not sure if they knew how to use this service. We were given a phone that we could use to call him on and he would make sure to take care of any needs or issues. EDWIN YOU ARE SIMPLY THE BEST!!!! Spa: Beautiful we had two treatments each and we used our coupons...the spa and water circuit were lovely we enjoyed them two days in a row! Prices are typical for a resort, you get what you pay for and I didn't mind paying for it here. Oh and on a side note, there were some reviews stating children being on the La Perla side, well we were there for 7 days and the only time we encounter the little minions was when we were in the common areas. In all this resort tops the past resorts we've been too! I have pictures and would post but they are in the wrong format...PM me and I will send you a link to them.

We had upgrade to Ocean view prior to departure. The room was exactly as per the web & youtube, and the view of the Ocean from this room was great. It also overlooks the Royal service Pool. As a Brit, we are not used to tipping unless we get exeptional service, then only restaurants Spa staff hairdressers and the like. We normally work on a percentage basis, so found it difficult to know what to do at an all inclusive resort. We were given different advice from different people. I did notice that the more often you tipped the better service you seem to get, though I guess that is natural. So if you tip one dollar each time you got served food at the pool, you get better service that if you tip say ten dollars at the beginning of the week, then not tip each day. Unfortunately they hadn't got the Royal service Butler service quite right, with a great variety of standards of the Butlers, and seemed pot luck as to which one you got. They varied from never seeing or hearing from them, to Edwin who we stole during our second week, who made a point of finding us around the pool, or contacting us in our room or via the mobile telephone which they provided for us, each day to book our restaraunt, check our mini bar etc. If the Management read this review, then my suggestion is that all Butlers be trained to the same standard. If it were my business, I would certainly consider promoting Edwin to head Butler and have him train and supervise the others, as he made a great difference to our experience at the hotel. One thing I found particularly annoying was when the room was cleaned each day, whoever cleaned it insisted on putting my wifes toiletries and my toiletries together on one side if the sink, each day we sorted out our toothbrushes ( electric and almost identical) toothpastes, soaps we also use small probes in place of floss, which were identical, and they were mixed up by the cleaners and left together on one side. Most annoying. The food in all the Restaurants on site were very good, with a great choice. The Buffet like most Buffets deteriorates the later in the evening you visit, though the choice there is quite good. To be honest we only ate there once, as the choice of restaurant allows you to eat elsewhere on site. However, the hotel seemed very quiet during our stay with approximately 30% occupancy. I am not sure it would be so easy to book restaurant seats if the hotel was full. We stayed in the Adult only part of the complex, though children still were allowed to eat in one of the Restaurants 'Bana' up until 8.00pm. 'Mole' and 'Passion' were particularly good retaurants, though I am told there is a supplement to pay at Passion. We got to eat there three times without extra charge as part of our package as we were staying in Royal service for two weeks. The entertainment was not bad in the evenings in Gabby club, with some versitile dancers, who turned up in various places such as the South bar, and around the main La Perla pool to entertain and get guests up and dancing. The DJ around the pool during occasional afternoons was great entertainment also. Overall this was a great place to stay with friendly staff and reasonable service which would have been better if the Royal service butlers had all of been of the same standard.

We've stayed at many all inclusives in the area, and none compare to La Perla. Here are some specifics, feel free to private message me with any questions. Food - Always one of my most important considerations, it was, for the most part five star restaurant quality. How many AIs serve amuse bouches at dinner? Passion - We were going to pass this by, since there is a $40 per person surcharge unless you're staying in the royal section. Upon checkin, the time share promoters offered us free dinner there for sitting through a 1.5 hour presentation. We decided it was worth it and we were blown away by the tasting menu, quality, preparation, service etc. I've eaten in many five star restaurants, and this was right up there. I ate things I would never have considered ordering, and each one was amazing. La Palapa - Ordinarily only open for royals, but since the census was so low, the regular folk were allowed for dinner. We ate there three times, ordering different dishes each time and loved all of it. This restaurant is completely outdoors, (thatch roofed) and the atmosphere was wonderful. Favorites-scallop appetizer, risotto, seabass, chocolate ingot Fuego-latin fusion- ask to sit outisde on the terrace - we had it entirely to ourselves the night we were there. The specialty is cevices, several kinds, they were all wonderful. Had a fabulous veal chop, and wonderful halibut dish as well as an excellent coconut creme brulee. Bana-asian- Did the teppanyaki thing, which also included an extensive array of sushi for appetizers. Would have liked to go back just for the sushi. Mole-despite the wonderful made at the table guacamole, our least favorite dinner spot. Firstly because it's on the \"family\" side of the resort, and even at 8pm, there were screaming children running around, and secondly because everything was just a little too spicy for us, despite the fact that we asked the waiter about spice levels and he assured us that \"nothing was spicy.\" For our palates, it was. The Grill- ate here for lunches. Great salad bar, the rest of the meal is served. Grilled grouper, chicken and steak were all excellent. Pasta al pesto ditto. Would not eat here for dinner, too many more interesting options, but perfect if all you want for lunch is a big salad and maybe something grilled? Ask for chimichuri sauce for whatever you get grilled. Drinks-Not a priority with us, but everything we had was excellent. I had wine with dinners, my husband had a martini at the martini bar, a mohito elsewhere, enjoyed them all. Rooms-Loved our ocean view room. We looked over the pool area to the ocean, we could see it but definitely wasn't up close and personal. Didn't care, was a nice view and the room was wonderful. Large, well lit in many different ways, two big closets, lots of drawers, area with a comfy sofa and chairs, great bathroom with double sized walk in shower. Lovely balcony. Pools-Beautifully designed, but not heated. Too cold for me, husband thought it was great for swimming, not so much for standing around in. Not used much by anyone while we were there. No hot tubs was a disappointment. Lots of ways to stay in the shade, not only umbrellas, but small palapas, like giant beds with thatched roofs which were perfect for me. Beach-Not great. We usually spend far more time at the beach than the pool but not here. Best beach was actually on the \"family\" side of the resort. When we wanted to go in the ocean we had to go there. That being said, access to the water was easy and the water was warm and clean. Service-Couldn't have been better. Everybody went above and beyond expectations. One night at Fuego they were out of the sauvignon blanc I had been drinking and our waiter went next door to Bana to \"borrow\" a bottle for me. During lunch at the Grill we noticed a tapas bar next door at Gabi Bar and my husband wandered over to look at their menu. The waiter from Gabi immediately followed him back to our table at the Grill and offered to bring whatever tapas we wanted from their menu back to us at the Grill. We never had problems making dinner reservations, wherever and whenever we wanted. That being said, the resort was far less than half full. Not sure how things might change when it's nearer capacity. Entertainment- Our one disappointment during the week. Would have loved some live music before dinner at any of the bar areas, but the only live entertainment during our stay was from nine to eleven at night in Gabi Bar. Went to check it out once, and it was extremely loud, not particularly good, and the bar was loaded with kids and strollers. Gym-loved the pilates and yoga classes in the morning. Used the elipticals and treadmills, wished you could plug your headphones into the TVs they had around the room muted. No problem getting on machines, but wonder what might happen when the resort is more filled. There were only two ellipticals, and four or five treadmills. Spa-seemed very overpriced, $145 for a fifty minute massage? Instead, we asked one of the concierges to call Veronica's Gold in Playa (got this info from Trip Advisor posts) and we booked massages for $30 that were wonderful. A ten dollar cab ride each way. Nothing fancy, just simple, air conditioned, quiet rooms, and wonderful masseuses. Afterwards we walked the town a bit, perfectly safe, just a little tourist tacky. Ambiance- Just wonderful, very zen. The entire resort is beautifully decorated, with a theme of rods and orbs, done differently in each area but always perfect. Lots of water weaving through the main areas, each bar area or restaurant area has a different feel, different furniture, all totally relaxing. Canned music played throughout resort, which normally gets on my nerves, but here it was all part of the relaxing vibe. Miscellaneous-Loved walking the two miles down the beach to Playa del Carmen. Great walk, no impediments and definitely not dangerous during the day. Can't see what would make Royal Service worth the upcharge. Rooms are basically the same, with the addition of a bathtub or hot tub on their balcony. Yes, they have a separate pool area, but it's no different than the main pool. And who really needs or wants a butler? We had a conceirge to make our reservations. Talked to one couple staying in royal and they said they were kind of embarrased that they had nothing for their butler to do. He kept asking if he could shine their shoes ( their sandals and gym shoes? not really), and wanting to draw them a bath. They really didn't need him to draw their bath, but finally said yes just to make him happy, but then they had to commit to a specific time they wanted their bath to be ready. The royals only restaurant, La Palapa was open for dinner to everyone, and we enjoyed it very much, but all the restaurants we went to were wonderful, if we didn't get to eat there we wouldn't have missed it. Interestingly, the clientele was primarily European and South American, not Americans or Canadians. And the ages were more in their thirties than fifties. The non-American thing became acutely obvious when it came to tipping. We always tip a few bucks, even at AIs where tipping is supposed included. Europeans do not, which is their culture, but a shame. All the staff worked so hard, they deserved everything we left them. Any questions, just send me a private message.

The resort is 100% complete and everything felt so nice and new. We truly felt like it was a splurge. My husband and I went with another couple (all in our late 20's) and it was the perfect place to relax. We loved sitting in the cabanas by the pool and my absolute favorite thing was that the resort was not over crowded. We never had trouble finding a spot to sit and relax and there was always a staff near by constantly asking us if we needed anything - it was almost like having a personal butler service. We did not have the Royal Service and felt like we were getting exclusive treatment. The room was perfect. The beds had fresh linens, everything was so clean and I loved the complimentary new slippers. The dual, rain showers were amazing and we took pictures so we could build an exact replica in our own home. The beach was okay - the sand was really soft, but there is quite a bit of seaweed and branches in the water/on the beach each though they spend a lot of time raking. There was sand volleyball on the beach, which the boys really enjoyed. My only complaint is that there's no seating to watch! The Family Conceirge section is right next to the volleyball net and although the seating was open we were kicked out from sitting there and had to sit on the ground to watch volleyball - seems like a simple fix to put some non-restricted seating next to volleyball for people to watch. Really we just stayed by the pool most of the time so it wasn't a big deal. Ivan instructed the Pilates and Water Aerobics and was fantastic! The food was wonderful - I recommend splurging on Passion - it was the nicest meal we've ever eaten and the 4 of us had a wait staff of 3 all to ourselves. It really made for a special evening. The guacamole at Mole was the best as well! Skip the Grill and try the other (non-buffet) restaurants...they were all really good. The fish was my favorite dish except at Vento get the steak!

Food was great, weather is great, hotel is brand new and beautiful!. Pros- rooms and grounds are JUST like you see in the photos. The place is kept immaculate. Palapas are awesome and the main pool and sunning areas are large and relaxing. Drinks and food kept coming and they were great as well. We hit a different restaurant every night. Everyone went out of their way to say hello and ask how everything was going. They generally seemed concerned if we were having a good week. Cons-they do not enforce the \"no kids\" rules on the Paradisus side, nor keeping non Royal-service guests out of that area. We ate dinner a few times with small children screaming in the background, or large groups of 10+ parents, friends and kids all eating together. And I'm refering to an upscale sushi restuarant where we were dressed up....not the buffet! Between 6-8pm most places allow kids onto the Paradisus side to use the restaurants and vice versa. But several times we saw kids, parents with strollers, etc. walking through our pool and resturant areas during the day. I have nothing against kids, but I went there to get away from them for the week. We got a swim up suite which was very nice, but the water is COLD! You might thtink this is nit-picking in a 90 degree paradise location, but it's not. Our side was in the shade all day and even the big main pool was rarely used by guests all week while we were there due to the temperature. No heated pools, no hot tubs at all on the grounds (other than the spa which you have to pay to use). Ocean seemed warmer than the pools. I would have saved my $$ and gotten a balcony had I known. Beach, nice, but small and dangerous. There is only 6 ft. or so seperating your chair from the water and there are several submerged logs and coral/rocks throughout the beach. All week you could see people stumbling to try and find clear passage into the water. If your going for the beach alone...be forewarned. Outside the resort is scary. It is humbling to see the locals and how they live. We were 'warned' several times to be careful if we went out in a cab and were advised not to walk off the grounds. I'd recommend the resort, we had a fantastic time. I just feel like they should work on improving the beach somewhat and do a better job of enforcing Royal Service and adults only sections. We did have some issues which we did not report to management about a strange sulfer odor in our room the last night, and the noise level from the neighboring rooms seems to be amplified off the limestone flooring. Minor issues, but it did keep us up the last 2 nights we were there.", "Date": "January 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bedford, New Hampshire, United States", "Title": "\u201cThe Best Vacation We've Ever Been On...\u201d", "Author": "Jill W", "ReviewID": "UR123752611", "Content": "Every time I read one of these reviews I always wonder about the background of the person writing the review. Age, gender, how often they travel, to where, expectations etc. So to begin so you guys have an idea..I'm a 24 year old female. This vacation was me, my 26 year old boyfriend, my 28 year old sister, her 29 year old husband, my 55 year old mom and 63 year old dad. We have been traveling our whole lives on family vacations, mostly to the Caribbean. We have never been to Mexico or stayed at an all inclusive resort. My parents owned a restaurant for 18 years so we are pretty critical of food and service. That being said, we are not snobby. We love to have fun and enjoy ourselves on vacation. So now on to the review.... My boyfriend and I have been reading reviews on here for months prior to the vacation. Most have been good but there had been a handful that have suggested there was still construction going on, you could hear dogs barking while you slept, food and service were average, the beach wasn't good, and there were a ton of mosquitoes. We were extremely concerned by this, to the point we almost switched resorts we stayed at. We decided to take a chance and hoped that by now they had it together and things would be okay. THAT WAS THE BEST DECISION WE EVER MADE. We stayed at La Perla from January 14th-January 21st. Here is our run down of our thoughts. We're going to try to cover everything. Booking: We booked the reservation through cheapcaribbean which included our hotel stay, airfare and transportation to and from the hotel. Everything they booked for us was perfect. We had no problems or issues at all. They booked us transportation through Olympus Tours and they were on time for both pick up and departure, were friendly and knowledgeable. (If you use them they were navy blue pants and orange shirts so you can find them at the airport.) It's a 45 minute ride from Cancun airport to the resort. FYI: Don't panic about the drive onto the resort. The main entrance is still being constructed so you will drive through what looks like a very shady, run down area with lots of construction going on. This is no way a reflection of the gorgeous resort you're about to step foot on! Check in: We were greeted with cold towels and champagne. They took our luggage immediately. We booked 3 Luxury Junior Suites Ocean View. We had heard about different problems noise wise depending on where your room was, we requested to see our room. They offered to let us see all of the different room types so we could decide if we wanted to change/upgrade. Mario at the front desk was more than accommodating for all of our needs and worked with us to get us what we wanted. Vouchers: We each got a packet of vouchers for staying 7+ nights. They were kind of pointless. I only used one at the spa that was $40 off a treatment. They had some others for $10 off bottles of wine not included in the all inclusive and one for $$ off a romantic dinner. The dinner was over $300 to begin with and you only got around $80 off. Vouchers don\u2019t help you much. The rooms: We viewed all of the different rooms you can choose from. Originally we were a little dissapointed with the view of our room because you can't see the ocean very well and it overlooks mangroves, as well as has a view of the run down town located directly outside the resort. That being said, we definitely recommend an interior facing room. The pool view is better then the ocean view. We ended up getting 3 swim up suites. They were a perfect location. We could LITERALLY swim from our room to the swim up bar. The rooms itself are aboslutely stunning. They have gorgeous double rain showers, big jacuzzi tub, king size bed, flat screen TV, couch, double his/her large closets and sinks, stocked fridge (beer, soda, water, juice.) One thing we were concerned about is that we wouldn\u2019t have enough privacy in the swim up suite. This was not the case at all. We had plenty. They have perfect drapes you can close at any time. Privacy is not a problem. Wi-fi worked perfectly in our room and by the pool. We never saw mosquitoes and never heard a dog bark. We never heard any construction. We saw a few people doing work on little things around the resort that were no big deal at all. The d\u00e9cor: Sheek, modern, beautiful. Every time you walk through you notice another detail you didn\u2019t before. So much time and money must\u2019ve went into the architecture here. It is absolutely stunning everywhere you look. From colors to design\u2026the list goes on and on. Restaurants/Bars: When we checked in Ingrid, our concierge asked us where we wanted to eat etc. and said she would book our reservations for us. You could only book reservations 2-3 days in advance. However, this created no problems for us and we were able to eat exactly where we wanted and when we wanted to eat without an issue. One of the biggest things to remember, that we were unaware of is that ALL of the restaurants except The Grill and The Market required LONG pants and CLOSED toed shoes for men. Women can pretty much get away with mostly anything semi formal. However, this dress code wasn't always enforced and sometimes they would actually tell you, you needed to change, while other times we'd see men in shorts. I think they're still trying to work this out. However, for the men, it wasn't a big deal wearing long pants because the temperature at night was comfortable for this. Okay, we were blown away by basically every bar and restaurant which shocked me, because as I mentioned, we're pretty food and service critical. Here's a rundown of our thoughts: Sunset Grill: Outside and casual dining by the pool (Sunrise Grill on La Esmeralda). Served great sandwiches and pub style food. Must have: Chicken Wings, Chips & Guacamole. Best guacamole I\u2019ve ever had. The bar here is the swim up pool! We loved sitting at the swim up pool and getting drinks and hanging out with the great bartenders. Hadar: Amazing breakfast buffet. Anything you want from eggs, pancakes, French toast, fresh fruit, yogurt, smoothies, omelets, etc. Must have: Chocolate Croissants Fuego: Our favorite restaurant of the week. It was so good we actually went back for dinner our last night there. Modern Latin cuisine. Must have: Appetizer - Travel the Americas, Soup Main \u2013 Pork Tenderloin, Dessert \u2013 Coconut Cr\u00e8me Brule. If you have a large group request the private room and Nikkolas as your server. Bana: There are three different types of dining here \u2013 Sushi Bar, Hibachi Grill & Asian Fusion. Be sure to identify which place you would like to dine at when booking your reservation. We went to the Hibachi Grill and were as impressed with the food as we were the entertaining presentation. There is no menu here as it is family style cuisine. We had Springs Rolls, Sushi, rice & a delicious combination of beef tenderloin, chicken & shrimp. My favorite dessert of the trip, the Fried Tempura Ice Cream with a raspberry sauce was served here and was exceptional. The Grill/The Market: Great steaks, chicken and pasta dishes. You can sit here and see the ocean over the mangroves if you sit at an outside table. Vento: Greek/Mediterranean Restaurant. Beef Filet and the Lamb dish were two of the best main courses we had. Baklava with caramelized apples was my 2nd favorite dessert of the trip. Gabi Club: Tapas Bar with a plethora of choices. One of the best places on the resort to go for drinks, dancing and fun at night. You can also purchase hukka and cigars here. We didn\u2019t, but I think it\u2019s $25 for hukka. South Avenue Bar: This is centrally located between restaurants. The biggest bar with seating all around it including beds/couches, etc. Large drink choice. They have most of the entertainment after hours besides Gabi Club. A good place to go after dinner or with a group. It is open air, so you kind of feel like you are outside which is nice. Red Lounge: Very creatively decorated, very comfortable beds/seats if you want to lay or sit down. Not too many people were here when we were here however and one night they had a DJ which was just a little too loud and only played Techno. Good service and they\u2019ll put TV\u2019s on whatever you want to watch. M Bar: Martini bar with an extensive martini list. Very creative. It is located between Passion and Fuego. Good place for a drink before dinner at either. Blue Agave: Located between Vento and Mole. Excellent margaritas here! Alcohol: They have all top shelf liquors, including Grey Goose etc, for free so feel free to request it in every drink you get. Their beer choice is limited to Tekati, Sol, and Dos Equis. We both like to drink beer so this was a little disappointing but the Sol and Dos Equis were fine for the week. Room service: 24-7, anytime you want it, for free. I think weird hours may be a $5 up charge. If they\u2019re really busy it can take a while (an hour) We ordered twice late night. Definitely not as good as the food in the restaurants, but none the less does the trick. Service: We can\u2019t say enough about the service!! It was un-real!! Everyone here is working to do whatever they need to do to make you happy. They will go out of their way to do anything you ask of them. Whether you call the front desk, are sitting by the pool, or at a restaurant, your wish is their command. They do everything with a smile. They all seem to enjoy being at work and genuinely want to learn about you. We had 6 people in our group and even with a language barrier we NEVER had one thing confused or messed up regarding food or drink! There are a few people I feel I must mention that stood out throughout the week. Ivan: He helps run a bunch of the free activities they offer throughout the week. He was extremely personable, friendly, fun and was always telling us what was happening where and when. We had so much fun when he ran activities. He was such a pleasure to be around!! We asked Ivan his secret to being so happy and he said: \u201cNo 2 for 1's, no happy hours, life is life. One chance. One shot. Got to make the best of it. The secret is to enjoy it.\" That\u2019s for sure. He knows how to live. Juan/Emanuel: Two bartenders at the pool bar. They were so much fun! They would laugh and sing and dance. They mixed us up all types of shots and were attentive and willing to get you anything you wanted. They made our pool bar experience what it was. Nikkolas: Our server both times at Fuego. Probably the best server I\u2019ve ever had anywhere. We requested him the 2nd time we went and requested the private room. At the end of our meal my dad and boyfriend asked him if he could get them desert from Bana because they loved it so much. His response was, \u201cAnything is possible.\u201d And of course, he made it happen. Could you ask for anything more?! Moises: Server at Sunset bar and grill. He served us when we ate there and when we sat by the pool. He is very interested in learning better English and will help you with your Spanish. He is always smiling and pleasant and working hard. Pool: We read a lot of reviews about the pool being very cold. I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect. Needless to say we spent a significant amount of time in the pool. It was like any other pool I\u2019d been in\u2026.cold when you first get in and then you get used to it. The earlier reviews could\u2019ve been because the pool was just filled a few months ago and it needed some time to warm up. It is large and has loungers with mini tables in it if you want to lay in the water and eat/drink. As mentioned earlier, the main pool is connected to the swim up suites so you can swim through the pool to your room. Our favorite part of the pool was hanging out at the pool bar and dancing on the days they had DJ\u2019s. FYI, Royal Service / Family Concierge have private heated pools. Later in the day we usually relaxed in the private huts around the pool where we could lay down. Extremely relaxing and comfortable. Activities: They offer a series of free activities every day. My boyfriend and I actually had a really good time participating in a bunch of them. We did beach volleyball, Mexican wine tasting, water aerobics (my whole family did this with Ivan after having a few cocktails and it was the funniest thing ever..), salsa lesson, merengue lesson, kayaking, and yhi spa massage lesson. They also offered yoga, Pilates, tequila tastings, cocktail making, sushi making, painting, etc. They had a DJ at the pool on Sunday and also again on Friday. On Friday they had dancers around the pool as well. This was our favorite activity. It really lightened up the mood at the pool and got people grooving and drinking. They also had nightly entertainment when we were there including: 60, 70s, 90s go go dancer party, fire show, different bands every night at Gabi Club, belly dancers, Mayan party, etc. Yhi Spa: Beautiful, beautiful spa inside the hotel. I got a 50 minute Mayan massage and chose to have mine done outside. They have an interior spa and then they also have a spa set up that is open air. It is set up kind of in the middle of the hotel. (hard to explain) but they have a Jacuzzi and pools in this area with water jets with water coming down and music. Even though people can still walk by this area (privacy is achieved through huts and curtains) I chose to have my massage here because you could barely hear anyone over the sounds of water and music and I thought it was extremely relaxing. My massage was amazing and well worth the money. It was $145 to begin with, and I used my $40 off voucher to make it $105. I did tip in addition to this. Beach: The beach, while narrow is beautiful. Beautiful blue green water, soft white sand. The chairs and umbrellas are comfortable and plentiful. They have servers walking on the beach they can serve you drinks. They have a bar set up as you walk onto the beach so they don\u2019t have to go far to get drinks. Non motorized water sports are free (kayaks etc,) while motorized (jet skis) are extra. The motorized were very expensive (kind of a rip off) so we didn\u2019t do them. We got up one morning and watched the sun rise. The sun rose about 6:30am. It was absolutely beautiful and worth it. Some people in earlier reviews wrote about rocks, sticks that stick up in part of the water when you walk in. this is true and you need to be careful of these!! It\u2019s not life threatening, but something to be cautious of! I recommend swimming directly in front of the life guard tower. The water was warm, warmed then the pool and very comfortable for swimming. Weather: Obviously the resort can\u2019t control this, but just an FYI: It was beautiful. Sunny and around 75-80f every day. Pretty breezy our first few days which was actually nice. It poured the first day we arrived but that didn\u2019t affect us much. Temps at night get a little cooler, but very comfortable. Probably 60-65. Off site activities: There are a lot of activities available off site. There is a travel agent from \u201cBest Travel\u201d sits near the lobby and you can book through him. Some of these activities include swimming with dolphins, visiting Mayan ruins, ATV tours, jet skiing, snorkeling, zip lining, repelling, etc. We actually didn\u2019t end up going on any tours. We were considering a combo tour of ATV\u2019s, jet skis and snorkeling, but decided against it. The tour ran about $150 per person. We booked a tour before we went with paradisecatamarans.com. We rented a private catamaran for the 6 of us. I can\u2019t say enough about how great this was. We has transportation pick us up from the resort, drove about 35 minutes to the marina and boarded a HUGE catamaran (probably could\u2019ve fit 50 people) We had a crew of 4. One of our crew members, Steven was a young American who travels all over the world doing a bunch of different stuff. He was so pleasant. We sailed out about an hour, stopped in a cove and went snorkeling. We saw a ton of fish including a sea turtle. We then got back on the boat, had a great lunch, and sailed back an hour. We even got to see the sunset as we sailed. A great, great day with no glitches. (Well, I got stung by a bee, but whatever, haha) Going into town/Playa Del Carmen: One day we all walked the beach from the resort and walked about 40 minutes into Playa. We ended up eating a restaurant called \u201cFusion\u201d (of course recommended by Ivan) it was right on the beach. The service was great! I had the best chicken fajitas I\u2019ve ever had in my life. Highly recommend. We also walked around 5th avenue (the famous street in playa) for a little while. We went into a bar called \u201cTequila Barrel\u201d where they do sports betting. We had fun betting on some horses. My boyfriend and I took a cab back into Playa one night ($10 cab ride each way, about 7 minutes from hotel, negotiate price before u get into the cab) We had a fun night bar hopping. We went to Cocoa Maya, and a few others I can\u2019t remember the names of. Cocoa Bongo is the most popular bar in Playa but we decided to skip it because it was $65 per person cover charge. (granted it\u2019s all you can drink and free entertainment) Playa is fun but definitely don\u2019t go alone. I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019d go with a group of girls. It seems like it can be pretty unsafe if you\u2019re not careful. We also went back one day and grabbed some souvenirs. LOTS of places to shop. Bargaining is definitely possible. Don\u2019t get ripped off. For the most part we didn\u2019t leave the resort much, nor did we feel the need to. Plenty to do! Superbowl: If you\u2019re there during it and want to watch it they will show it at the resort or you can go into town and watch it at Tequila Barrel and a bunch of other bars. We watched the Patriots play off game at the resort while we were there. Okay, sorry this was so lengthy!! We relied on these reviews before we went so we want to make sure others have as much information as possible. We can\u2019t say enough about this gorgeous resort and awesome staff. We are counting down the days until we get to go back. Please feel free to message me for any additional information! Have a great trip!

The atmosphere from the welcome lodge, hallways, lounges, restaurant, our suite and pools was contemporary, calm and serene. Even the music was relaxing. I was so impressed with the friendly and helpful staff. Because of the mangrove preserve; ocean views are limited; but you will not miss them because the entire place is so beautiful. Lounges everywhere and the poolside furniture is comfy and private. The pools are large but COLD. Too bad they aren't heated. The family section is well separated from the adult area; however many of the restaurants allow children whom I would have rather avoided. Very romantic otherwise and the entertainment was lovely. My favorite was the saxaphone player in the North Lounge on Friday night. The food was amazing! If you do not enjoy exotic gourmet type meals; just go to the buffets....but I highly recommend you go 'outside the box' and try their truly unique international style restaurants. The beach itself was clean and had plenty of chairs; but it was very short from mangroves to the actual water. You can walk for miles either direction. We even walked all the way to the shopping district in Playa del Carmen. It took over 45 minutes; but well worth it. We had a swim up suite. Nicely furnished (great bed) but never got to actually swim off our patio since the water was so cold. The service was excellent. Our room was cleaned early ever day and the turn down service happened every night; even if we didn't leave our room until after 7:00 pm. Make sure you bring a pair of khaki's and closed toe loafers if you are a guy and want to enjoy one of the fancier restaurants. They are very strict about the dress code. We were the only 4 people in the restaurant (Fuego) and they still made us leave because our friend wore tennis shoes (he did not bring loafers). They were friendly about it; but we still felt a little put off..... We will be coming back again. We travel frequently and this resort is definatly our favorite!", "Date": "January 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cParadisus La Perla is Paradise\u201d", "Author": "Trucker13", "ReviewID": "UR123205847", "Content": "My wife and I arrived home late last night from our week at La Perla room 1162, and like canwegotothebeachnow said, we will be back. We spent 2 days with canwegotothe..........Hi L&J. The service was second to none. Juan, at the pool bar is wonderful, as are all of the bartenders, and we felt so welcomed there. The Sunset grill has a small but very good menu. We ate lunch and dinner there several times, (order the chicken wings, with a side of bar-b-que with tabasco sauce) just to stay by the pool. We didn't take advantage of the many restaurants like we should have, but the ones we ate at were fantastic. The service all over the resort was the best, no matter if we were at the beach, or where ever, simply fantastic. Our room did have an ocean view if we went to the deck railing and looked left. We could see Cozemel from there but sitting our on the deck, we had a view of mostly open space. The bed was like sleeping at home. Not rock hard like most places I've stayed at. Room service was great, and even that food was very good. Saturday it rained most of the day, so we stayed in except for lunch and dinner. You can access the entire resort without getting wet. Long walk as the resort is huge. My wife and I are already planning a trip for next winter to La Perla, but will get a swim up suite, and we will go to a tanning bed before hand so we don't get fried like we did this trip. The sunburns we can't blame on the resort however. About the only complaints we had are, The pool wasn't heated. We could not locate an ice machine, though there was an ice bucket in our room. The final thing is the buffet food while very good isn't kept very hot, in fact it's luke warm by the time you get back to your table. We would recommend the resort to any and everyone.

We plan to return this summer. This resort really set the bar for all inclusive. The staff were earnest in trying to make our stay exceptional and they succeeded. Our experience with service was top notch. Everyone we encountered was polite, professional, and responded to our requests. Our Room- We reserved a room in the Royal Section and upgraded during check-in with our promotional resort credit to ocean view. We stayed in Room 1291 in the Royal building which had full ocean view. Rooms ending in -90 through -99 are full ocean view. The 1200 rooms are actually on the third floor (European/Mexican way of number floors \u2013 ground floor, first, second, etc). So if you\u2019re checking in and the staff tells you\u2019re on the second floor, don\u2019t worry about the view cause you\u2019re on what Americans call the third floor. The attached pics don\u2019t do it justice as I took them with my cell. The rooms are exactly as pictured and quite spacious. The deluxe rooms are quite spacious and we love the soaking tub as well as the Jacuzzi on the balcony. We\u2019ve had our fair share of beach resort vacations and this room has to be our favorite. It\u2019s very modern and luxurious. Ample closet space and room to spread around. The bath tub is fantastic. If I were to offer one suggestion regarding the room, it would be to have softer sheets. They\u2019re comfortable \u2013 just not to the same standard and quality as the rest of the resort. By the way, we had zero problem with noisy neighboring dogs mentioned in previous post. Royal Service Staff Karen at Royal Service check-in was great. Our \u201cbutler\u201d Sharron was also excellent. Sharron took care of everything we needed, made our dinner reservations at the time and locations we wanted and accommodate changes without any problems. We\u2019ve stayed at other all-inclusive resorts including the Dreams and Palace chains. The Paradisus is far superior in terms of food quality. This goes for the Paradisus Palma Real in DR as well. Restaurant \u2013 The ala carte breakfast and lunch restaurant for the Royal quests was excellent. I highly recommend Passion. This is Spanish celebrity chef\u2019s Martin Berasategui's restaurant. His restaurant in Spain received 4 stars from Michelin. This is molecular gastronomy as its finest. You get one complimentary visit for every 4 nights you stay in the Royal Service section. Non-Royal Service guests additional dinners are $40 per person up-charge. A bargain considering you would be paying roughly $200 euros for the same meal in his restaurant in Spain. We love all 9 courses. Think sea bass perfectly cooked and not oily. Mushroom ravioli with foie gras and sauce. We loved it so much we ate there again. The chef was informed of our return and he created a new tasting menu for us. Awesome!! Passion would be one of our top reason for returning. Juan and the rest of the waiters (sorry I forgot the names) were all excellent without being formal/stuffy. Beach \u2013 Gorgeous bay. And ample seating while we were there. Yes there are large rocks in the beach immediately in front of the Royal Service section. 2 minutes walk south from our lounge and there its completely sandy and great for swimming. The quality of the lounges and beach beds were quite high as well. Gonzalo took care of our food and drink orders each day. He\u2019s fantastic as well. One minor complaint - This has to do more with guests then staff. Guests that are not in the Royal service section still came and took all the good seating in the \u201cExclusivo\u201d area reserved for Royal service guests. This is akin to coach passenger showing up at 7 a.m. claiming first class seats. This didn\u2019t happen so much when we were at the Paradisus Palma Real in DR. Maybe because it was roped off. A minor annoyance. The staff could have enforced the policy but risk pissing off disgruntled and entitled guests. Recommendation regarding reservation. I recommend you go online and join the chain\u2019s MAS Rewards Program. It\u2019s free and there are often great perks including better prices. Also, there were some complaints from other posters regarding bed selections. Their website clearly spell out the bed configuration for each of their room categories. I believe the Royal service concept is intended for romantic partners. There\u2019s the family section and even other bed type options within the La Perla resorts. Finally, we were late celebrating our anniversary because we had a super busy 2011. They sent a lucious chocolate cake and champange to our room and to our table. Loved the cake. We don\u2019t drink champagne but appreciate the gesture all the same. Again, excellent service, beautiful rooms, and gorgeous beach.

This resort opened November 15th, 2011. My husband and I stayed from Dec. 9-17th, 2011. We are in our early 30's. We've stayed at many all inclusive resorts and this one sets the bar to the highest standards! Let me tell you I'm a hard woman to please and extremely picky! I'm in real estate sales and my husband is also in the industry so we have that eye for detail. There was MINOR construction at that time. I don't know what many people were complaining about in some of the reviews. The main board walk was completed that leads to the beautiful ocean the day we left. Other than small landscaping is some landscape beds, they will be done with all of their construction (and I walked around the whole resort, Esmeralda as well!) . My husband and I stayed at another resort that \"was under construction\" and let me tell you... half the hotel wasn't even completed! So La Perla is 99.9% finished! You do have to wear wrist bands (so they can tell if you are royal service or not). You can tell Paradisus really paid attention to every detail, even their wrist bands were classy and even pretty! Yes, pretty! Anyways, on with my review. We were greeted by a big smile and a great glass of Champaign by Marisol. She was so warm and gentle, showed us where everything was. She also made reservations for us for 3-4 nights out, so think about what you'd like to do in advance, if not go with the flow. They will guide you along the way. ROOMS: We originally booked the standard swim out suite and it looked just like the pictures! (No the fish tank above the bed isn't real, ha!) It looks so neat! Nice background and mood lighting everywhere! Lots of storage/closet space ladies! You can tell a woman must have designed it! Mirrors everywhere and even a shoe rack in both closets! (no offence men) . The shower has a nice seat that you can shave your legs on and it's a 2 person shower (huge and 2 shower heads!) LOVE their toiletries! They smelled so good! Even their towels have a special scent on them! I can't tell you that I think the swim out suite is the ONLY way to go! However, if your not big on swimming or laying out, I would recommend if you want an ocean view room, only 3rd or 4th floor. You won't be able to see the ocean on 1st or 2nd floor because of the pretty mangrove between the ocean and the resort. Our first night we stayed in the standard swim out suite! Very spacious and loved everything about it! For this night we stayed in room number 1051. We were impressed by how large of an area there was for the swim outs! Your room for this category has a built in lounge chair in the water for 2! SWEET! This was located in Section D (rooms 1038-1053). One thing I would do differently is to be on the opposite side of the hotel. The Sun in this direction would fade the fastest so we had to move to the other side. Since I have a resort layout to reference, here's where I would recommend you to stay: Section C (rooms 1026-1037). Here you are literally in the center of everything. Right near the bar/cafe and main pool. You can swim out off your swim out and swim to the main pool. So if you like to be social and like more people around, this is your section. Also very quite at night here. Great Sun too! Section B (rooms 1014-1025). Here you are still near everything. Maybe a little less quite. A short walk to the cafe/bar at the pool. Rooms are quiet at night here too. in my opinion the Best Sun if you are looking to get sun! Section A (rooms 1001-1012). This is your more secluded area if you like more privacy. There's people walking by but still more private if you don't want to be bothered. These rooms at night you can hear a little bit of the music from the main bars (Gabi Club) but they stop at 11:00pm. You're on vacation right? Enjoy! Great Sun here too! The second night we got upgraded to a One Bedroom Swim Out Suite! WOW! HUGE ROOM. This had more the of traditional neutral, light tan colors... still very modern (like the whole resort!). We had a small size apartment to ourselves and boy was it a royal treat! For the remainder of our stay, we stayed in room number 1007. We really liked the location! When we stayed there, we ordered room service our first day since we arrived about 2:00pm. Room service they do charge you a $5.00 service fee, but you can order as much as you'd like. Flat screen TV's in all the rooms. We did experience a couple mesquites but we read the reviews and knew to bring spray. We used it and worked like a charm. Just remember your in the tropics so this can happen. No big deal. They actually have someone going around and in the rooms to spray if you request it! :) Such great service. Cleaning service was great every time. This is a green hotel (YEAH!) but if you want your bedsheets cleaned every day just let them know. Otherwise they will do it every other day. FOOD: We are from Chicago and we are big foodies! AMAZING when describing the food is an understatement! We went to MOLE the first night! Service was excellent and I feel horrible since I cannot remember many names! :( Atmosphere was spectacular!) Food was so great! This restaurant they had an upgraded wine list that you can order from for an added fee. You can ask for their house wines if you'd like and they were really good (included in their all inclusive plan)! This was the most upscale restaurant out of them all. So if you have a really dressy outfit, I'd recommend wearing it here. The second night we went to FUEGO! OUTSTANDING! We had to go their twice since it was sooo good! Nice vibe too! This is also a restaurant they require you to dress nice. (There's two Mole and Fuego that have a dress code). Men have to have a collared shirt and pants. Girls, no rules just look classy as you normally do! I wore another dress but I felt was a bit more relaxed than Mole. Fuego they have their own ceviche bar where you can see them make it! They have about eight different kinds! Then we went to BANA. Really good! We didn't do the hibachi, we sat on the sushi side. NAOS- was the Mexican (Gosh I hope I'm getting this right!). Also good! My favorite was VENTO (Mediterranean) ! We also went there twice! You have to try their tomato soup and their risotto! OUT OF THIS WORLD! (I'm not a vegetarian either). We went to the bar in between VENTO and NAOS after and before and met a very nice gentleman (bartender), Carlos! He had such a warm smile. Told us stories of him and his family. He made us the two best drinks of my life! Shout out to Carlos! Sorry we never got to say bye since we were at Mayan night. The second time we went back, he remembered our names! Breakfast and lunch are great! We really liked the grill. (the market and grill are very similar) and haddar and esmeralda breakfast place are pretty much the same). They have a great variety and you'll never get boared! We also never were bothered from families with kids from Esmeralda. They had planned these resorts very well! Anything you make mention of, within minutes they are running to meet your expectations! There was someone walking around with wash clothes during the day to you can refresh your hands/face if needed to! There are outdoor showers all around the pool areas that you can use if you get sandy from the beach. The Beach: The beach is beautiful. Tourquise blue/green water! The sand is very soft and you can tell it was fresh. My husband and I took a few walks along the beach. If you go to your left (when facing the beach) there's not much over there. It's a bit slanted and but yet very secluded. We usually went to the right. We walked actually to 5th avenue. It's about a 20-30 minute walk depending on how fast you walk. It is not that close but if you are looking for a nice stroll or some excersize do it! To give you an idea on how far you will walk, when you arrive at the beach you from the resort and look to your right you will see where it curves out (I think there were boats around there). That is about your half way mark. You will also see other people and pass a few developments and hotels. The other hotels are a lot busier and more of a wild croud. Fun to see! Once you pass this big bar, you go right and take the street up. Bam your at 5th Avenue. I would tour 5th avenue if you haven't before so you can experience it for yourself. Otherwise it's about a $10 cab ride each way. People say it's a different vibe at night than it is during the day. They say if you walk to beach to walk it during the day and cab it back at night. SPA: We didn't do the SPA. But the menu looked wonderful! There are some mixed reviews, mostly all great. You can't please everyone and I understand that. You are on vacation and you make what you make if it. There wasn't anything I would have changed or a service I wish I had. There is a new resort they are building in Costa Rica coming in 2013... We will be waiting for this to come!! PLEASE. . . PLEASE leave a tip. These people travel so far to get to work and would give you everything they can! (They would give the shirt off their back if needed). They say the average daily wage is $6.00 a day. They never expect it but you can tell they appreciate it very much. A little something will go a long way. I hope this review was helpful to you. I only mentioned a couple of names,and apologize for everyone I had missed! LET ME FINISH BY SAYING THIS: Everyone has fully exceeded our expectations beyond belief. This is our first time at a Paradisus resort and will we continue to stay here.

Having gone to Mexico about 6 times in the last 7 years, always staying in 5 star resorts, I know to expect only the best in service. Mexico is my favorite place to vacation mostly because I can count on the service being excellent. Unfortunately my experience at Paradisus La Perla was no where near 5 or even 4 start quality. Let me start by saying that last year the same group of friends stayed at the Paradisus Punta Cana in the DR. We stayed in the Royal Service section, although we were extremely disapointed since, despite supposedly being given priority for restaurants, etc. we couldn't get a reservation to save our lives. We also we supposed to have a butler who was never around except to recruit me for the time share speech. We chalked our lack of service up to the culture since we are used to the high quality given in Mexico. While I was reluctant to book another trip at a Paradisus I figured that it was in Mexico, it was new, so it must be better. No. The exact same problems we had in the DR we had in Mexico. All service related issues. While it would be tedious to list everything experienced, you should be aware of some things that are not clear at all when booking: 1. Royal Service rooms ONLY have a king bed. If you are friends travelling together and do not want to share a bed you are SOL. Unless of course you want to sleep on the couch, which is not a pull out. We had two guys with us who refused to sleep in a king bed. After calling several times (I was told RS had a pull out couch), they were upgraded to a one bedroom with two doubles and a pull out couch, however it wasn't in the RS area and the room was not nearly as nice. I was told that RS was a \"concept\" area. If it is meant for couples then it should say so. I met two other families who had the exact same problem. Also, the \"whirlpool\" on the balcony is a bathtub. It fits one person. 2. The beach is DANGEROUS!!!! There are massive sharp rocks in the water and during our stay we saw several people get cut, bleed, etc. My friend got a huge bruise on his leg from a tree trunk and our other friend got a scuffed knee from the rock/cement/construction debris or whatever is in the water. If you want a calm beautiful beach do NOT go here. 3. They do not enforce the Royal Service only areas nor the adult only side. There were people from other areas of the resort at the Royal Service pool and restaurant and kids on the La Perla side. Whats the point of upgrading. 4.. The butler is a joke. She made her presence when we first arrived and made us two dinner reservations and some tennis reservations and she dissappeared after that and I never saw her again. Also, there were no reservations on the day we arrived, the second night she told me she put us in the teppanyaki room, but we weren't on the reservation list, and we had no reservation for the third night. I spoke to THREE other couples at the pool who also were complaining about their butler and the lack of service. We weren't the only ones pissed. 5.. There was a definite lack of staff at the breakfast buffet and lunch buffet. First, the buffet didn't change during either meal the entire time we were there. Also, we had to beg for coffee, when I ordered diet coke during breakfast it either never came or I was told they didn't have it. I brought my own from the mini bar. During lunch, the waiter came maybe once. We had to order our pizza directly from the pizza maker since our waiter was MIA. 6. The waiter at the RS pool was a very good waiter, however he was overworked due to the lack of staff but tried his hardest. However, when you did order you had to wait much too long for your drinks. My friend ordered lunch one day and it never came. It was easier to go to the bar. While the list of little things that happened could take up pages, above were my main complaints. I will say that the room was very nice and a couple of the restaurants did have good food (not breakfast or lunch). Those were the areas that I can say were worth while. Overall, there are way too many true 5 star resorts in Playa del Carmen/Riviera Maya (this resort is not near town....it is a $10 cab ride so if you are looking to stay near the action this is not the place) to waste your money here.", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cFabulous holiday\u201d", "Author": "gablegirl", "ReviewID": "UR122761391", "Content": "We had never done an adults only (youngest son is now 19) or an all inclusive holiday before this trip and we loved both aspects.

We all went Royal Service which we thought was fantastic. Thanks to Eva and Elenit who organised any reservations we needed for the 6 in our party and looked after us beautifully. From restaurants, to spa, to golf etc they organised anything we requested. As part of the Royal Service you get a private designated swimming pool and a private area on the beach. You also get a private restaurant just outside the building next to the pool and near the beach. Roberto made sure everything was perfect during our stay and almost knew what we wanted to eat before we did. The beds are super huge and super comfy. If you want extra peace and quiet this is for you. We also had a top floor ocean view room - our kids had rooms on lower floors. The Royal Service building has its own bar and lounge inside too. The food throughout the resort was excellent both in quality and presentation and we have never had such wonderful serving staff anywhere (and we were at the Four Seasons Costa Rica last year) - nothing was too much trouble and although sometimes things went a bit wrong, it was due to the new opening and either not enough chefs or just getting the timings right but they definitely tried to do whatever they could. There is hot and cold running food and drink all day, all of a fantastic standard and including premium drinks. The beach is lovely but you do have to go to a clear place to enter the sea, but it appears they are trying to sort that out. The resort is beautiful and I am sure all the niggles will be sorted out in the next few months. On the negative side (and this is for the hotel really)............ The baths in the bathroom are so big that it takes about half an hour to run a bath - they need to sort the water pressure out. Also it did seem a bit ironic that they ask if it is ok to change the bed linen every other day to save water......but there is the huge bath and a jacuzzi on the terrace. The entrance to the resort is not impressive and is right next to the end of Playa del Carmen town and frankly looks really grim when you arrive, and you can see it over the wall. Once inside it is forgotten. The comments other travellers have made about noise is valid - it just depends where your room is.

The pool is so nice and comfortable with unlimited premium booze that we didn't spend much time on the beach. The beach is beautiful, resort has 2 sides La Perla side and Royal service side(private). Share a private bay, they are working on cleaning the beach up, some stumps were exposed but will likely be removed soon. Greenish/blue water...stunning for photos! We actually did a private photo shoot...pics turned out amazing! The restaurants are excellent, all were open but one. Recommend making reservations prior to your arrival, as I said before staffing was a little marginal...but assume this will not be for long. We ate at Passion Christmas Day, it's the only surcharge eatery at the resort $40/person. But this dinner would cost $300-400 in the states. We ate at the tempanaki/sushi(Bana)place twice...perfect experience and delicious. The grill is outstanding as well! There is a night club/ bar we hangout at almost every night, with hooka lounge if you like smoking. Great DJ, and prem cocktails all night. All service was great, our room was cleaned daily. Don't forget room service is included which we maximized, breakfast in bed...ordered numerous bottles of champagne and wine. Late night menu is limited, from grill burgers...sandwiches etc. Service at the pool was nice too... Always had a cocktail in our hand. We met some great friendly peeps there and partied at the pool a bit. Only went to town Xmas eve for dinner...cool clean 5th ave. Overall our experience was excellent, we would like to return some day soon. Some must do's while here: rent a jeep and go to Tulum, visit the Mayan ruins. And def take advantage of the Ocean Photography at the resort(office is next to the concierge desk). Ocean photo will do a private photo shoot for you complimentary, you only pay for prints or DVD if you want. Well worth the DVD. The resort and beach provide the perfect backdrop for these photos. Lastly, make sure you get the room you book, if you book an ocean view...that's what you should get. The Royal Service is nice but we did not see the value for upgrade price. But we heard if the resort is slow, they may upgrade you for a low fee. It's worth asking about.

This brand new resort is trendy and contemporary with all the modern amenities you expect. Both the suites and the public areas are beautiful in a Vegas sort of way. There are glitches as expected but the staff tries very hard to please. PROS - The staff is wonderful. Nice pool area with plenty of chaise lounges and beds. Nice clean beach and excellent service at the beach. Spacious rooms with modern amenities. We loved the outdoor jacuzzi tub on our patio. The swim-up rooms are worth the upgrade. Ample outdoor spaces for hanging out. Excellent gym and fitness classes including yoga and spin. The spa was nice but beware that you have to book your appointments way in advance. CONS - the restaurant reservation system is a mess!!!!! You cannot get a reservation at the specialty restaurants including their signature restaurant, Passion unless you book 3-4 days in advance. This is disturbing since the resort is barely half full! They constantly told us the restaurants are 'booked' but each time we passed them, they were nearly empty???? This was particularly the case at Passion which charges a $40 surchage per person. We were able to secure a reservation at Passion finally on our last night because I complained. There were no more than 6 or 7 tables full the entire evening we were there. I don't understand this. On the other hand, the food was superb and worth the extra money. Food quality overall was OK. It is pretty much what we expect from an all-inclusive resort. This resort is supposed to be adult-only but all the public spaces including most of the restaurants are accessible to guests from their family-oriented resort next door. Nothing against children but we expected adults-only and paid extra for that privilege. The resort however is an excellent value but if you're a foodie or expecting super luxury, you may be disappointed. I don't think it is on par with Royal Hideaway, Mayakoba Banyan Tree or Maykoba Fairmont. Bottom line, price matters.

It was very quiet. Restaurants are great. The food is fanatastic and I urge everybody to go the Royal Service restaurant La Pallapa and to Passion for some extraordinary food. Sushi and sashimi were also wonderfull. Royal Service is great for booking restaurants etc., but they still need to work a bit more on the value they provide. The butler service in f.e. Sandals is more pro-active in arranging for things when coming back from the beach, little snacks in your room, arranging for dinner in your room etc. Although if you ask anything the staff would go out of their way to get it done! If I had to comment anything it would be two small things. First they need to abolish the $5,- room service charge as this is penny wise pound foolish. Second they need make sure that in Royal Service the butlers work in pairs, so that there is 16 hours customer coverage rather than 8 as our butler for ten days had the evening shift starting at 15:00, but the majority of questions are in the morning/ early afternoon.

My husband and I were with our teenage daughters and we all stayed in the one bedroom suite. We were able to close the sliding door and watch separate TV sets and enjoy a little privacy. They slept on the pullout sofa which they said was a bit hard, but we were very comfy! Of note: the one bedroom, when booked on Orbitz, stated King or two Full size beds. When we checked in they informed us that the King bed suites were another class and therefore not available to us at the rate we paid (which was not cheap). So, we ended up with two full size beds, very cozy for my husband and me! With that said, the resort is beautiful. The suite was large with great closet space, a safe, and a lovely terrace with a jacuzzi. The bathroom was generously laid out and the separate toilet stall and frosted glass on the shower and twin sinks allowed multiple people to be in there with a degree of privacy. Bedding very nice quality, towels new and nice, bathrobes provided. Food was great. We are serious foodies in our family. We have never stayed in an all inclusive so we have no basis for comparison, but that tends to be the complaint we've heard for others. This was a wonderful dining experience every day. The breakfast at Hadar had everything you could want. We went to a different restaurant every night (they are all open now) and each meal was terrific. Most notably, the people were incredibly nice. They really aim to please. The service in the restaurants was generally good, sometimes a little slow (it was Christmas week and they were clearly a little overwhelmed sometimes since they just opened) but always cheerful and friendly. We stayed on the La Esmeralda side as we had our 15 year old who technically is not an adult. However, we were able to enjoy the adult side too. They did not give us a hard time reserving restaurants there though I guess technically they could have. I think the goal is to keep the environment more sedate, and there were a lot of families with small children. We were grateful for the flexibility. Regarding the sales pitch for timesharing, yes they tried to pitch us but I shut it down definitively and they left us alone after that. The beach is gorgeous. Water is lovely, sand is perfect. We were a bit put off by the drive in--we wove through very impoverished neighborhoods and, being good liberals, it was disturbing given the opulence of the resort. We found out later that the main entrance in not completed and it will allow access from the main road. This will certainly allow for a better first impression. We would certainly return happily. The design aesthetic is very modern Soho-vibe, which suits us better than a kitschy theme type place. LOVED the whole experience. Though we planned to venture into Playa, with the exception of one day excursion to Tulum (great day) we never left the property in our six days.

Overall we had a great time and enjoyed our stay. I was nervous booking this hotel given that it recently opened and there seem to be so few honest reviews of this property. I am an avid Tripadvisor reader and it is so annoying how many of the reviews seem to be fake. This is an honest review of the property as seen through my family's eyes. We arrived at La Perla and as many have stated, the entrance of the property is not complete so it is not very impressive until you reach the lobby. We booked an ocean view room but were surprised that we had been upgraded to the Royal Service section of the hotel. I was planning on trying to upgrade using the 700 dollars of resort credit but the stress of negotiating an upgrade did not happen and I did not ask why the upgrade was given to us. We therefore had a great check-in process. Our two rooms were adjoining but not interconnecting. Both rooms looked towards the main pool with a view of the ocean off to the side. The rooms looked just as shown on the website with comfortable king bed mattress, nice soft sheets and plenty of pillows. There is a very large tub in the room and a large hot tub (really a Jacuzzi type bath tub) on the balcony. Not sure why the hot tub on the balcony as you would have to fill it which would take a while. I don't think I saw anyone ever use their hot tub during our stay. We were on the third floor and felt the view was nicer than you would get in a swim up suite or on second floor. I do think the best view would be over looking the royal service pool area from third or fourth floor you would see the ocean. The towels were also very nice and large with a separate toilet area for privacy. The tv was large about 40 inches and many channel selections in english and spanish. There was an ipod dock with stereo that sounded nice with dvd player but no cord to connect the dvd to the tv. Additionally I noticed that there was no mattress pad on the bed which wasn't too bothersome to me as we were some of the first guests but after awhile it would not seem too sanitary. As others noticed the workmanship was not the greatest. The sliding doors around the bathroom were hard to close and our kids toilet did not function well but the plumbers came promptly to fix things. I would say that you could hear the person walking above you on the marble floors. Also noises in the hallway kind of echoed but we did get a good nights sleep. The Royal Service was very nice. The separate pool area and restaurant were great and they did seem to give you special treatment. We had a butler but wasn't sure what to really do with them other than to help with dinner reservations. As noted there is NO hot tub anywhere that we were able to find. The water in the pool was a little cold but we did get in at times when really hot. Not sure why they left out hot tubs in the resort. I do think the upgrade to royal service would be a plus but not sure I would want to pay the extra they were charging online for the benefits. As stated by many, the 700 vouchers were worthless and were never used. All of them were for credits towards services. There were 5, 10 dollar vouchers to be used toward a bottle of wine which also stated not to be used more than once per stay. The food overall was much better than we expected, however there were some misses and some really good meals. First the reservation process was awful. We met with our butler the first day as she informed us the hotel would get busy and we should make our plans right away which seemed to go as planned. The entertainment program is poorly explained to the guests and seems to be getting more organized so we tried to plan dinner around the activities. We were then informed three days into our stay that all the places we wanted to eat were booked. This was so irritating as I thought everything was already reserved. After much aggravation things finally worked out so we were able to try all the places we had requested. Not sure why there were no reservations as most of the places were pretty empty when we were there. Fuego was very good for Ceviche and the main courses were great. Even the duck was surprisingly good. Nicholas our waiter was a great person to meet and really made the hole dinner fabulous. Mole for Mexican was very dissapointing. A few good things but overall did not enjoy the meal. Vento for Mediterranean was also very good and our waiter Carlos was great. (The low point was desert. We all ordered the Baklava only to get Cinnamon apples with yogurt) Bana for sushi was pretty good with very good spring rolls and pretty good shashimi and rolls. Passion was a great dining experience. The food and service were excellent. Dinner at Palapaga which was for Royal service was average but the risotto was nice. Compared to other all inclusive resorts the food was much better than we had ever experienced. The lunch at grill was good with great salad bar and entrees that were mostly grilled chicken, fish or steak with a very good chimichuri sauce. Breakfast was at Palapaga or the Hadar buffet. It was generally good but sometimes the service in the Palapaga would take forever. They were always very pleasant and happy to help but a times you just wanted the food to come faster. They had a very tasty green juice but we were disappointed that the orange and grapefruit did not taste fresh squeezed. The drinks otherwise were very good throughout the resort. The room was stocked with absolute vodka, a midgrade tequilla, rum and I think Jack Daniels. There were premium alcohol throughout (Belveder, grey goose, Johnny Walker black, Glenlivet, Don Julio Reposado, Tres Generations , etc.) Most of the mixed drinks were pretty good but it varied by the bar tender or their translations. The service was very good at all the bars. Entertainment was a little lacking. There were so many cool bars that seemed empty. They had a show each night but sometimes it was hard to tell when they were going to happen. They could have used more live music but I think that will improve with time. The resort has a very modern feel and played fairly contemporary music around the pools and at times seemed a little annoying. It reminded me a lot of a Las Vegas hotel such as the Encore or the Red Rock. The decorating and design is very interesting and hip. No reggae or mexican type music except when a mariachi band played in one of the bars. At times I kind of wanted a little bit of a more Mexican or Carribean vibe. But it was a very hip and modern place. My 18 and 20 year old daughters would have liked a little more active dance or bar scene but I expect that will improve with some time. (They did have fun and felt it was one of the best trips). It is a 10 dollar cab ride to the town and not sure it would be a very safe walk to the city. So if being close to the town or to walk in to town is what you are looking for, this would not be your place. The beach was very disappointing. It was narrow and very rocky. There were men working on removing the rocks so it may be better with time but we spent all of our time at the pools. The sand was very soft and white and there were many umbrellas but it is a fairly narrow stretch of sand. As others have stated, there is a very thick growth of trees between the hotel and the beach so you really can't see the beach from the pools or the restaurants. My family wasn't bothered by this but I would prefer to see the ocean as much as possible. The pools however were great. They had many loungers in the pools and a nice pool bar. Ivan was great to get the palapa set up for you. Also there were palapas all over the place which were comfortable and very shady. We stayed in one of these almost the entire trip. In regards to mosquitoes, we did not have any problem with them. I did notice they were spraying for them at night so they may have solved any kind of insect problem. As far as construction. There were a lot of workers touching things up but it was not intrusive or noisy at all. Additionally we felt very safe and did not hear any gun shots or dogs barking but again we faced internally. Lastly, the gym was very small for a resort this size. There were 5 ellipticals and 6 treadmills for a resort of almost 1000 rooms. Not sure what they were thinking. We did a pilates class and the instructor was great but they were only offered once a day. Sorry for the long review but felt there were so few \"real\" reviews posted to date. This is the first time to do an adults only hotel and I did enjoy the lack of children running around the pools and the resort. We did walk into the Esmeralda side which is larger and looked to be a nice place if you had smaller kids. All in all I would recommend this hotel and feel it will continue to improve. The staff always had a smile and never seemed to be waiting for a tip. They seem to be very well trained to make you feel welcome. Many seemed to remind me of the staff at the Four Seasons Hotel.

The hotel is about a 25 minute walk on the beach to the Playa del Carmen pier and the 5th avenue (lots of shopping & street shows), be prepared to be hassled by shop merchants (they all want to sell you something). We would not suggest walking back to the hotel at night; just take a taxi for $10. I know in previous reviews people have been talking about the rocks on the beach. On our stay, the hotel had workers pulling the rocks off the beach so guests did not have to trip on them. Yes there still is some construction going on, but the workers were cleaning up after themselves & we found the noise very minimal. We suggest upgrading to the royal service, you have your own personal butler, a pool that only Royal quests get to use, private section to the beach & you get to eat at Palapa (best restaurant & service at the hotel), Angel was great. Also with the Royal service area, no kids are allowed, so if you would like some quite time it is very easy to find. If you decide to upgrade to the Royal Service please ask for Edwin as your butler. Edwin was fantastic; he arranged the best seats in the house for us at Coco Bongo (great show). He also suggested great restaurants in downtown Playa, I would definitely go back to Fusion (great food right on the beach & a nightly fire show with live music). Edwin also arranged a taxi for the day, to take us to local areas, and also take us snorkeling, so the two of us could just be alone. Our last night, he surprised us with a romantic bath & champagne. Edwin went above & beyond his job description to make sure our stay was out best experience in Mexico. We just want to thank Edwin again, for making our vacation so very special. We will be back!

Several restaurants a la carte are open every night (reservation needed), in addition to a buffet (called \u201cinternational cooking show) that is now available daily for breakfast, lunch and dinner. If you are watching your cholesterol (diet), as of now, there are no low fat or fat-free dairy products, but I trust it\u2019s just a matter of time\u2026 We enjoyed all the eating choices, but Fuego (Latin fusion) was our favorite. We were very lucky to have Nicolas as our waiter there. Excellent personal presentation with impeccable timing and social skills\u2026 never rushed, never lacking anything, appropriately entertained, he was the most cordial server we've ever had and the food was fantastic. Thank you, Nicolas - it was a night we will always remember! Beach is long and good for walking (at least 3.5 miles each way), however, extremely rocky. Sharp rock formations on the beach are going deep into the water; one may not be able to see them. To find a good spot for swimming you need to walk the beach. However, pools (3) are quite large and not overcrowded, the quality of water in pools is excellent (no chlor. smell or such). There is waiter service on the beach and at the pools. The hotel, the staff of nice, helpful and absolutely wonderful people and the amenities were very good. We enjoyed our stay very much \u2026 Erica", "Date": "December 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Irving, Texas", "Title": "\u201cThey should pay you to stay there until its complete\u201d", "Author": "CliveWatkins", "ReviewID": "UR122032166", "Content": "Too early to be there.

The rooms are large and beautiful. The bed is the most comfortable we have experienced. There numerous day beds on the grounds. Great to relax in. The food, except for breakfast is not buffet style, you need to order everything but it is amazing. The hotel is a 25 minute walk on the beach to the Playa del Carmen pier and the fun 5th avenue. To return by taxi is 10$. One of our main criteria for chosing this hotel was the Wifi in the rooms ( which was included in our package). We wrote an email a week before to confirm that there was Wifi but never received an answer. Upon our arrival they informed that the room didi not have Wifi. We explained that this was important to us and that we paid for this in our package but all we got was a \"sorry\". No compensation, nothing but indifference. This attitude disappointed us. The beach is not large but clean. There are in all (esmarelda, la perla and royal service) 34 palapas. The hotel was a 1/3 full so we had no problem to get one. If you plan on swimming, take a moment to locate the reefs that stick out from the sand. They are few but sharp and dangerous. People \" planned\" their path into the water. Hint; in la perla section align yourself with the pine tree! Or go to esmarelda or on either side which are not the hotel beaches. Question:Why pay for La Perla? You get a nicer room but no exclusivity. All Esmarelda guests can use the facilities if they are without children. Knowing this we would have saved a couple of hundreds and stayed at Esmarelda. Or pay more for the Royal service since you get more for your money (private beach, restaurant, pool, ...). Choose a room with inside view since the hotel is surrounded by local neighborhoods with dogs barking all night long. Pool is not heated and except for private hot tubs on balconies there are none on the grounds. Would be nice when temparature in December is not the warmest. Enjoy the food and nice wine selection!

Its a pity that they didnt finnish the access road though as about 100 yards remains unpaved .We started in the basic junior suite which is large , airy and very nicely decorated in a modern style with large flat screen TV and DVD/iphone player . Whilst the bathroom opens with a sliding door into the bedroom at least the toilet is seperate but if you want to see to wash your hands at night afterwards it might mean waking up the occupant of the bed . This is similar to other paradisus properties and I dont understand the concept of watching the TV from the bath or watching someone else in the bath . We also used our room credit to upgrade to a 1 bedroom master suite for some of our stay , similar layout of bathroom but a seperate shower room with hand basin and toilet ( but with a glass door ( why ? ) partially frosted . Two large TVs and large balcony with hot tub . Its difficult to assess how busy the restaurants will be as the hotel is less than 50% occupied at the moment but so far the service is second to none and the food of the highest quality . The pools are large with lots of sunbeds and covered areas . Staff are very friendly and helpful but it does get a bit tiring having the server inroduce themselves all the time . All seem to speak reasonable english . Be aware that there are sales reps for Melia club time share lurking around the hotel who may not necessarily introduce themselves as such .

I had read reviews on other paradisus locations and even though i was a bit nervous, i decided to take the risk of booking this resort only 2 days after it had officially opened given all the good reviews on the other resorts Lets start with all the good stuff 1. The staff was wonderful- everyone went out of their way to make us feel welcome. Its seems everywhere we turned, there was a drink placed in our hands 2. I assume because we were one of the few couples booked, we were upgraded at check-in to the Royal services and were appointment a butler (although exaclty what we were supposed to have him do for us, i wasn't too sure) 3. The grounds although still under heavy construction (see the negatives below) had great potential and the parts that were near complete were beautiful Now here are the many negatives 1. There was waaaay too much construction still going on. there were workers everywhere- they trudged mud/dirt through the so called finished areas, places were dusty and overall the place looked unfinished which is was. When u entered the compound, you encountered La esmeralda (family friendly side of the resort) which was still obviously under construction and even the front area of la perla wasnn't complete 2. The food and drinks were far below what i expected. All the mixed drinks tasted the same whether u got a daquiri or some other mixed drink- they were just different colors it seemed. The food was mediocre and we ended up eating essentially the same thing for lunch/dinner almost every night we were there. the breakfast buffet i will admit was pretty good. 3. We thought we had a $350 coupon that could be used for upgrade, spa services and food upgrades. besides the explanation we got for the breakdown of how to use the coupons for the spa, nothing was said about food so imaging our surprise when we upgraded our wine at dinner the last night and at check out were told we could only apply $20 to the upgrade ($44/glass) rather than the $100 we thought we had. Needless to say, i fought this tooth and nail and they finally gave in after 45 min at the desk trying to check out 4. there were many mosquitos- we had to ask for our room to get sprayed nightly and even then, my husband came home with over 15 mosquito bites 5. The entertainment was horrible. Considering how isolated the resort was, we though at least there would be good entertainment at night. One night we had a group of 3 belly dancers who danced for maybe 2 hrs on and off, another night was a DJ who by 10 P or so was shutting down- my husband and i would just got our room early and watch tv/read a book 6. The hotel very poorly advertised their location. We went to 5th avenue and had to give the taxi driver directions to the hotel (did i say this was our first time in mexico?) The signs pointing to the actual open entrance was very poor so even when we 'saw' the resort, it would take us an additional 5-10 min to get to the entrance 7. the beach was just OK- the hotel was located in a poor city and the locals seemed able to access the beach as they wanted to you questioned the safety of it and it wasn't the cleanest beach. So as you can see, the negatives kind of outweigh the positives. I am trying to give them the benefit of the doubt and saying things were as they were because they had just opened but i still wonder. Maybe we'll visit again someday and hopefully they would have things together then.", "Date": "December 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "illinois", "Title": "\u201cWill Return\u201d", "Author": "tinaitaly", "ReviewID": "UR121460315", "Content": "I found this resort perfect!!

This was just shortly after it had opened and as such it was not 100% open. The family side of the resort, La Esmeralda, was net yet open and several of the restaurants were not yet open. Despite this, we were amazed at how great this resort was and can\u2019t wait to return when it is fully opened. This was our fourth time visiting Cancun/Mexican Riveria and our first time at a Paradisus resort. We have previously stayed at resorts by Excellence and Secrets. Negative Reviews: First I want to respond to some of the other negative reviews and give you my point of view. While no resort is perfect (I highlight the negatives I felt throughout my review below) I feel that some people expert perfection and over exaggerate problems they see. Construction: Yes, there is construction going on. This resort had only be opened two weeks and the other side of the resort was still under construction and had not yet been opened. I am not sure what people expected going to a resort under these circumstances. We knew this going in and expected this. While occasionally we saw construction going on, the vast majority of it was in areas that were outside of where we were. This never bothered of affected us while at the pool, beach, dining, etc. (We never experienced any sort of power loss) The noise was not bothersome and I never noticed the dust that others complained about. I suspect that within a few months this will be a non-issue, but I would still visit even now considering the great discounts they are offering. Mosquitoes: I see this complaint with every beachfront ocean resort I have ever seen. This amazes me, as these people must live in an area that has no mosquitoes. We have been to many beachfront resorts throughout the world and I have yet to be to one that did not have any mosquitoes. Yes, we did see mosquitoes but they never bothered us while at the pool, beach, dining, relaxing in the evening outside or in our bedroom. They were never numerous enough to have to resort to using repellant. Location: The resort is right in the heart of Playa del Carmen. We took a private transfer via Lomas and it took about 45 minutes from the airport. They are still doing construction on the entrance streets and you have to wind through downtown Playa del Carmen to get to the resort. Obviously you will see some of the poorer sections of this small fishing village/tourist town, but we always felt safe on the resort. The location is also great if you want to go downtown during your visit for shopping or to the large selection of nightclubs, as these are only minutes away by taxi. The resort is made up of two resorts: La Perla which is adults only and La Esmeralda which is for families. They both are separate resorts that share the same restaurant, spa and lounge area in the middle. La Esmeralda was not yet open when we were there, but they were just finishing it up and it looked awesome for families. It offesr a large kids pool area with pirate ship and water play features. It was also nice to see that some restaurants were adults only and most of the others only allowed adults after 9pm\u2026 so if you stay at La Perla you will likely feel you are in an adults only area with its separate pools, etc. The Beach: The resort sits on one of the nicest beaches in Playa del Carmen. The sand is soft, clean white sand and the water is warm and clear. It is not a huge beach, but is still nice and I liked the fact that it was very private and not crowded as compared to the beaches on the main strip in Cancun. The resort sits back about 100 yards from the actual beach and you have to take a boardwalk type path to the beach through the mangroves. Since it was newly opened there was only one path from the resort to the beach, but they were working on two more so it should have several very easily accessible paths to the beach in a few weeks. At the beach they had life guards and several staff to help you get setup, bring you drinks and food, etc. They had nice loungers, umbrellas, small tables and plenty of towels available. They did not yet have any of the small thatched palapas/wooden umbrellas structures yet, but again it was just opened and these should be there in the future. This resort is not the ideal resort if the beach is the most important feature you are looking for. There are much nicer beaches at other resorts (Secrets Maroma Beach for example). The beach is small, separated from the resort by mangrove trees and did not offer any water sports when we were there. If you just want to be able to go to the beach for a little while to enjoy the ocean, but plan to spend the majority of your time around the pool then you will still like it as we did. The Pools: There are basically two large pools (a main pool and a private Royal Service pool) and then a long series of swim-up room pools in front of all of the ground floor rooms. Every ground floor room was a swim-up room that had a series of steps in to the pool and a tiled 2-person lounger built in the water (these were very cool and great for laying out in the sun). The pools have a lot of lounge chairs as well as thatched covered palapas with day beds. If you like hanging around the pool in a daybed, then this is the best resort as they have a ton of them here, more than we have ever seen at any other resort. The pools also have a small but nice swim-up bar and there are always plenty of staff walking around offering you food or drink. We found the pool areas at this resort had a focus on providing you with lots of areas to relax and feel some privacy while still enjoying the pool as compared to other resorts that have larger central pools with lots of people crowded around one spot. If you want the \u201cparty\u201d type pool with a large swim-up bar and area to hang out with lots of people, then this is probably not the best for that. The pools here focus on lots of smaller private areas around the pool than just one big public area. One drawback is you can\u2019t see the ocean from the pool areas like you can at other resorts. We really enjoyed the Royal Service pool. It was smaller, more private and had lots of tiled two-person lounge chairs built in the pool (I have never seen these at other resorts and they are awesome!). It also had its own pool bar. The Royal Service pool would be ideal if you were at the resort during a peak crowd time. We also really enjoyed the modern lounge style music playing throughout the pool area. This is the kind of music you would here at a Vegas style ultralounge. It was very upbeat yet relaxing. Rooms: We stayed in a Luxury Junior Suite Ocean View. First, all of the suites that are on the upper floors are \u201cocean view\u201d and all of the ground floor suites are swim-out. Because of the resorts location you can\u2019t see the ocean from the ground floor swim-out suites. So if you want a view of the ocean you will need to get an upper floor room. Most of the rooms sit pretty far back from the ocean so your \u201cocean view\u201d is not great, especially if you are on the second floor. You really need a room on the 3rd or 4th floor if you want any sort of view. The only rooms that have a decent view are the ones in the two buildings that face the ocean and are closest to the ocean. The rooms are exactly as pictured on the website. The have a very modern, chic upscale Vegas style feel. (Actually this is nicer than any room we have ever stayed at in Vegas) The bed is very comfortable, but the mattress is rather firm (hopefully this is the type you like). It has a nice flat screen TV with several US channels. It also has a cool button in the bathroom so you can hear the TV in the bathroom area. It has a great iPod/iPhone docking station with speakers that sounds great and is ideal for bringing you own music to listen to in the room. Our room had a coffee maker and a really cool espresso type maker that uses the individual pods. (like a Tassimo or Keurig type coffee maker). This was awesome and made great coffee every morning. There was a mini bar with some chips and M&Ms, as well as stocked with lots of bottled water, sodas and beer. There are two closets and plenty of drawers offerings lots of rooms for you clothes. I also liked the fact that the toilet was in its own separate area with a door at the very opposite end of the room (at the entrance)\u2026giving you lots of privacy if this is important to you. The bathroom area has a huge, blue neon lit, 2 person tub, two sinks and lots of shelves to store your stuff. The only complaint here is that there is very little sink space to put your stuff on when getting ready. The shower is an awesome large two-person shower with each end having its own rain shower. The bathroom also has a great design where it has sliding walls which allow you to either close it off for complete privacy or open it up so you can enjoy the room/view from your tub. Our room had a large balcony with two chairs and a second outdoor 2 person Jacuzzi tub. We had booked a \u201cregular\u201d Luxury Junior Suite Ocean View, which is there basic suite, but when we arrived we were offered to upgrade our room to a Royal Service room for a few hundred dollars more so we decided to upgrade to the Royal Service room. Online it was considerably more expensive to book the Royal Service rooms and thus we decided not to book it then, but likely since the resort was just opened and well below capacity, I think they gave us a very good deal to upgrade. There were a few of things that we really liked about the Royal Service. First, the Royal Service has the best views so if you want an ocean front view you should book this. The mini bar included a 375ml bottle of Tequila, Jack Daniels and Absolut Vodka. You have your own private check-in/out area which would be great if you were checking in during peak season. There is a really nice private lounge area were they offer drinks and awesome hors d'oeuvres through out the day. The Royal Service had its own pool area that was the nicest one. It was closest to the beach, had an infinity pool and a ton of those 2 person loungers built in the pool that we loved. The Royal Service also had it own open air restaurant called La Palapa. We really loved this place for breakfast and lunch. While all of the restaurants were awesome, I think this place would especially be a great treat if the resort was crowded as it would offer a nice place to eat and get away form the large crowds. The Royal Service also includes your own personal \u201cbutler\u201d. Our butlers name was Edwin and he was awesome. He would check-in with you throughout the day and take care of any request: making reservations for dinner (again important if you were staying during peak bus season), getting you a newspaper, taking care of any problems, etc. The service here was just incredible. They were constantly looking to take care of any need you might have. I think the concept of \u201cbutler service\u201d here is a little exaggerated and unnecessary, but the level of service is definitely the best we have every experienced. For example: One day there was no music playing around the Royal Service pool and they ended up bringing down and setting up one of the iPod/iPhone speaker docks so we could listen to our own music. In the end I don\u2019t think we would pay substantially more for a Royal Service room, but if offered for a few hundred dollars more we would definitely do it again. Wi-Fi There is free internet access via Wi-Fi throughout the resort, but the coverage isn\u2019t very good. We were not able to get it in our room nor could we get it around the Royal Service pool area (this should be fixed!). But we could get it in the Royal Service lounge area, around the main pool and around the hotel lobby and restaurants. The Royal Service lounge also offered computers with internet access. Dining This resort offer the best dining by far compared to all of the other all-inclusive resorts we have stayed at. The food is fantastic. We met Tomas, the Food and Beverage Director over all of the resorts, while there and you could really see that they are focused on offering high quality gourmet food at all of their restaurants. All of the restaurants have modest menus with a variety of unique vegetarian, meat and seafood items. Everything comes out fresh having just been made specifically for you\u2026 never do you feel like you are eating some sort of large scale institutional type of meal like at a typical hotel or cruise. Now this can be a draw back for some as they tend to appeal to \u201cfoody\u201d type of people who like varied, different and gourmet style food. If you prefer just standard American cuisine on the lines of Applebees, Olive Garden, Red Lobster, etc then you will likely be disappointed. They do have great steaks, burgers with french fries, club sandwiches, pizza, chicken wings etc\u2026 but most of their offerings tend to be more gourmet than standard cuisine. Only half of the restaurants were open when we were there, but the rest were opening the week after we left. Here is where we ate: La Palapa: This is the open air restaurant just for Royal Service guests. We ate here for breakfast and lunch several times. They had the most incredible croissants we have ever had. They also make a great burger. Passions: A romantic restaurant with very unique, gourmet style food. We had wild boar, white bean and scallop soup, and a lobster ravioli to name a few. We also had a phenomenal bottle of Mexican Cab/Merlot wine called Unico. Iran, their wine sommelier, was great. If you like wine, ask for him as he can help give you background on a lot of unique wines and help you find a something new like he did for us. Bana: We ate here two nights. They offer a variety of Asian food. One night we had their Tapenyaki style dinner where you sit around a central grill and the chef makes you meal in front of you (think Benihanas). The food and appetizers were great. The second time we ate at their sushi bar. You are probably thinking \u201csushi in Mexico?\u201d but it was some of the best we have ever had anywhere. Their sushi chef lived in Japan for many years and is married to a Japanese woman. They raise their children only speaking Japanese when in their home\u2026 so this guy is the real deal. They only offered a modest selection of sushi rolls, but when we asked if he could make something different using octopus he said \u201cno problem\u201d and created one of the best sushi rolls we have ever had. They also have a fantastic spicy tuna roll that has jalape\u00f1o peppers\u2026 I couldn\u2019t get enough of this and still am craving them as I type this. The Grill: This is an open air restaurant offering steaks, pizza and seafood. The steaks were very good. I had their rib eye, that while thin, was large, tender and very flavorful. While not the best steak I have ever had, it was far better than any one I have had at any other all inclusive resorts\u2026 typically all-inclusive resorts tend to go cheap on the steaks. They also offered larger abd better cuts of steaks (cowboy bone-in ribeye, Porthouse, etc) that you could purchase for just a few dollars extra. Some people may complain feeling everything at an all-inclusive should be included\u2026 but if it was then you would not even have an option for these more expensive steaks. I would have paid the extra $ if I really wanted a larger and better steak and probably would of if we stayed longer, but I found their ribeye was great. The sides (we had mashed potatoes and corn) were \u201cok\u201d, but they tasted as though they had been made much early and were not very hot when served. They also had a nice salad bar, but the selection was somewhat limited when compared to a typical salad bar in the US. Their pizzas were very good but expect more of a gourmet flat bread style and not a New York style pizza. We sat at an outside table, next to a fountain with the stars overhead\u2026 very romantic. Hadar: We ate here for breakfast one day. They have a large breakfast buffet with all kinds of food. From Mexican, European and American style breakfast food. They have a custom omelet/egg station where they will make your eggs to order\u2026 I had probably the most perfectly cooked sunny side up eggs here I have ever had\u2026 they looked liked something from a cookbook. They also have a custom pancake/French toast station. I loved their link sausage as it had a slight Mexican style taste to it\u2026 almost like a chorizo style sausage. Again\u2026 they have the best croissants here I have ever had. Nightlife Being that the resort had just been opened a few weeks and didn\u2019t have a lot of people staying there yet, the night life was somewhat limited\u2026 but promising. They had several shows while we were there that were very good. One night they had fire dancers that were way better than I expected\u2026 very cool show. They have several bars/lounges that are really nice\u2026 on the lines of a Vegas style ultralounge. The Gabi Club is a outdoor lounge with variety tables, chairs and daybeds set outdoors in the sand with very cool lighting. A great place to chill. The South Avenue Bar was open air and kind of in the middle of the resort. They had a DJ playing dance club style music at night and one night had professional dancers dancing. It has lots of tables and couches throughout. While they did have a DJ playing great music, they did not really have any designated place to dance\u2026 this would have been a great spot to dance if it was setup for it. The coolest bar was the Red Lounge. This really felt like a Vegas type nightclub. It had a very modern, chic d\u00e9cor with lots of little areas to hangout and a large red bar. They had a lot of very good unique drinks. The also had a great dance floor\u2026 the one problem was they didn\u2019t have any dancing or DJ. It was setup with a DJ booth and you could see that this place was designed to be their nightclub for dancing and I suspect that once the resort is fully opened and starts to get crowded that this will be the place for dancing. At this point if you really want to go out clubbing/dancing your best bet would be to check out PlayaCrawl.com where you can get an escorted night out at all of the local nightclubs in Playa del Carmen. Hopefully in the near future you won\u2019t need to leave the resort to dance. Yhi Spa The Yhi spa is a very nice modern spa. While a very nice spa, it is not as nice as ones we have found at other resorts. If one of the main focus\u2019 of your vacation is the spa then I think I would stay at another resort that has a nicer spa (Excellence Playa Mujeres for example) It is offers a great full service salon for hair, makeup, manicure, pedicure, etc type services\u2026 great if you are planning to get married here. They also have really nice massage rooms\u2026 both for couples and individual massages. The massage rooms also have these really cool open air outside showers in each room. The men\u2019s and women\u2019s locker rooms are nice offering lockers, changing rooms, showers and steam and sauna rooms. The steam and sauna rooms are separate for men and women\u2026 nice if you want privacy, but not so nice if you want to enjoy them with your spouse, etc. We had a couples massage which was great\u2026 the best my wife said she had ever had. They also had a water circuit area, but it was very small, not a lot of features and was pretty cold when we were their\u2026 this was disappointing when compared to other spas we have been to that offered similar treatments. The biggest negative here was their prices. They were very expensive when compared to most others we had been to. For example, their standard deep tissue massage was almost $200 for 50 minutes. In our opinion their prices should have been about half for what they offered. Overall Impression: On a scale of 1-5, we would give this resort a 4.5, hoping that by the next time we come everything will be fully open and worthy of a 5. The negatives: ok beach, modest beach views, expensive spa, limited wi-fi, small bathroom sink areas, and no dancing yet in the Red Lounge. The positives: awesome rooms, fantastic food, great service, lots of great lounges, nice pool areas with lots of places to relax, and good entertainment. So far, this is our favorite resort in the Cancun/Riveria Maya area and we look forward to coming here again in the near future.", "Date": "December 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york", "Title": "\u201cnot happy\u201d", "Author": "taladentala", "ReviewID": "UR121366112", "Content": "A lot of construction, hotel was not ready, elevater was not working, enterances to the hotel was not finished,coupons for credits not possible to use ,spa very expensive ,you have to pay to enter the sauna very disappointment .A lot of mosqutoes in the room.In restaurants service -excellent but every day the same food .construction dust on stairs.

The room was very modern and mirrored the pictures posted on their website unlike many properties I've previously visited. The best inroom feature not posted on the website was the dual couples shower, it's always nice to not have to wait on the shower. All the restaurants offered great decor and even better food. My wife and I were celebrating our anniversary and we received special surprises at every meal. The staff was top notch and were eager to cater to any and every request, but the pool staff was especially pleasant as this is where we spent the bulk of our time. They keep the drinks coming and offered a lot of insight about things to do while in Playa Del Carmen. Each day they offered classes from water aerobics to bartending; all of which my wife took full advantage of. The only complaint I had was the sun played peek a boo the entire week and the brisk breeze made swimming more like participating in a polar bear club than taking a refreshing dip. When that's all you can complain about you can't put that on the hotel. I would definitely reccommend La Perla to anyone planning a trip to Playa.

There is a natural mangrove reserve in front of the beach so it feels like there is nature everywhere. Whenever we felt like we wanted to do something, there was beach volleyball, dancing lessons, tennis and other interesting attractions that happened every hour. The room is fashionably decorated and has a huge tub. Must say that was a pleasant plus.

Close to shopping, restaurants, and clubs in area. Approaching the resort, still some minor construction going on with the entrance way. They are finishing a brick road. After talking to manager, he assured me that all construction would be complete within a months\u2019 time. There are two sides to the resort, Esmeralda and La Perla. Esmeralda is the family side and La Perla is adults only side. They do have a common area situated in middle. Adults who stay at Esmeralda do have access to La Perla and vice a versa. Once walking into the lobby, the first thing you notice is how modern everything is, upscale and very nice. The d\u00e9cor alone will set the mood for entire trip, definitely a five star luxurious feeling. Employees are very welcoming and polite and you get the sense they will go out of their way to help you. All rooms are suites that offer garden and pool view rooms, as well as swim-up suites. The pool is very large and is surrounded in lounge chairs with towels on every chair for convenience. The resort is still working on building more pathways down to the beach. It is set 30 yards from ocean with trees and plantation in between. Don\u2019t really see the ocean from resort, but it\u2019s a short two minute walk if that. The Japanese restaurant was not yet opened but will be within a months\u2019 time. Overall, I was very impressed with the resort and it is a top choice for romantic getaways and having that prestige five star factor, from the lobby, the restaurants, the rooms, and the amenities of resort.
