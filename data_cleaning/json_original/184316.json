The majority of staff were nice (from the receptonists to the servers and the cleaning ladies), except prehaps the receptionist who checked me out. I stayed for 12 nights so i felt that i should have been asked how my stay was and should have even gotten a thank you for payment but no. The deposit they request is new to me. it wont be back in my credit card for 5 working days which is inconvenient, is this the norm in Canadian hotels? Bathroom flooded on me twice but it was dealt with switfly, except the floow was left soaking wet. Lobby nice and relaxing but i was not too enamoured with the food in the restaurant. I ate there 3 times and found the food to be nice but not worth the price. the view from the room was amazing- and bed was very confortable. Shower was nice and powerful. Kitchenette nicely stocked for my needs. Liked the pool and steam room. Cafe was ok. Very strong coffee and on my last visit had to wait 15 minutes for my coffee. Apart from these small things, really enjoyed my stay mainly due to majority of wonderful staff that i encountered. Vancouver was a special place and would love to revisit and if i do, i would stay in the hotel again", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "campbell river", "Title": "\u201cwould stay again!\u201d", "Author": "Terry S", "ReviewID": "UR128151739", "Content": "clean, centrally located and \"very\" friendly competent staff. nice little iga market just two blocks down for a grocery run and close to a couple of beer and wine/liquor stores if you are on foot. wouldn't hesitate to book there again! you get the very pleasant spa aroma when entering the lobby which was nice!", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cGreat experience, close to nightlife and downtown\u201d", "Author": "carlbrochu", "ReviewID": "UR128091443", "Content": "Great spot to stay overnight in Vancouver.

Anyway the more the merrier i reckon so here goes. Plus sides: I had two rooms as i had a problem with my toilet (things Happen) Both rooms were very clean and spacious and exactly as described. Maid service was spot on. If not a bit overkeen. Desk service was perfect. Friendly, accomodating and Knowledgeable. I saw quite a few on the desk in my stay as i was around at all times. All were 5 star. I used them for as much planning of my stay as i could and they were very happy to help. When a porter needed to come up he was there in an instant. The Spa and Restaurant were perfect, no complaints. I never used the coffee shop. Pool was clean and comfortable. You can use the YMCA gym but at a cost i think. Changing facility was great. Even mouthwash if you want it. Minus side: The Spa and restaurant were a bit on the expensive side but i suppose you get what you pay for. There was a bare minimum of kitchen utensils in room. The steam room never seemed to steam. The first room was a bit hot at night but the air con sorted that out. Hey you can open a window to. Most hotels it seems have old windows here and you will here a bit of sound from the street. I was on 18 and 27th floor and you still hear a bit. It isnt to noisy at this location though. Its a good road as there are no clubs ect nearby. Doubt i can say more. Its perfect for walking to all areas. Im 50 and walked from there to the park, waterside, the stadium, the market, english bay to all the shops downtown, theres loads of bars and retaurants nearby look up vancouver bars and map them to the hotel. I arrived there and thought i was miles from anywhere. When you know your way around its great. I had to go to VC for a emotional family trip as well as be a tourist. The hotel made it that much easier for me and i thank all for that. It was great value but in March.

The breakfast is quite expensive and we found a convenience store only 5 minutes walk away so we had all of our breakfasts in our room. The tourist bus stops right in front of the hotel. This is a great way to see the city and you can get on and off wherever you want. The bus comes by every half hour, the driver gives a running commentary and it costs about 35$ a day. Just one very important tip, Canada charges a value added tax on everything you buy. The shops do not show the price including tax, this applies to restaurants as well so that you always get a surprise when the bill arrives. Go to the museum by the University. It has the most fabulous collection of art etc of First Nation People. To get there by taxi costs about 30$ but we returned by bus for 5$ and it is easy to get back into the downtown. If you are going on to Vancouver Island then get a taxi just to the main bus station. You then catch a bus right through to Victoria.

Pros: - Kitchenette had a sink, mini fridge, microwave, electric kettle, tea pot, and coffee maker. We were able to prepare instant noodle and sandwiches in the room. There's a grocery store one block up the street for convenient shopping. - Our room overlooked the church next door. Nice views. - The bed felt really big and was firmer than other hotel beds I've slept in, which my back appreciated. - The room was spacious, as well as was the bathroom. I liked the large mirrors which made the room feel even bigger. - The doorman's friendly greeting when we first arrived set the tone for our stay there. Minor cons: - The TV was not well stationed. It neither faced the sofa nor the bed so you have to watch it from an angle. - We took public transportation everywhere, so while it was a walkable distance from the main transit stations, next time I would consider staying closer to the SkyTrain Stations to make it easier to get around. If you drive, then it wouldn't make a difference. - Charging $3.50 for a bottle of water is daylight robbery. A bottle of water cannot cost more than the free toiletries that are provided in the bathroom. I do not understand why hotels charge for this very basic necessity. But that's alright, we bought water from the grocery store a block away. - No free wi-fi.

We had breakfast every morning in the hotel restaurant. What huge portions and the porridge was particularly good. At night we dined out in the really good restaurants Vancouver has!

Our first stop was the Aquarium and it was so enjoyable - a must do for any visitor. Stanley Park is a 15 or 20 walk from the hotel and well worth spending time in. My wife and others hired out bikes and I just wandered about looking at totem poles, rose gardens and good views of the city. My son and I played golf in a nice little par 3 golf course also found in the park. We took a day trip to Vancouver Island, spending some pleasant hours cruising across, walking around beautiful Victoria and visiting the beautiful Buchart gardens with its lovely delphiniums and Chinese gardens - thoroughly recommended! Granville island and its market and lovely beach walks also contributed to our enjoyment.We also visited the Capilano suspension bridge - it didn't disappoint - and Grouse mountain - also a worthwhile experience.Vancouver is such a beautiful city, so perfectly located along the seashore with the mountains visible in the distance - we would love to return sometime.

The staff told us how to get the free shuttle to Capliano Suspension Bridge and Grouse Mountain and gave us vouchers which gave us a discount - great service!!

There was some noise from sirens etc but heck what do you expect we were right in the centre of downtown Vancouver - it did not disturb us! The Hop on Hop off bus was right outside the door and enabled us to get our bearings as well as providing a more in depth tour of Stanley Park - good value! We used a taxi hailed outside the door to get to the airport and again at $30 we thought this was excellent value as otherwise we would have had to take our luggage 5 blocks to the skytrain.

Then I thought I best check the tv, perhaps it takes quarters now to operate it for 15 minutes? But no, it's still free as well. Thank heavens the heat and A/C were also still included in the room rates. But having to pay $9 for in-room wifi seems egregious in todays traveling climate. Although I didn't deign to pay for the privilege of checking emails in my room, I did venture down to the lobby around 9pm on Friday evening to use the free wifi there.

Called the Front Desk again, and they assured me if I had spoken to someone in the morning it would have been dealt with, but I asked that they check it again, as it didn't seem much better. Myself and the boys went out again and left my husband having a nap. When we arrived back in a few hours and walked inot the room it was like a blanket of warm air hit us. Nobody came while we were gone! I called again, they sent somebody up, and he tried to tell us it was working. We insisted it was not, and we were not going to spend another night in a hot room. At this point they FINALLY moved us to another room. The gentleman who came up was very pleasant, and he helped us relocate, so it was dealt with professionally at that point.

What I thought was going to be a $250 bill for the room in fact cost almost $300. Other people who called ahead of time to be sure they had enough money for everything were never informed of the need for paying for parking or how much the tax is and quite a few were scraping by at the end of the trip. Keep in mind this is a group of at least 40-50 families that are booked here. I also requested a room next to a friend, she did the same, we were put a floor above her. After talking to other people we found out that they \"lost\" all the requests made reservations were made monthes ago, and I had been told it was still in there Tuesday when I called to confirm my reservation. The elevators were extremely slow. There was a 30 minute wait at times for the 4 elevators, and only 2 seemed to be running at any time. The gentleman at the door was nice enough to open the smallest last one when lines got too long but it was never working long and there was constantly a line in the lobby. No free internet in your rooms, that was a $9 surcharge (as well as a .65 charge for any local call? local calls are charged?). I finally was told by someone else that you could get free wifi if you were in the lobby, and that was after asking why so many people were down there with laptops taking ALL the seats available down there. The pool is on the lower level (LL) there is a way there from the stairs but more people seemed to use the elevators making the wait even longer. Once it picked up people from the pool, it would often open on the lobby and be too packed for anyone to get on. Not that you would want to be crammed into an elevator with wet kids and adults anyway. The rooms are big, I had double beds and a full kitchenette. Everything is outdated however. The room was sweltering when we arrived, and we had to turn on the air conditioning. You could not set it belove 20C (70F) or it would freeze. When I opened the filter on top of the unit it was clogged with dust! There is no fitted sheet on the beds, just a regular one tucked in, and they have tears in them. The carpets look dirty but not sure if its the color or what. The shower BLASTS you and is set way too high, you cant make it lower. I am 5'4\" and it hurt me, my 4 year old was disappointed she could not take a shower, it pushed her down. The shower curtain does nothing to contain the torrent of water either, the floor gets wet no matter what you try. My real only positive experience was the ONE greeter(?) when you came in the hotel. I saw him a few times through my stay and he was always polite and tried to help me out with anything I asked. There was another I saw constantly around but he seemed to be playing on his cell phone most of the time. The only maps to be found in the hotel to where anything is, is on every floor there is a fire escape route. Overall, I would never stay here again. I did not try out the spa (I did not like that the one time I saw someone in there you can see them walking around in the bathrobe and slippers from outside the hotel) or did I venture to the steam room (I never found it).

While that is not the case, I will say, over all, my experience here was slightly disappointing. I will, however,start with the positives. 1) The Hotel is close to down town, and so location is fabulous. 2) There was parking, and internet. 3) Staff was friendly. 4) We were able to check in early, having arrived an hour and a half before the normal check-in time of 3pm. That was wonderful! 5) The room was clean, and large and the beds were comfortable. 6) For the four of us, booking through Tavelocity.com, got the room for a failrly decent price. On to the more negative side. 1) Getting from the parking to the actual lobby was confusing and difficult with all our luggage. Either up (or down, I am not sure, as I said, getting around in there was very confusing) the stairs, or out side (walking down the three levels), along the side walk, and into the Hotel through a side door, or further around to the front entrance. 2) The elevators. Slow, small...and slow, slow, slow. I mean 20 minutes wait at times. I almost wanted to attempt climbing the 11 floors of stairs on a number of occasions. When an elevator DID arrive, it was often over crowded, and not able to hold myself and three kids. 3) Hot water. The morning check out of 11 seemed early, and because of this, we didn't all have time to shower. Even attempting to wash my face, I had no hot water in the sink, even though I turned on no cold water. That being said, my son and his friend were both able to shower around that same time, but I was not able to get any in the bathroom sink at ALL. 4) Though we were able to GET internet in our room, I was disappointed to find a charge for it. I have stayed at many hotels, of higher and lower quality than this one, and have never had to pay for internet before if it was available, in-room. If this is normal procedure, I am not aware of it. 5) We were quite excited to find a pool and sauna were at the Hotel, but it was in the basement,with the elevators not working properly, this was inconvenient, and the sauna had a horrible horrible smell that only increased as it got hotter. Very unpleasant. Also, seeing a room key is needed for access to the pool, I was disappointed to find the pool closed after 10pm. I would have enjoyed swimming after coming back in, but not being so limited on time. 6) We were booked as one adult with three kids. (under 18) It was myself and three boys 17,16, and 16. We had two twin beds and one pull out couch. There was no extra bedding provided for our \"third\" child, and when I called housekeeping, to ask for an extra blanket, the one we were given was an old, scratchy blanket. I was pleased we were able to get one, in a timely manner, at that late hour (we had just gotten back to our room after a concert, and it was approx. 10:30 pm), but I was disappointed in its' quality. 7) Though the room rate was quite reasonable, I might consider paying a bit more for better quality or ammenities next time. Over all, though slightly disappointed, I would consider staying there again, mostly due to location and cost. If I was able to shop around on price, I would do so before my next stay.

It was a stop over stay before we headed off to Ucluelet & Tofino. The fact that we did not pay full price and that we were just beginning a much needed vacation, are the only reasons we were ultimately not as upset as we could have been. Here are the reasons we will never recommend this hotel to our family and friends. Not even our acquintances, actually. 1. Poor initial first impression/Lack of welcome: Since we were planning on a week long vacation in a condo, we had more than the usual amount of baggage for a one night stay. While my friend and I organized our belongings (she was smart and made reservations at the Delta Suites!), my husband went inside to find a bellman to assist us. I was surprised that he came back with just a bell cart as there were clearly two bellman leaning on the pillars in the lobby, watching us unload our items. Both my husband and I have spent over 15 years in the hospitality industry (particularly working for 4 - 5 star hotels/resorts companies), so we can be quite comfortable and self-sufficient in a hotel setting that it wouldn't be odd for us to offer the staff assistance with our luggage. No matter where we've stayed, the bellman have never let us take a bellcart when they were standing idle. It felt odd to be pushing our own bellcart and only because the 2 bellman kept looking over and smiling. Perhaps their hourly wage is high enough that tips/grats are no longer a motivation?!! Even the Front Desk staff didn't offer us any assistance with the cart although it was obviously ours as there were no other check ins while we were checking in. The woman who checked us in simply went through the motions, like she was reading off of a script. I have done her job before and it is not hard at all to have a warm, welcoming conversation while ensuring that all check in procedures are completed properly. 2. Extremely slow elevators: Without exaggeration, we spent 20 minutes waiting for an elevator. We had to let 1 go by because it was already too full to allow a bell cart to fit. Of the 3 elevators, only 1 seemed to be stopping on the Lobby level. After a long drive from the Okanagan to the city (heavy snow, then heavy rain), we were short on patience. Not once did a staff member come by to apologize or explain why only 1 elevator seemed to be working. Perhaps the elevators double as service/staff elevators?! That would explain why the other two were locked on certain floors. 4. Mediocre guest rooms: Although our room was spacious and the full size fridge came in handy, you could hear what the neighbours were up to and in our case, it was a post-clubbing party. It's a good thing we were so exhausted that when we eventually did fall asleep, we stayed asleep! The TV was situated at an odd angle and we think this is to accommodate viewing from both the bed and the couch across from it. Either way, it didn't work well for viewing. The bed sheets were scratchy and the blankets were quite thin. I kept my shoes on while awake as the carpet was quite dingy. 5. Dismal Last impression: At least the woman checking us out was smiling although, although there was no inquiry about how our stay was. Now I'm not sure if the cafe adjacent to the lobby, by the main entrance is run by the hotel, but service was again, poor if non existent. There were no other customers in the cafe. At first I didn't see the beverage menu as it is on a LCD screen that changes every few minutes so of course I asked. The woman behind the counter could barely force a smile to her face no matter that I was trying to be gracious and friendly. It truly felt like I was intruding on her day. Overall, a disappointing experience no matter how you spin it. Not sure why the quality of service was so poor. Having been in the staff's shoes and having managed staff in their positions, it is abundantly clear when a staff does not care versus a staff who is overwhelmed and therefore cannot meet expectations. As I mentioned earlier, we were often the only guests requiring assistance and they just stood around. Do yourself a favour and pay a wee bit more and stay at one of the other great hotels Downtown Vancouver has to offer!", "Date": "April 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wenatchee, Washington", "Title": "\u201cNot worth the price\u201d", "Author": "KJBCHB", "ReviewID": "UR102072962", "Content": "I am not sure where to begin...I will start by saying that my husband and I travel quite a bit and stay in many types of accomodations....From budget to luxury. We are not high maintenance people. We can accept minor flaws and misunderstandings with kindness and grace. I have worked in many aspects of the customer service industry so I can understand when things just don't go right. I will leave honest and detailed reviews without trying to sound like a snooty hoity-toity. We have stayed in Vancouver many times but this was our first with Century Plaza. I was hoping for a bit more luxury on this stay but certainly did NOT get it. Maybe my mistake was that I booked a studio suite for three nights through Booking.com. They offered the best price ($83 CAD) compared to other travel sites($120-$160 CAD). I requested a king size bed instead of two doubles since my husband is over 6'2\" and a bed hog. When we entered our room it had two doubles. I called the front desk to see if we could change rooms. I was told that since we booked through Booking.com that any request I made would not be honoured. Had I booked \"exclusively through the hotel they would be happy to change our room.\" I asked the front desk clerk if that meant I was a second class guest and they replied with \"pretty much\". Ok. Whatever. But the story does not end here...The room was incredibly hot and a window had been previously opened by housekeeping (I assume) but it still was sweltering. The thermostat to the ancient baseboard heater was off and we couldn't find any switches on the unit itself but did notice a bunch of bare and exposed wires peaking out from the baseboard that the unit was falling off the wall. That certainly would not be acceptable in most places. I called once again to the front desk and asked how to turn off the heat completely. They sent up a houseman with a pair of pliers or a wrench and he tweaked something on the baseboard and it was finally off. I also find fault with the fact that the bed and curtains and TV cords were all resting on or very, very near the baseboard. Fire hazzard? The AC had a years worth of dust on and in it. As we were trying to settle in I opened both very old windows ( no balcony in this particular room) and noticed that one window had a lock so you can only open it about a foot wide. The other window lock was broken and it opened all the way. There are no screens on these windows and are rather close to the room floor so anyone could easily fall out and from the 22nd floor that would not be a good landing. The noise of sirens ( over two dozen times), traffic and people from down below are well heard from even this high up. The room itself was falling apart and the kitchen wasn't the cleanest. We can accept old age and a little wear and tear but this was ridiculous. The outside of the toilet bowl had black stains all the way to the floor. The shower had plenty of water pressure but the shower head was set so high and couldn't point it downward that the explosion of water almost pushed me through the wall behind me! I am 5'6\" and the water flow pelted me right in the face. Very uncomfortable and it sure did a number on my delicate facial skin. Anything brass was now well rusted. Food garbage in the drawer under the stove/oven. The refigerator/freezer doors opened away from the tiny kitchen so that made it annoying and difficult to access anything inside while trying to cook at the stove. The corners of kitchen floor still had leftovers of many guests past. Pieces of wall were missing and metal was exposed at wall corners. I get that folks crash their luggage into these but come on, for the price of the room it should be much better cared for. The doors to the room are paper thin. While walking through the halls you can hear various guests using the bathroom and every word of their conversations. A fact that sucked at 3am every night when the partiers return to their rooms screaming and bouncing around. I did not sleep much the entire stay due to this fact. One afternoon they had problems with their fire alarm and it kept ringing. Twice we were on alert as to what to do. Thankfully they were false alarms but due to electrical issues. Which didn't make me feel much better. Electrical issues can start fires..(thinking of our baseboard heater). In order to get ice for your room the guest services book suggests you call for room service or go all the way to the lobby floor with your bucket and retrieve ice from the restaurant. When I called room service she told me I had to go down and get it myself. Just what I want to do while on vacation. We had one itty-bitty ice tray in our freezer that might supply ice for two small glasses which was empty upon arrival. Now on to the parking. You can park your vehicle in their garage for $17 CAD a night PLUS tax! That comes out to $22.61 CAD PER night. A bit much considering you have to park on level 3 or higher and the creepy and steep staircase to get to any elevator was less than safe feeling. It appeared that it was public parking for anyone and the doors to get into the hotel are not locked. Anyone might be lurking in the stairwell. If there was another way to access the parking & our vehicle we were not told of it. The staff was nice enough. All in all it wasn't a horrible stay but definately VERY dissapointing. I am very glad I did not pay the normal higher price for this room. I wonder though if we got an inferior room because of reserving through Booking.com.

I booked the room based on a special I came across on Travelzoo ($149/night including parking, internet). I would agree with many of the comments previously stated on this property but will add a few things. Overall the hotel is a good find for Vancouver. It is an older property that has been renovated more recently and I think is still in partial of stages of renovations. The lobby is very modern and nice but that somewhat stops at the elevator. Those were small and not as speedy as would be liked for a 30 story hotel. I was on the 29th floor and it took sometime to get a ride especially during peak times. That said, my room was excellent. I reserved a King Executive suite, which are limited to the upper floors (24-30 I think) and what a room it was. It had a full kitchen, marble bath with whirlpool tub, large living room with a 50\" TV, smaller separate bedroom and a nice balcony overlooking the city, mountains and ocean. The room was updated with newer furnishings and fit the style of the lobby. This tells me they are slowly updating the rooms as some reviews say the rooms are not updated, but mine certainly was. The views were priceless and made you want to stay in the room and watch the sunset. A couple of things that were not great was the AC is small for the large room and the bedroom was a bit hot. Also, the interent did not work. I could not connect and finally gave up. And the noise from the streets below is evident and the windows are not sound proof. I could hear loud conversations 29 floors up. Did seem to quiet down at night so sleeping was ok. Otherwise, great room. I ate in the restaurant and it was excellent.

We did not get a renovated (floors 25 and up) room but were given a 1 bedroom corner suite on the 24th floor. The view from the suite was terrific.

The room must be a smoking room and must be high up to have a good view. Vancouver is a stunning city. When we arrived we found that the only smoking floor is the 7th, the bottom of the 25 or so guest floors. The view was of the parking lot and back alley. In the Hallway the paintwork and wallpaper were severly worn. The rooms, while spacious were spartan. The bed was completely uncomfortable, and the plumbing was a nightmare. If you turned on the cold water in the kitchen you couldn`t speak over all the noise. We were awoken each morning by the sound of the shower next door. The plumbing is seriously outdated in this place. The shower was nice and strong but the curtain too short and we subsequently flooded the bathroom several times.While we had a good rate, we could have done better. This place is great if you are on a serious budget, don`t expect much, and are a non smoker. Otherwise, unless you like being treated as a sub-human avoid this place.

But if you want the convenience of eating at the hotel or ordering room service, you will get good food and service. The location could not be better. It's centrally located and near many attractions. Although there is a moderate amount of traffic noise at certain hours, it was not enough to be a problem. The swimming pool area was adequate, but its room could use a new paint job. Also, the chlorine level was a bit too high. But the facilities, including the locker room, which had a steam room and showers with a head on top and three on the side were nice enough that even on days I did not swim, they were preferable places for a relaxing shower. However, there is no gym at the hotel. The parking lot is convenient, but they do charge for it. Internet access costs money, which is typical of all but low priced hotels, but one could be misled by the website and expect it to be included. I mentioned this to the manager, who was glad to get helpful feedback, and the web page will be probably be updated soon to be clearer. The windows open, and there is a balcony, and the air conditioner works well if you prefer to keep the windows closed. Whatever minor inconveniences I found, the hotel staff was anxious to accommodate. I needed to leave a couple of days early, and Expedia's rules required a stiff penalty since I did not cancel them prior to my first day.

It's grungy and rundown, and unattended -- as some poor soul discovered on Sunday when their car was broken into. But that's just the beginning. We were three adults. The renovation of the lobby looks nearly complete (and it is really modern and nice), the hotel is a perfect location, and the bar (they told us) had only recently opened. We had good experiences in these areas. The room, though, was pitiful. It looked like a worn out Motel 6. The furniture was stained and worn out. The carpet was bordering on threadbare. The kitchen was completely unstocked with anything. No dishes, utensils or coffee/tea. The cabinets were recently painted over so they looked awful to boot. There was no air conditioning either, and from our floor the air conditioning units on surrounding roofs were loud all night long. We had to ask not once, or twice but FOUR times during an eight hour period to have linens brought up for the sofa bed. The guy at the desk apologized that he \"misdelivered the linens to another room.\" How do you take stuff to the wrong room when they've asked for it FOUR times? Upon unfolding the sofa bed, or attempting to, we discovered it was lashed together with cord. Once we undid the knots, we found out that the frame was broken. Hence, the cord keeping it together. The guy at the front desk then brought up a rollaway cot, which was equally terrible. A thin mattress through which you easily felt the support rod in the frame of the rollaway. He referred us to the manager Angel who would be on duty in the morning. We went down in the morning and she absolutely refused to compensate us, not even a voucher for breakfast in the restaurant. She insisted that the hotel's web site doesn't advertise that the room has a sofa bed (go look: it does), and that we shouldn't have counted on having that available -- even though we reserved the room for THREE adults. Please, don't make assumptions about who is sleeping with whom. We found out the next day, from one of our fellow travelers in another room (who ironically had great service and a good room), that the night manager who should have been on duty the night before to address our issues was actually out at a bar flirting with one of our friends. So much for \"on duty\"! Later in the day, we went back to talk to her again. She did apologize and said the room was unacceptable, and that she would talk to the owners/managers about how to resolve this. It's two days later and we don't have an answer yet. We didn't sign the credit card receipt either so we can dispute it with Visa. This level of service is abysmal. The staff has an attitude or is inept. The quality of the rooms is pitiful. If you're going to renovate a hotel, then close it down and get it done, and re-open with a staff ready to treat their guests in accordance with the quality of the property you present. Right now, it isn't up to snuff. This hotel is a no-star loser and nothing more. Perhaps once the renovation is complete, and if the staff receives training on how to honor a customer's needs -- or if the ownership of the hotel gets a clue about how to earn business not just suck people's money away -- this would be an awesome place.

I booked this hotel through expedia and looked at pictures and descriptions and when we walked in, we were so (so so very) disappointed! It was my 3 year anniversary with my spouse. We live just outside Vancouver, and we had saved up money just to spend the weekend away together for something special. First of all, there was major construction going on and there was a really strong smell of paint and drywall and dust. Within 5 minutes of waiting to check in, I already had a headache and was beginning to get an itchy throat and eyes (I have allergies, but they aren't usually very sensitive). We got our room keys and went up to the room. The whole journey to our room smelled terribly of the constuction, and then cigarette smoke. Our room was no better. The smoke smell was disgusting, and there were cigarette burns in the carpets and furniture. I had requested a non smoking because of health problems where smoke gives me a big problem, and this was clearly NOT a non-smoking room. The room was in pretty poor condition, uncomfortable furniture.. a really noisy, irritating fan of some kind. To make matters worse, the smells got a whole lot worse because it became very obvious that at least one of the adjoining rooms were smoking marijuana. By now, I felt completely sick and knew I had to leave. We called expedia and they said that they would refund us for one night, but not the other. In any case, I couldn't stay so I thought we would have to take a loss on the money... which I was pretty upset about because I thought we would just have to turn around and go home, considering we couldn't pay for another hotel stay. When we went down to the front desk (having only been in the room for about half an hour), the woman waiting for us there seemed like she was already ready to fight with us. I told her we weren't upset with her personally, but we were disappointed by expedia. We found out, though, that expedia was willing to refund us ALL our money if the hotel would refund them, and this woman had refused. She was rude, in a word. She refused to try and help us in any way, and was quite hostile towards us for no apparent reason. She was unphased by the fact that I was feeling ill (which was obvious) and that we could not stay there for health reasons. She also acknowledged that she was aware of the drug use going on in the hotel, but did nothing to rectify it. She also refused to provide us with a receipt to show that we did not stay at the hotel for the night. It was only when my spouse when back into the hotel to return a parking pass (for which we were also not refunded) that he saw she had written, seemingly for her own records, \"Guest did not stay\" that my spouse demanded a copy of. I cannot express how upset I was when we left the hotel. I feel that the manager (who I believe was only \"front desk management\") could have cooperated with us and expedia and everyone would have been satisfied, but she would not. I do not feel that anyone should be forced to stay in any situation that will affect their health, or subject them to illegal drug use if they object to it. When we left here, a friend took us to the Coast Plaza Hotel and PLEASE, PLEASE read my review of that hotel if you are going to be staying in Vancouver!

The bathroom was a tad small, one had to close the door in order to use the sink, but it was of small consequence. The hospital is right next door, but I only heard sirens twice while I was there, so it was no big deal. The only other negative was that I had to call multiple times to have an iron and ironing board delivered. I did not visit the restaurant, the spa, or the attached comedy club, but we did order room service one night. The food was delivered promptly, and it was piping hot. The location of the Century Plaza can't be beat--it is in the heart of downtown. There is a full grocery store with organic food and produce two or three blocks from the hotel. This store was very handy since we had a kitchen with utensils in our room. Robson street is just another block or two past the store, and there is a bus stop close by too. The room was excellent, the staff were helpful, and the location was great. Stay here if you can! I paid about 80 dollars American a night, thanks to hotels.com. The Century Plaza far exceeded my expectations, given the price.

The hotel is located approx 5 minute walk from Robson St with all the main shops/restaurants etc. We stayed for 4 nights and didn't spend a lot of time in the hotel but found it to be a nice place to stay. The rooms are incredibly large and comfortable and are complete with a kitchenette. There are 2 food services in the hotel. The Plaza Cafe which we used for breakfast once and a lunchtime snack, was nice, good food and friendly service. Roys Steak and Seafood Restaurant (used it twice) was excellent - very good food and a high standard of service but the price is very reasonable. All of the hotel staff were very friendly and incredibly helpful. The only downside to the hotel is that it is quite noisy - it is right next to a hospital with an emergency department so you do get a lot of sirens through the night but thats the price you pay when you stay in a city.

Century Plaza changed all that. This place is abysmal. After checking in, my wife and I headed up to our 185$ room. The putrid smelling halls carpeted in 20 yr + paisley print led us to our 'suite'. We opened the door to be greeted by a rather spacious, but poorly organized room (where you could see the tv from neither the bed nor the couch) and a new yet equally putrid smell. Doing a quick look around the room we found a half glass of water in the washroom along side a used washcloth, and an expired carton of milk in the fridge (leading culprit for the smell). So, we talked to the front desk, and while we stepped out for a minute the maid was sent up to touch up the room. Fine. The next morning I got up to shower and found something I have never seen, even in the dingiest motel. No shampoo and soap covered in someones hair, covered so that it could have been mistaken for a small rodent. At checkout we were assured, by a seemingly equally appalled staff that we would not be charged for our visit. Two days later, however, we were. The manager was indifferent to our complaint, condescending, possesed no qualities to indicate any experience in operating a business. There are many beautiful hotels in Vancouver, I hope after reading this review that this one should used only after the hotstels put out their no vancany sign.

When we arrived late on a very warm August night we went to our one bedroom suite to find that we had a room with no air conditioning. Two large fans helped but it was still unacceptably warm. A call to the front desk resulted in a change the next day to an air conditioned room. However we should have been given the air conditioned one in the first place as we were able to move into one the first thing the next morning so it had been available when we first arrived. Even in the air conditioned room things were still not so great. The air conditioning unit was located in the living room and only provided adequate cooling in that room, the bedroom only received an inadequate amount of spillover from the livingroom and that was if you kept the bedroom door open to allow the cool air to come in. Also noise from the streets pervaded every inch of the room which prevented us from having a peaceful night's sleep.

It was the first week in October 2004 and the downtown hotels were booked solid with business travellers. This hotel boasts the most famous spa in Vancouver and has actually had the likes of Jennifer Lopez as one of it's clientele. From the outside, the hotel looks like it's trapped in the 70's, but inside it's not bad. The elevator's are kind of on the small side, but otherwise, the rooms are very spacious for what you're paying. I had a double bedroom suite complete with full kitchen and basic kitchenware, as well as fridge and table and chairs. There was also a pull out sofabed and balcony. The bathroom needed updating, but apparently, next week was the renovation week for my floor and empty rooms were being prepped for work. It looked it, as the lights and some electrical plugs were loose or missing the plates. Also, I think someone burnt something on the stoves a few days back becuase the entire hallway (I think I was on the 10th floor) smelt of burned food the entire time I was there. It wasn't overwhelming, but definitely, it was a smell that i could have done without. Best things I liked: size of room, ethernet connection, abundance of side tables and kitchenette. I also like the large driveway which allowed for easy pickups and dropoffs from all cars coming to pick me up/drop me off. Service was great at the front desk. Things that could be better: the sound-proofness of the rooms, the security on the balcony doors, the tiling in the bathrooms.
