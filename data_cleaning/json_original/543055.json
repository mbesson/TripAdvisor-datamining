{"Reviews": [{"Content": "The worst place I've ever stepped foot in This place is awful. Its the stereotypical hostel, dirty filthy place with broken furniture, creepy staff working there, and weirdos staying in the place. The telltale sign was that they make you pay before you see the room - don't make this mistake!! I complained to the 'management' and was told what did you expect, a 5 star hotel??I don't have particularly high standards, and just wanted a cheap place to stay 2 nights, however this was awful, and as a girl I can tell you that this place gives me the creeps - sleep with 1 eye open if you do stay there. For only 10 euro more a night there are some much better hotels (not hostels) that will make your stay in Florence far more pleasurable.", "Date": "Nov 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR897172614", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "filive"}, {"Content": "Great value in Florence This is a little hotel in Florence.

We had a private washroom, which was big, but there was mold on the ceiling over the shower and the shower curtain was not clean either. Also, the towels weren't replaced the next day.This was advertised as a hotel on the website that we booked it on, but really it's a higher end hostel. Therefore, my thoughts are mixed on this place. For a private room, with one double bed, the room was spacious.Staff is friendly and helpful. Call if you are going to arrive late, so that they will be there to let you in. It is close to the train station, but the hotel sign is not obvious from the street. There is no internet connection, eventhough the website says there is. However, they will store your luggage for free, if you want to explore the City after you check out. That saved us money on having to store our luggage at the train station.If you arrive late on a Sunday night, no worries - there are plenty of places to eat close by so you don't have to get McDonalds at the train station.

There was no need to worry - the bathrooms were always spotless (cleaner than many 4 star hotels in Europe with private bathrooms!) with fantastic showers. The owners were very friendly, and offered to keep our luggage at the hostel after we checked out, as we were catching a train later in the day.

On the inside, this place is a hostel, wireless internet doesn't work but they do have computer with internet connection in the lobby. If you are really on the budget the place will do as air conditioner works, has hot water, and fairly central location with an ok size room.

We were visiting friends from college who were studying abroad. The location is good, very close to San Lorenzo market. We walked everywhere and this was close to everything as well as the train station. We felt safe. The picture is not of the building. Rooms were good size for Europe. What we found funny was the bathroom, its one long tile hallway. When you opened the door there was a sink, in the middle of the hall there were 2 shower curtains to seperate the shower and the toilet was at the rear. We were only in our room to sleep and it suited us fine. Dimly lit rooms. The only complaint was construction outside our window in the morning. If you are an early riser this would not be a problem, however we partied everynight and would sleep in till about 11 a.m.For the price, this was a great budget hotel. Friends we visited came to the hotel and said it was a great deal for the room size. There is little signage outside and you enter into a dimly lit hallway. They do have elevators which is convenient for luggage. Overall, for the money it was a good deal since the hotel was not expensive. We were not expecting much and it was sufficient for showering and sleeping. They also had beverages available at the desk.Other friends from our school stayed in a quad room and for the price they agreed it was a great deal for college students.I would not stay here if you are expecting luxury or a nice hotel in comparison to the U.S. However, perfect for college students or someone on a budget just looking for somewhere to shower, sleep and keep your belongings safe.", "Date": "Jan 17, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR713969088", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "michl813"}, {"Content": "Great stay for a great price We stayed in a room for three adults and found it to be clean, airy and spacious enough so as not to be claustrophobic.
