{"Reviews": [{"Content": "What You Pay is What You Get I went to Bali with my spouse and my brother on November 9th until November 14th 2008. We booked one Standard room in Legian express with extra bed for my brother. But when we arrived at the hotel, we were transferred to Cottage room (This is more expensive than Standard Room) without paying extra charge for it. The cottage room was quite large for 3 persons, and it\u9225\u6a9a a typical of Balinese style Cottage with an open air bathroom. I really loved the bathroom concept but I had 2 things that disturbed me regarding the Bathroom. First there were only a few Toiletries so you have to bring your own shampoo, tooth brush, and shower cap. Second, the water from the shower doesn\u9225\u6a9b race along, so if you are a woman who has got long hair, you should spend an extra time in washing your hair (to make sure, it has been cleaned vey well). There are few naughty mosquitoes in our room, and they a little bit disturb my spouse, so I recommend you to bring mosquito repellent cream. And the room lighting is quite dim. Maybe it\u9225\u6a9a good for a romantic getaway or honeymooner, but because there are 3 of us, so it\u9225\u6a9a kind of give the room a little gloomy mood. And we find it hard to read in this kind of lighting. And my spouse hate it so much because of it.The hotel location is in the heart of Legian (Legian street), and it\u9225\u6a9a very near with restaurants, pub, and shops. But if you want to go to Kuta beach, it will take 20 minutes walk from the Hotel. This hotel provides three kind of breakfast (Indonesian Breakfast, Continental Breakfast, and American Breakfast), but when I was there, I never ate the Continental Breakfast. I didn\u9225\u6a9b like the Indonesian breakfast in this hotel, because the fried rice is tasteless and the portion is too small, so I prefer American breakfast to Indonesian Breakfast. For American Breakfast, the hotel provides toast, omelets, two sausages, and a glass of orange juice. They also offer a free flow of coffee, tea, and milk. Overall, I was quite satisfied with this hotel, because the price was very cheap (I only paid IDR 260.000 for cottage room plus extra bed). This is a typical of hotel that \u9225\u6e2cou get what you pay for\u9225? so don\u9225\u6a9b complain with hotel\u9225\u6a9a facilities and services.", "Date": "Nov 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR597546082", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Uthie87"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297697-d648134-r22156606-Legian_Express_Hotel-Kuta_Bali.html", "HotelID": "648134", "Price": "$32"}}
