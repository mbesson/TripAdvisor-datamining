Located right next to the metro and close to all the nightlife the Aparthotel Tribunal is so close to the action. The downfall is that the rooms are a bit dated but the beds are comfortable and the staff are accommodating. I wouldn\u2019t recommend this hotel if you wanted to spend a lot of time in your hotel but if you only want a bed to sleep in and are planning to spend most of the time taking in the sights of Madrid, I would recommend it.", "Date": "September 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cCentral but very run down\u201d", "Author": "Katie187069", "ReviewID": "UR131602169", "Content": "The hotel was very central, close to the Gran Via, metro stop (tribunal) just outside of the hotel which was very handy, we used the metro every day to get around the city. The hotel itself was very dissapointing, it was very old fashioned and our room had little light and fresh air. The air conditioning did not work and it was too noisey to keep the window open as the city never sleeps, the bin men woke me up one morning at around 5am. The room was clean though and the towels were changed each day.There was renovation work taking place when we stayed which were not previously informed about, every day we had to dodge ladders and paint and step over uneven floors, I actually got paint on a top which I wasnt too happy about. The staff on reception seemed rude but it could have been the difficulty in communication? The workmen worked from 0800 am to late at night, call it our personal alarm clock as they worked just below our room, banging away. There was no bar or cafeteria in the hotel so if you wanted even just a drink of water you had to walk to the nearest shop. Madrid itself is great, I would recommend going to the Zoo, they have lots of different animals including Panda's and Dolphins, the Dolphin show was good. If I went back to Madrid I would not stay at this hotel again.", "Date": "June 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sofia, Bulgaria", "Title": "\u201cGood location but old furniture\u201d", "Author": "Mee_AG", "ReviewID": "UR130700515", "Content": "Obviously for this price you could expect something of the kind but I think they could freshen up the rooms a bit.
