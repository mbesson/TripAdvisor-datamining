It did get me out of a tight spot and it was cheap. I will say that the hotel has three saving graces; the location, the price and the staff. We managed about 4 +/- hours sleep between the hours of approx one and just after 5, being woken by noise from other guests, who sounded like they were in the same room, but with the dubious \"benefit\" of amplification from the halls. My daughter opened a drawer and it fell apart. I wouldn't let her walk on the carpet without shoes on, as it was filthy and worn through to the underlay, and then beyond in some places. Fluorescent lighting. We shared facilities and the shower room seemed new and was one of the better aspects of the stay. The toilet room was also new but the toilet was not clean. The evacuation map on the back of the door did not seem to match the floor layout.

My room had a single bed, a built in desk with a mirror above it, a sink with a mirror, and a freestanding wardrobe/closet. There was a radiator plus an electric heater (\"gas heater\" they told me it was called?). There were two outlets in the room, plus one for a shaver. Breakfast was included in the rate, and consisted of a fried egg, beans, ham, a sausage, toast, coffee or tea, PLUS you could help yourself to any of four different cereals and milk, and several kinds of juice. The location was incredible, right next to the British Museum. (Literally: you step out the door of the hotel and you were looking at the side of the museum. You could walk to the front entrance in about 3 minutes.) The room and all the facilities, while a little old (shabby, some might say) were spotlessly, sparklingly clean. I couldn't have asked for a cleaner place. Also, it was very quiet. I only ever saw another guest in the lounge or at breakfast. Never heard others in the hallway, never had to wait for a toilet or shower. The room and all the facilities, while a little old (shabby, some might say) were spotlessly, sparklingly clean. The tiles in the sink-surround area literally sparkled, which is pretty amazing because they seemed to be pretty old. The toilet and the shower always smelled vaguely like bleach, which, frankly, I found reassuring. I couldn't have asked for a cleaner place. That's the good. The Bad: The shower was very tiny. I'm a 5'2\" women of medium build. The shower was approximately 30\"x30\". Shaving my legs was tricky. Also, there is no shelf or ledge or anything to set your soap or shampoo on. I did feel a little funny about setting my soap on the floor of the shower and then, say, washing my face with it. The little vestibule outside the shower was exactly the same size as the shower, and there was no bathmat. I was turned off by stepping on the wet floor after my shower. I would stay again, but I would bring a suction-cup soap dish, and a cheap bathmat (with the plan to throw them out/ leave upon my departure). The Not Bad but Sort of Nit-Picky: The outlet situation was tough. There was no outlet anywhere near either mirror, and the cord on my tiny travel hair dryer was too short to use. I asked the front desk clerk where I could buy an extension cord, and though he tried to help, he couldn't really describe anywhere that I would easily be able to get to. Once he understood the problem, however, he loaned me a framed mirror that I hung on the handles of the wardrobe. It worked out well, and I was pleased with his willingness to help. A few other things: they seem to be very very strict about the check-in time. From the lounge I heard them tell a handful of inquiring guests that their rooms would not be ready until 2pm. Period. No offer to \"let me see what I can do,\" or anything like that. 2 pm, end of story (which is fine, and fair, but many hotels will try to squeeze you in. From what I overheard it seems to be a pretty firm policy at the Ruskin). Other reviewers complained about the decor. Yes, the walls were pink, the tiles around the sink were yellow, the bedspread was gold, the carpet was mauve, the curtains were blue, and the wood on the desk, chair and closet were all different. Really? You come to London to see things that are hundreds of years old, and complain because the furniture in your hotel is a bit shabby? How someone could pay so little and get such a great location, and yet have the nerve to complain about the decor is totally beyond my comprehension. If you want precisely the same comforts of home, here's a tip: don't leave home. I liked the hotel and wuold absolutely stay again. Overall, I was very pleased. I would stay again, but I would do some things differently. 1) bring a cheap bathmat, plan to leave it/throw it away when you leave.

If a traveler is looking for a hotel of the caliber of, say, the average Holiday Inn in the US, this is not the place for him. We decided to request a room with the shared toilet and shower (in the hallway to save a little money). Here are the positives: 1. The hotel has a lift (elelvator), which many hotels in Europe don't have. This means I don't have to schelp my luggage up and down stairs. 2. The rooms, though very small, are reasonably clean, with fresh towels and your beds made up every day. 3. A delicious full English breakfast is included in the price, with as many eggs, sausages, toast, and cereal as you'd like. 4. The hotel is right across the street from the British Museum, and easily walkable to the Russell Square and Hoburn tube stops (both on Piccadilly line, which takes you directly to Heathrow). 5. There is, in fact, free WiFi, but only on the first floor where the sizeable lounge is located. 6. The staff at the desk was always polite and helpful to us. 7.

Within walking distance of three underground stations which make use of the tube quite practical.There are also bus lines that run near by. It is centrally located which makes sightseeing a breeze. I walked to most places and used the tube on occassions. The reception staff is excellent: friendly, helpfull and informative. The staff is knowledgeable about the sights and the surrounding neighboorhoods. If you have a specific situation ask and they shall find out for you. The hotel has a contract with a local taxi company which provides service for the guest at reduced rates. I used that service twice during my stay and I recommend it . I had an early departure from Heathrow and had no clue as to which terminal I needed to check in. The reception inquired as to which terminal I was to depart from at Heathrow and arranged for a cab to pick me up at 5:00AM. The complementary English breakafast is excellent and the breakafast staff is very nice, friendly and polite.I had a single room (G24) with a lovely view of an English garden. The room was quiet and very clean.Confortable single bed and clean linen which was changed regularly ( I stayed 5 nights).Room has a sink inside with clean towels included. There is a space heater in the room and an electric tea pot. I had a shared bathroom which was located near by and kept clean at all times. There is a WIFI connection available if you have your own portable PC. I strongly recommend the Ruskin for someone looking for an affordable, friendly hotel in the heart of central London that satisfies the basic necessities. If you want luxury and frivolous frills the Ruskin is not your kind of place. I would definitely return to the Ruskin.", "Date": "November 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "syracuse, ny", "Title": "\u201cGood value, location and staff.\u201d", "Author": "lpoolwines", "ReviewID": "UR46800077", "Content": "Our room, although small, was more than adequate.

We've stayed there 3 times and have never been disappointed. True, the decor may be dated and the rooms rather small, but consider these positives: (1) the staff is very helpful and courteous, from the gentlemen at the front desk to the waitresses serving a very fine English breakfast; (2) the rooms facing relatively quiet Montague Street are sunny, bright, and scrupulously clean; (3) the location, facing the British Museum on an elegant-looking street, gives you access to three tube stations and lovely Russell Square is one block north. All in all, once we Americans set aside our expectations about private bathrooms (although these are available, too) and gigantic rooms and beds (and cable TV), it's a great place to stay while sightseeing in London.

The hotel was well run, breakfast was excellent and quickly provided, and the staff was polite and visible, yet discrete. We came and went at our leisure, and the room was done well by the time we got back in the afternoon. Our twin room had only a sink, so we shared the bathrooms on the 3rd floor. Those were clean and available. We had absolutley no issue in that regard. My only complaint is the seemingly thin walls. The people next to us for one night were fairly loud, and the sound came right thorugh the wall like they were in our room. In summary, I would recommend this relatively modest but clean and orderly hotel.
