It's location is the biggest drawback, involving a 20-30 minute metro ride plus 15-20 minute bus ride from the center of Rome. Also, a small pizzeria is the only food option within walking distance. It is surrounded by Tor Vergata, one of the largest research universities in Italy and the lack of life and business in the area was surprising. We had some loud music from the surrounding neighborhoods well into the night on one of our nights. Hotel staff is indifferent to most concerns. They advertise free wifi and I asked three different clerks about the lack of wifi and they assured me it was there, and one even told me to just sit in the lobby and keep trying to connect. After attempts in his broken English to dismiss me, I showed him there was no such network and asked why I should keep trying if it wasn't there. Finally he says, \"sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't\". Wifi was non-existent during all three days we stayed there. If you need a cheap hotel in Rome on relatively short notice and have nothing better, this would be an option. Otherwise, find something else. I booked directly through their website for an additional 10-15% discount. Take the red metro line to Anagnina (end of the line) and take 506, 507, or 509 bus to Tor Vergata and you'll see yellow Hotel Laurence sign on the north side of the road. You can catch these buses at the bus stop closest to the highway near the parking lot. If you don't take public transport, you'll pay a small fortune for a taxi from airport or city center. If you're in a rental car, you probably won't find this place without a GPS.", "Date": "October 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Porto, Portugal", "Title": "\u201cGreat for a 3* Hotel\u201d", "Author": "PT-GDM", "ReviewID": "UR67249407", "Content": "The hotel is very comfortable, clean and with green outside area with tables and chairs.

Tickets are 1 Euro per journey , usable on the metro also for a duration of 75 mins which is more than enough to reach anywhere in Rome. Always managed a seat on the Metro from Aganina although a bit crowded on the way back. Did not encounter any undesirables at all & all the local folks we spoke to were all friendly & helpful. Tickets bought each day at the hotel reception. Nice to return to the tranquility of this hotel in the evening having been in the city all day. Quick shower & into the nearby restaurant where the fare was excellent & reasonable & everyone so friendly. Visited shopping outlet nearby on the last day as not enough time to go into city , again worth a visit.Don't be put off by the other review of this hotel as the journey to and from it is no big deal. One necessary piece of advice - dine in the city on the monday as the hotels own & nearby restaurants are closed that night.

Most of the staff were very helpful and friendly and one of the receptionists was fit! The main problem with the hotel was its location. When we went in November, we were the only foreign tourists at the hotel. The brochure stated that central Rome was 15 minutes away, it wasn\u2019t! There is no shuttle from the airport so we had to make our own way, a car ride that cost us \u20ac80 and took us 45 minutes. The hotel is located in Tor Veragata; it didn\u2019t look like the safest place in the world so we didn\u2019t venture out at night, not that there was anywhere to go! The nearest shops were a 20-minute walk away. In order to get in to town, every morning we had to catch the 507 bus (nowhere to buy tickets from beforehand, so we had to travel without tickets on a couple of occasions) to the nearest metro station \u2013 Anagnina which was 15 minutes away by bus. Then came the 45-minute metro journey before we hit the centre of Rome. The return trip back to the hotel was always tricky too. You had to get to Anagnina before the Metro closed (about 11.30pm); the area outside the station was very unsafe with a lot unsavoury characters lurking around. The 507 bus went to the hotel from this location but we preferred to travel back to the hotel by taxi, as it was the safer option. The taxi ride should cost about \u20ac13 but we found it was always best to ask for a rough estimate of how much it was going to cost even if it is a metered taxi. On one occasion one of the drivers would point out a nearby attraction and when we looked he would bump the meter up by a few Euro! When we asked why we were charged so much he stated that it was because we had arrived after 10.30pm. We didn\u2019t take it any further as this was the only taxi company that had taxis going from Anagnina. Although there is nothing wrong with the hotel itself, in future I would pay the extra and stay at a hotel closer to central Rome.", "Date": "November 28, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Laurence Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d275882-Reviews-Laurence_Hotel-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$71 - $131*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Pietro Baragiola 18-24</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00133</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "275882", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/4f/a6/4fa690ccb3da939dd5c52888d6b0d59e3large.jpg"}}
