I stayed in a small room which surprisingly was a very good size, it would be a suite if you were staying in London or New York! There was a super comfy king size bed with lovely bed linen, plus a large flat screen tv, sounds system, big comfy chair and a sideboard with books and tea tray. They had lots of nice big fluffly towels and the shower was a lovely big rain shower and there were cowshed products for use whilst staying at the hotel (i think there were three different types of shampoo!) plus minitaures of every other bathroom product you could want - razor, comb, cleanser, cotton buds, toothbrush etc etc. Breakfast was nice, good quality products and an extensive menu of freshly cooked items plus a contential buffet if you wanted it (extra charge), we were in a big party so service of the food was a bit slow but drinks were served quickly. not cheap but woudl set you up nicely for a day of sightseeing. We had drinks in the bar downstairs and they had some delicious cocktails, not sure of the price as I wasnt paying but im sure they werent cheap. The barmen were fun once they loosened up a bit. Some of the staff are a bit stand offish and think they are uber cool but generally helpful. Didnt go to the pool or the spa as i didnt have time :( maybe next time! Would definitely stay here again. Re location to be honest really not sure where it is in relation to any of the sights as we took a taxi in the dark from the airport (abotu 30 minutes) and then to a restaurant then back to the hotel so apologies for not being helpful here but it was a work business trip not a social event.

The 40 bedrooms represent the hotel component of this members' club, part of the Soho House Group, which has restaurants, cinemas, bars and spas on both sides of the Atlantic. The Berlin outpost has many similarities with the others, particularly in the creative crowd it attracts, relaxing beside the fireplaces of the Club Floor, tucked away in a padded window alcove or basking on the large green-and-white striped sun-loungers beside the rooftop pool. Typical, too, are the industrial design elements in the public spaces (exposed brick, concrete pillars), offset by the prettiness of the bedrooms (lively floral prints). The 'Tiny' rooms under the eaves reflect an 'anything goes' Berlin mood with wooden bedsteads and metal side tables; the other (much larger) bedrooms have supersized, padded-velvet headboards, faux-fur throws and pillows aplenty. Hot-water bottles, home-baked shortbread and Roberts radios are among the English quirks found in this Art Deco former department store, once headquarters to the Communist Party.

We certainly weren't treated any differently to the actual members of the place and were allowed to sign our friends in as members would do. Our room was classified in the \"Tiny\" category but it really wasn't. It was a bargain at 100 euros a night. There was enough room for a super-kingsize bed and other bits and pieces of furniture. The bathroom was big and included a fantastic rain shower - no need to take your toiletries bag as they provide lovely full-size Cowshed Spa products as well as toothpaste, mouthwash, razor, deodrant and various other miniatures. This is so handy if you want to travel with hand luggage only on Easyjet! Otherwise the room was very quiet with good thick curtains on the windows - great for me as I'm a light sleeper. There was a good flat-screen TV and DVD, plus iPod dock. Good quality bedding, tea, proper coffee and biscuits added to the feeling that I did not want to leave this room! The club floor on the 7th floor is really cosy and nicely done out. We easily whiled away our last afternoon here with a drink and the paper and, importantly, there was no pressure from staff to buy drinks or food. The rooftop bar and pool is very buzzy and was busy most of the time because it was hot. The bar staff seemed to be under a lot of pressure but were nonetheless as polite as the other staff. The food and drink is reasonably pricey I guess (probably not much more than you'd pay for a meal in London really) but we expected that and we were there for a celebration so it didn't bother us. We ate one breakfast there and a dinner plus various drinks at different times, everything I had was very tasty and all served using decent crockery, glassware and cutlery. The spa was excellent. My therapist was very good and patient with my ticklish feet, in addition to speaking great English! I didn't have any cash on me at the time stupidly so ran back to my room to get a tip for her. When I got back down to the spa, they asked me if I was sure I'd like to leave a tip as they didn't have a policy at all and then thanked me very much for it - I really appreciated that and it was another score for the staff. The location is good and it's very easy to get to from Alexanderplatz. Otherwise it's pretty easy to get to other places for sight-seeing, eating and drinking using public transport or walking.

My recommendation is room 32. It is on the 5th Floor right hidden in the corner. Probably their smaller rooms but it is super cute, still has a beautfil balcony, huge double bed and TV and coffee/ tea/minibar/ snacks the usual and the bathroom has walkin shower and the great cowshed products. A few minor points in this specific room are no hair dryer (or at least I couldnt find one) and no full length mirror. But in the other two rooms I have stayed in (on the third floor) they did have those. I can recommend it, thought it is for a certain demographic I would say. It is definitely a place to be seen and it is the media/fashion/music industry mostly meeting there. Great location and i find the value for money also reasonable. The inhouse free steam room, pool and movie theatre are a definite plus!", "Date": "February 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBauhaus Concrete Style but 5* Comfort\u201d", "Author": "Hammythehamster", "ReviewID": "UR95608307", "Content": "Whether you're a member of Soho House or not, this house has so much to offer, in a city that has so much to offer.

This time however, my experience was so utterly at odds with the previous review that I feel honour bound to do so. I read this review the day before my wife and I were due to fly, and it did worry me to the extent that I planned to pack some earplugs. I forgot of course, but as it happens it didn\u2019t matter because a) there was no extraneous noise in the room we were given and b) the hotel supplied them anyway amongst a plethora of gratis bathroom items. To be fair, the room we had was on the 5th floor so there was a clear floor between both the Bar on the 7th and the Politburo club on the 3rd which may have helped. This may be something that you might want to mention when booking if you think that noise may be an issue for you. I\u2019m pretty sure the majority of rooms are on the 5th floor. I do not recognise at all the description of the desk staff at all. Yes, there were a lot of them but they were polite, professional, helpful and courteous. Each and every one of them. On each and every occasion. Without fail. One is left only to assume that some sort of attitudinal mirror was in effect. In fact it was not just the front-of-house staff, but the restaurant staff, the hard-working and stretched bar staff, and the spa staff. They were uniformly excellent. The room we had was beautiful. Sumptuously furnished with a fabulous bed and gorgeous detail all round. My wife adored the roll top bath. I spent a good deal of time in the spa area which was very nice indeed. It is essentially an enormous hammam which had a steam room and sauna as separate ante rooms. It is perfectly easy to lose hours there and the Cowshed products in the changing areas leave you feeling wonderful. My only criticism would be that it could have a slightly larger relaxation area. You can relax in the spacious hammam, but that never cools you down totally as it periodically becomes thick with steam. The showers within the hammam are very cold though. Perfect. I can\u2019t recommend this hotel, or commend its staff highly enough.

I have stayed at 4/5 Star Hotels throughout the world and this was the worst I have ever stayed in. The Rooms, Hotel and Club are Beautiful - Decor and Style cannot be faulted but all this is all spoiled by the experience of staying there. Firstly the Reception Staff are badly trained - rude and arrogant. You never see the same staff on the desk. They have little idea of how to deal with people. In our first room on the 6th Floor we were kept awake most of the night by what sounded like tables and chairs being moved about and footsteps from the Club Lounge above - Floor 7. It is open until 3 am and then staff start cleaning etc at 5.30 am ready for breakfast at 7 am. We asked to be moved the next day and were told to pack our belongings again and they would move us in the daytime. We returned to the hotel in the evening to find that we had not been moved and the desk staff had not idea about it - they were unhelpful and rude. After we a fuss they eventually promised we would be moved next day to a Large Room at no extra cost. We packed out stuff again!! and then (big joke by staff?) found ourselves in a large room which was the noisiest room in the hotel directly above the Dance Club and next to the smokers balcony. The Politburo continues till 4 am both on Saturdays and Thursdays - the bed may as well have been on the dance floor. Weird idea to have hotel and club together and advertise a a luxury hotel. This room still had the weired scrapping sounds all the time - like tables and chairs being moved - maybe displaced lift shaft/door sounds - but all the hotel had this sound. When we left and paid our bill the staff gave us our receipt and then just turned away not even saying thank you or goodbye - we spend over \u00a31000 at this hotel!!! We were disgusted. A hotel run by children for children!!!!!

I would assume that the \"club membership\" makes sense for those people and works well with the local Berliner crowd who get access to the lounge area on the 7th floor, the rooftop pool and bar, the underground spa, cinema and library. All these are spectacular and a must-see. If you are not a member, simply become a hotel guest to check it out for a night. The price level is surprisingly low (starting at ca. \u20ac 100) for the size of the room and the quality of the amenities. The food in the 7th floor restaurant is not bad, but there is room for small improvement. What really needs to be worked on is the service concept. Not only the (older) guests, but also the staff themselve struggle with the first-name basis. In Germany that is not going to work. Luckily, almost all staff were naturally friendly and without any design-hotel-syndrome. Another downside was the crowd in the lounge and the pool area - on SUNDAY: a real Kindergarden with more kids than grown-ups as it seemed. The worst part of the hotel: no driveway whatsoever (actually no place to stop a car or park legally at all ... dangerous!), no porter, no lobby. This really reduces the 5star luxury feeling to a 4star hotel.

The interiors are incredible throughout: loads of colour and different fabrics and carefully chosen antiques. The staff are all ridiculously good looking and multi lingual but at the same time SO nice and accommodating. We stayed in the \"small\" room, which was HUGE by normal hotel standards. The bathroom is packed full of Cowshed products for guests to use. My boyfriend would have happily spent the entire weekend under the monsoon shower head (apparently \"the biggest he'd ever seen!\"). Standing under the shower all weekend wouldn't have been much different to stepping outside since it rained fairly constantly. But thankfully that gave us an excuse to hang out in the club rooms, eat in the restaurant (very good and reasonably priced) and watch DVDs from the hotel library. My only criticisms would be the lighting in the rooms (although I like \"mood lighting\" it makes reading a travel guide or applying make up near impossible) and the pricing of the breakfast (we ordered from a la carte and had one bowl of cereal with fruit and yoghurt from the buffet and were charged as if we had ordered a bowl of cereal, a bowl of fruit and a bowl of yoghurt).

The first impression is kind of weird since there is nothing outside that you could possibly realize that this is a hotel; there is no display or anything. The lobby (if you can name it like that) is just a large, almost empty hall with table tennis, some kind of carrousel, two chairs and the very fancy Front Desk. But the rest of the hotel is way more exciting! We were welcomed very very nice, check in was fast and friendly and one of the bell guys not only showed us our room but also the great bar/restaurant and the rooftop terrace with another bar and pool. The only negative comment: the guy really did not have any idea of anything\u2026 We were wondering if there is anything special going on at the Bar since it was Thursday night \u2013 he had no idea since he just came back from holidays... I asked a couple of more questions since I am also working in the hospitality industry but he had no clue about hotel details and even gave me a wrong answer regarding the origin of the building. But whatever, the room was fantastic: tiny but cute, a great bed, sweet little details all over the place, a wonderful bath room with plenty of amenities, Bose Ipod docking station and great TV. We did not try the restaurant even though the offers are good and not too pricy. We had drinks at night at the rooftop bar right next to the pool and with a great view over Berlin and enjoyed the unique scenery; the ambiance everywhere is simply great and not comparable to any other hotel. Special thanks to Marie who was one of the most charming and friendly Front Desk people I have ever met.
