The shower room was absolutely tiny, a little square room that jutted out into the bedroom, limiting space even further. I travel quite frequently, typically staying in London twice a week and I have had rooms of far better quality for less than I paid for this room. It was very obvious that the hotel has been designed for maximum occupancy with detriment to the guest experience. I have never ever stayed in such a small room and this hotel is meant to be 4 star!

Our first impression was a unimpressive lobby and while waiting to register, watching two couples being asked to transfer to a sister hotel with the compensation of a free breakfast!! I choose a hotel on the basis of location as much as anything and would not be at all pleased to be asked to move especially as this seems to happen frequently and no amount of complimentary would have swung it. We however got our Club Room in the hotel we booked. Although the room was well appointed with, microwave, fridge,robes, fruit, wine,etc. it was a little dated and still small, the bathroom the smallest ive ever seen with only a 2 foot square floor space, but clean and modern. Our bed a super king was very comfortable with its new mattress. In fact they had taken delivery while there of dozens of new mattresses. We had a view of the garden on the first floor which was fairly quiet, and you could open the window a plus for us The lounge/bar area was fine but the exclusive Club lounge was a small, narrow, windowless basement room that no one would want to spend any time in. Breakfast was fine a good buffet choice of either a cooked breakfast, pastries, cerels, yogurt, juice and fruit. Shame again also located in the windowless basement. Could not name lots of members of staff as some reviewers, as we were out and about most of the time, but they seemed friendly We paid just under \u00a3200 for two nights in a Club Room with breakfast and for this we got a pleasant stay, if i had paid alot more i would have been disappointed, in my opinon a three not four star hotel.

You couldn't even open the wardrobe without moving the bedside cabinet and thr bed was pushed right up to the window. We wasn't happy at all, but we thought o well we r only sleeping here I suppose. After about 10 minutes we started to hear a really really loud noise coming from the ceiling! To which we realised was obviously their heating/air con system! It was that loud it sounded like someone was hammering the ceiling! It stopped after about 5 minutes, but then to our horror kept on doing it every 15 mins! We rang down to reception to say we wanted to move rooms but they said this was not possible as they were full!! Well let's just put it this way we did not get ANY sleep what so ever as this banging noise went on ALLLLL night every 15 mins! It's the worst nights stay I have ever experienced! Also the beds were so small that my feet were hanging over the bottom of the bed....and I am only 5ft 2 so as you can see I am very short!!! The whole place seemed dirty and I really felt as if I was in a hostel!! Me and my boyfriend checked out in the morning and complained to the receptionist saying how loud the noise was in the room. I have also recorded the noise on my phone and I am thinking of going to trading standards in the hope that I will get a full refund! Anyway, when complaining to the receptionist and saying we cannot stay in that room and were thinking of booking into a different hotel, the woman on reception just said ok ok I understand. And that was it!! She did not even try to accommodate us by offering a different room or anything!! They are probably sick of complaints that's why!! This hotel is definately not a 4 star!

There was a smell of fresh paint which meant that they were obviously redecorating. Check in was quick and efficient and I was advised that my room was in the building opposite and downstairs! Expecting the worst and thinking I was going to be in a dark room with possibly no windows I was escorted across. On entering the room I thought they had allocated me the wrong one as it was a good size (I could walk around the bed easily), it was very clean and modern and it even had a window. Not only that... It also had a huge shower with a standard head and a rainfall head! There was also a small kitchenette with sink, microwave and fridge, which had I been staying a few days would have come in real handy I'm sure. The bed was comfy and the lighting good. The TV channel selection was also good. I almost wish I had more time to spend in the room! Breakfast was served back in the main building which wasn't a problem. The choice was great as was the service and the room setting. Checking out was as easy as checking in, with no hassle. I left my bag with the porter for the day and when I asked I was given the code for the free wifi! Having been so surprised at the whole experience I even completed a survey and handed it in on departure. Credit where it's due I feel.

It is a mystery to me how hoteliers can get away with cutting to the bone room sizes and still retain a 4 stars rating. To me this is an absolute rip-off, and the only reason why I do not rate this establishment in the \"terrible\" category is for the kind and fresh attitude of their (predominantly young) staff.", "Date": "December 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "lyon", "Title": "\u201cbig problem last week first week of december 2011\u201d", "Author": "frederic f", "ReviewID": "UR121799865", "Content": "i was in this hotel from the 5 to the 8 december 2011. i did book a room second floor big bed; after the second day , i just notice that i had so many buttons on my arms left and right. also the day before i left the personnel in charge of the room forgot to take my dry clean ,i did call them but at night the bag was still on my bed. when i went back home, i went to see my doctor,and he notice right away that my bed in this hotel was for sure full of fleas .so just to tell everyone not to go to this hotel.very abd service and dangerous,i had to take a treatment for those last 10 days. i will never go back to this hotel again.never !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Date": "December 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "ireland", "Title": "\u201cI'll be back\u201d", "Author": "errinf", "ReviewID": "UR121661509", "Content": "Having read the reviews i was a bit nervous that i'd booked to stay here but i had no need to be.

In fact we wanted to use our BW points for our last two nights in the UK and London always being expensive we thought that this was the place to use up 64,000 points! Also the hotel is within walking distance of Paddington station and the Heathrow Express. We had read other comments on TA but thought, well, most hotel rooms are small in London, so we gave it a try!! Wrong! The room is every bit as pokey as others have mentioned, with the bed being stuck at the end of the narrow room, taking up most of the wall space. In fairness, the room was quite comfortably decorated and furnished but it looked as though very little thought had gone into the design of such a very tiny room. First there was the appalling lighting, then there was the badly designed bathroom... oh sure it had a trendy looking sink, but no space, and again poor lighting and mirrors. The towel rack was very, very high on the wall (probably because the room was so small that there was nowhere else that it would have fitted) then there was the shower stall which was really small and a toilet seat that didn't fit. We have in the past stayed at the Corus in Lancaster Gate ( very close by) and their rooms are also very small but they have amazing design features that allow you to be able to use the bathroom and room well - good lighting and mirrors, so it's not impossible to make small rooms that are functional. Then there is the front desk. They all seem to be vague about the hotel, we were not told where the breakfast room was or the bar, and neither are easy to find. The television stopped working, we called down to report it and were told that someone would be there immediately - no one ever came. Breakfast was good, though not included, it was however a buffet style full English breakfast. Even in there some of the staff, quite frankly seemed to be dense! The trouble with an experience like this is that you end up being intolerant of everything, because basically you feel ripped off. Oh and also, when we checked in we left our luggage at the hotel until the room was ready and I asked if it was put in a same room as one of the pieces wasn't locked \"no, we'll put it out in the road\" was the reply. He tried to make a joke of it but it hardly qualifies for good customer relations does it?

So I arrivied on Monday, to get to my room I had to go accross the road. I got to the door and it was already open, infact the external security door never closed properly. So I walked in there and opened the door to this small room and a loud noise. So I called recpetion and said there is a loud noise coming from my fridge and the TV had a puple tinge. Another phone call to recpetion and 45 minutes later a porter came over and had a look, luckly the TV was just a loose connection so that was sorted out, how ever the fridge was opened and closed twice and then I was told that the porter would speak to the shift manager Another 45 minutes past and I had no reply from the porter, so again I phoned recetion to find out what was going on, the recpetist said they would find out, and again suprise suprise I had no responce from recpetion. So I deceided to order some food, I looked over the very limited menu and decided to have soup of the day (Which turned out to be the soup of the week) and a crusty roll and Haddock, Think cut chips and a wedge of lemon. So I asked how long this would take, 20 to 25 mins the girl said at the other end of the phone. 45 minutes later the food finally arived. I could of done better with my microwave. I started on my soup and I relised Ihave no roll, so yet again back on the phone again and my roll never turned up. At about 8:15 I had several issues, 1) My fridge was still making a very loud noise, and I had no response from the porter the came to look at my issue 2) My bread roll never appeared So I called the duty manager, and he told me that I would be moved in to a different room. The shift manager then said some one would be over, after waiting until 9pm I turned the fridge off an went to bed. Tuesday, Final some that was Ok, Breakfast! the sausages was a bit under done but all in all It was quite good. Tuesday Evening, I come back from work and the fridge was still not working and then to add to my pain the TV channels had stopped working, I called up recpetion and they said that someone will be over, to my suprise no one come until my food come. I was then told that there is a problem all over the hotel.

This meant I was further away from the office which was the reason I book the Metropolis.

No chance. I was in the basement where room numbers had no logical sequence (even the staff member could find it) The room itself was tiny just enough space to walk around it. In fairness it was clean and very well decorated with a good size TV. The bathroom was very well presented as well but completely impractical. Whoever designs these rooms has no idea what they are used for. The toilet is so close to wall it is practically impossible to use either standing in front or sitting on it. The toilet roll holder is fitted in front of the toilet and is level with the front of the toilet. There are 2 decorative lights which stick out from above the sink. When you use the shower you have duck to miss them. As with each stay in Shaftebury Hotels I find the shaver point did not work. Neither did the telephone which meant I had to go up to reception to tell them there was no iron and ironing board. I then had to go up a second time when no iron and board was brought down. On the second evening I found the door did not auto close when a man walk into my room. He did not knock or announce himself, he just walked in. He said my door was open and left.

The following evening, on our return from the city, we discovered that the TV was still broken. We complained again that evening and had to pack again and move to another room.

We had an appointment in the city that morning, with no time to pack, so this time we had to carry our clothes, on hangers, across the street (!) to reception. An added complication was repeated building and room access problems with our various door keys resulting in regular trips to reception to have the fault resolved.

The real disappointment came on arrival when after 10 mins waiting at the reception the stressed and nervous receptionist finally decided to greet us by throwing the registration card asking for the payment saying that the room will be ready at 2pm. I kindly asked the black haired receptionist | her name was Marian or Maryna not sure| if there is any chance to check in earlier. She called housekeeping and was on the phone speaking in a foreign language for more than 5 mins. Finally the conversation finished and without even looking at us pointed one of the bell boys to leave our bags saying the room will be probably ready at 13.30 and this was the best she can do. Compare to reception staff attitude all bell boys were very kind. We had lunch and came back to hotel hopefully to have the keys to our room. The rude girl was not there so it was a relieve for us but another girl and boy speaking indian were on shift . I asked the boy if i can collect the key he turned to the girl and ask her something in the unknown asian to us, she called housekeeping and finally it was confirmed that we can have keys.When we reached the room the key didn't open the door so we had to go back to the reception. Unluckily the rude lady who checked us in was back and seeing us changed her face expression from normal to grumpy. We asked for a key and instead of giving us another pair she shouted to one of the bell boys in her language. Not amused by the unprofessional service we headed off to the room. The room was ok smelled a bit weird but not bad. The same night the tv stopped working so we called reception 3 times to beg somebody to fix it. Finally nice young chap from the maintenance came and fix it.Also we asked few times if is possible to speak to the manager but it seems he was always in a meeting.

We came down in 15mis because nobody called us ,the taxi was not there and we asked if is possible they to call because we were late for our train . The unpleasant lady again was there and she said we can flag a black taxi and that the one that they called is probably gone. We didn't say anything and left furious to try to get a taxi.

Our room however was an entirely different story. Our room (222) was set away from the main building off a spur from the starwells. The hallway that led to it was damp and pungent with a rooftop service door that seemed to keep making itself open up to the elements. When we arrived in our cupboard, sorry, room, not only did the tiny size take us back but also the appaling state of repair in which it is kept. The double bed filled the width of the space so that it could only be enetered from one side with the other side jutting up to the window. A modern plasma television adorned the foot end wall that was so flimsily installed and unprofessinally wired (all cables hanging under the TV) that I feared it may fall on my legs in the night. The wardrobe door was hanging off at one side, the curtains were gaping from the inadequate plastic rail and dragged on the floor making them awkward to open and close, even if they did meet in the middle, which they did not. The window was either wide open (no safety restraints) or tight shut and had a habit of flinging itself open at the slightest adjustment. The radiator cover under the window was smashed in multiple places and the wall adjacent was scuffed and scratched as though someone's bootheel had been used to keep the ripped wallpaper in place. Although we were surprised that a shower room could fit in such a tiny space, one had been shoehorned in and although judging by it's size it could have been designed by NASA it was obviously fitted by morons. The shower rail holding the shower head was swinging freely from the tiles. The shower itself dribbled a pathetic amount of water at a miserable speed making it impossible to wash your hair with the nicely provided toiletries. The shower needed a serious clean, it looked as though it had seen little but a wipe with a damp cloth for quite some time. The shower cubicle was set nearly a foot off the ground and this combined with the stairwell access and the bed positioning would make the room almost unusable to a more elderly couple.

The hotel staff treated us superbly. Part of this was because there was a high ratio of staff to guests, but it was more than this. The hotel prides itself on its service, and this is evident in many ways. For example, Sunday was a down day for us as we accustomed ourselves to the time change by remaining in our room for most of the day. We had expected that our room would not be made up that day \u2013 as would certainly be the case in most any other hotel. However the maid service showed up at 12 noon Sunday evening to make up our room! All of the staff was wonderful, but we came to have our favorites. For example, Anton\u2019s service in Bar was effortless, gracious and attentive to detail and very friendly. He made us feel at home.

Spend your hard earned money on some other pricey London hotel. The trip started well - we arrived early for check in, just to drop off our bags, but the front desk informed us that a room was already available. So checking in early was quite nice. The room, which was a \"club room\" seemed pretty standard for a London hotel - not large, but decent enough. It appeared clean, though the bathroom smelled fairly damp and there was some mold on the ceiling. On the second day, we had to call to ask for our \"club level\" amenities, which never appeared. These consisted soleley of: a can each of Coke, Diet Coke, and orange soda, two small bottles of mineral water, and one 18.7 cL bottle of Shiraz. These beverages were never again replaced. I have no idea how much extra I paid for being in a \"club\" room, but as far as I could tell, these six beverages were the only difference. Also on the second day, the air conditioner began leaking all over the floor. We called to inform the desk, and eventually had to be moved the next day because the entire unit needed to be replaced. This was probably for the best, since our room did not have a refrigerator (as was promised in the reservation). I was informed that none of the rooms in the main hotel had fridges any more \"for health and safety reasons,\" whatever that means. So we were moved across the road to the second building. Our second room was almost identical, but did have a fridge. The air, however, didn't work at all, and the room was intolerably hot (although it was in the 50s and 60s farenheight outside). It was so warm that we could barely sleep in the room, and using the covers was out of the question. After two more days of complaining without response from management, we were moved to a third room. In the third room, the air worked OK (not great, but enough to make the room tolerable) and had a fridge. Throughout our stay, staff displayed all of the hospitality and cheer one might associate with a Soviet post office. While I was always very polite and understanding while explaining our issues with the facilities, staff seemed totally unconcerned. More often than not, they would promise to send somebody to the room, then nobody would every arrive. We had breakfast included with out stay, which I would also say is not a wortwhile value. You can get a fine, full english breakfast a few blocks away for only about six pounds per person. Breakfast was a hot bar of a few items (bacon, sausage, eggs, beans, hash browns), plus coffee service. There were also some cereals and yogurt. the coffee service, though, meant that breakfast combined the poor quality of a buffet breakfast with the slow service of a sit-down meal. So, all in all, not really all that great. most days, we just elected to grab something on the way to Paddington, which was always tastier and faster. Overall, this hotel was not a good value, even for pricey London. There are ither three star hotels with better customer service and facilities for the same money or less.

As other reviewers experienced, we were told when we booked a Deluxe Triple at the Shaftesbury Premier Inn hotel for 117 pounds a night that our booking was confrimed but on arrival we were told that there was a problem with the hotel and our room wasn't available. Something or other about plumbing but in truth they would have simply overbooked the hotel which is a simply dishonest practice seen too often. They then transferred us to their sister hotel which was the Best Western Shaftesbury Paddington Court and gave us a small room in the basement with one small window opening into an airwell. It was so small it made Hong Kong hotels look large. Two steps and you hit furniture. Having carefully checked tripadvisor and chosen the Shaftesbury Premier Inn Paddington at Westbourne Terrace and ending up in their Devonshire hotel I cannot help but conclude this chain of hotel is practising deception but over booking guests at good rates at their better hotels and then transferring the guests to their crumpy ones which you would not have picked in the first place. Apart from the size, the hotel is a rabbits warren and there is lift to the basement and you have to navigate your way through corridors downstairs and then more corridors, then upstairs and then more corridors. Then there was the staff. Hopeless. Didn't know anything. Smiles would have been too much to expect. Clueless, cheerless, cheesy and cheated. Stay away from this hotel and from the Shaftebury.

On arrival, we were greeted coolly, as if we were an inconvenience, and the day manager spoke poor English. We had not been informed that the room where we were staying was up 5 flights of steps and there was no lift! We had a porter to carry our heaviest bags, but we are both at an age when our knees are going and this was a hard slog. It was made harder on the second evening when we couldn't get the key card to work and I had to climb down and back up the stairs! The room was tiny for a \"Superior Double\" and the bathroom could barely accommodate one person\u2019s toiletries, let alone 2. The bed was hard, rather than firm, but was otherwise clean. The TV channels available were quite limited and the air conditioning did not work. Because we were at the top of the building, of course, the room was unbearably hot so we had to open the windows to let in some air. One of these had to be propped open, as the sash didn\u2019t work. On the second night, at 3.00am, I was shockingly awakened to a really loud argument going on in the street below. I am a very heavy sleeper. I have been known to sleep through earthquakes and coach crashes, but this argument sounded as though it was right outside the window \u2013 6 floors up, that\u2019s quite startling. We rang the duty manager/reception numbers on the room phone, but got no reply. We think that it was the duty manager and one of his staff having some kind of discussion, without any consideration for guests who might be asleep, at the tops of their voices. I did not recognise the language they were shouting in, but it was a very animated debate and kept us awake for a good \u00be of an hour. My partner told me the same thing had happened the first night, but that I had slept right through it. We have a video recording of part of the incident as proof that it happened. The only bright spots to this stay were the young lady who served in the bar, who was very pleasant and managed to handle our requests despite limited English and the young porter who carried our bags and who also sorted out the key problem, although no explanation or apology was given for the key\u2019s failure.

First of all, when booking I was quoted 230 for the 3 nights. Upon confirming the booking the price had suddenly shot up to 290 pounds. On our travels this winter we usually stayed in 40eu/night hotels but realized how expensive London hotels were and wanted to stay in the same one as our visiting family. I can say that this 100 pound/night hotel was far worse than any 40eu 2 star hotel we've stayed in over the past 2 months! Service: Upon arrival the hotel staff were unwelcoming and greeting us with the bare minimum. We had to call down multiple times for things missing from the room. Although they were polite when we called down it took at least 10 minutes for the required item to arrive and someone showed up only half the time. The only shining light was our last night when a nice young man was working who was extremely helpful in getting us what we needed. The Room: We went up to the room where we could hardly fit through the front door. The door did not open all the way so even fitting our suitcases through was a struggle. The room was tiny. I have lived through staying in the notoriously small hotels in France but this was a closet. We were lucky not to have a large suitcase because I don't even know where it would have fit. The bathroom was tidy and clean but the shower was once again so small that I could hardly turn around in it! Cleanliness: Although the room seemed clean every time we got back to the room it had a disgusting smell. I think this was attributable to the tiny room. Luckily there is a window that opens onto a quiet street so we were able to air it out. Also the cleaning supplies used by the workers are kept in the hallway not in a closet so anytime you walk through to reception there are vaccuums etc. which is very untidy especially for a 4 star hotel. Sleep Quality: Although the beds were incredibly comfortable the \"double bed\" we shared was the smallest one I've ever seen. It was closer to a twin than a double. Location: Although the hotel is very near to two tube stations and right outside is a bike rental stand, many tube stations are closed on weekends making that convenience useless. It is very far from the city center so not taking the tube makes it very hard to reach the center. Overall for that price it should have been more central. Although the hotel is pleasant enough it should definitely not be the price they charge. You can find much better value elsewhere. It looks nice upon arrival but that's just the exterior.

Our Paddington Suites was about 1/2 mile from Paddington Station train and underground. The hotel is really in Bayswater, a nice upscale neighborhood, quiet, but with everything around the corner. Upon arrival, we wanted to check in, stash our bags in our room and go drop off the mess of a car (see Kendal) to Hertz at the airport. No parking of course, hence us getting rid of the car. The front desk was busy, but moving swiftly. I checked in and the clerk detailed a porter to help unload and get us into our \"suite\" across the street from the lobby. We had done our reading and knew the setup although we had never been there before. Got the car unloaded, jumped back in the car, returned car to Hertz and rode the \"Heathrow Express\" to Paddington Station--ridiculoulsy fast and easy. The staff at the front desk was going through some new front desk clerks, and some training was going on, but never without an \"adult\" trainer to take over. They worked quickly and tried hard to get us what we wanted/needed very quickly. They were always polite and never rude. The porters were hard-working and polite. The breakfast room personnel were hard-working and polite as well. Across the street, in the \"Suites\", we had our own key to the building and our suite, plus there was a small elevator. The room was rather charming-an anteroom with a large closet for coats, clothes, ironing board, etc, and also held the main thermostat. From the anteroom, through another door was our room. Very quiet, usually. We had lovely high ceilings and windows with billowiy drapes in a gorgeous bronze polysilk that went all the way to the ceiling, with sheers under. There was a desk, thoughtfully outfitted for computer or writing use. There were two different chairs for comfortable sitting and a tiny kitchenette for anything we brought to put in there! Lovely tea setup and plates, utinsils, etc. All very handy and just what we needed! The bath was clean, very modern and the shower was awesome! I tell you, My Fellow Americans, we have got to get our bathrooms up to par!!!! Plenty of clean white towels too. The bed was magnifico! Plush, comfy, lots of pillow.....dreamland came easy! The large screen tv was our lifeline when our trip to Egypt crumbled in front of our eyes.... and the staff worked with us to stay in the exact room we were in, with no break for another 5 days. In the end, when we left, I had \u00a3 7 in my pocket as a refund from the upfront payment I made when we stayed longer! How often does THAT happen??? The hotel says they took too much and gives you change??? Over all, we loved the room, the view, the cleanliness, the service. We would gladly recommend it to friends, acquaintences and family. There are less expensive options, and I guess you have to decide what's worth more to you: cheap or no-hassle. Our hotel wasn't cheap cheap, but we had no hassles.

Other than that, the location is good if you want to go sightseeing, paddington station (including underground) is just up the road.

The hotel is in a nice area, only 5 minutes walk from Paddington Station. Nice street. Looks good from the outside. The issues I had with the hotel were as follows: When we arrived, they did not have all the booking details (we had booked on Wotif.com). We were supposed to have : Mini fridge with complimentary drinks including half bottle of wine; flowers; fruit basket. None of the above were on their booking records, so we waited half an hour or so for the room to be readied. When we got to the room, we found that: there was no fridge! Apparently NO rooms have fridges because of some accident once upon a time. I can't recall the last time I stayed at a reasonable hotel that did not have a mini fridge. So we had the drinks, but they were room temperature. The barman only had one ice bucket when I asked for ice in the evening, so I could only keep that for a little while. The half bottle of wine was actually a quarter bottle. The room was small and too warm for me, but the heater wouldn't go completely off, and the separate room air conditioner wasn't very effective - not cold enough. We ended up with both of these running all the time but it wasn't particularly successful. The room was very small - normal for London hotels though, I guess - and became even smaller because we split the double into two single beds. The so-called English Breakfast was actually just access to their buffet which was very ordinary limited and not great quality, soggy pastries. A pity because the loved the English food during the rest of our trip. On the positive side, the staff were all very helpful. The concierge helped me with directions, and they were happy to look things up on the internet for me if required. All in all, the least favourite part of a two week trip.", "Date": "February 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Marlborough, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cVery disappointed and won't be staying again\u201d", "Author": "sueb51", "ReviewID": "UR95655615", "Content": "This hotel was booked for its proximity to Paddington Station - it that respect it was OK. On arrival, the staff were very polite and friendly, and we were able to book in early although we would have 20 minutes wait whilst the maid finished cleaning. We decided to have a drink whilst we waited. So the doorman came to the bar to serve us, but I don't think this was his forte. By the time we got our drinks, the room was ready so we took our drinks to our ground floor room. The corridor leading to the room was like an oven, even though the weather had turned mild and this was so unneccesary. I was very disappointed with the so-called deluxe \"Club Room\". It would have to be a very small, exclusive club to fit in there! The bed was two 3/4 beds pushed together, thus taking up most of the minute room. Because of the bed, only one of the wardrobe doors would open. There was a nice unit where the tea/coffee things were, with a top cupboard containing a microwave, 2 plates and some glasses. The cupboard underneath was obviously for the fridge, but this was missing. Again, the room was suffocatingly hot so we turned the heater off. There was an airconditioning unit but the flap was missing and a live wire had been wrapped with blue tape. It was dripping on the carpet. The bathroom was adequate but very small, although fairly well equipped with soaps, shampoos etc. Only one hand towel between us though. There were 2 chairs in the room, but we couldn't put them together to sit as there was no room. 1 chair was squeezed into a corner and the other was at the desk unit. The view from the window was over next door's derelict garden and the backs of the neighbouring houses, so I guess we were luckier than the people in rooms below us who would only have a wall a couple of feet away from their window. When I pulled the curtains, one of them started to come off as there was no stop on the end of the curtain rail. In the advertising blurb it stated free internet. We had considered taking our laptop, but since we were on a short break, decided against it. If we had taken it, there were connection wires, but the huge flatscreen TV (unnecessary in such a small room) had internet so we tried that, only to find that if you wanted to use it or any of the other services (film, games etc) the charge was \u00a320 per day regardless of usage. Flowers and fruit were advertised as being part of the package with a large fruit bowl shown - we had 3 carnations, 1 orange and 1 apple which weren't topped up, the same as the biscuits. The breakfast was fine and the staff good, although some of the food was only warm.

Hotels in London in general are expensive, so 65 GBP per room per night (not breakfast included) is a fair price. We were a bit conscious about this hotel as the comments were not really good... But anyway, Heathrow was closed due to the snowfall and we just wanted to spend two nights in London and be close to Heathrow. Rooms: Extremely small. One could barely move between the furniture. the furniture itself was in a good condition. classical furniture. The LCD TV was profoundly there because the lack of space; if it was more spacey, I doubt that the management would not invest such money! Furthermore, i hated the pillows! so small and light... damn. Anyway I can't complaint more about the rooms... If only the windows were closing properly so they would not allow the cold come to the room! And if only you couldn't hear people talking from the next room! soundproof? not-at-all!!! We woke up by babies crying the other morning, it was a nightmare, for one moment I thought the babies were into my room! Bathroom: Renovated, cozy one. At first glance it was clean, at a second glance I saw dust and a razor under the sink! The water's temperature was not as hot as I wanted. Overall, it was a good bathroom - if only there was a brush next to the toilet that I could clean it after the use! unacceptable... Hotel facilities: Poor for a so-called 4* hotel: small lobby, boring decoration, very small bar. One positive thing was the free internet access. Service: All the staff are foreigners. This is not bad of course, as long as you can communicate with them. I tried to speak with a maid and I couldn't... Overall they were fine - if only they did not knock our door in order to clean up!!! I swear I put the \"Do not disturb\" thing... The other funny incident was when I asked for a second face towel (there was only one in the bathroom) the member of the staff apologised and told me that they did not have.... Location: really convenient, close to the red line and in general the city centre. This was one of the basic reasons which would make me go back there.

The staff all seemed fine but we didn't really need to put them to the test apart from on the second night when our room keys wouldn't work. There was no apology but they were fixed right away. We booked a standard room but ours (105) had 'clubroom' on the door. If they are bigger than standard, I dread how small standard must be.

A blind or curtain at the bare window might have given an illusion of a little warmth. The shower looked OK but was poorly positioned and the pressure was too low for showering to be anything better than a chore. We did have a bath so there was a bit more space to move than in the shower-only rooms. Having said all that, we were expecting the possibility of it being far worse.

I called reception to tell them, and at the same time took advantage of their free wi-fi to take a look at recent reviews of the hotel. Bed-bug reports were present. Reception called back and I alerted them of my concerns. They assured me they did not have a problem with bed-bugs (although later admitted that their other rooms in the building across the street had had a bed-bug problem that they had 'taken care of'). They offered to move me to another room regardless, which I accepted. I undertook a thorough inspection of the new room and found a live bed-bug, which I duly took upstairs to reception and showed the hotel manager. There was some surreptitious glances between staff and managers, a whispered conversation, and then the manager asked me to go outside for a chat. I insisted on being moved from the building, was offered a room at a sister hotel around the corner, refused, was offered a room at the Best Western Kensington, reluctantly accepted this 'final offer'. I glanced with sympathy at the happy customers still entering the lobby to check in, wishing I had the courage to warn them. Enroute to the Kensignton Best Western l I googled reviews of this hotel and found similar reports. I got out of the cab and stayed at a friends house. I believe this hotel chain is denying rampant reports of the infestation. Their efforts to control the problem have obviously been unsuccessful and night after night innocent victims sleep in their infected beds and carry the bugs back to their houses and families. Spread the word- this hotel chain should be shut down! Their behaviour is disgusting, their actions are based on pure greed, and their victims number in the hundreds, if not thousands.

The only 4 stars listed were the Hilton Metropole and Hilton Paddington, and I expected to get one of those. I was very wrong! Hotwire has added at least the Shaftsbury Hyde Park International, at 52-55 Inverness Terrace, to its list of 4 stars in this area. From all appearances it is NOT a four star but don\u2019t know for sure since we were turned away at 6 pm on a Saturday afternoon although we held a printed paid booking, with the explanation that \u201ca boiler has broken and since you didn\u2019t book directly with the hotel, you\u2019ll have to call your travel agent\u201d to sort out the situation. About twenty minutes of back and forth resulted in an offer to put us up at another \u201cShaftsbury 4 star\u201d nearby, the Best Western Shaftsbury Paddington Court. An offer was made to get us a car service but we were warned that this would talk at least a half hour. After waiting the half hour, we were ready to walk to the new hotel with our luggage, when the car showed up and drove us quickly to the Best Western Shaftsbury. Things went downhill from here. The Best Western Shaftsbury is listed as a 4 star hotel, even by AA (the British equivalent of AAA) who should know better. Like the Shaftsbury Hyde Park International \u2013 where we were unable to stay \u2013 it is a converted row house in an entire street of perhaps 20 or 25 conversions serving as modest two- and three-star hotels. How the two Shaftsburys got to be listed as four stars is beyond me. Although the experience overall was very disappointing, the pertinent details here are that we were again given rooms with single beds, mine measured approximately 2.5 metres by 3 metres (about 8 feet by 10) barely enough room for the bed and for the door to open. There was no lift / elevator to our rooms on the first (US second) floor, so we lugged our bags up. The air conditioning in my room did not work and the window in the bathroom opened only a crack. The dirty window in the room did not open at all. The carpet was threadbare and the bathroom, which had been outfitted with a new, plastic shower stall too small to bend over in, was tiny, with the sink slightly larger than an A-4 sheet of paper. From what we could tell, the guests at this hotel are backpackers and tour groups. When we were there a busload of about 50 people from Holland checked in, and there were several scruffy but polite backpackers waiting to use the one computer hooked up to the Internet. The staff were all immigrants, which is fine as long as they don\u2019t bring some of their more disagreeable customs with them. When we checked out early on Monday morning, a member of staff offered to get a taxi for us. Since we were right next to a main road with plenty of taxis we told him that wouldn\u2019t be necessary. Nevertheless he barged out into the road, stopped the first cab and had a brief exchange of conversation. When we got into the cab the driver told us \u201cHe wanted me to pay him for bringing me clients!

It's a 5-minute walk from Paddington Station, so if you land at Heathrow, you can reach Paddington in 15 minutes, and the hotel in another 5. It's also a few minutes away from Lancaster Gate tube station, which is right in front of Hyde Park /Kensington Gardens. Just 15 minutes away by tube from the heart of shopping: Oxford/Regent Street. The room range is very vast. While they offer only 2-3 types, there's a huge variation within each type (they cost the same, it's just your luck). While the staff are very courteous, they do tend to take you for a ride by overbooking/ giving you a smaller room, and hoping you won't notice/complain. Ive always booked a Double Superior/Deluxe room, but have been sold a crappy single room slightly bigger then a cabinet. I complained, and was moved to a far bigger room the next day. Make it a point to complain specially if you are going to be there for a few days. The rooms themselves (assuming you go for a double deluxe or better) are nice and clean. The beds are very comfortable, and there's free wired broadband in every room (if you are on the lower floors, you may get the wifi signal from the reception). The rooms have LCD TV with IPTV connections, with about 30 FTA channels already available. My room had a coffee/tea maker, hair dryer, and ironing board as well. Other than the bed, there's a small writing table and chair. These rooms are good for yourself, but if you plan to invite someone over, you will probably need to get a bigger room - or meet in the lounge/bar. The hotel provides free toiletries which are fairly decent: one tends to use a lot of moisturizers in London, specially during winters, and their's isn't too bad. There was a bathtub in the attached bathroom in the room I had.. and lots of clean towels, replaced everyday by efficient housekeeping were provided. The breakfast (sometimes included - you'll need to confirm before you eat!!!) is not all that great, and a bit overpriced (about 17 pounds including VAT). You can eat a helluva lot more for that money, and your choice of foods too. For vegetarians, there's very limited stuff, and vegans are basically screwed. The room service can be really, really pathetic - I once ordered food from a takeaway, and then a plate and fork from the hotel, and the food came in much before the plate. All in all, a value for money hotel, but you will get a good deal only by insisting for it.

I needed to change my check in time to midnight, so I decided to phone ahead to advise, as I was concerned about arriving so late with the possibility of my room being given to somebodey else. Upon calling the hotel, I received a very abrupt staff member who repeatedly said that the reception was open 24 hours a day and that there was no need to advise. She would not take any details from, not even my name just to appease me. - Upon arrival at midnight, after not eating all day and travelling for about 6 hours, the staff told me that they had no record of my confirmation of stay. Fortunately I had a copy of my confirmation from the website I booked it on. I then had to wait while the very unprofessional reception staff kept running out the back to sort everything out with the Duty Manager. I may as well have been standing at the counter of McDonalds. I then asked if the hotel had anywhere that I could eat, even if only a snack and I was told there were no facilities but I could order a take-away pizza! - 1/2 an hour later my room was sorted out. They told me that my booking had not been updated in their system which is why they couldn't find out, despite my confirmed booking being made 3 days earlier. - The staff at check in did not tell me of any of the the facilities at the hotel or any near by attractions. I asked if I could arrange a late check out for the next day, (only an hour was required), only to receive the response, \"Late check out, what is a late check out\"? I then had to explain to the staff what is was. When I told them, they said there was no problem and that I could check out an hour later the following day. - The room was already prepaid but they requested a further \u00a310.00 for incidentals after they had just told me that I could not obtain any food or drinks in the room or at their bar area. Of course if I wanted breakfast, that would be extra so what could I possibly accrue another \u00a310.00 worth of incidentals on? - The room, although having nice decor, was ridiculously small. I was tripping myself and I was the only one in there. The room I had was allegedly the, \"club double room\", this means that it's supposed to be on eof their biggest rooms. I wouldn't want to see what a single room looks like. I had to sit on the toilet to reach the rubbish bin that was under the sink in the bathroom. The shower was extremely small, if you're a tall or wide person you might be able to get in there but good luck moving your body around trying to have a wash. - There was some complimentary tea, coffee, drinks, biscuits and fruit in the room but nobody told me that they were complimentary. Everything was also at room temperature, as there wasn't a mini fridge/ minibar in the room. - By this time, it was now about 1:30am, so I went off to wonder the streets of Paddington looking for something to eat. - Next morning, the Cleaner is knocking on my door at 12:01pm. Through the door I explained that I had a late check and that I would be ready in about 20 minutes, to which I received a response of, \"okay\". Then literally 3 minutes later, I had a knock on the by the Duty Manager asking me if I was checking out today! I told her that I had arranged a late check out with reception the night before to which she said she wasn't informed. Never again will I stay in the 2 star hotel!

The TV was a nice flat screen, which I watched at bedtime and in the morning as I drank my coffee. Location is great. There was a little supermarket around the corner, Paddington is 5 blks away, and newsstand around the corner where I purchased drinks and my pass for the bus and underground. Many restaurants along Craven Terrace that were better priced than hotel and great food. I ate lunch at the Craven Cafe, which was great. And if you walk up Craven Terrace to Bayswater Road, you will find an entrance to Hyde Park, where you can sit by the fountain and eat lunch on a nice day. Also, many buses run along Bayswater Road. I took one to Marble Arch to shop and was there in 5 minutes. Lancaster Gate tube station was also a few blocks from Craven Terrace and Bayswater Road.

Some previous guests seemed to have suffered of a panic attack, judging by some scratches on the room walls... _ Technical Problems : shortage of water at peak time in the morning, right at the moment when you need to get ready for an important meeting; electricity breakdown during the night : alarm clock not working; ice in the freezer and fridge had melted, transforming my room in a Little Venice... _ Not designed for Business Activities : very old and not functioning internet connection.

When I had to go all the way down to reception a 2nd time because my 2nd room key was not working, the Reception Staff tried to charge me a 2nd time the price of the stay that I had already paid before even getting my room in the morning... _ Very narrow and unclean Bathroom.

The hotel staff seemed completely unconcerned with their guests, and if you went down to the front desk, they addressed you in their own time--usually after making you wait a bit. Any questions I asked of the staff had to be asked at least three times to get an answer, rather than a run-around. At one point I was using the computer in the lobby and overheard a guest coming to the front desk to complain. Upon being told that the manager was not around (after he had just spoken with said manager), the guest left angry. When the guest was out of earshot, the staff began badmouthing him. With me still in the lobby. My electronic room key went down 3 times during my stay, at regular two day intervals. The room itself (a kitchenette suite) was smaller than the two star hotel I had stayed at on Belgrave Road. The kitchenette was a microwave and minifridge fitted into a space that looked as though it normally would have contained a dresser or something for your clothes. The cabinet where I was supposed to put my clothes was wedged in so tightly between the wall and the end table next to the bed, that I could barely open it. The view outside my room made me feel as though I was in a prison. There was a glowing green light (I'm assuming that it was the fire alarm it was attached to) on the ceiling and a bright blue light on the bottom of the TV--neither one turned off. The glow from these lights was so bright I had trouble sleeping.

This hotel is in a great location very close to Paddington and Lancaster Gate tubes and handy for the bright lights of the west end and the parks.

The rooms are modern, well kitted (tea, coffee, complimentary biscuits, an iron which is great for business travellers). Good television set and clean stylish bedding and free broadband (and its quick). The service is ok and far from the worst and again it is all reflected in the price (book via the Shaftesbury group website for great prices \u00a375 for a deluxe double). The breakfast is fantastic for the money (the acid test for any in England is the sausages and bacon and they are good here and not the usual 'frozen' fair). There are a number of reviewers complaining of turning up with no room...check out the terms and conditions when booking as some prices do not guarantee a room at the hotel you have booked but you are then ferried to another of the groups hotels.

However once beyond this point the hotel turned into a maze of tiny corridors with a strange smell and brown carpets, similar to a retirement home. The doors were all held open by fire extinguishers, hoovers left permanently in corridors, tatty door frames, ripped carpets. DEFINITELY not a 4 star. We walked up many stairs to get to the 3rd floor as the lift only went to the lower floors and when we finally reached our room with our suitcases in tow we realized that we had been given a twin room instead of a double room. So back we returned down the stairs and informed the man behind the desk politely and in a clam manner about the mix up.Only to be met with a rude response. Basically we were told that the hotel is very popular and we were lucky to even have a room (I am not joking these were his words!). He also said that the hotel had tried to contact all the people that this had happened to but the numbers had not been working (which did not sound very believable) Finally he agreed to giving us a twin room the following day. We stayed in the double room that night and it was TINY! Pretty much only space for a double bed which was so small I was afraid to turn as I might knock my friend off!! There was also a narrow corridor beside the bathroom (which actually was a nice bathroom , but tiny if you bent down in the shower you could get stuck). The next day we were moved to a new room and luckily the previously mentioned staff member was not on and the people on duty were much more accommodating. The new room was bigger but still dark and dingy apart from the bathroom as mentioned before. HOWEVER............ it was in this room that I was bitten by BED BUGS. I did not realize that this had happened to me until I had returned home as the bites appeared then (they can appear up to 9 days later). I had to hoover my whole room, mattress, bed frame, suitcase, all of the furniture, wash and dry everything that I had with me at a high heat in case any of these critters had returned with me but I was very lucky that they hadn't because they are a nightmare to get rid of. The bites have still not healed and are very itchy and I cannot believe that untop of everything else this happened to me. It is so disgusting. This hotel is certainly not deserving of its four star status.I just don't understand it. Four stars hotels in Ireland are a pleasure to stay in: clean, luxurious, friendly staff.

The reviews were wrong and I suggest you heed my advice. I paid extra to get a deluxe room but there was nothing deluxe about what I was given. The cons are as follows: Star rating: The hotel sells itself as a 4 star and in the past I have experienced many hotels ranging from 2 to 5 star. Of the 4 star rated hotels I have experienced they have all been reasonably good and often provide you with the comfort and quality of a 5 star with slightly inferior finishing and fewer facilities. In this case however the hotel would more realistically be categorised as a mediocre 3 star. On this ground I was disappointed as the Shaftesbury did not live up to the standard you'd expect from a 4 star hotel in any sense of the term. State of room: The room was in the basement floor. There was marginal natural lighting and you had no view. There was something resembling a sky light that was apparently what made the room habitable. The carpets were a disgrace, there were marks all over them, they were worn, stained and grubby looking. The television remote did not work, except to change channel but no volume control or standby function worked. The room was stuffy due to poor ventilation and no window you could reach to open. The crockery for the complimentary tea was mismatched. The complimentary soap in the shower was empty. The minibar smelled like farts (seriously it did) and there was nothing in it except two lonely bottles of water. The safe was locked and could not be opened to store valuables in. The shower did not have adequate water guards and water would splash off you onto the toilet and toilet floor. Staff: with the exception of one receptionist they were indifferent to you, would not greet you as you entered the rather intimate lobby and would barely acknowledge you upon approaching their counter. They were not overtly rude but they were falling far short of the standard you would expect from a so called 4 star hotel's staff. Overall condition: The hotel had the fascade of style but it was cheaply done and already there were signs of detiroration from the marked up walls in the corridor to the disgraceful state of the room we were allocated. Facilities: The gym was a glorified home gym with very few machines. The lack of space or windows was also oppressive. i did not use any other facility but there didn't appear to be many in any event. There was no lift down to the basement level which meant we had to carry our luggage down/up on check-in and check out. I could have used the porter but chose not to. The point remains that the Shaftesbury is allocating rooms in it's basement that lack sufficient natural light, a lift and proper ventilation. All in all it was tacky, tired, psuedo-stylish, poorly kept, poorly presented, poorly attended and just generally rubbish. The only good points were its location and selection of television channels. However, these are not selling points as the area is full of similarly convenient hotels at a lower price and of a similar quality. Why should I pay extra for a 4 star that doesn't deliver when I could save the bulls**t and get a more honest 3 star for less money?", "Date": "March 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "staffordshire", "Title": "\u201cawfull beware this place was disgusting\u201d", "Author": "lilli67", "ReviewID": "UR25847784", "Content": "we stayed in a basement room across from the main hotel the room was so tiny, the bed was hard and dirty and the bathroom was filthy.

When we first saw the room we thought it looked good - nice decor, clean, plasma tv, great view etc. However this changed in about 5 minutes when we realised that it was right next to the top of the lift shaft of a very noisy lift. I tried to get a different room but was told there was nothing available until next day, and that it would be quieter at night. However this was the only lift for the whole hotel and people were travelling up at down the lift every few minutes until 3.30 in the morning. As the noise level was like being right next to an underground train, you will understand why I was in tears with exhaustion and lack of sleep by this time. Rooms like this are really unfit to be offered as guest accommodation at all. I don't know how many of the other rooms near the lift were similarly affected but as ours was near the lift machinery it was probably the worst (room 419 - avoid like the plague). I found the reception staff very pleasant to deal with - I felt sorry for them as this situation probably arises every day and it is really the fault of the management to put such rooms on the market. If they do so there really ought to be a health warning attached. The fact that they refused to change the room until the next day made me wonder whether this was a deliberate management policy - always have one set of mugs in the room for one night then move them, and put another set in etc, that way the room stays in occupation. It really is a great pity as I thought this was otherwise a fairly good hotel in a convenient, quiet location with restaurants and shops, Hyde Park and Paddington station nearby, although minor grouches would be that the hot water ran out on the first night and also that there was a fire alarm nearby beeping for lack of a new battery which probably should have been checked.

Our nightmare began in just trying to find the hotel via rented car. (That's another issue altogether, maybe, - I strongly advise independent American travelers to use taxi service anywhere near London! The difficulty finding on -street parking; feeding the meter; getting parking tickets for being 5 min. past due; the \"Congestion Charge\" for driving a vehicle within city limits - all amount to much, much more hassle and money than a simple hail of a cab. We tried parking a block away, just to drop our bags off, but had trouble with police-(on the upside, for wary American travelers, the area is well patrolled by officers on foot.). The \"car park\" is NOT convenient to travelers staying at this hotel - with or without luggage - it is at least 4 long city blocks away and in an area that is difficult to navigate by foot. The \"car park\" seems to be designed for Paddington Station travelers. Next, the hotel tried to tell us we had no reservation. They were short rooms - some large group staying there - and initially would tried to turn us away. After proffering the online reservation confirmation and some heated negotiation, they did find us a room, alas, finding the room ourselves was another \"adventure\". The hotel was under construction/renovation and guests were given rooms in the wing under re-hab! Painter's tarps lining the hallways, painting, hammering and fumes - workers inside and out harassing my teenage daughter with suggestive comments, all made for a lousy stay. There is no elevator and no bellhop offered to help us with our bags - we traversed a literal maze to find our room - it became comical after getting lost in London - to get lost in the hotel too, trying to find our way through little narrow, winding staircases and connecting passageways... Pictures on hotel website are deceiving. I recognize the double room and the front desk - minus the harried employees who were all foreigners with difficulty communicating in English, but I never saw the bar as pictured and the hotel facade was hidden by tarpaulins and scaffolding - maybe NOW, it looks as advertised! The room and bath were tiny-cramped by American standards, but clean. My daughter got a severe electric shock when using the iron provided - (frayed cord). No hallway amenities as in American hotels, but night staff was obliging and I was able to get a beer (warm, mind) at 2am - (suffering jet-lag). The lounge did offer 1 computer for guest use - this was inadequate, however, as the line was always 3-4 deep waiting (it was available at 2am, lol). Also, lounge boasted big screen TV. TV in room was flat screen, mounted on wall and wholly adequate-\"breakfast included\", by American standards was not. Breakfast room found in basement - long line - short time frame of availability and again, harried, impolite staff - we opted to buy a muffin and coffee at a local deli/lunch shop while walking to the tube. Finally, since our travel plans had us arriving/departing the UK via Heathrow, we booked this hotel for our first night stay and our last - we were unable to cancel our reservation for our last night without losing the money prepaid by credit card online - thus we suffered a return to this establishment as we bid farewell to London as well. In any case - quaint ain't exactly what we were looking for - we needed comfort and convenience at both ends of a UK adventure. Whether you're on an extended stay in London or just passing through sightseeing before journeying onward, I suggest finding other accommodations.

My main gripe was the size of the room and facilities.

I spent 4 months constantly reading the new reviews to see if things had improved, but 90% of the reviews were quite negative. We had booked for 3 nights and from what I read about the rooms, service and staff, I was preparing myself to go to war if things were as bad as people reported.. We arrived around midday, the staff knew about our bookings, our rooms were ready and we were handed the keys. I was actually surprised when I walked into our room as it had been fully renovated and everything was really clean (including the bathroom). I have to say the room was quite small and we had to re-arrange a few items to fit our luggage, but it was good enough. The shower however, was a different story.. I have never seen such a small shower, and to top it off, they had also fitted a saftey handle/rail thing inside, which causes you to lose even more space once you're inside!! I had to actually keep the shower door open in order to be able wash myself properly!! We stayed 3 nights and only had one problem, which was on the 2nd day when the hot water system was down for the whole day. We asked the staff whether it would be fixed, and they told us that the problem was only with the rooms in our block. We were given the keys to a vacant room and carried our stuff across the site to another room, which hadn't been cleaned yet. I tested the the water temp in this room just to see whether the problem was only in our block. It didn't surprise me that there was no hot water here either (a complaint most reviewers had). I gave up after wasting around half an hour moving from room to room and ended up having a cold shower in my own room (luckily we were in London during summer). Apart from that, everything else was fine and we were charged the correct amount when we checked out. The hotel is in a quiet and convenient location. We didn't have breakfast included, but we found a little cafe which was only a 2 minute walk up the main road, which served a great hot breakfast for 3 pound.

The breakfast was ok, plenty to choose from, thought orange juice was foul. also make sure they don't try to charge you for english breakfast when you check out. we had booked it but they told us we had only booked a continental breakfast..... when you go down for breakfast there is a choice but you are not told that full english costs more! Another recommendation to the hotel is to get a lift installed ion the refurbished part of the hotel..... 6 flights of stairs 4 times a day is no fun for anyone, least of all the maids who have to drag up and down heavy loads of laundry!

The Padding Court Hotel in London is not a good choice no matter the price. We arrived at the hotel as part of a large family reunion of at least 60 people. I would have expected the hotel to be ready for our large party as they knew we were coming, and we were also 2 hours behind schedule due to a delayed flight. When we did arrive, the staff had no idea what to do with us. Getting our room keys and trying to find our luggage turned into a stressful event. Some people in our party had disabilites and had asked for rooms that did not require stair access but turned out being given rooms that required at least half a flight of stairs just to get to the front door. The manager and front desk staff were cold and indifferent and were never able to give us accurate information. When I asked if the changing of the guard was taking place a specific day, I was informed no only to arrive at Buckingham Palace with the changing of the guard going on. The rooms are terrible! I do mean terrible unless you are lucky enough to be a large family and given one of the suites across the street from the main hotel. A large renovation has just gone on making the rooms smaller than anything I have ever seen. My husband and I had to crawl across the bed to access either side of the room. There was not enough space for the 2 of us and a bag a piece especially since there was no place to put the bags. It looks like they took the size of a normal hotel room and cut it in half. The bathroom is even smaller with a stand up shower that can barely fit a 6'2\" man. The only pluses going for this hotel are the free internet access in the lounge and the buffet breakfast. The breakfast offers a large array of cereals, pastries, juices, fruit, eggs, and ham. The downside of breakfast is that the restaurant is located in the basement where too many tables have been crowded into a small space so you have to eat with your elbows attached to your side. Because of the renovations, other problems exist in other parts of the hotel. We heard stories about phones not working, the walls being too thin so every cough, laugh, or opening door could be heard by the 3 adjoining rooms, strong paint smells etc. If we could have changed hotels, we would have. The biggest plus is the location. The hotel is between 2 different tube stops, Padding and Lancaster Gate, which is conveinent.

It is in fact a very small basement room with one window looking into two other toilet windows and at the bottom of a dirty vertical gap about 8 feet square. Do not be tempted to open the windows as the downpipes for rainwatrer are corroded and leaking and the sound of even light rain cascading down wakes you up. This means you have to ensure the windows are closed. If you put the air-conditioning on it freezees up around 3'ish in the morning and makes a very loud dripping onto the carpet. (and lovely wet socks the next morning) The TV did not work initially and needed to be tuned into the 5 channels available and a couple of frozen digital channels. This takes about 10 mins every time, annoying if you come in wanting to see a particular program . Then again you would end up with a crick in your neck as the TV is installed at a slant. Why ?

It is true that the staff do not speak English. They are not polite and are not helpful. Thankfully, my husband and I travel internationally a lot and even with two small children are pretty self sufficient. I was annoyed that I requested an early checkin (as we had an all night flight) and a crib (I even emailed to confirm a week in advance, with no reply). They seemed to have confused our reservation...wanted us to have a double with no crib and wanted us to wait until 2:00 for check in time. I finally spoke up and said that we booked through British Air, booked a Triple with crib and an early checkin. They said that maybe we could get in around 1:00. Our room was a triple...it was neat and clean. The bathroom was large, I thought. Our crib was not waiting for us, we had to ask again for it. The biggest problem I have is that after I made the reservation (months ago), a week before my trip, I received an email from British Air saying that the hotel advised them that there would be some \"slight construction\" but that the workers were instructed to work only during \"regular business hours\" so as not to affect the guests. Listen. The construction is not limited to one area only. They start early in the morning. So you may be asleep at 7 am (that would be 2 AM eastern time!!!!!!!!) and suddenly a chainsaw starts right outside your window. Or you could be relaxing on a Saturday morning and at 7 am, someone hammers on the floor above you. The walls are super thin which I can deal with when it's only talking or tv on the other side of them but demolition is not something I want to hear first thing in the morning. Their construction project is extensive. They really should've shut down until they could finish but I get the feeling they are too cheap to do so.

A suite with air con, kitchen, Internet and comfy bed in a quiet location. Clean and modern. The hotel part of Paddington Court Hotel, used to be great value.

They the offered HER an anniversary special 0f 139 pounds a night and they would place flowers in the room and chocolates and serve breakfast On the bed. Such a deal!

Well, I have stayed in the Suites part of the hotel about 6 times so far since Spring and it is the cleanest, brightest, friendliest, most reasonably priced hotel in West London. Other hotels make all of these promises regarding their 'suite', but they never meet expectations. This place does! Since I stay so often now I have my favorite room and it has become my home away from home. It never disappoints. On the occasion that there is some reason I need to deal with the hotel staff for a problem, it is handled promptly and with great customer service! The Management is the best and I have heard other customers mention this as well - they want people to enjoy their stay, plan to return and tell others to do the same because they are proud of their hotel. I have referred associates here who usually stay at one of the large chain hotels and they prefer the suites here to those monstrosities.

My verdict: you can be better off at other hotels. Rooms were clean and nice so if you are lucky and go without a hitch, should be OK. It is when there is an issue that the hotel apparently has difficulty addressing it. My initial room was in the basement, (yuck) but not unacceptable, except that I found (very late at night) that the plug for the bathtub was missing, which made it unable to take a bath. Unfortunately, it was in the hours that maintenance was not in, so I had to make do with a shower after alerting reception, although it wasn't really what I deserved after 12 hours in the plane. I made sure they can follow up on it by also leaving a note in the room as well as at the reception as I left the hotel the next day. However, when I came back in the afternoon, although the room was already made and maintenance must have been in from 7:30am, the plug was still not there and no indication of replacement. I talked to reception, and after some conversation got another room which was much nicer and had a perfectly working bath. They helped me move, so I was almost about to forget about the not-so-nice night before. The next day I was attending a wedding and therefore spent time in the room until 1pm preparing. Housekeeping ladies came and asked when I wanted the room made, so I said \"After 2pm, please.\" They were having some difficulty with English, but pointed at their wristwatch so I pointed at 2pm and they appeared to have understood. Then another man came and asked the same question, so I told him the same thing. His English sounded natural, and I assumed the ladies sent him to confirm my instructions. However, upon returning to my room late at night, I found my room un-made, with a note stuck under the door saying \"did not clean because you instructed us not to disturb.\" Again, it was late at night so I had to make do by getting someone deliver clean towels etc. I made it clear about my displeasure, but there was no follow-up when I checked out the day after and I was past the point of caring anyway, just happy to leave.

What a huge mistake! I would never stay here again for free or even if they paid me! In fact, after seeing our rooms at the Paddington Court, we called our usual hotel in London, willing to pay full price to get out of this place, but at that late date they were already full. So we ended up staying for 2 unhappy nights. It was like staying in a bad youth hostel. The first room my mother got was one of the tiny basement rooms. It was dirty, looked out onto an airshaft, smelled heavily of cigarettes, and had the tiny shower mentioned in previous reviews. It was reached through a narrow dark hallway with rubber pipes/hoses (not sure what they were) dangling overhead out of the ceiling. We asked for a different room but were told they had none until the next day, so my husband ended up sleeping in that room to spare my mother. She and I shared the twin room, which really wasn't a lot better. It was a narrow room with two twin beds lined up foot to foot! The room also reeked of cigarettes, even though we had asked for non-smoking rooms. The toilet leaked and we both got our socks and slippers soaked from toilet water! When I called reception, they sent someone up who said all he could do was stuff some extra towels on the floor around the toilet! The bed linens were of questionable cleanliness, and the walls were absolutely filthy, covered with smudges and stains. There was a bare light bulb hanging over the \"desk\" with no lampshade. The room really was quite hideous. The next day we were given two \"better\" rooms. They were marginally better, but still very dreary, with dirty walls and one of the towels was filthy with a large brown smudge on it! I brought the towel down to reception and was told that the towel would be replaced. It never was. And one of the \"better\" rooms was on the 4th floor (really the 5th floor) and the lift was broken, so we had to walk up and down many flights of stairs. At breakfast we were shown the \"full English\" breakfast but were told we could only eat from the \"Continental\" side - tacky! All in all it was a terrible experience. Don't be fooled by the decent lobby and the nice lounge area. They are no reflection of the rooms you will be given.

I knew that European Hotels were small and upon reading the terrible reviews before I vacationed in London, I braced myself for what was to come. I was not disappointmed. It lived up to its reputation. I checked in with a group of 12 and alot of luggage. The staff in the hotel did not seem prepared for such a big check in. One person in particular was rude and informed us that the hotel had booked us all in smoking rooms (we had requested non smoking). The staff proceeded to swipe our charge cards to charge us for the rooms which had already been prepaid through our travel agent. We insisted on non smoking rooms and were told to give the staff a few minutes to find the rooms for us. We were told that we were getting the larger rooms because of the original error in booking smoking rooms. My boyfriend and I were put in a basement room. How we found the room and were able to find our way out everyday is surprising. The hotel is a maze of small hallways with multiple doors closing off the hallways. The lift, on top of that, was broken during our stay so we had to lug our luggage to and from the basement. Upon getting into the room we found the room to be small. It was very dark and smelled musty. The bedspreads and window treatments were also a very dark navy blue which did not help to brighten up the room. Our window was open to the outside and was at waist level where anyone could break in. We closed it and tried to turn on the air conditioning. It didn't work. We went upstairs to check with the staff and was told that the air conditioning did not work and to just keep our window open because no one would break in. The bathrooms were very small. The worst part of the bathroom was the shower which was literally 2x2. Everynight when taking a shower, I was assaulted by the shower curtain which clung to my body. There was no way to get away from it because the shower was so small. Water flooded the outside bathroom floor everynight. Since the shower curtain was so long, I learned the first night that it floated over the drain of the shower and caused the shower to fill up and overflow. If it was put on the outside of the shower the floor got wet. Being very conscientious of cleanliness, I wondered how many bodies this shower curtain had clung to before clinging to me everynight. I found the thought disgusting. I next noticed that there were two PVC pipes snaking along the wall and draining into the shower. I realized that one of the pipes was attached to the backside of the air conditioner and had the the air conditioner been working, I think would have drained condensation into the shower. The other PVC pipe came from the other side and originated from the tank of the toilet and drained out into the shower. I wondered how this could pass anytype of sanitary inspection. The bed was okay in terms of comfort, but when I initially pulled back the sheets I found hair (not ours as we had just checked in) on the sheets. I also found that the sheets were not changed the whole time that I was there and maybe this is customary to save on expense. I knew they were not changed because the same brown spot that was on my sheet remained there for the duration of my stay. The internet television service did not work and every night, usually after 11:30 p.m. a group of people staying on our floor would talk noisely in the hallways and slam doors. Our neighbors could be heard carrying on a very clear conversation. I usually don't write letters or reviews like this as I am easy to please but I felt that my experience was bad enough that anyone choosing to stay here needed to know what they could expect. I understand that the rates are affordable and I can deal with small, but cleanliness and good customer service are important. Please don't get me wrong, not all the staff was rude, in fact I really only experienced the initial check in person to be short with us. He seemed to change his attitude after another hotel representative (I think he may have been management) reassurred us that the room situation would be worked out and thanked us for our patience. Then out of nowhere a number of employees came out to assist with our bags.

The beds were very uncomfortable and the bedspreads and curtains were very tasteless. We were only given a few sheets which were rough and itchy.

Even though there was a thermostat on the wall. But my all time favorite is...i brought a calling card with me to call home to say I made it. Even though there is a big label on the phone saying they accept all calling cards. THEY accept NO CALLING CARDS. But all those were minor details compared to the staff. Not all of them but mostly the ones working during the day shift were the laziest and rudiest. We left a note for extra towels and coffee creamer everyday.

Ok, so maybe not that bad...but Best Western really ought to look at this hotel and considering pulling its franchise. Don't let this bad hotel put you off of Best Western entirely, I stayed at a perfectly nice Best Western in Paris. Here was what happened to us -- we arrived early in the day and waited in a long line to check in. Their staff is all Indian and we could hardly understand a word they said...and their systems seem to be mostly manual. I didn't expect the rooms to be ready, and they weren't but the hotel did offer to store the luggage in a secure room. So far so good...except for the garbled language problems. Then when we came back after dinner for our room we collected our bags -- we had to get them *by ourselves* out of the little room -- and went up to our rooms. On first glance they weren't too bad. We had two twin rooms and they put us at least on the same floor. When I sat down on the bed I almost went down to the floor! The mattress was up against the wall, so the side of the bed to sit on was completely sprung. When I say that the springs were sticking up, it's an understatement. There was absolutely no padding on the mattress and it seemed as if I was just sleeping straight on the springs. It was late, I was tired...so I toughed it out for the night. The bathroom -- ha ha ha. The shower -- ha ha ha. The next day we asked if the bed could be changed, but they made us change rooms. This couldn't be done immediately, fair enough, but I had to come back to the room to change clothes after lunch and they didn't have my luggage moved so I had to do that myself. The new room...no better. The bed was extremely bad and uncomfortable. I didn't get any sleep at all. The neighborhood, by the way, is very nice. Paddington is close by and there are other tube stops nearby. Hyde Park is just down the street and if you like to walk you can include Hyde Park in your stroll. There are some excellent pubs and restaurants and a couple of internet cafes nearby too. Breakfast: Don't bother with the hotel breakfast. If you can book room only it's worth it to find breakfast elsewhere. Theirs is rubbish. Bottom line...don't stay at this hotel. If you must, ask to see the room first, and try the bed, before you commit to a room. If the first one they give you isn't any good then leave yourself some time to find another or get another hotel.

The Front Desk staff, while very professional, were not very responsive; requests for extra pillows, etc. were forgotten.

We arrived, tired, at the end of a long trip, looking forward to a good sleep before our flight home. This wasn't to be. The first man in line as we arrived was berating the frazzled desk clerk about his accomodations and was wanting an immediate room change, which couldn't be accomodated. Next up were two businessmen, who were told there was a problem with their rooms and they would need to be put up in another hotel. After a lengthy, heated exchange, they stormed out of the hotel, cancelling their 'reservation'. Next up, we were also told that there was a room problem, but they were going to put us up in an upgraded, four star hotel and they would pay for the taxi over. Sounded good. However, we waited much longer than an hour for the ride. Turns out they couldn't just use a taxi service, it had to be a company they have an arrangement with, so we waited, waited, waited, with the clerk intermittently phoning them, pleading with them to come as the list of unhappy travellers continued to grow. When we finally arrived at the hotel, well after midnight, we were horrified. The 'four star hotel' we had been promised was under major renovation and in the dark all that could be seen was scaffolding. Our sound sleep was not to be. There was no air conditioning and the room was stifling. The window wouldn't budge more than an inch. The front desk person came up and fought with the window and also couldn't get it to open. His solution: open the door to the hallway to let cool air in. By then it's about 1 a.m., so that wasn't a particularly viable option. And sure enough, in the morning, construction started up, so there was no quiet and no privacy as construction people walked right by the window. The only good thing about our experience was the camaraderie developed with other exhausted people who were waiting with us, caught in the same predicament.

The hotel appears lovely from outside and the lobby is quite nice, too, but on the first night there I was waiting to check in and I received an omen that I was about to experience an awful stay. A couple there was complaining about how they had requested coffee 48 hours ago and they had called several times to remind the concierge but no one did anything about it. It was obvious that they were upset and the concierge really did nothing to help them out, it seemed he couldn't care less. He wouldn't answer them when they asked for the manager's name, nor would he give them a contact number. The couple was enraged and they left fuming. I thought at first that maybe it was just them but then that same night I discovered that we didn't have a blowdryer so I went to the front desk to request one and the concierge there said there wasn't one available because all the rooms were booked at the moment and he would need to wait until someone had left the next morning so that I could have one then. I found that hard to believe but went along with it. So I called the next morning around 6:30 and asked for the blowdryer. I was told then that they would deliver one to my room in 15 minutes. Half an hour passed by and there was still no sign of the blowdryer so I called again and this time another person answered and he told me that it's \"in the drawer\"...I asked which drawer, and he continued to be vague so I just hung up. It turns out that it was in the dresser drawer right beneath the TV (which by the way didn't even work properly) but I couldn't understand why I wasn't told that the other night when I initially asked for it. Anyway, we had this other problem with the staff there. Besides the fact that most of them 1) were rude and disrespectful and 2) were totally incompetent, it seems that they actually went out of their way to make our stay difficult. We needed a room for one extra night since we were spending part of our vacation in Paris and we were told that we wouldn't have a problem getting a room. The next day, however, when we tried to book something, this other receptionist, a short Indian woman whose name I couldn't catch, told us that we were mistaken, there was nothing available for the night we requested. Obviously we were furious because not only were we given the wrong information the previous night but she did absolutely NOTHING to help us, and her sour expression showed no sign of empathy at all for our situation. We decided to speak to someone else the next day and the assistant manager, Roy, handled the matter but he did put on a very arrogant and snooty attitude. He didn't give us any confirmation of a room but merely signed a letter saying that something was available and that was all. So we came back from Paris and apparently there was a mix-up because they couldn't find anything booked under the cardholder's name (my friend's, who was staying with me) and they told us that they were fully booked for that night so we couldn't stay there. Fortunately, we were able to get assistance from the manager there who was really a blessing. If it weren't for him we would have been left with no place to stay our last night in London. Not only was he corteous and kind but he also went out of his way to do what he could for us. It turned out that the room was booked under my name although it would have saved us a lot of time and trouble if Roy had told us that to begin with, but anyway, we got to stay at this 4 star hotel instead of at Paddington for the same rate that was promised to us, so in that sense we lucked out. Even our transportation to the other hotel was provided for us thanks to the manager (I can't remember his name because I lost the business card but I think it was something like Peader; he had a slim build, average height, and red hair). Really, I can't fully express just how terrible the service was at this hotel and the manager was the only person who stood out as someone who cared about the customers. If you can settle with bad service then stay there because it is in a good location but I would rather stay somewhere else that has a nice and friendly staff. I'll admit that the rooms were decent but still small, and the TV gave us problems (it wouldn't turn on at times). Overall, I would have to say that it's really not worth it to stay at this hotel because it will ruin your trip by making you disgruntled twoards Londoners thanks to the poor service and attitude at the BWPCH.", "Date": "April 7, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Jose, CA", "Title": "\u201cIf you love to sleep with bugs and bad service...\u201d", "Author": "berfah", "ReviewID": "UR1756864", "Content": "Deceptive. Upon arrival to the Paddington Best Western, the lobby looked clean and quaint. The staff was curt and uninviting (but that could just be Londoners). When we arrived at our room, other boarders mentioned that the electricity was out in their rooms and they were waiting for over an hour and had called the concierge multiple times. So we waiting in our cramped toom. The room looked clean, but upon getting into bed, I noticed a cockroach next to my pillow, then later in the bathroom. That was enough to disgust me, but I sucked it up. Meanwhile, our bathroom had a sign up that said, \"DO NOT USE\" and we were worried that there was a problem so we called management and they said not to worry about it. Any reasonable person would take the sign down if there wasn't any problems. We were reluctant to use it, but ended up conceeding. Then I went in search of a hairdryer. This is where the problem escalated. We didn't find one in the room so called the concierge again and noted that to them. They said it was in our drawers, but we mentioned that we couldn't find it. So I went to bed with a wet head. Then in the morning before we left for the day we AGAIN notified them that we did not have a hairdryer and AGAIN they said it was in our drawers and we said it was not in there. So they said that they would take care of it. By the time we arrived back at night we decided to stop bothering them and hoped that it would be there by then. Again, no sign of a hairdryer. So I called the concierge AGAIN and he said that his colleague went looking for one, but never returned. He in the end brought me to another room to actually use the hair dryer before the new occupants arrived. I was furious by then, but too tired to complain to their manager about this frustrating situation. I had to ask them FIVE times for a *** hairdryer! I was afraid to even ask for roomservice after that! Besides finding bugs in my bed for the rest of my stay there, we opted to stay out of the hotel as much as possible. If you can find a better hotel with better service, I would highly recommend it.
