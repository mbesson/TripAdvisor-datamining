{"Reviews": [{"Content": "hotel is ok, connection to Firenze so so We stayed in this hotel during our Italy tour, as a base for exploring Florence. Since we had a car we were worried about staying in Florence and parking there. The hotel is a few minutes walk from the train station, where you can reach Florence in 20 minutes. Trains, however, are not that frequent, especially on weekends, so it can take about an hour to get to central Florence. In the one time we drove to Florence, we had no problems finding a parking place, so I would recommend staying closer to Florence.The hotel itself was decent and clean. The breakfast room, however, was very crowded, especially on the first day, and was understaffed, so one had to wait ages to get a cup of coffee. Otherwise, the breakfast was pretty extensive. The reception also recommended a restaurant in Prato, itself an handsome city, which turned out to be rather good. The night receptionist, however, was not as welcoming. The first evening we called for an extra pillow, and he asked us to come down for it, as he cannot leave his post. We came down later, and then he said that the storage room has been closed and he cannot help us. The second night, when we came he was not there at all. We waited a few minutes, and after he did not appear, I took the key to our room myself, which made him pretty upset when he finally showed up.", "Date": "May 25, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR594235285", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "YigalM"}, {"Content": "A Real Find!!!! Would definately stay at this hotel again!The room are tiny however after hearing so many horror stories about accomodation in italy i was so pleasntly suprised when i walked into my room; compact but clean, pleasant and perfectly adequate. I stayed in a single room; however another member of our party had double room which was substatially more spacious and quite airy too.The hotel, athough not in the historic town centre is very well situated and walking distance to the hub of prato. I would thourougly reccomed basing your self at this hotel even if you plan to holiday in florence; it is so well priced and only 10 mins by train to florence (trains run about every 15-20mins to florence whilst i was there). However, do be carefull when catching a train from florence as not all stop at prato (i ended up in bologna on my first attempt). that said, the train line that runs past prato also runs through many well-known tuscan towns so its very well located. Prato is an industrial city, however the town centre is picture-post card perfect. The hotel states that its 'across the road from the train station' which is a bit of dramatic liscence; its about a 10 minute walk when your doing it with lugguage and its a bit painfull if you have a lot of it (as i did)The reception staff (who i think are the men who run the hotel) are absolutely wonderfull; really helpfull (which is unusual for italy ;p) and friendly.The rooms have everything you need with a suprisingly large bathroom (compared to what i found in rome; not per se). toiletries are provieded, and housekeeping are fantatstic too; the bathroom did have a one of those hand-held shower head things which i found quite difficult to get used to and consequently drenched the bathroom every time i had a shower!!!!The buffet breakfast was sufficient by regular hotel standards however GREAT by italian standards. They had a fairly good variety (which i found to be generally lacking at other places in italy) of simple, home-cooked options and some beautifull home made cakes that reminded me of things my nona makes!All in all a great experience!!!! two thumbs up!", "Date": "Dec 12, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR418407460", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "jlsar1"}, {"Content": "Great value Would stay here again. Although the bedrooms are small,all decor, furnishings and bathroom fittings etc very new. Great staff and the inclusive buffet breakfast was excellent. Different buffet dinner each evening for all inclusive price (including glass of wine 12 Euros...lovely and each as much as you like.)Only complaint...no electric kettle in the bedroom. They obviously are not used to the strange habits of the English!. The manager said he would put the suggestion to his boss. The best value hotel we have stayed in on the Continent. Prato is a pleasant town, not geared to tourists so the atmosphere is really'Italian'. 10 mins on the motorway from Florence.Well done Expedia for finding this.", "Date": "Oct 30, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR532656384", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Toxop"}, {"Content": "Comodo e pulito   showReview(21170013, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR731731409", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Milano78"}, {"Content": "Bon rapport qualit\u8305 prix   showReview(18542458, 'full');", "Date": "Jul 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR806312984", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Vicino alla stazione dei treni...   showReview(16727350, 'full');", "Date": "Apr 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR715993009", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "L'abergo \u732b in posizione comoda...   showReview(16725158, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 31, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR751840274", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Ho prenotato una camera...   showReview(11363226, 'full');", "Date": "Dec 3, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR429825201", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Ottimo rapporto qualit\u813f prezzo   showReview(10002830, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 25, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR766839547", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Maxuel"}, {"Content": "Albergo buono, letto comodo...   showReview(11363227, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 14, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR768509337", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Veramente un ottimo hotel se si...   showReview(11363228, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 4, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR703280285", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Nous avions constat\u8305, sur...   showReview(11363229, 'full');", "Date": "May 14, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR120025060", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Tr\u732bs d\u8305cevant autant au niveau...   showReview(11363230, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 14, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR860093081", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Davvero molto buono il rapporto...   showReview(11363232, 'full');", "Date": "May 6, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR944892200", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Ottima posizione (zona centro...   showReview(11363233, 'full');", "Date": "May 4, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR849295146", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "La posizione \u732b tranquilla...   showReview(11363234, 'full');", "Date": "Feb 20, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR452558075", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d296845-r5225686-Art_Milano_Hotel-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "296845", "Price": "$101"}}
