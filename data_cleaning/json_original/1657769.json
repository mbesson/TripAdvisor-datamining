I carefully read all the reviews about the property and was a bit concerned by some of the negative reviews. However, we chose to keep our booking. We booked through the Mistik property management (www.aldeathai.com.mx/us) website. They were very responsive to our questions prior to our travel. The property has a mix of condo owners who live in their condos and others who rent out their condos. Not all owners use the Mistik property management company. We met our neighbours who owned and lived in their suite - they were quite friendly. The location of the hotel is great, Kool beach and Mamitas beach clubs are steps away. Our rate included breakfast at either place (Kool beach's was better than Mamita's) and chairs/umbrella at those beach clubs. The suite itself was nice and spacious, like a mid grade finish to a modern N American condo. The big pros to the property are the location, that it is modern, the suites are large, and ours was well maintained and kept very clean (Suite 240). The condo pool is lovely. I thought the property itself was well maintained (pool, poolside chairs, lobby, etc.). The cons are that the internet bandwith is POOR, and I needed to use the internet (despite being on holiday I still had to check in with work for about 1/2 hour/day). The speed of the wireless was at times like dial up which was a big time waster, although I could waste it by the pool. Our bathroom was treacherous, the whole bathroom gets wet and there is no way to prevent it. While not a problem for us, if someone had some mobility issues it would have been a serious problem. The AC was loud but worked very well. This property, because of its mix of owners and renters, is not run like a typical hotel. You're more or less on your own, but other than the internet we had a few small issues that were quickly resolved by the Mistik property management people. I thought they did a great job. I would stay here again. I think users who post on this property should identify their suite and the booking agency they used because my sense is that the experience is quite variable depending on the property management company involved. I am not sure I would classify the hotel as a \"luxury condohotel\" and the level of service is not similar to that of any luxury hotel I have stayed in.

We called 3 times about the A/C not functioning properly and once because they turned off the water in the entire unit for no reason. There was also no shade on our upstairs patio so we couldn't really use it in the heat. We also had to call at least 4-5 days to find out if the maid was even coming (after 4pm!).

There are a lot of good reasons to rent here, especially the location, but beware of who you rent from. You can rent a unit through the Mistik VIP service on the ground level. You will pay a premium but you can be sure that you will have a unit that is professionally managed and will only suffer from some modest design flaws of the architect/builder. But if you rent through an individual or a local rental service to get a better price then you are rolling the dice. Before I knew the difference, I took the second option and got screwed by the owner of unit #303, Carla Hammeken and her local agent, Oscar Lloyd. We arrived at the designated 1pm time and were not given keys until 3pm. We entered and found a three bedroom penthouse suite that had not been cleaned in the two weeks since the last tropical storm. There was mildew on every surface of the unit. By 9pm they had one bedroom clean. Two days later, when the rest of our family arrived, the whole place was clean but we lacked a full set of cutlery, plates and cooking pans. The clean water dispenser was broken. There was neither toilet paper nor paper towels. There were not enough bath nor beach towels for six adults. Half of the interior lights were dead (I had to buy light bulbs and re-wire two lamps to get adequate lights for the living room). Seven out of eight roof deck lights were dead, as was the circulating pump in our private pool. There were no tables and torn furniture cushions on the deck After six days of complaints we were finally given a few mis-matched towels but no other problems were addressed. I asked for a refund of some of our payment but the agent, Oscar Lloyd, refused. Later, he was sufficiently indiscreet to complain by email to another local realtor who is a friend, saying that we were being unreasonable. What is truly unforgivable is that we made this reservation three months ago so there was no mistake about when we would arrive in order to meet minimal expectations. They did not care about us once they had our money, $3500 for ten days. They even had sent us pictures taken of a different unit. Once they have your money you are out of luck.

It's rented out through Bric Vacation Rentals so we had to check in at a main location as they have many propeties in Playa. We were assigned a personal concierge who we could call anytime for anything. Sounded great but was very unreliable. We stayed in a Penthouse and expected as much. Our rooftop view to the ocean was great except the rooftop terrace next to us was very unkept. Moldy cusions pilled up and maintenence equiptment out. The entire complex had a worn feel to it. Lots of paint chipping and holes in the drywall. There was a dead bird by one of the main stairways that layed there for more than a day before one of the staff removed it. As we swam in the main pool, a broken fan repeatedly hit a nearby beam making a loud noise. That went on for hours. There was a broken light bulb by the only elevator. That took 5 phone calls and 2 trips to the front desk (3 days) to fix. We had a broken towel bar the first day. Hair dryer broken too. The shower set up was a joke. No curtain on a raised spa type shower so the floor got flooded the first day. We used a couple towels to clean it up but they were not replaced the following day because it's their policy to change towles on the 3rd day. We spent 4 nights in Tulum first so when we arrived in Playa we were nearly out of clean clothes. We were told they would set up a laundry service but we didn't get our clothes back until our final day in Playa. It was just one thing after another. Upon our return, I contacted the person who I booked the vacation with. I explained the situation and was told they would compensate me for all the problems we had. I never asked for compensation but it was offered. I just wanted them to know about our poor experience. I have yet to be contacted by their management for any sort of compensation or any sort of explanation or apology.

We were asked to pay a rather big deposit which troubled me a little, but there was no problem at check out: We got our deposit back without any hassle. The condo is huge and has a big bathroom with hair dryer and iron board, a well-equipped, totally new kitchen, a bedroom with a comfortable bed and finally a small, cosy balcony with partial ocean view. You can't sit on the balcony in the morning because it's way to hot (it's placed on the sunny side of the building), but that's really details. The furniture and chosen colours of the room are really appealing to the eye, and the same is the case for the rest of the building (the pool, reception, out door areas). On the downside you could say that the 'thai theme' is a bit unauthentic (I want to feel that I'm in Mexico : ) ) or at least unnecassary. The location is great, although the beach in this part of Playa del carmen is a bit crowded and primarily filled with young partying people who wants to be seen - we are talking lots of silicone boobs and italian guys showing off ; ) Remember that you can use the sun beds on the beah for free, when living at Aldea Thai, and also you get a rather big discount on beverages and food at the nearest restaurant on the beach (can't remember the name, sorry), but you'll have to ask yourself to get the discount.

Stunning interior, amazing decor, detail, quality and views, penthouse is very nice!!! Not to mention the private roof deck...private pool....what else can you ask for....im very impressed. Very upscale. And off course its the perfect location, has to be one of the best beach clubs and hottest beach ambiance i seen yet in all of Mexico.

We had a partial view of the ocean as well as the side street that led to Kool Beach. Needless to say, this is the place to be if you want to party and be close to the beach. I didn't really notice the loud music, then again we were there to party so it didn't bother me. Because of the proximity to Kool Beach and Mamitas and considering the music they play and the volume they play it at, unless you like house or dance music, I wouldn't recommend staying here. If you like that kind of music, this is the place for you. It is a couple of blocks from 5th avenue, but nothing too inconvenient for a walk. Taxis were easy to find in the area. There are a couple restaurants below the resort on ground level as well as a liquor store just a few steps up the street. We inquired about breakfast and they directed us to Mamitas beach club just next door. Breakfast began at 8 am. Wi-Fi worked great in the rooms and were free with our room.

The staff was quite pleasant and tried to be helpful. The pool was large and very nice and uncrowded throughout our visit. The room was well appointed with tile floors and attractive furniture. The shower was great - lots of water pressure. We could see the ocean from our (small) balcony. The hotel is located close to the beach and a short walk to the heart of the town - restaurants, shops, etc. The TV worked well and the internet connection was good and free. Downside: The place next door is a beach bar that plays very loud from about 8:30am until after midnight. The pulsing beat was monotonous and penetrated every fiber of our beings all day long. There is little staff - they show a pool bar, but it was not always staffed. There is a concierge desk that was never staffed. The bed was rock hard. That may be good for some. I like a hard mattress, but this one took the cake. Did I mention the music? The balcony was small - no chairs or room for them. And there was only one small side chair in the room. And when the bar closed, some of the other residents in their rooftop patio played the same music non-stop all night long. A real bonus. There are really no amenities - no restaurant, etc. so you need to go off site for meals. So, if you are under 30 and want a non-stop party hotel, this is definitely the place. It is a party hotel. If you're not, and if you have kids, stay far away from this place. We saw one poor family with kids at the pool one day - that's it.

The only complaint I would give about the rooftop is that if your group is loud and rowdy, like mine, you will get complaints from the \"neighbors\" who live there or staying there :( other than that everything else was GREAT:) The staff was very friendly and helpful.

There weren't many reviews when we booked our stay on Orbitz ($124/night), but we decided to take a chance, and I am so glad we did! The hotel itself is beautiful, with obviously new construction and cool Asian touches everywhere. And it's perfectly situated: at the northern tip of the tourist area, 2 blocks off of 5th - close enough to walk to everything on 5th or even into town, but completely peaceful at night. We found the service to be extremely friendly, from the valets to the concierge to the front desk. Gabriel was particularly helpful (and he's always there - we wondered if management ever gives him a day off!). We had only booked a King room (those are the small ones), but were graciously offered an upgrade to a larger double room with a pool view when we checked in. My only concern was the noise from the pool, but I needn't have worried - the window panes are so thick that you can't hear a peep from the outside, even when the pool bartender is playing music. The hotel has all the amenities that are so common in America but not always a given in a foreign country: free parking, free wireless, a hairdryer, etc. Our bathroom was large and we even had a little hallway area with lots of closet space. The hotel is less than a block from the beach, and the concierge can give you 50% off coupons for chairs and a palapa at Mamita's Beach Club (knocking the price down from 90 mx to 45 mx). The criticisms we had were all small and easily fixable, and I'm confident that as the hotel matures, some or all of these will be addressed: - In the bathroom: showers lack sufficient hot water (at full blast, you've got about 5 minutes), no shower soap is provided (just tiny facial soaps that work as hand soaps), and the sinks are more form than function (the previous reviewer was spot-on when he said the water gets all over the counter) - At the pool: I get that they don't want a silent pool area, but techno music at 2 pm (particularly at the volume the bartender plays) isn't what most tourists are looking for. Frank Sinatra/Tony Bennett (or even American top 40) would be better, and at a lower volume so that people can nap or read peacefully if they wish. Also, beach towels would be a really nice addition so that guests don't have to re-use the bath towels (I think beach towels are included in the high-end rooms, but not the others). - Not a grumble, just a suggestion: Even if a restaurant isn't possible, an onsite bar that would be available to guests in the evening would be a great addition. There's a beautiful lounge near check-in, but we didn't ever see anyone using it; we would have loved to grab drinks there before heading out for dinner. But of course, there are so many nearby bars and restaurants that the lack of one onsite is hardly a problem - it would just be nice to have. Given those very minor complaints, I suppose this is technically a 4.5 star review rather than a 5 star. But given the amazing price we paid, I felt that Aldea Thai more than exceeded our expectations.

However, the service at this place was horrible and they misrepresent themselves. I will mention pros and cons. Pros: 1) Place looks chic. Like a Thai spa. 2) The shared grounds are well kept and maintained. The glass is clean, the doors and lobby are clean. 3) The location two blocks from the beach, but Club Kool blocks direct access. 4) There is parking included in the room rate, which was important to us. 5) The maids were great and tried to go above and beyond. Cons: 1) We were given a room in the basement even though the hotel was empty. 2) The smell. The horrible smell. The bathroom had a drain built into the bottom, as many bathrooms do in Mexico, but the smell emanating from it smelled like horrible sewage. We could not breathe in the room. We kept the door closed. 3) The room rate advertises a DVD player. Our room did not have one. (We normally stay in budget locations without a TV or without other amenities, but we want what we pay for). When we went to speak to the receptionist about it, he did nothing the first night of our stay. We went again and asked why our room did not have the DVD player as per Expedia or their own data. They told us we were wrong. They did not even try to fix it nor even explain it - they just told us we were wrong. I speak fluent Spanish so I made sure what they said was what I was hearing in both English and Spanish. I told them I saw it on the website. They said we were wrong and that Expedia was wrong. I told them that they were the ones who put the information on Expedia and the room descriptions in the first place. They still were rude and not conciliatory at all. 4) The sewage pipe that runs through the underground parking leaked all over our rental car. 5) The in-room safe was completely broken and it took them 2 days to respond to our request. After they came, it was still broken. 6) The construction was poor. There were leaks and puddles everywhere. The electric outlets in the room did not work. There were cracks in the ceiling. (We could deal with this in a low budget, older hotel, but this hotel was constructed in 2009). 7) Please note that the hotel was empty and there were only three other rooms filled when we were there. We went on vacation during a busy time of year. 8) The main objective of Aldea Thai is to sell rooms and not be a hotel or have common customer service. This is not a good hotel and should not be used as one. There are so many wonderful options in Playa del Carmen. The whole Maya Riviera is great. I have been to the Yucatan three times in the past few years (twice this year). We are going back to the Yucatan in two days!
