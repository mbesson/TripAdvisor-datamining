First of all I'd advise people to stay in the Beyo\u00c4\u0178lu-area when visiting Istanbul. There's lots to see and do in the Sultanahmet area, but I personally would not enjoy staying there. There are also lots and lots of great cafes, restaurants and bars in Beyo\u00c4\u0178lu, and Triada is close to many of them. This hotel is small, and consists of 11 rooms. I suspect the top floor penthouse is exceptional, the other rooms look pretty much like you would expect from the pictures. We had a backside room with no view, but the jacuzzi made up for the lack of scenery. If you have a room in the other side of the hotel, you'll have a view but also a lot of noise from the busy Istiklal street, so I'd rather go for a quiet room. Service was good, very friendly and attentive but not everyone was great at speaking english. They also offered to send a shuttle service to pick us up at the airport, but at 30 euros that was far too expensive, as a regular taxi should only cost 30-50 turisk liras. Only thing that was a little bothersome was that it's not very soundproof, so arguments from other rooms could get pretty annoying... Oh, and like other commenters point out: just skip the hotel breakfast and go to one of the nearby cafes and get yourself some food. Overall, great location, good service, clean and comfortable rooms. And at that price?

You can probably hear music from the disco across the street on weekends but for the most part, it's quiet. The rooms are beautifully decorated (ours had paintings from Klimt), clean and spacious. The most wonderful feature of the Triada has to be the staff which was pleasant, friendly and helpful. From the reception desk attendant to the lovely lady setting up the breakfast table. They went out of their way to make sure that we were comfortable, answered all our questions and made wonderful suggestions on where to eat and shop. My only complaint about this lovely hotel is the fact that breakfast is limited. Otherwise, I would not mind staying at the Triada again.", "Date": "January 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cExactly what we needed!!!\u201d", "Author": "PeggyR3", "ReviewID": "UR118082172", "Content": "The hotel was exactly at the center of everything. Istiklal str- The shopping street!!!- is 4 seconds away. Taksim square-where metro and buses and tram begin- is1 minute away. All kinds of restaurants are nearby. The residence is in excellent condition.11 rooms only, so it was like we were home. Everything in the hotel is new. Great matresses and great jacuzzi in the room (not in all rooms).The stuff was great and helpfull. We booked a room in the back side which has got no view AT ALL but it's extremely quite-exactly what you need after a full day walking around a city like this. You need to sleep, you don't want to sit outside in the balcony. The only thing that was poor was the brakfast but with a hundred places around to eat, you don't need the breakfast.

With our 7 years old, we did not want to have to go to the restaurant twice a day for 8 days. Actually the kitchenette was no more that a tea making facility and a small fridge. There was no natural light in the room as its only window gave onto the huge air conditioning block. This was no good value for money any longer. In the morning, we therefore got up and ready as soon as possible to enjoy breakfast downstairs...but there was no dining room! Fortunately the very friendly receptionist kindly organised for us to have breakfast at a cafe nearby! After protesting for the room, we were offered the 'executive suite' for a modest supplement. However, there was only 2 single beds, still no facility to cook or heat up food and the no shade on the terrace. That's a shame as there was potential for this room but it was not well used.", "Date": "September 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Europian", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and excellent service\u201d", "Author": "ferozde", "ReviewID": "UR30015865", "Content": "I stayed in Triada residence and I really liked it.
