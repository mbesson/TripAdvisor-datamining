On the day we arrived i called them after 6pm to ask if they could arrange a cake, balloons, flowers and champagne to be sent the next morning as it was my husbands birthday, given that it was such late notice i didnt think they would manage to get everything but they exceeded my expectations and everything was lovely, especially the flowers.

Cecile, the Events Sale Manager, was extremely flexible in accommodating our various (many!) needs and requests and helped us to make this a truly unforgettable experience. Even as we had additional requests in the days and hours before the wedding ceremony, she was always extremely available, kind and responsive. It certainly made us feel that our wedding was in safe hands. As we live abroad, it was crucial to have such a great professional taking care of everything. We were touched by her commitment, as shown during the preparation period as well as during the big day itself. As for the venue, the different function rooms were simply gorgeous. The staff did a terrific job throughout the day (especially thanks to Ingrid and her team). Our guests were wowed not only by the unbelievably delicious food and the museum-like setting, but also the quality of the service. We felt that the whole event could not have been more perfect. To come back to the food, we had the opportunity to do a tasting dinner one week before the wedding in one of Shangri-La's restaurants. Again, outstanding service and great, great, great food. We stayed at the hotel for three nights. They very kindly upgraded us to a stunning duplex suite with, we believe, the best view in Paris and a very large terrace overlooking the Eiffel Tower. Again, service was impeccable throughout the entire stay (in-room breakfast in such setting is a real treat). It was a bit difficult to go back to the real world after having spent three days in such heavenly environment. If you are considering organising your wedding in a hotel in Paris, we would strongly recommend Shangri-La for its sheer beauty as well as its flawless service. We visited all major hotels in Paris before finally discovering Shangri-La (as they had just opened). For us, it was an obvious choice.

Shangri-La was not on the Amex list, but it certainly should be! This was by far the finest hotel experience we have ever had. This hotel should be Number 1 in Paris! As an accountant and number cruncher at heart, I realized that the newness of the hotel and thus few reviews is why it is currently Number 82. It won't take any time for this hotel to rise to the top! The staff was amazing, especially the concierge desk. They could not have been more helpful or friendly. Each day the helped us with an itinerary and reservations, and often had a complimentary car take us to dinner. The time they took explaining the map actually made me familiar and comfortable traveling ourselves throughout Paris. Keep the map on you, because this is a very new hotel (Dec 2010) and several cab drivers have never been there. (the hotel address is on the front of the map) The rooms are gorgeous and the Eiffel views are incredible. Our room 306 was a Duplex Terrace Suite facing the Eiffel. We could see the beautiful tower from bed! Loved the heated floors in the bathroom too. There was a nice fruit arrangement always available. We found the property is in a very easy spot for traveling the city. We walked several days and also became familiar with the bus lines and metro with great ease. Our first night the concierge desk got us in to the Jules Verne, the posh restaurant on the 3rd floor of the Eiffel Tower. This was impressive, as they can have a 3 month advance reservation list! It turned out to be a very lucky thing for me as we got engaged there that night! Be sure not to miss the Shang Palace.

Entering this one-time Palace built in 1896, previously lived in by the Grand nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte, one cannot avoid being impressed by the architecture - and how so beautifully adorned it is with fabulous flower arrangements. Smiling faces welcome you from behind the Reception counter, and although the majority of staff are European, you sense undertones of Asian hospitality, transporting you to the best of what is back home. My wife and I glance at each other - and silently acknowledge , \"now this is nice\". Escorted to our attractively appointed room with a direct view of the Eiffel Tower, you become automatically geo-tagged of the location. Space was adequate, everything was where it should be, and it just worked. You opened the desk drawer and there was a good supply of stationary items. You plugged the supplied Ethernet cable into your laptop, and you were effortlessly on line and for free. And with a flick of the wrist, you were enjoying a nice cup of Welcome Chinese tea poured from a lovely tea service, reminiscent of what we did back in the mid 70's when I worked at (the now defunct) Hong Kong Hilton. A quick freshen up, and it was time to rendezvous with a friend for a pre-dinner drink in the Hotel's bar. A lovely cozy room made complete with superb background music, and very comfy surroundings. Service was impeccable and friendly - and the snacks accompanying the drinks complemented the experience in this intimate Parisian location. Awaking from a good night's sleep, my wife and I decided to take breakfast (especially since it was inclusive in the room rate) and sauntered down to the breakfast room, aptly named La Bauhinia - the Hong Kong emblem. In all the excitement and rushing around, we inadvertently were still running on UK time. Due to this irresponsible oversight, we arrived just before 11am thinking it was 10am - and I fleetingly noticed that the tables seemed to be more laid up for lunch than breakfast. That being said, we announced we were there for breakfast, and after a pregnant pause, the Greeter said, \"they were in fact getting ready for lunch - but it's no problem, we will take care of you\". WOW we thought - that was so nicely handled, and it could so easily have gone the other way - south - but thankfully, it didn't. A table was quickly cleared, and we were offered a sumptuous fare. It was a lovely experience, and my wife said they were the best-poached eggs ever. The server was so polite and friendly and had a lovely demeanor. I can't help thinking she must have been exposed through deep training to the Shangri-La way, and if so - kudos to the folks who did it. Checkout was very well handled, and a short exit interview conducted. I was asked if I needed a taxi, and confirmed we did - to take us to the Mandarin Oriental across town. Since there may be a delay, the Concierge suggested waiting in one of the small lounges off the main Lobby area, and we did just that for the first ten minutes. Getting anxious I ventured back to the Lobby and one of the Reception staff noticed me, enquired if all was ok and apologized for the delay even though it was not her problem. She then followed-up with the Concierge. A few minutes later the cab arrived, and we were off to the Mandarin, for part two of our Paris adventure.

I have to say, expectations are very high as we were paying 650 Euro per night for a standard room. As we arrived, we were all blown away by the grandness of the hotel. The entrance to the hotel was palace like, we were treated like royalty. Check-in was a breeze, took less than 3 minutes, and the receptionist personally guided us to our rooms, welcomed us with hot Chinese Tea along with fresh fruits and bottled apple juice. The standard room was everything we had asked for. Advertised as 37-42 sqm, we weren't sure which size it was, but it was definitely large. It had a walk-in closet which fit all our luggages comfortably, and a huge safe deposit box. The safe deposit box was large enough to fit a laptop standing up, which was amazing for an in-room hotel safe. The bathroom was spotless, clean and new, just how we want it. Everything looked brand new. Bathroom was also generously sized with 2 wash basins, an LCD built into the mirror, a spacious shower with rain forest or normal shower head comfortable enough for 2 adults, an individual toilet room with its own door, and a full sized bathtub. The room itself was also very nicely decorated, mostly a French decor fused with Oriental touches. The windows were very large and the curtains were of very high quality, no sunlight bled through in the morning from the sides, the top, or the bottom of the floor, which is rare these days in hotels. Breakfast was sumptuous, and my advice would be to get it included in the room rate, its truly luxurious. Rather than the usual buffet style breakfast, this was a personal American breakfast, but there was nothing American about it. It was a la carte style, the waitress took orders and brought everything to your table, but you could have as much as you want, seconds, or thirds, if you wanted. You could have yoghurts, cereals, juices, hot chocolates, tea/coffee, baskets of croissants and danishes, any kinds of toast, 2 eggs any style with chicken/pork sausages, bacon, you name it they got it. And as long as they got it, you can have it. I thought it would be a set thing where you choose and that's it, but I was surprised, they actually offer to give you more as long as you were still hungry. Definitely a generous touch. Like I said, if you didn't include this in the hotel rate, it goes for 48 Euro a head, so definitely a splurge if you had to pay everyday. The other room we had was larger and had a Eiffel Tower view which was breathtaking. When the tower started flashing on the hour at night, it was really worth it, to just sit by the large window and take endless pictures of it, which we did. But no review would be complete without mentioning the downsides. First of all, I was a bit disappointed by the electrical outlets the room provided. As a 5-star luxury hotel of international recognition, I was surprised to see only French electrical outlets. I was only able to charge my appliances one at a time, and that was only because I brought 1 universal adapter. So my iPad, iPhone, BB, and camera had to take turn being charged, which was annoying. My advice would be for the hotel to at least provide a universal adapter in the drawer somewhere for international travellers. Secondly, the room we had, felt a bit warm. The air-conditioner was blowing warm air no matter what setting we put. We woke up a bit sticky most mornings. I expect better from a 650 Euro a night hotel. But the other room was fine, so maybe they'll fix this as time goes by, after all the hotel has only been opened a few months. Gym was a temporary one, so it was small. They said a permanent one was being completed. I didn't see a pool, so I wasn't sure they had one. So for now, I'd say the Fitness facility is incomplete. Overall, this was an awesome stay, really made our Europe trip, it was very dreamlike, its no doubt expensive, but worth our while in every way. I have stayed in many luxury hotels, but Shang Paris no doubt is in my top 3 list now. Although its expensive, I thought the price was decent for Paris standard, and nothing beats its newness.

Facilities Stunning hotel with no expense spared. The renovation of this stately mansion is impressive. Rooms are sparkling new and very tastefully decorated. Be careful with room selection as a terrace and Eiffel Tower view are important. As with many historiic hotels rooms are not standardized \"cookie-cutter\" shaped. If you have specific requirements for view or space, etc I would be very specific when making your reservation. We viewed a number of rooms and suites and highly recommend the Eiffel Tower view rooms with a terrace. We preferred this room to the suites we viewed. Location Some reviews bemoan the location of the Shangri-La but we found it convenient to everything. Paris is the ultimate walking city so go out walk around and enjoy. The Shang is in a gorgeous neighborhood of Embassies and is low key and discrete. Dining We enjoyed room service and the morning breakfast. Deliciously prepared food served by a terrific staff. Dinner would be a special treat at either of the two venues but we were both very casually dressed and it did not feel appropraite to dine in these elegant venues without proper attire.

I must say that our room may have been one of the most exquisite rooms in all of Paris. A corner suite with a wrap around terrace you access via dormer windows reveals unto its guests the most incredible view of the Eiffel Tower. I knew instantly that I had a vantage point that most Parisians will never have. The welcome amenity of hot tea and fresh fruit was greatly appreciated and helped to wipe some of the cobwebs away.

The hotel itself is a bit off the beaten path, in a more elegant and less touristy neighborhood, but a short 10 or 15 minute walk from the Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es or Avenue Montaigne. Great cafes and brasseries in the neighborhood as well, just a few short blocks away. Oh, did we mention the room, the spectacular view of the Eiffel Tower, the cool smooth sheets and duvet on the delicious bed, and the wonderful surprise of the radiant bathroom floors. Eve the water pressure is fantastic. It's the simple things that make a hotel stay special, and at the Shangri-la Paris, these simple things do indeed add up to a magical experience. We will most certainly return.", "Date": "April 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas", "Title": "\u201cA new palace is born\u201d", "Author": "Adult44", "ReviewID": "UR105992477", "Content": "The new Shangri-La Paris is not meant to be a \"value\" but rather an indulgence.

This website was extremely helpful and gave us some insight into restaurants and things to do while in Paris. Although the hotel was expensive, we were there to celebrate our anniversary and I will say that it was an incredible experience and worth every dime.

Incredible rooms, great food, outstanding concierge, fantastic housekeeping - I could go on and on. Truly a new benchmark in Paris and definitely for the Shangri-La group.
