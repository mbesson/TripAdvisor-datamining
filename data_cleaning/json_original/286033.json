We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We caught a private water taxi to the hotel from airport. The rest of the time we jumped on and off vaporettas which go to stops close to the hotel. The decor in the hotel is wonderful - really beautiful oldy-worldy feel but still very swish/stylish. There were wooden beams on our bedroom ceiling, gorgeous chandeliers in the hall way and the rooms had everything we could need. We were also able to lean out of our bedroom window to see gondaliers going by. The hotel was spotlessly clean and the breakfasts were lovely. The two men on reception were extremely welcoming. They even gave us a bottle of complimentary sparkling wine as it was our honeymoon! The hotel was in a good location. We didnt hear any noise at night. We also loved spending time relaxing in the garden at the back of the hotel which contain lovely gold and green statues. Watch out for the ants though! The reception staff also provided us with names of recommended restaurants to try on the back streets (much better food and reasonably priced).

Hotel was a bit difficult to find in the dark, as we did not have good directions (it was booked at the last minute and so I did not even have the address!). The shopkeepers near the hotel did not seem to know of its existence! It is set back in a little alleyway about 100 metres from the main walkway down the right bank. The hotel is unusual in that, to gain access, you walk in a large gateway into a walled garden, complete with fig trees (and figs). The hotel is a lovely old palace and only has 15 bedrooms. The downstairs is given over to a cosy reception (they did not stint on heating) and a communal area where breakfast is served, in ducal surroundings. The bedroom was not huge, but not bad by Venice standards. It was boiling hot when I went in and so I turned the heating off and turned the heater in the lovely large bathroom on - this proved to be sufficient to heat the bedroom well. The bedroom had large windows that opened on to the garden. About the only criticism I can find is that the view of the garden was slightly blocked by an awning. Enjoyed a lovely night's sleep in the comfortable bed. The hotel proved to be very central - 2 minutes from the Vaporetta, 4 minutes from Billa supermarket, 10 minutes from Rialto. Breakfast was made up of a lovely spread of meats, cheeses fruits, boiled eggs, bakes, cereals. We were served beautiful frothy milky coffee. Highlight of breakfast was an absolutely fabulous almond marzipan cake. The staff in the hotel could not be more friendly and helpful.

The antique decor makes you feel like you are on a movie set. And the breakfast! My partner and I are still talking about it months later -- we loved waking up to that sumptuous spread every morning. The neighborhood is really the best part of all. Rather than \"out of the way\" or \"off the beaten track,\" I would actually characterize the location of the hotel as \"central\" -- particularly if you want to explore the entire city, rather just than the San Marco-Rialto-Accademia triumverate (not that they aren't essential as well!). The Strada Nova is a bustling main street that would be worth visiting no matter where you were staying. And the hotel's Cannaregio location makes it much easier to pick up ferries from Fondamenta Nove to Murano, Burano, Torcello or San Michele (the historic cemetery), or to walk to the main train station for a day trip to Padua.

I'll attempt to answer the questions I had when looking for hotels in Venice. Access. As far as getting to the hotel from the airport it is convenient from 2 approaches. If you wish to keep costs down, you can find your way to a vaporetto and exit at the Ca' d'Oro stop. A Google map will show you the way from there to the hotel. It is a short walk and for a minimally physical able person a breeze to get to. We elected to hire a water taxi and once in Venice -- climbed aboard what I'd call a \"speed boat\" that took us right to the canal entrance to the hotel. We climbed from the boat and walked into the lobby. Same for our departure from the hotel to the ships port. You may want to look into sharing the cost of this as it is not inexpensive but very convenient. The location is good although not in the mainstream area of Venice. It is close to many restaurants, shopping and the vaporetto. It is and within a reasonable walking distance to for starters, the Rialto bridge and area. I'm not the greatest at walking distances yet we found the distances very acceptable. We even did a walking tour on our own from St Mark's Square back to the hotel. My point here is that while I had concerns initially about location -- that concern was totally unfounded. The hotel itself is what it is. It's an old palace. To us it was charming and interesting. The morning breakfasts included were ample and we loved sitting in the private courtyard which is peaceful and inviting. We sat there often upon returning from our excursions into Venice. We had a suite on the 2nd floor. The room was huge with a fresco painted on the ceiling. You do need to climb stairs to get to the 2nd and 3rd levels. Noise level? Not an issue. Service? Outstanding as the people go out of their way to assure your stay is acceptable. We had dinner one evening at Osteria Ca' D'Oro (La Vedova). You can check out reviews on Trip Advisor and decide for yourself. We loved it. Don't be reluctant about this hotel as it is a good choice.

We wanted a place away from Piazza San Marco and after a brief vaporetto ride from the train station, you arrive in this hip, residential area of the city which to us, made it so unique and special. A few windy narrow turns and you arrive at this amazing palazzo, not a gaudy, overdone hotel, but like you are staying in some fabulous Venetian person's home. What more do you want?!! So after you walk through their garden, which is there for your enjoyment, they hand you a giant, funky old key to open your door - so much fun! No silly code key, and once again, you feel like a house guest. Our room was ridiculous! We had a bottle of Prosseco waiting for us upon arrival. It was furnished with all authentic venetian antiques, just as the entire palazzo is. Our ceiling was hand painted and we had wonderful windows that overlooked the residences close by. Breakfast was included and it was the best we had in Italy, complete with fresh fruit, meats, tarts, breads, cereal, the works. You can enjoy that in the garden or inside and oh, I forgot to mention, they have their own little dock at the back of the hotel, so when the door is open you have a water view!

We had room #23, a large corner room overlooking the canal (which is no longer under construction as far as we could tell). Venice, overall, is like an echo chamber with all of the stone and you can hear everything happening outside your windows, but this is not a problem just with the Palazzo Abadessa, simply an observation about staying in the city that applies to the P.A. and, my guess is, most hotels in town. It was chilly, so we didn't get to use the garden, but it was lovely anyhow. The breakfast was excellent. I was very happy to have my Parma ham with butter and toast every morning. Housekeeping was well done and timely. The Palazzo itself is charming and vintage. I wanted to feel like I'd stepped back in time and the P.A. accomplished this without having creaky beds, too much lace, and the other dusty trappings of an older hotel or B&B. The location is also good, very near the Rialto, the Ca'D'Oro stop and also the vaparetto stop for going out to Murano and Burano. Our only negative comments are that the bathroom we had (in a large room, even by US standards) was very narrow and the shower stall was so small we had logistical trouble taking a shower. Our other comment was the front desk staff, while getting an \"A\" for effort and sweetness often were just not very knowledgeable about basic Venetian information, like a restaurant open at 4:30 in the afternoon that served pasta (couldn't give us one recommendation in the entire city) or the cost of a taxi to the airport (had to call several people and then quoted us a price way more than it ended up being). We seemed to stump them with basic requests and it got to the point where we just stopped asking as it wasted time and got us nowhere. Strangely, email communication before we arrived was very helpful and the opposite of our experience in person. I suppose the moral is arrange as much as you can in advance via email. I recommend the P.A. very highly, but you need to go in with the right expectations. If you are expecting five star bathrooms and concierge service, you will be disappointed.

The lack of the canal in front of the hotel was disappointing, but it certainly didn't detract from our stay. (And it appears from the construction that the work will be done soon... they had started refilling the canal while we were there.) Overall our stay at the Palazzo Abadessa was exceptional. We highly recommend the Palazzo Abadessa.", "Date": "September 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Georgia", "Title": "\u201cWhat a wonderful surprise!\u201d", "Author": "tonigb1", "ReviewID": "UR8613615", "Content": "Two days were added to our trip when Delta called to say we could fly direct if we left on the 5th instead of the 7th. No problem, but when our hotel in Venice couldn't extend our reservation we looked around for another. Can't remember how we found Palazzo Abadessa - especially since it's in the Cannaregio and we, like most people who visit Venice, thought you must stay near San Marco! What a delightful surprise on both counts! The location for the hotel is just minutes from the Ca' d'Oro vaporetto stop but except for the Arsenalle it's a relatively easy walk to everything. We walked to Zanpolo, San Polo, Rialto, the Ghetto, San Marco. It's just a block off Strada Nouve with lots of shops and restaurants but not the hordes. The hotel itself was lovely; it appears not too many years removed from being someone's private residence. The public rooms were like museums. This was our second trip to Venice, and I didn't think gardens like this existed among the alleys and waterways. Think lush and green. The perfect setting for a late night complementary aperitivo provided the hotel. Our room was an adequate size with a larger than average bath, elegant and clean. Yes, there was the business about the canal under repair, but noise didn't begin before 8:00am and I wasn't in Venice to sleep in. The breakfast was probably the best we had on this trip and eating in the garden added a special touch. All the staff were very gracious and helpful. We couldn't have been more pleased that circumstances allowed us to experience this wonderful hotel!", "Date": "September 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cOld hotel, nice decor\u201d", "Author": "Euro-plane", "ReviewID": "UR8275047", "Content": "Very nice property, delicious breakfast, but it did not vary...same thing day after day.

Overall, we were completely satisfied. The property is gorgeous, well situated near the Ca' d'Oro stop, and the staff is quite attentive. The breakfasts were superlative. It was wonderful. Our only complaint was our room. Me and my two friends were travelling together across Europe, spending each night together as we rarely see each other. Many weeks prior to our arrival, I booked a room for the three of us. I recieved a confirmation at that time. A couple of weeks prior, I reconfirmed. I received another very nice email that our reservation was confirmed. Finally, I sent one last email the day prior to our leaving for Europe to say how we were looking forward to our time there. I again recieved an email confirming and saying that they intended to provide us with the best hotel experience we ever had. So, with this, we were all suprised to arrive at the hotel saying that we would have to be put in another room for the first two nights, and split up altogether the last night because our original reserved room was unavailable. This was very disappointing to us as we had confirmed multiple times prior to our arrival. To the hotel's credit, the first two nights were an upgrade to possibly the best room in the house. The only downside to it was that the canal outside our window was being repaired so it had been drained completely (with bad smell coming in the room) and the workers started outside our window very early. Overall, the room was wonderful. After these two nights, we had to repack our things which was an inconvenience in order to move into another room. The last night was a definite downgrade from what we had reserved. It was a clean, nice, but small. So we were separated our last night which was not to our liking. I guess the hotel's philosophy was that since they had upgraded us the first two nights, a downgrade on the last night was ok. I cannot stress enough that I think the hotel is beautiful. Our experience was unfortunate and apparently not common for most people staying there. That said, I would still suggest this to anyone wanting to stay in a real Venetian palazzo with a not-so-common garden that is beautifully tended.", "Date": "July 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hampshire, England", "Title": "\u201cAmazing rooms\u201d", "Author": "HampshireTrip", "ReviewID": "UR8243701", "Content": "We got to the hotel for a 3 night stay, and were told that we'd have to change rooms after 2 nights.

The room we had for 2 nights was amazing, palace decor - painting on ceiling, chandaler, 17th century furniture etc... and absolutely massive. Also included was a free bottle of champagne. Breakfast was nice and had a huge range to choose from, and sitting eating in the garden to start the day was perfect. The member of staff on days was very, very friendly and helpful, and advised on entertainment, and booked a night at the Opera for us, gave directions, and it was a superb night. Overall this is an excellent hotel, with fabulous pictures and furniture where ever you look. The one down side, which affected us on the first morning, was the work currently being done on the canal outside. The upgraded room backed onto the work, and at 7:30 woke us up.

Beautiful property, very good breakfast, and afternoon drinks. Air conditioning good, clean, and friendly employees (usually). Problems with the following; do not get or pay extra for canal view. The canal is torn up and the view is poor at best from our second story windows if the canal wasn't drained. Again they did not tell me either, even when I contacted them 1 week prior to our arrival. Not very helpful with recommendations and the local restaurant scene. Everything is very expensive here, including this hotel. On the day of our arrival, after a 18 hour travel day, we did not have any water to shower until midnight that evening and there was non stop noise from the canal due to this construction. We were offered only 'bottled water' to take a shower with and no discount off our rate due to the non-existant canal view which we paid extra for...Garden is beautiful but can be noisy from neighbors playing disco music both in the morning and evening or slamming weights (a gym??). We too were sent to a restaurant that was closed when we go there and were given very poor directions and information on the \"Doges Secret Tour\" which we did not go on, because we were not given the confirmation number by the Abadessa staff who had graciously made the reservations for us, but neglected to give us detailed information on where to meet, time, etc. Internet service is hit and miss and you must ask for it to be turned on (wirelesss).
