We refused to get it , and the clark made some nerveus phone calls , i had to speak with the manager and insisted to receive a diffrent room as was shown in the hotel website. After all, we got a nicer room , but it was also so little , not a normal place to store your clothes , so for 3 days they stayed in the suitcase. The breakfast is o.k and it is good you have a free parking place. The hotel situated a bit far from rome center, you have to take a bus to the closest metro and than contineu with metro, but it is close to the round road and exits from Rome. We do not recomend .", "Date": "September 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Patras, Greece", "Title": "\u201cCheap but dirty\u201d", "Author": "Melina210", "ReviewID": "UR71124794", "Content": "I would not suggest this hotel, because the rooms are dirty.
