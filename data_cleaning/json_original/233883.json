However, it is easy to get the bus into Venice, just get your tickets at the tabac beforehand. A local bus around the corner will also get you to the airport very cheaply, 1 euro 30 cents. The longer distance buses to the airport are 5 euros.

I don't know what kind of rating they were into to be called a 4 stars, but it definetly wasn't a \"propper 4 star\". During my whole european tour, I've stayed in 2 or 3 three-stars-hotels that were amazingly better than this one. First of all, the lobby decoration was horribly tacky and the elevators were old. The room was \"ok\"; it was clean and comfortable, but there were no courtains or windows separating the shower from the rest of the bathroom so sometimes it was a bite messy. The mini-bar refrigerator wasn't really working since the 1st time I opened it, because next day, all drinks were a bit warm even though I checked it and was propperly closed. Finally (and most importantly I'm guessing...), this hotel was placed in \"Venezia Mestre\", which is NOT the typical-touristic Venezia island. To get there, I had to walk about 5 minutes to the bus station and then take a bus ride that took around 15-20 minutes to get to the island, so that made everything a little worst, since it wasn't really easy to get to the interesting area whenever I wanted. And the other detail I wanted to bring up to this review is that I'm pretty sure it was the same guy from the bar that cleaned the rooms... Anyways, I just would like to repeat something in different words: The hotel was OK... It was good enough just for sleeping and maybe staying there for a few hours before going to bed, but if you're expecting a normal 4-stars hotel with all the facilities and nice details they use to have, THIS IS NOT the hotel you're looking for.", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lviv, Ukraine", "Title": "\u201cNothing special\u201d", "Author": "oks70", "ReviewID": "UR123415370", "Content": "It looks poor for a four star hotel.

Because we had our car this time, it was not convenient to stay right in the centre, so instead we stayed at Hotel Alexander in Mestre. Parking at the hotel was free, and the hotel itself was quite modern and clean, and with a bigger room than you would expect if you were staying in Venice itself. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly. We were able to buy tickets for public transport directly from the front desk, and they directed us to the bus stop which is only a 5 min walk from the hotel. The buses to Piazzale Roma in Venice go past every 10 mins or so, and from P. Roma you can then just hop on a Vaporetto and you're on the Grand Canal!
