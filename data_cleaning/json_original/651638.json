The suite was spacious with a loft for our daughter to sleep in. Kitchen had what it needed for a week and the place was cleaned daily. Parking is available underground, but indeed it's a bit of a tight fit. As we came here off season, no problems to find street parking. We did look at a couple of rooms at the hotel for a future stay and would book one of them without worries. And quite frankly, the common areas such pool, terrace, lobby and bar had actually style compared to the Solvi next door. Take a look at my images and see for your self.", "Date": "February 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cHas not changed...still awful\u201d", "Author": "LondonHolidaybuff", "ReviewID": "UR119365978", "Content": "Landed in Vilanova I La Geltru late at night for a business meeting, so stayed here. The staff have a very poor attitude which has not changed since my last visit. They arestill miserable and unhelpful. The room cost 130 Euros and smelt so I stayed that night and moved to Vilafranca. The Spaniards to say they are in a recession are still so arrogant and think the tourists and visitors will accept any rubbish masquerading as service. I asked at 10.30pm for a sandwich and was told the restaurant was closed so I walked down the road and had a dinner. Until visitors to Spain vote with their feet the standards will never change. The hotel in Vilafranca was a 4 star and cost 65 Euros in Dinner and Breakfast and was amazing. The staff and management could not do enough. I have booked our future visits here and have been given a corporate rate.", "Date": "October 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mechelen, Belgium", "Title": "\u201cIt takes you back to the 1970s !!!!\u201d", "Author": "chris.lalor", "ReviewID": "UR64187175", "Content": "I had to make a business trip to Vilafranca and our customer uses this hotel. We arrived late at night and checked in - that was easy and fuss free. The rooms are quite small even though I had a double room with a double bed. We had a drink outside, the prices were very reasonable. The bathroom is a throwback to when the hotel was built (I'm assuming the 1970s - the hotel next door is called Sol 70 !!) very old fashioned furniture thought the hotel, all in dark brown, including the bathroom suite (see photos). We didn't eat in the restuarant at night, the poor breakast put us off. The breakfast consisted of some meats, yoghurt, only WHITE bread (no brown) corn flakes & co-co pops and a large selection of sugary pastries. To my amazement there was also wine available for breakfast (see photos) something I've never seen before (for the English tourists maybe ? ) - the bottles were open, glasses right next to them, just help yourself!! In terms of position the hotel is just accross the road from the beach, with a large free municipal car park just opposite the hotel. The staff were \"okay\" not exactly the fastest with mostest, trying to get a cup of coffee in the morning is quite an art, you have order them one by one and the waiter is rarely to be seen so you have to grab him when you can. Plus points are the position and free parking, minus points were the drabness, poor breakafst, absense of wi-fi and no TV stations (38 in all) that weren't Spanish :-((. I'd certainly look around at others before booking back there and I recommend anyone doing the same.", "Date": "May 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cWhat a dump\u201d", "Author": "LondonHolidaybuff", "ReviewID": "UR58146830", "Content": "We stayed in Vilanova for one week to have a taste of the Ctalan culture the stay was fantastic what great people in this town However the hotel and staff were awful. The weaher was terriible and most nights the temp was 0 to 2c and theheating in the hotel wasvery poor weasked for some extra heating but we were told there was n't any but they gave us six extra blankets. This did noit help when we were`sat in the room. The breakfast was cold and the barman was a disgrace. He ignored us most of the time and even let the door entering the bar swing in my wifes face on 2 occasions. I bchallenged the 2nd time but hej ust walked off We will stay in the Atenea Apts when we return in September,. This hotel and its staff are disgusting and at 120 euros a night a rip of.
