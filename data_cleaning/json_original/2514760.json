The facilities include a fully equipped kitchen with a dishwasher. The Reception staff are all very helpful, it is worth noting that Housekeeping work until 5pm(?) at the Marmara, so if you're an 'early bird' you can ask that your apt be serviced by a specified time. There is plenty of closet space but as normal in most hotels, not enough hangars for us (8 I think). 2 flat screen TV's (bed and living room). The bed was really comfortable. All the furnishing is modern and light, a refreshing change to the normal 'chintzy', patterned style that is common in a lot of hotels. The 2nd Ave construction work has been ongoing for all our visits but that has not bothered us. There are plenty of great places to eat, the area is very good and the subway is not that far away.

The view was amazing. Yes, there is major construction going on out front but it was no problem getting around and the noise was minimal. The apartment had every amenity you could ask for. The doorman was so helpful and all the staff we came across were warm, friendly and eager to please. We really felt we hit the jackpot with this place and it will be our \"go to\" place when visiting NYC. The Upper East Side was such a nice change from downtown! Nicks Restaurant across the street from Marmara had fantastic food, best veal I've EVER had and their pizza is amazing too. The Barking Dog for breakfast was amazing with the most unusual omlettes.

The apartment was large and light with fabulous views from the East River to Central Park and I could see the top of the Empire Sate building from my bed!

The utensils provided in the kitchen were very basic but a request for a kitchen knife was responded to immediately - even if the knife provided was quite blunt!

We always felt safe walking around even after dark. The subway is not too far away and the Green line was very handy when it came to getting around the city. It is also a pleasant walk to Central park and many of the Museums.

The best, you had a full kitchen and could make a breakfast before heading out which saves you money. The subway was a quick walk and its nice to get lost the best part and when you learn the routes you definitely feel like you live there. The Taxi rides were never over 20 (was holiday so a lot of traffic) and if you take the subway just take a Taxi back. Overall, if you want to experience NYC you don't need a fancy place because the time you spend in a room is only for sleep. However, this place is a clean, spacious, and attentive place that's inexpensive place to stay. Now, I would recommend a little TLC because it does show a little use the rooms like paint and new decor. Yet, for the time we were in the room it was nothing that bothered.

Anyway, other than that, the only negative was the bed - not super comfy, a little over firm, but personally I slept like a rock. The hotel is neat and unique - it is the only hotel I've stayed in in Manhattan that has a full kitchen. Apparently it was formerly an apartment complex but that's a killer advantage because the rooms are HUGE in comparison to midtown boutique places - for $195 (cheap by Manhattan standards) we got a full living room, a west-facing balcony, a full kitchen (yea, I mean a stove, a full fridge, microwave, sink and all the utensils), a pull-out sofa bed AND a full separate bedroom with a queen bed, two panel TVs, DVD player, a good sized bathroom. And the decor is very tasteful - from the chandelier-lighted elevators to the very whimsical artificial-grass-walled atrium - and it has a substantial gym AND laundromat in the hotel. Awesome. Highly recommend this place, especially if you're keeping to the UES or if you need a lot of space (i.e. lots of family).

We were familiar with the area, which was a plus. The staff were unflailingly friendly and from what we could see, helpful to the numerous visiting families and groups staying at the hotel, from the doorman to the front desk staff. The doorman were always polite and helpful in getting a cab (which can be difficult because of the construction); the front desk staff recognized us each time we returned to the building. The large one bedroom was typical of East Side rental apartments we had lived in in the past, as compared to a \"hotel\" look, and it had pleasant decor and enough cooking equipment, plates, glasses and utensils so that you could treat the place as a home and do cooking and laundry on site, or go out to the plentiful bars and restaurants NYC has to offer. We had a high floor with a balcony with nice views. There's no getting around the Second Ave subway construction, particularly with the expected terminus being at 96th Street, has had a significant effect on Second Avenue, which the building faces, and it is difficult to cross the street and it is dirty and the construction apparently only stops on Sundays. Nevertheless for visitors who know their way around NY or know where they are going, there's no reason to spend much time in the neighborhood, and if you are using the place mainly as a place to sleep and eat breakfast in (Dunkin Donuts and a better than average bagel shop within 2 blocks) with the once or twice pizza or Chinese food delivery on a rainy night then this is very good indeed for the money and the space, especially if you are in a large group. The Lexington Ave subway is very close; the Second Ave bus stops move because of the construction work and probably is best left to the adventurous or the locals. The East River in the other direction is also very close, and worth a stroll (you can get to a riverside walk at 96th Street under the FDR) to remind yourself Manhattan is an island surrounded by water. Because we were a longer stay we had cleaning done weekly but had more than enough clean towels and supplies (soap, conditioner, etc) to last; and if we needed replenishing it was done promptly and courteously (there is no separate service elevator, so check ins/out, housekeeping, food and other deliveries share the two elevators with guests).

All the B&B\u2019s were booked and I had a hard time finding a hotel in this area of the upper eastside. Marmara is a very low-key mixed use building of residence and guest rooms. The staff was excellent and very professional. There are a few things to consider when booking a stay at this property. I had envisioned the d\u00e9cor of the rooms would resemble what was shown on the web site. The pics aren\u2019t at all what I got. I assume these are individual owners and the accommodations will vary widely room to room. My one bedroom suite had stark white walls, a couch and a very plain wood table with 4 wood chairs\u00ac-\u00ac-very austere. It didn\u2019t bother me as I wasn\u2019t going to be in the room much at all, but some folks may feel duped for some $450 a night after seeing the pics on the web site. The bed was very comfortable, Westin style, but that could also vary room to room. The Marmara has no services, not even ice. But right across the street was a delightful local grocery store opened 24 hrs a day, and they had ice and all the essentials etc. There\u2019s a liquor store also within a block. There\u2019s a great bagel spot and a few local bars with all the charm NYC has to offer. I enjoyed Off the Rails. I can\u2019t recommend Ray\u2019s pizza. The one thing to consider for some guests is that there is a subway station being built right outside your room which will continue for 4 years. I would not want to contribute to less commerce to this area affected by the construction, but it must be said It was very noisy during the weekdays. I didn\u2019t hear construction noise from the bedroom, which is on the rear side of the unit\u2014but I also travel with a fan to mask noise. And for me, I like the energy of the city and that\u2019s part of the gestalt. But if my wife had been there, she would not have been a happy camper.

With five of us, including two teenagers, we needed at least two rooms and two baths, and two hotel rooms in a decent hotel will completely break the bank for most families. After researching here, we chose the Marmara. It was a nice place! The location was a little farther north than I anticipated, although in all fairness I didn't really think about it enough - that one's one me. The location worked just fine, though. To get to the subway was about 2 short blocks and 2 long blocks - uphill to the subway. Bus stop was on 2nd, across the street and one block down. By NYC standards, subway was close. By Houston standards, where everyone drives cars all the time, and we had a couple of bad knees, it was a little farther, but actually still worked out just fine. Check in was easy - there's a small desk in the lobby, and they were ready for us. There are two elevators, so sometimes you have to wait a minute, but not too long. (Look up in the elevator!). The halls are very dark, though. Once you get used to it, it's not as startling, but there are only a couple of small lights on each floor, and the walls are painted dark gray. The rooms are nice and spacious, tho. We had a two bed / two bath, that had apparently not been remodeled. The carpet was older, but the furniture was all fine. The entryway had a parquet floor that needed to be refinished / replaced. We did get a peak into another unit during the week, and saw that it had the newer, nicer carpet. Otherwise, our unit had the feel of an actual apartment, except that all the colors were very neutral, and there wasn't as much artwork on the walls as a private apartment would have. Living room and each bedroom had a nice flat screen TV. Sofa and chairs in the living room were nice and comfortable. Sofa bed feels like a sofa bed - not great, but it worked. King bed in the master and two twin beds in the second bedroom were all comfortable. Bathrooms worked just fine. Master bath had jacuzzi jets, but we never used them. Men will notice that the toilets are located a little too far back, and there isn't enough room for the seat to stay up by itself - poor planning on someone's part. Kitchen had service for eight, good size fridge - everything you'd need for a short term stay. For our drinks, cereal, pop tarts, and snacks, it was more than enough. There was a little confusion between the small trashcan and the larger recycling bin, but we figured that out after a couple of days. In the entry hall was a stackable washer and dryer, but we never had the opportunity to use them. Balcony was a great view! we had a corner unit on the 19th floor, so we had great views! Everyone spent some time out there enjoying the view. Housekeeping was generally fine, but there seemed to be a shortage of shampoo and conditioner. More than once we had to ask for more after housekeeping had been there. Closet space was great, and the hangers were nice. The safe was a typical hotel safe, but was not bolted to the floor. I don't know if they're all that way, but at least nobody stole ours while we were there. This is not a full service hotel, so no one should expect things like restaurants and room service, or a pool. However, there are numerous decent restaurants within a block, and hundreds more a short hop away, so we didn't see that as a problem. If you're looking to sit in your room and don't want to go out, that might be a problem. Speaking of restaurants, people have mentioned Nick's. It's right across the street, and it's fine, but not outstanding. It's nice and convenient, but there's a lot of very good Italian in New York. This works 'cause it's close, but nothing to write home about. There are small grocery stores nearby, as well as pharmacies, and a liquor store, so you should be okay for whatever you need within a block or so. All in all, I would recommend this hotel again. If I go again and don't have the whole family, I would probably stay at a more traditional hotel down near Times Square.", "Date": "August 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "colorado and ohio", "Title": "\u201cLove the Marmara\u201d", "Author": "moac4", "ReviewID": "UR116115191", "Content": "This was the second time we have stayed at the Marmara and it was as clean and friendly and convenient as the first time.

No one in our group would take off their shoes. Stains and cigarette burns on furniture. The extra blanket in one bedroom closet had long black hairs in it. Bathrooms were old and tired, and the doors to the vanity cabinets were torn off the hinges. The strong odor of the hallway and rooms are similar to an old gym.

We asked for another room and again, were given an attitude that nothing could be done. This was the best they had to offer.

On the other hand, the cleaning staff were very good, and in fact attempted to scrub out some of the carpet stains, but that was a futile attempt.

There is road construction surrounding the hotel making for dusty and difficult walking. Check your maps carefully prior to selecting this area. This hotel has great potential to be very good.

But it took quite a long time to disappear and both my sister and I are sensitive to chemical smells and think the management should look over the types of chemicals used in the cleaning process, using preferably ecologically compatible products with no lingering fragrance; b) the sofa bed, on which my sister slept, was ok to sleep on but not too comfortable. It was also a bit hard to open and we had to ask for assistance two or three times (a staff member promptly came up to help us but it was a bit inconvenient); c) the heating seems a bit antiquated and the room became rather dry so we found ourselves turning the heating on and then off for the night; d) at the end of our stay we split the cost on two credit cards but the system produced a mix of our names and cards - this is not acceptable if one needs to submit costs as business expenses. The system should be reviewed and adapted to split costs, which are probably not all that uncommon. Otherwise, we were very pleased with our stay and were very comfortable.

The apartment was scrupulously clean, well appointed, a corner unit with generous windows in the living area, and even a small balconey. The Kitchen was fully stocked with a service for four. The staff was incredibly kind and caring. What could have been a frightening and lonely experience was mitigated by the attitude in the hotel. I had booked a 4 night stay, but when my husband needed to stay for 7 nights, my stay was extended on a night per night basis. After long, tiring days at the hospital it was wonderful to return to the hotel, and greeted warmly by the doorman and front desk staff. It even felt as if I had a pied a terre in the city, and I would love to return to take advantage under better circumstances. The walk to the hospital was very doable, even though it was one of the coldest and snowstormiest weeks in NYC history. The only criticism that I have is that the windows are not very well insulated, and leaked some cold air, and the Manhattan noise was perhaps more than it should have been.

There had been comments posted about construction at the base of the hotel so I requested a higher room (we got 19A) which was a very clean and spacious one bedroom suite with living room, kitchen and one bath. It turns out the \"construction\" is for a new 2nd Ave subway line being built directly in front of the hotel. Early on three weeknights, the hotel was rocked by explosions as crews blasted the new tunnel. Given the general noise of NYC, however, surprisingly this was more of a novel experience than something to complain about BUT...be warned. The room was very clean, the staff was great, every request was met quickly and courteously. My ONLY complaint was that despite getting a discounted rate on the room, the price per night jumped by almost $50 once the additional taxes were added...an additional $250 for 5 nights. While this was displayed on the quote in advance, the budget-minded traveler should consider this a $300/ night hotel. Being three of us (me plus wife and daughter) I had originally been shopping for the most possible space in the low $200/ night range but decided to take a chance on the Marmara based on TripAdvisor reviews.

I loved staying in the Marmara! One of the things that I look for is good communication before I stay in a hotel. To say the Marmara doesn't disappoint is an understatement! I had looked at the rates on the site and was pleased to see that I could get a studio suite for less than a single bedroom with shared bathroom midtown. I don't know New York well though and wanted to know how easy it would be to get to Columbia-Presbyterian (W 168th St) and NYU Medical Center (E 33rd Street). I emailed and got a response the same day from the wonderful Neslihan. She gave me a full rundown of transport options. She then offered a free upgrade to a one bed suite if I wanted to book. I did! A while later I emailed to ask if I could have some online shopping delivered. No problem. If it arrived before I did they would hold it. So: Location: Some people wouldn't like being well up the Upper East Side (technically Yorkville really) but I was glad I was there. The hotel is on 94th Street and 2nd Avenue and easily accessible by subway-stop is on 96th street. Every time I strolled around 34th street I was glad I was living away from the crazy throngs of tourists. The area around the Marmara is far more residential and you kind of get to feel like you're living in New York. There are plenty of grocery and drugstores nearby, ranging from expensive ones like Dean and Deluca to the cheap and cheerful Pioneer/C-Town and midrange Gristedes and D'Agostinos. I made many trips to Crumbs, Glasers and Two Little Red Hens bakeries also. Very close to Guggenheim, Whitney and Met. It's a few blocks east to Central Park where you can go for lovely runs around the reservoir.... I'm missing it already! Check-in: I arrived early but they managed to find me a room straight away. They had kept a package for me...and knew before I asked. It was swift and the guy on the desk was really friendly. Room: Well, it was an apartment really! I was on the 18th floor. Large bedroom with TV and loads of storage. Bed was quite hard but I got used to it. Couldn't sleep with street noise first night but managed every other night so it may have been due to being over-tired at the start. There was a full kitchen with a massive fridge, and everything you could need-utensils, plates, cups, plates, saucepans etc. Even sealable Pyrex bowls. I particularly liked it that there was a dishwasher...and they provided detergent, washing-up liquid and rubber gloves. Nice touch! There was a little pack with 2 bottles of water, coffee, tea, creamer and sweeteners also. Living room comfy with TV, DVD player and fax machine/copier. Everything spotless Amenities: Small fitness room with some weights, elliptical, treadmill, bikes, rower and TV. More than adequate and never full. There's also a laundry room with a few washers and dryers. Didn't have to wait for a machine. Cute little gallery in lobby which was lovely to see when you arrive in the door. There's also a laptop set up there with internet access, as well as free WiFi in the rooms. No restaurant but loads outside and they deliver. Staff: Wonderful. I was greeted with a hello and a smile every single time I entered or left. Both the doormen and the front desk staff were charming and exceedingly helpful. Heard them giving extensive area advice to guests and they accepted all my deliveries and made sure I got them. A car was organised to bring me to the airport and they also printed out my boarding pass for me! Downsides: Slow elevators. Bit noisy... These would in no way prevent me from staying here again!

New Yorkers to our surprise were very polite! - shocking I know, but we found the New Yorkers in town much more friendly than most Brits in London etc!. They are very friendly indeed - like to talk in lifts etc rather than us Brits who hold back from talking! Rather than brash, we found the New Yorkers we met talked very straight and to the point! there was no beating around the bush and we liked that! It isn't really a hotel in the traditional sense, ie there is no bar for example. but it is a 32+ storey complex with a chandelier in the lift! We had a gorgeous high suite room complete with dishwasher cooker fridge- massive bed too - about 7ft wide! 2 tvs, it was more of an apartment than a room (about 500 sq ft.!) ..and gave us a good idea of the lifestyle that condo living may entail in NY. The area is safe and full of New york Charm with restaurants and Delis. Out Taxi driver on the way back drove like a maniac but thats another story....We were a little concerned when he took us on a shortcut through a real rough part of Harlem...with cars on bricks and gangs on corners - but he got us to JFK in the end...... If you see a guy in Times square asking you to come to stand up NY club on 78 and broadway- he sells the tickets but doesnt mention you have to buy 2 full price drinks in the club which the cheapest are around 10 dollars each!

I don't think I have recieved so many e-mail thanking me for such a wonderful time in an incredible space. The view is breathtaking. I will stay there again in a New York Minute. Thank you everyone at the Hotel.

I have been too Manhattan three times and I can safely say this is the best accommodation I have stayed in. The apartment we had was fantastic. No central park view but hey, how long do you spend in your apartment?! A couple of blocks from the Maramra is a little restaurant and bar called the Barking Dog. Food is fantastic and so is the price. Great service apart from one time. You will find it at, 150 E 34th St. Try it out. You are about 6 blocks away from Central Park and 5th Avenue. Not far from the museums. There is a store across the road from the Marmara that sells all the essentials you need. A fantastic stay. Will stay again here next time!!!!", "Date": "November 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cAMAZING!\u201d", "Author": "Vick911", "ReviewID": "UR19668328", "Content": "This was a beautiful hotel in a beautiful area.
