The Domidea Hotel is clean, friendly, has free Internet and a good breakfast. We recently spend four nights here and will return when we need to visit Rome. This hotel is best if you have a car. It is located in an industrial area just of the A24. If this is your first visit to Rome and you are looking for a hotel to just explore the city from, this is not the one for you. However if you have a rented car to get to the hotel and don't mind taking public transport to visit the city it works great. The 437 bus stop is just a 1 minute or less walk. From there take the bus to the Ribibbia Metro station. You can buy tickets on the bus that are combined metro/bus tickets for \u20ac1 at the time of this review. That will get you into the city. Buy your ticket on the bus, validate it and keep it with you for entry to the metro. Buy another to come back out to the hotel. Of course, the hotel also provides a shuttle service to and from the Metro station in the AM up to 1030 and in the evening starting around 1730. Check with the hotel and also make reservations on the shuttle bus. Take a business card from the hotel as you will need to call them on your return to say you would like to use the shuttle back to hotel. (Or just catch the bus again.) All up the trip takes about 20-30 minutes each way. The rooms are clean and new. There is a huge bus depot near the hotel so if you are a light sleeper you may find the idling busses a slight annoyance, but in reality we didn't. We were there during the recent cold snap in Italy and the heating worked wonderful. I would expect the AC would too but as yet have not been there during the summer. Breakfast is served downstairs and has a good collection of breads (toast) cakes, ham, cheeses, coffee, juice, yoghurt, ceral and sweet cakes. Quite sufficient to get the day going. Next door you will find a nice restaurant, a small supermarket, a coffee shop and a pizza bar. All very convenient. It has good access from the GDR (Ring Road) and the A1. The Internet works well with both wireless and Ethernet.

The staff was friendly. Very close to the hotel there is a shop for sandwitches, coffees and restaurant. Close to the hotel there is a very good restaurant for stakes, La Pampa. Hotel disadvantage is that very close to it there is a big garage for busses that causes noise and dirty air full of gas.

This was nice because my husband and I had our own private room. Nice large balcony. Free wi-fi worked great. The room appeared very clean, however, my daughter's white socks were completely black after walking around the room. The hotel was too far from Rome. It might be better if you have a car but we didn't. We spent about an hour each way to get into Rome. I hated wasting at least 2 hours per day in travel. On a final note, the manager was extremely rude to us. Upon check-in, we were told that our breakfast was included and given the hours and location, etc. I did not pay attention when booking the hotel as to whether is was or was not. Breakfast is a non-factor when booking a hotel for me. When we went to the breakfast room, we were told that it wasn't included. I mentioned that the person that checked us in the previous day indicated that it was. She then disappeared and came back with the manager. I explained to the manager what we were told at check-in. She pulled our reservation and told me that I should have known what reservation I had made (I didn't) and that there was no way the staff told me that our breakfast was included. She called me a liar in front of several groups of guests. I'm not upset about the breakfast issue, we went next door and had 3 caffes and 3 pastries for 6 euro, not a big deal. The issue was that I was called a liar and treated very rudly. For this reason alone, I would never return to this hotel.", "Date": "January 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Prairie Village, Kansas, United States", "Title": "\u201cNice room, bad location\u201d", "Author": "AliAnne84", "ReviewID": "UR118794764", "Content": "This hotel has a great sized room and bath, and the price was great, but the location was a little too far from Rome.

Bus stop is just around hotel. Hotel room was large, TV only in italian, large bed, A/C, fridge and a lots of storage in room. Bathroom is also large. Hotel provides shuttle transfer to Metro, but limited places and limited time because it is better to book it in the morning for next day. We didnt have breakfast, but there is a cafe around a corner and also a shop where you can buy stuff for your sandwitches for all day city trip. Hotel has no facilieties like restaurant (there is ristorante at the same place as cafe), pool, meeting room and so in my opinion this is not 4star hotel.

The location of the hotel is out of central Rome, about 10 kilometres from the Vatican in an area that from what I saw in my four days there has absolutely nothing of interest to the average tourist, surrounded by small factories, offices and not much else and definitely not a place for a leisurely evening walk. This hotel appears to be mainly aimed at business people needing to be in this particular part of Rome for business reasons and not so much for tourists expecting to walk out and find everything Rome has to offer within walking distance. The hotel offers a free scheduled shuttle to a nearby subway station, Rebibbia in the mornings and when you come back you just call the hotel and they will send the van to the station to get you and take you back to the hotel up to either 10 or 11pm i think it was. What the hotel does have is really nice rooms at a good price, I paid $86 Australian dollars per night room only. My room 311, overlooked an inner courtyard which made the room very quiet and was by far the largest room I had on my entire two month trip in Europe. The room had a large king size bed, LCD TV, fridge, safe, good free internet access, air conditioning, desk, good wardrobe space, separate dressing area and a nice bathroom.

The hotel is very nice, modern and new . We chose that hotel because it seemed to be the best hotel 4* in that price range. And it turned to be one of the best choices we made on our trip , if it is not the best. It also has its own free parking space, which is a blessing as we rented a car for our road trip Rome-PISA-Florence-Venice-Milan. The hotel is located in an industrial area , it is 1 minute driving off the small ring road around Rome, 20 - 30 mins drive to the city center depending on the traffic . I would recommend that you rent a car if you stay at that hotel , however I saw in other reviews that there was a shuttle bus that would take you to the nearest train station. I believe there was a cafe/ restaurant and a supermarket nearby (I did not use any of these) as I just used the hotel to sleep and shower while spent most of the time in the city center. The triple room was spacious with 2 LCD TV's , modern furniture and nice bathroom . The room was cleaned daily and was very well organized , although we left it a mess each day. (3 guys in 1 room could be a challenge for any hotel housekeeping :-) ) We had a very quick check in and they asked us at the front desk to fill in a small paper that they provided to us each day with what we'd like to have in our breakfast and when would we like to have it . We left that paper hanging outside on the door knob(similar to the do nit disturb sign). Then at the time we specified , someone knocks on the door with the tray of breakfast which was nice thing to do since they have a small dinning area. The breakfast was good with a lot of options. Bottom Line : I would definitely stay at that hotel again if I get to visit Rome one more time. I would recommend that you have a rented car as it is a bit far from the city center (shuttle bus available also to the nearest train station). The hotel is new, modern, cheap and very well kept . The service is good , with free parking .

It takes 10 minutes from the hotel to Rebbibia metro station and 30 more to the center. This is very inconvenient if, for example, you plan to go out in the night for a drink when the metro stops. We had to rent a bike and with this means we were at the city center in 20 minutes. The personel is not helpful and almost unprofessional. For example at about 8 in the evening a glasss broke in our room. When we went to the reception and asked for a room maid to clean up the glasses from the floor the response from the two staff members in the reception was that there were no room maid on duty until next morning and we were handed over a piece of paper (!) so that we would clean the glasses from the floor by our shelves.

Good: The hotel has parking, although limited, you can park anywhere onsite if not blocking other vehicles....ie.right at the front. It's only a 10 min drive to the centre, or you can simply use the free courtesy bus that will drop you off at the bus station and then it's a 15 min ride into Rome. The rooms are ultra modern, the bed is good, the bathroom is excellent, towels are of good quality, toileteries are provided and the room is cleaned daily. There are plenty of English channels and Wifi is free. Bad: No real bad points especially for the price.....my only point would be that the hotel is aimed at business people only....meaning that for the average guest, there is nothing more than a nice room and parking......I guess this is reflected in the price, though the room more than makes up for this in quality. Summary: So if this is going to be your base for Rome you really can't do any better for the price as a similar hotel in central Rome will set you back at least three times the money.
