Also, the rose petals that the hotel offered in it's \"romantic package\" (which costed an extra 100 euros, among with a -quite good- champagne and a couple of macarons), as we were honeymooners, were fake (by fabric). And furthermore, they even charged extra for wifi internet! In terms of location, next time we go to Paris, we would prefer a hotel either nearer to the shopping areas (e.g. near Opera) or a little further out of centre for a better value for money, since being close to the Arch you still need the Metro to go near the river banks, to the Tower or to go shopping.

Deciding on a hotel to stay at while visiting Paris for 2 nights was pretty traumatic. This was largely due to the fact that most of my friends that had been to Paris before told me to expect small rooms and horrible service from even the best 5 star hotels there. In the end I decided to book a room at the Villa & Hotel Majestic based entirely on online user reviews and it turned out to be a fabulous choice. Sure the hotel might be slightly pricey compared to other boutique hotels...but the experience was completely worth it. The location would have to be one of the hotel's main plus points since it is less than a 5 minute walk from the Arc de Triumph and the Champs Elysees. It is also less than a 15 minute walk to the Eiffel Tower not to mention the close proximity to metro stations. I doubt you will find a hotel which is placed more conveniently for a tourist. The room was extremely spacious for 2 people and the decor was perfect. The large windows allow the room to be flooded with light so you will always step into a bright room which is personally very important to me. The room was equipped with all your normal modern amenities and had ample closet space as well. The beds were extremely comfortable and the bathrooms were neat and clean. But I think the service is what truly blew my mind. From the time we walked into the hotel we were greeted with a warm welcome and our check in was quick and effortless. The staff were extremely polite,approachable and accommodating. The concierge was a tremendous help to us as well since he organized tickets, arranged for taxis, helped with walking directions and even recommended restaurants. All in all, we were always made to feel welcome. Having stayed at some of the finest hotels around the world in the past, I can assure you that it is very difficult to find a hotel that lives up to all of the hype. A hotel that is ideally located might have horrible service whereas a hotel that has great service might have tiny rooms. The Villa and Hotel Majestic, however, is one of those rare few that offer great service, great location and great rooms. I don't know when my next trip to Paris will be but when I do go back, I know that I will definitely be checking in to the Villa and Hotel Majestic again.", "Date": "September 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "malibu", "Title": "\u201cA stunning jewel and oasis in the 16th, almost perdection\"\u201d", "Author": "mrsmikael", "ReviewID": "UR115032575", "Content": "great \"equipe\" here, everyone, from the front desk staff to the bellboys, stunningly helpful and charming.
