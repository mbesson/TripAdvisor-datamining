This hotel is located right next to Tokyo station which is great for business. The reception is on the 32nd floor so the rooms all have a good view. The rooms are modern and very comfortable with a good size double bed in the single deluxe room. The staff were very friendly and spoke okay English. I would recommend this hotel to anyone as their rates are very competitive.", "Date": "Sep 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR855393012", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Genki1"}, {"Content": "Great location and good service       View from the room", "Date": "Jan 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR522078508", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "mc582"}, {"Content": "solid choice for business This very new hotel is conveniently adjacent to Tokyo station's Nihonbashi exit, which means it's handy for transportation; JR, subway, shinkansen, and Narita express trains are all available within a relatively short walking distance. Since the hotel is also part of the JR group you can book shinkansen tickets with the concierge.It can be a litttle hard to find the hotel since Tokyo station is so huge. Make sure you know where you're going before arriving! The attractive multistory open lobby is on the 27th floor of the Sapia Tower office building and rooms are on floors above, so views of the city are terrific.Since the hotel is so new, rooms and facilities are stylish, pristine, and comfortable. My single room was a little small but perfectly serviceable. Free internet service is provided. There's a refrigerator stocked with bottled water every day but there's no minibar. The breakfast buffet had a good selection of Japanese and western foods.The hotel definitely feels oriented to business clientele with its quiet, officelike atmosphere and understated service. However, there seemed to be a few tourists -- mostly Japanese -- staying there too. For the money it was a great deal compared to other similar-class hotels in the area, but it's not a hotel you'd want to hang around in for the atmosphere or action.", "Date": "Dec 7, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR801861740", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "voito"}, {"Content": "Great location, good service - great new hotel Stayed in a Deluxe single at the Metropolitan Marunouchi for 6 nights on business, booked through the Japanese website Rakuten.For someone requiring a base around Tokyo station for travelling around Kanto - it must be hard to beat this hotel at the moment.Finding the entrance to the hotel was a bit of challenge, but more down to navigating to the correct exit from the station.Staff were friendly and attentive, hotel immaculate (opened in May 07) and service top class. Breakfast was a buffet and plenty of choice, the rooms were quiet and there was no noise leakage from the train tracks below.Free in-room internet was a nice bonus, and the selection of amenities was good though fairly standard for a Japanese hotel of this grade. Room size was perfectly adequate, par for the course for central Tokyo - fittings and furnishings good quality.There are plenty of food options in the neighbouring buildings and nearby areas.Overall, highly recommended as a base for business and tourists alike.", "Date": "Sep 24, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR425722749", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "JCS76"}, {"Content": "Good value in Central Tokyo! Spent 4 comfortable nights in this fantastically located hotel. Adjacent to Tokyo Station getting around is easy and there are many facilities and resources around the hotel.Room was small, but decent by Tokyo standards. Very modern. Very clean and very comfortable. Free internet access ids provide to all guests in each room. A nice feature!Staff were pleasant and service was excellent. They went out of their way to make my experience at the hotel a good one.The hotel occupies the top eight floors of a building, starting at 27 ... so every room has a decent city view.The only negative experience at the hotel was the atrocious buffet breakfast.
