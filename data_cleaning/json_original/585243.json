{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Standard business hotel I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights during my business trip to Frankfurt (training). It was chosen by the company organizing training and I slept there mostly due to good location, close to the company.The hotel is nice and clean, the breakfast is fine, typical german one, but nothing special (I had better breakfasts in german hotels). The room was pretty small so I could give 3* to this hotel instead of 4. The breakfast is served on the first floor.The train line is something 100m away and was not so disturbing - probably mostly due to bad weather so I had to keep windows closed ;-).There is free wireless Internet connection available.It is pretty close from LokalBahnfof train station, you just need to go under the train line (approx. 400m). From airport you need to take S-Bahn S8 or S9 and change on Haupthbahnhof to S3 or S4.", "Date": "Dec 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR320406395", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "komalo"}, {"Content": "Horrible - Mistakes over mistakes  We booked Hotel Cult for a Bachelorette Weekend of a friend and booked all in all 3 double rooms for the girls. One girl went to the hotel early to check into all rooms and as she was the organizer of the weekend - she checked in and left little presents for all girls on the bed. After picking us all up at the train station - we returned to the hotel to get to the rooms. Three rooms were booked - 206, 207 and 208 - all together and very close and already checked in. When we arrived - we tried to get into room 208 - but the lock didnt work. We tried over and over again and out of the blue, the door opens from the inside and a man is in the already-checked-in-room by my girlfriend. We asked what he was doing and he said, they gave him the room. He already took advantage of the presents left in the room by one of us for the rest of the group and said: he thought it was a present by the hotel for him. We contacted the front desk and got another room for the 3rd party - room 229. We showered, changed and left for the night out with the girls.Upon return at 3:30 in the morning - the key to room 229 does not work again. The front desk reprogrammed it and it still didnt work. The guy at the front desk tried to argue with me at 3.30am that it might not be my room and I have to proof it is mine! Since another girl - that was already in bed, as all other rooms were easy to access - booked the whole stay - the front desk guy shouted at me I have to get her to get it under control. I tried calling room 206 - where she was staying, but no answer. I walked upstairs - she was already in bed and said the phone never rang. She got dressed again to go downstairs and talk to the front desk guy that still wanted prove that it is my room. By that time, everyone was pissed off. The front desk guy trying to argue with a guest and telling me I dont know my room - at 3:30am`????It became 4am and I still wasnt in the room. The front desk guy came upstairs to check on the lock - it did not work. In the end, he told me, I have to sleep in another room and he will call someone tomorrow - to let the lock open up. Since this weekend was a get together of even girls that never met - I slept in a room with a girl that I never met before, didnt even have my sleeping clothes and was worried about my stuff in the room as the front desk guy told me, they will play with the lock tomorrow morning some time. Great, just go into my room. He told me, the front desk would call me, once the technician was there - but they never did until I called them at 9:30am. I got the new key to MY ROOM and finally was able to brush teeth and shower.We had a light breakfast and went to check out - trying to tell them with all the mistakes - we are not going to pay. The front desk guy called the boss who than tried to argue with us for about one hours, that we have to pay. He would give us a small deduction - but since we had a roof over our head, we have to pay. The boss was a turkish guy that tried to argue with us like on a market and would make new price offers here and there and he told us he had to feed 3 kids and blah blah....it was really just stress in the morning.Not even that we told him that we are looking to book the hotel more frequently for friends and groups doing a weekend in Frankfurt let him get off the arguing mood and he still wanted to charge us.In the end we had to pay a reduced price for the hotel - but even that is for a 4 star hotel with only mistakes during the whole stay - just unexaptable. We were also thinking about security reasons - first someone else is in a already checked room. What if we had our luggage in there already and they let someone else into the room??? Second - someone will play with the lock tomorrow to open it....but none of us was present? Very shady.....is all I can say. Rooms are alright, but not 4 star - I would say a 3 star. They are clean and nicely stocked with towels and little hotel-goodies in the bathroom. Staff is unfriendly and not willing to make your stay great - and that for a 4 star hotel is unexeptable!!! Trying to argue with a guest in a 4 star hotel at 3.30am to let them into the room - NOOO WAY!!!Breakfast was good though, the buffet was well stocked and nice. Had eggs and different cereal. Overall I would not stay at the hotel again - just because of the staff and the unfriendliness of the Boss - who was arguing about money for the room instead of letting us off easy after such a night and experience.", "Date": "Jul 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR242470486", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "KatharinaBasel"}, {"Content": "Clean Comfortable Inexpensive Stay We booked a room at Hotel Cult the day before we arrived. We were traveling back to the US via the Frankfurt Intl Airport and needed something clean, close to the trains and inexpensive. With the exchange rate not in favor of Americans, it is difficult to find places uner 75 Euros that isn't a dump. I will admit I was a bit worried when we got to the neighborhood this hotel is in, because it didn't look too nice. But we were surprised when we checked in that it was, indeed, very clean and comfortable. They even offer free WiFi which we had yet to find available at other hotels. We had spent a decent amount of money on internet already, so it was nice to connect for free.The only thing I would warn about is that they claimed their credit card machine was broken and we'd have to pay cash. We booked this place with intentions of not using cash since we were hopping a flight home the next day. He asked for cash, but we told him to take our credit card number and run it when they fixed the machine. The next morning when we paid, the sign that the machine was broken was still posted, but the machine worked fine. We think it might have been a hoax to get people to pay cash.The breakfast was VERY nice. One of the nicer breakfasts we had on our whole trip to europe. Other people have complained that it is close to the train station and therefore noisy, but any schmoe can look online at a map and see this before booking. We booked it BECAUSE it was close to the train station and we carry earplugs with us where ever we go since you never know what kind of noises you'll encounter when sleeping somewhere new. I am an extremely light sleeper and basic earplugs did a fine job of allowing me to sleep soundly at this hotel. Our room even faced the train station.So, if you're looking for a long stay in a plush hotel, this is not the hotel for you. But if you're looking for a place that is simple, clean, friendly and in close proximity to the city and public transportation, it is a great deal. For 59 euros we were very happy.", "Date": "Oct 1, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR510036304", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "JAZSTOWE"}, {"Content": "I hated Hotel Cult - I would not recommend it I stayed at this Hotel while I attended the Automechanika trade show this September. I have visited Frankfurt six times and this was one of the worst hotels I have stayed in. The room was clean and the staff was friendly, however a train line runs close by the hotel and trains pass by constantly making sleep very difficult. There was no a/c and it was very hot. Therefore you had to keep the windows open which made it seem as if you were staying in the middle of a train station! Breakfast is supposed to be served from 7:00am to 10:00am but usually everything ran out by 9:00am. The hotel is ideally located in terms of public transport as it is only a few minutes by foot from the train station or the tram station. However, this hotel is definitely not a 4 star hotel. If it was marketed as a 3 star with an appropriately lower price, I would not have been so upset. For the price, there are other hotels close to this one which offer much better facilities - the Lindner Hotel is one example!", "Date": "Sep 21, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR815954957", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Jamekya_Traveller"}, {"Content": "An OK hotel - price of a 3star, but also is not worth 4* This is an OK hotel in Frankfurt, but I was surprised by its award of a 4*The good points of this hotel are:* A nice breakfast which can be taken outside* Location is not bad - close enough to the bar area of Frankfurt - although the neighborhood itself did not feel very friendly* Good value for money, particularly taking into account typical Frankfurt prices.The not so good points are:* Very small room, very small bathroom too without shampoo, the double bedroom had two twin beds put together (no doublebeds available).* Service was not very friendly - and with poor english (and not great german either)* Limited and expensive parking included - although parking outside the street (or on the street behind the hotel) can be easily found", "Date": "Jul 16, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR502856228", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Hypnos"}, {"Content": "Great Hotel - Awesome Location       First floor lobby", "Date": "May 1, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR611710917", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "mandlintx"}, {"Content": "Great value for the money We were three guys (and one couple) spending 2 nights there in March 2006.
