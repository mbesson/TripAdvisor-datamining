We were in a superior suite with a king size bed. The room was great. The room had lots of space, the washroom with a soaker tub and rainfall shower head, well stocked kitchenette, spacious bedroom, cozy living room. Before I went one complaint I read about was the noise from outside. We were on the fourth floor and yes you could hear traffic and emergency vehicles, the windows were definitely not sound proof. Growing up in the city, these noises didn't bother us and easily became background noise and didn't bother us from sleeping soundly. If you are a very light sleeper and outside noise bothers you it may be something to be aware of before booking. Another complaint I read about was the duvet. It is paper thin almost looks like a sheet, wasn't sure if I was going to like it because I usually like to sleep with a more fluffy style duvet but it was cozy and there is a furry blanket in the closet if you want something heavier. There was a choice of a firm or soft pillow, all in all a comfortable sleep. My one disappoint was when booking this trip we were choosing between being in the city or going out to the eastern townships because it was my birthday weekend and I really wanted an outdoor hot tub. I was really excited to find this place that I could be in the city and enjoy an outdoor hot tub, which was the main reason we booked here. Unfortunately it was out of service and would not be repaired until Monday. From a customer service perspective I wish we were informed in advance and given the opportunity to reschedule our stay, which we would have done, seeing as how the outdoor hot tub was our main reason for staying there. So just beware that sometimes these special amenities do breakdown and probably best not to plan your trip around them.

We had never, however, stayed at Le Crystal which is relatively new to the Montreal hotel scene. We decided to give it a try and we were not disappointed. The entire staff was very courteous. We had two adjoining rooms and because we arrived early one of the rooms was not yet ready. They allowed us access to our one room and quickly finished cleaning the second, then promptly notified us when it was ready. The location is right across from the Bell Centre so if you are going to a Canadiens game or any other event there, it is a very convenient location. Lively Crescent street is just one block over. It is an all suite hotel and we had two deluxe suites. Some of the comments indicate that the classic suites are small so that it why we opted for the larger suite. It was a nice size with a kitchenette area and a separate sitting area. The bed was a luxurious king with a bearskin throw on top of it. Nice touch. The bathroom was huge. It is a good hotel for families because of the large pool which is about three feet deep. Good for both laps and for kids to play. A lifeguard was on duty all the time. Great views of Montreal from the pool floor plus an outdoor hot tub which we scurried to on a cold January day.

The bathroom was a wow, huge shower with 2 shower heads and all glassed in. 2 sinks and 2 robes with slippers, lots of towels and nice bath products. Lots of space for unpacking, 2 closets, 1.5 dressers and kitchen cupboards. It had a kitchenette that came with a microwave, mini fridge, esspresso machine and kettle. I brought a toaster for toast in the morning and wished I had brought a coffee maker as there was not one there, you could not have reg coffee unless you ordered it was 10 dollars or went downstairs to cafe for a bit cheaper. Coffee was not that great, weak, so bring your own coffee maker and coffee if you can. They had plates, cutlery, mugs, glasses, all you really need for small meals. The hotel has a great outside hot tub, use it, it's big and nice to be outside. The pool was a tad bit cool, would of been nice to be a bit warmer and they had to great saunas and a lounge area.

So the pool was good, hotel room good, but the best part was the service....wow, the bell boys were fantastic...we got there, they helped unload the car, brought the stuff to the room, parked the car and then went to get me some stuff that I forgot from it. when we were leaving we went to ask for a luggage holder, he brought it up, we filled it and he took it back and loaded the car for us before we even got down. The front desk was at our becking call and the maids were great. All in all it was a great stay...also in less then 5 min walk you are at all kinds of outside stores, restaurants, pubs, night clubs and to get on the highway was easy, the 720 was right there. great location, I will be back.

That being said let me get my one negative point, that dropped it from 5 to 4 stars on my experience, out of the way first. The \"computerized comfort settings\" (lighting, heating, TV, etc.), in my experience were overly annoying. I understand the idea behind them and if I were staying here by myself they would probably be a very cool feature. But I was staying in a Deluxe Suite with 3 other guys (we were in Montr\u00c3\u00a9al for a bachelor party). You have to put a key-card in a slot right by the door in order to control the settings of the room's electronics (including the TV). The problem comes up when the person who has their key in the slot decides to run out for beer and they take their card out... and everything in the room turns off. The first time it happened we all thought there was a power outage. That lasted about 5 minutes until we figured out that someone has to keep their card in the slot at all times, while we're in the room. There now that I got that out of the way on to the rest of the review, which is all positive. The Crystal is an absolutely beautiful hotel! The suite we had was roomy enough for 4 grown men to sleep, without overlapping each other... and we were able to comfortably entertain a few guests during the early evening in the living room area. The fridge was large enough to fit about 20 beer bottles. The bedroom with a king sized bed was used by \"the groom\" so I can't really comment, aside from it being decent sized with pretty cool sliding \"frosted\" glass doors. The bathroom was as big as some budget hotels' bedrooms... actually I think one of our guys ended up passing out in the tub. Our view was nice overlooking rue Rene Levesque & the Bell Centre. The complimentary WiFi signal was very strong as well... But the crown jewel of the place, for me anyway, was the top floor pool and jacuzzi area. Taking a post-dinner dip in the pool is always fun... but absolute relaxation is reached when your sitting in a outdoors hot tub, sipping an ice cold beer, overlooking the picturesque Montr\u00c3\u00a9al skyline. I could definitely get used to that kind of living! I'm more of a \"value over luxury\" type of traveler so places like this are usually never on my radar, but I can definitely appreciate how the other half live when given the opportunity. I would recommend this hotel for couples looking for a perfect, romantic experience (they have customizable packages). Also bachelor parties that need a bit more room then just a bed, four walls, and a bathroom.

For my husband's birthday I bought us tickets to see the Boston Bruins play in Montreal. The hotel is very close to the Bell Centre where the Canadiens play, so that is what attracted me to the hotel at first. However the reviews were so glowing on TripAdvisor that I booked us a King Superior room. I found that the rates directly through the hotel were the same as if I booked the room through one of the discount sites. I like to do that when I can, as I always think the hotels prefer when guests book through them. When booking, I asked for a higher floor, and they honored that when we checked in. The hotel is very chic and modern, and the staff is extremely helpful and warm. A lovely young woman named Amelie helped us upon check-in. She took out a map and was able to highlight a few things for us. She was a perfect hostess! The room itself was lovely. There was a separate seating area/kitchenette from the bedroom. The bathroom was quite large and there was a big soaking tub separate from the shower. I don't usually take a bath, but it was very tempting, so I ended up taking a bubble bath. The bed was very comfortable as well. All and all, I was very pleased with the value, location, comfort level, etc. My only regret is that I did not bring a swimsuit. The indoor pool and hot tub on the 12th floor looked amazing. There is a beautiful view of the city from the indoor pool as well as the outdoor hot tub! The location was great as well. We were a 1 min walk to the Bell Centre and if you go one block in the other direction, you hit St. Catherine's Street (lots of shopping and food). There were two great breakfast places nearby as well - M Cafe and Eggspectation. We found a lot of good food in Montreal. Before we left a friend told us to go to Schwartz's (need to take a cab from the hotel). Most locals know what it is - it is a deli that serves delicious smoked meat. A line forms outside of the place around lunch time, so we got there at 11:30 and made it in just before the line formed. You will want to order their famous smoked meat sandwich with mustard. We have heard that some wealthy New Yorkers even fly up to Montreal just to eat there! After lunch we walked around a lot in that area (many locals shopping around). St. Denis street is not too far and is a great street for shopping in unique stores and also stopping in at a chocolatier. One of my favorite stores was Arthur Quentin on St. Denis...beautiful cookware, dishes and home accessories!", "Date": "October 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel with a great location\u201d", "Author": "nanoucy", "ReviewID": "UR119389577", "Content": "I spent a girls weekend there and we stayed in a Deluxe Room.

The bedroom is closed off to the living area and has a great fake fur blanket for extra comfort. There is ample closet and drawer space, which I imagine is great for longer stays.

We were greatly displeased by the valet parking, understandably parking downtown is expensive, but to have to pay each time you want something out of your car is just ridiculous. The front desk as well was rude and unhelpful, I can only imagine what a sour image they portray to tourists from other countries. I hope this doesn't make people think less of Montrealers and our friendly attitudes. Room service was deplorable, we ordered two hamburgers, a fry and a sandwich for $65+, I didn't mind the price, but you figure that they could at least be friendly when bringing it to your room.

We took a car service from the airport for a flat rate of $50 + tip which worked out well. We made no prior arrangement; we just walked up to the cab line. The hotel was very nice and clean. The staff was pleasant and helpful. We were a few hours early for check in but after half an hour we were checked in with no problem. The room was large with some crowded counter space and a stocked mini-fridge. The fridge had enough space for our own wine, milk and juice. (Wine and liquor is two blocks right on Catherine and a somewhat large pharmacy/grocery was about five blocks to the left on Catherine.) We had a Deluxe King room that had a view of a parking lot. As far as I can tell all the views from any room are either of another building or a parking lot. The hotel occupies only floors 4-11 so with all the other buildings around you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really get high enough to have a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153view of downtown\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd although, technically, since you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in downtown anything you see is a view of downtown. The rest of the room was consistent with what other reviewers had to say. We used the pool/hot tub a couple of times. The pool was warm enough to stay in without feeling a chill. The outside deck around the hot tub was nice but, not as nice as the website pictures would lead you to believe \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but still nice to sit outside and read or nap. We both had deep tissue messages at the spa. Our therapist was Olga(?). It was great, the deepest deep tissue I have ever had (wife agrees) but, it did leave some marks on my back for a few days \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not complaining at all, but if you were planning on wearing something backless you might want to consider the consequences. Hint \u00e2\u20ac\u201c join the Crystal Club and save 15% at the spa. The gym is surprisingly small. When we checked in we took a quick walk through and thought it was of good size, but when we went to work out we seemed to be in each other\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s way. There was also one other person using the equipment at the time and there just wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough room. It basically had a couple of treadmills, a bench, lighter free weights and a multi-purpose strength machine. One morning we walked to the top of Mount Royal, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s less that half an hour walk. The view is great and worth seeing but the walk up hill and hundreds of steps can be a challenge if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not ready for it. Le Coupole restaurant in the hotel is very good. We ate there one night. Note - there was a concert at Bell Centre that night and they had a prix-fixe menu until 8:00 so, we had to wait until after the rush to get the regular menu. The surrounding restaurants are hit or miss. Most of the restaurants in the area are just touristy places with average food, but you can find a couple that are nice. We really liked L\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Autre Saison on Crescent. I would avoid the Italian restaurant Il Compari Centro just across from the hotel on Montagne. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the first one on the right heading toward Catherine. It is very expensive for almost-unacceptable food. We bought a 3-day metro pass and that worked out well. The station is only a couple of blocks from the hotel. Old Montreal is two or three stops away. It isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too far to walk to Old Montreal but there is a lot of walking once you get there. Again, we found the restaurants to be average but, if you get a recommendation you can probably find someplace nice. We also were able to use the metro to get to the casino and Olympic Park. The metro was very convenient; we never waited more than 5 minutes for a train, even on the weekend. The metro itself seemed safe, as far as metros go. However, the homeless in Montreal are surprisingly aggressive (compared to NYC, Washington D.C., Las Vegas and San Francisco). There are other chain hotels in the area, some with higher floors (Sheraton I think?) but, I doubt you would get the same space in the room or the level of service you get at Crystal. Overall, the hotel is very nice and would stay there again.", "Date": "August 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ventura, CA", "Title": "\u201cThumbs up to a great little luxury hotel in Montreal !\u201d", "Author": "JCranford", "ReviewID": "UR116728983", "Content": "We had an exceptional stay in an executive suite.

We appreciated that they had the roll-away in the room and ready to use when we arrived, which is something we often don't find. Once the sofa bed was opened, you couldn't even walk in the living room but we only opened it at bed time and it wasn't a big deal to fold back up. We didn't use it but the little kitchenette had enough equipment available to make a meal if you wanted. As mentioned by other reviewers, there isn't much room in the bedroom for anything besides the King bed but the bed itself was comfortable. There are two closets in the bedroom and a reasonably sized hall closet. I couldn't fit my full-size suitcase in the bedroom closet and still access it's contents (I didn't unpack since we were only there two nights) so with that left in the corner of the room I literally had to step over it to get around to the far side of the bed but we spent so little time there that it didn't really matter.

It's just three metro stops from the Old Town area and a 10 minute walk to the train station so reasonably located if you want to be downtown.

It is a newer hotel in the city, conveniently located to rue St. Catherine and perfect for being the base for exploring the city. Upon checking in, we were given the Superior Suite which I had booked. Upon entering the room, the layout made the space seem significantly smaller than it actually was due to the way the bedroom is separated from a small living area. When I mentioned my concern to the front desk, the very helpful staff were able to provide an upgrade at a small cost to a deluxe room, which offered a much more expansive sitting area and better views of the city. The bedroom had a very comfortable bed and a second flat screen TV. Reading lights as well as bedside lamps ensured you can read without disturbing others. The bathroom in our suite was expansive! There was a separate glass shower stall with a rain shower, and a large (and deep) bath tub. The amenities were Molton Brown. Everything was sparkling clean, and the towels were fluffy and white! We did experience a couple of hiccups during the stay. We had made reservations for dinner at La Coupole, specifically asking to be seated on the terrasse. We arrived for our dining reservation only to find the terrasse had been closed that evening due to a threat of rain. We were offered a table indoors, but noticed there was absolutely no-one else eating in the restaurant at 7:30pm... We declined the indoors table, and found outdoor dining elsewhere. Our other hiccup was with housekeeping. We returned early one evening from a day of exploring Montreal (on foot) and found our room had not yet been serviced. When we contacted housekeeping, they said they could send someone up - but we had to get showered and ready for leave for dinner, so that really wasn't convenient. They did send someone to clean the room while we were out for dinner, but it left us wondering why they were so late to start with... All in all, I would definitely recommend Hotel Le Crystal as a place to stay in Montreal. The staff was helpful when needed and very accommodating of requests.

It is directly across from the Bell Center, which is ideal for hockey lovers there to see the game. We weren't, but enjoyed watching from afar everyone coming and going. There were no other highlights to the hotel. The staff was OK. The hotel photos made it appear nicer than it really was. The room service menu for breakfast was very limited. There were no egg dishes, waffle, pancakes, potatoes, or breakfast meats. For several days that we had room service for breakfast we had bagels with salmon and cream cheese, french toast, coffee and a glass of orange juice. Just about everyday, room service forgot to bring something, whether the water or cream cheese. It was so frustrating having to call down everyday to have them bring something they forgot. It was like clock work. Also on the menu was yogurt, cold cereal and a fruit dish. That was about it. There is only one restaurant in the entire hotel. The one evening we were going to dine there, we were advised we couldn't because a private party was being held there and it was off limits to hotel guest. We were advised we could order room service from the restaurant menu. Instead we asked the desk attendant to recommend a restaurant in the city. We followed her recommendation . The food was okay but it was way, totally overprice for what we got and the food was just okay. The service was slower than molasses. The fitness center is good for two people. It's very small, but has sufficient equipment. If more than two people are there, it's uncomfortable, as it's so tiny. There is only one large mirror that two people can fit in front of at one time. There is a nice swimming pool and sauna, with an outdoor hot tub in the hotel. Skip the facial. It's so totally not worth the money. I had a facial and opted for the collagen mask. The aesthetician was a very young girl named Maria. She cleansed my face, put some serum on it, massaged my face for a mere MINUTE, put the mask on and left me there for twenty minutes. She returned, said I was done and charged me $136.00. I've had many a facial in my days and this was by far the absolute worst. A complete rip off. Don't waste your money. You could give yourself a better facial or get one someplace else. Beware! This hotel was nothing to write home about and I would not recommend it to anyone accept a hockey enthusiast there to see the game at the Bell Centre across the street.

Furnitures are modern and I liked the style, neutral tones of gray and beige mixed with glass and wood, they make look the room even more confortable. The hotel has also an amazing spa, a gym and a swimming pool, everything kept with the maximum of cleanliness and order.

I spent hours researching Montreal hotels before settling on the Crystal because it had a fireplace. It had that and so much more. The hotel itself was spectacular, the room ridiculously amazing, from the kitchen where I could cook small meals and make espresso, the giant soaking tub, the floor to ceiling windows, the fireplace, balcony, to small details like the turndown service with the next day's tempurature printed and the great toiletries. I could walk everywhere to great boutiques, pubs and restaurants, caught a hockey game across the street (and all of the players were staying at our hotel which made the elevator rides fun), had a guided tour pick me right up from the hotel, and was 2 blocks from the main train station. The rooftop jacuzzi was to die for, and i enjoyed a day at the spa which was great. Tip - join the Crystal Club (free) as I got free breakfast in my room every day (and on time) plus 15% off at the spa. The breakfast was so huge I saved parts of it to make grilled cheese sandwiches for lunch or snacks and sent my friend home with tons of croissants and danish each day. Everyone is so nice, from the front desk to valet to the lifeguard to the breakfast delivery guy and because it is a small hotel, they quickly and efficiently attend to every need.

I read many reviews before and after booking our reservations through Expedia. I cannot say anything negative about the hotel rooms. The front desk staff (Edith, Sophie, and Milien (sp)) were extremely helping and accommodating any time I had special requests. They would go out of their way to help you out; more so than any other hotel I have stayed at in the last five years. The furnishings and decorations were very nice and chic. Our first room (which we turned down) did not have a separate bedroom so I called the front desk and within 3 minutes Sophie was there to lead us to a more spacious room. The bathroom was very large and I love the shower head so much that I want to install one in my master suite. The tangerines in the morning were a nice touch as we headed off to walk the streets of Montreal. My son enjoyed two nights using the pool, sauna, and whirlpool. The computers were always available and in working condition. Even the cleaning lady was very hospitable and made sure we had fresh supplies of bathroom products such as shampoo, etc. every day. I highly recommend the grayline bus tour to Qu\u00c3\u00a9bec City which lasts all day; it is very informative and you will learn a lot of interesting historical facts. I guess the only area where i would suggest improvement was La Coupole. We ate one dinner there and i found it rather overpriced for the portion sizes.

Never having been there before we took this route into the hotel because this is where the taxi driver dropped us off. Had we realized we would have walked around to the front doors where no doorman is present but the doors do open automatically so with luggage you could have entered without any issues. You need to push the panel button on the post by the exterior front door to get the first set to open; the second set opens automatically. Upon exit both sets of doors open automatically\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6..a nice touch for non staffed doorways. We walked up to the front desk with luggage in tow and there were at least 6 hotel desk employees all buried into their computer monitors and not one looked up to greet us. After about 2 minutes another employee arrived from another location and she warmly greeted us. The same employee helped us several times from the concierge desk later during our trip. She needs to be the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s desk staff trainer. We waited long enough unacknowledged to feel very uncomfortable almost invisible. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve read other reviews about the staff being indifferent so it must be absolutely true. They had a remarkable ability to ignore a hotel guest. The staff member who saved us from our wait was very lovely, helpful and friendly and almost made us forget the previous lack of acknowledgment\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6almost. After check in, there was no offer to assist with luggage from the valet or bellman. We had two large rolling suitcases and two carry-on pieces so it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t an issue to handle it ourselves. We had made it this far but some assistance in figuring out the required card key-operated room lighting would have been nice and the very least a hotel can do is offer to assist with luggage. We were tired from the trip. If there are two of you traveling together and sharing a room, make sure to request two keys so if one person leaves the other is not left in the room with no lighting since the key (in our room anyway) had to be left in the slot in order for the lights to stay on and operate. You need your card key each time you use the up elevator to get to your floor, you need it to enter your room of course, and then again to allow switching on the room lighting. The trick is to leave your key in the slot in the room that controls the lighting panel and not just swipe it. Leave the card key in the slot inside the room door. Lighting in the room was more for romance and ambiance over reading. The floor lamp should have a higher wattage bulb for reading purposes and it could easily be moved around to other locations where a little extra lighting is necessary. We arrived at our room and everything immediately got better. The room was lovely. We had upgraded to a Deluxe suite in the reservation process and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m glad we did. It has a separate King bedroom with beautiful sliding frosted glass doors. The seating area, dining area entry way, and kitchenette are all nice indeed for the room price. Almost 700 square feet per the website and beautifully decorated with more closet, drawer and shelving storage than I have ever seen in a hotel room or apartment. The kitchenette is not meant for any sort of cooking or real meals. It is stocked with 4 dinner plates, 4 bread & butter plates, 4 of each kind of flatware, 4 placemats, 1 cereal/soup bowl, 1 salt/pepper grinder, and some assorted useless cooking utensils. There is no cooktop so it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make much sense to have cooking utensils. They need to add a corkscrew and bottle opener, cheese knife, and bread knife. The advertised refrigerator in every suite is filled with their mini bar items for sale so there is not much room left for your own purchases. If requested, they would probably rid the room of the food items for sale. I like to keep some milk in the room for my coffee. There were two pot holders and 1 dishtowel. There is a spacious in-room safe with a lit interior, wired or wireless internet access free of charge, an espresso machine, an electric kettle and a hidden microwave. We never had a loss of our internet connection. The glass turntable tray in the microwave was missing rendering it useless for an even heating process. It should be replaced. If you offer an appliance it needs to be in working order with all the necessary accessories. Having said that, the rooms are beautiful, clean (see grout comment) and comfortable. The sofa is plush and inviting. The club chairs are neither. I would have preferred one nice comfortable club chair over two hard uninviting and uncomfortable leather ones. The soaking tub and separate shower and bathroom amenities are absolutely fabulous. They need an extra blanket or some throws. The furry throws you see in all the other pictures were not existent in this suite nor were any extra blankets for the cold-natured. Asking for one would probably have easily solved the lack of one. There are no instructions for the espressos machine but it the type you insert the coffee capsule and the machine does the work. Fill the back basin with cold water, lift the lever on top, insert the coffee capsule, close the lever and put the espresso cup under the spout, press the button with the small cup or large cup and it instantly brews espresso into the provided glass espresso cups. Here is a tip for regular coffee drinkers, just make a cup of espresso and then pour it into one of the ceramic mugs and fill with boiling water from the electric kettle and you have a nice flavorful cup of regular coffee. There are no decaf choices and the creamers are all flavored so if you like plain milk or creamer you should buy some before your first morning as well as some sugar. They are skimpy on the sweeteners. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure just asking for some solves that issue as well. I ordered ice for the thermal stainless steel ice bucket and it arrived both times in just a few short minutes. The service in this hotel is good if you overlook our issue when we first arrived. Housekeeping stocks the room with plenty of plain and flavored tea bag choices for tea drinkers. Some plain instead of flavored creamers would have been nice to have. The concierge can point you to a nearby market that stocks everything you need about 5 blocks away from the hotel. Room service meals are expensive, no surprise there. Housekeeping will bring more of the espresso capsules upon request. The perfect solution would be for the hotel to include a French press in the kitchenette and some regular ground coffee. The in room thermostat is Celsius so do your conversions before you leave to calculate your favorite room temp if visiting from the USA. 21 Celsius is right at 70 in Fahrenheit if that helps. There is a dock for your iPhone, iPod or mp3 player with a universal plug-in adapter included so bring your tunes with you. Do not disturb is operated by pressing a button on a panel by the door. Housekeeping honors the do not disturb request. If you want maid service you have to request it before 4:30PM if you have left your do not disturb light on all morning. Housekeeping did a nice job of freshening the room daily except for our last night we seemed to be short of fresh towels as compared to the other days. The room was very clean and organized except for the shower and it had a lot of mold and mildew from a lack of detailed cleaning. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve included pictures of the room as it was when we arrived. The Molton Brown bath products are a nice touch. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t leave without soaking with the Dead Sea salt bath soak product included free of charge. It was very nice after a long day of walking the streets of Montreal. The rooms are quiet. You can open the windows for fresh air if you like. We checked out the hot tub (exterior) on the roof, the exercise room and the indoor salt water pool. We did not use them but I wish we had found the time to do so. The pool and hot tub are very nice and inviting. The exercise room is small but has several options for cardio and a nice universal weight machine allowing many exercise choices for toning and increasing your heart rate. The equipment appeared to be relatively new and in good working order. Overall this hotel is great. I will most definitely return. It is comfortable, clean and beautifully decorated from the lobby to the guestrooms. It is conveniently located for shopping and sightseeing. The Metro stops for the orange line and/or green line are just a couple of blocks away and the Metro is easy to navigate. Ask the concierge for a street map. We used it several times. You can purchase a 3-day Metro pass for fourteen dollars from the cash only machine. It appears as if you can use a credit card but it did not work for me. The attendant told me the machines are cash only. You do not need to speak French to enjoy Montreal. 90% of signs and menus are in both French and English and all the shopkeepers and desk staff appear to be bilingual and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to mind switching to English for the tourists. Everyone we encountered was very friendly and accommodating. One of the many entrances to Montreal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s famous huge underground mall is just a few blocks from the hotel. My first impression was that this hotel was not going to be all that great. My lasting impression is that this hotel can offer a wonderful traveling experience and is a very nice place to stay for the business or tourist traveler. The hotel needs to do a little training on the housekeepers on the mold and mildew issue in room 905 and add a throw or blanket. Thanks Hotel Le Crystal for a lovely visit to Montreal.

I had such a great experience at Hotel Le Crystal in Montreal last week that I just joined TripAdvisor to encourage others to visit. This hotel is hands-down the best hotel that I have encountered in Montreal, and it may be one of my favorites in North America. When booking my trip to a conference in Montreal, I dreaded staying at one of the major-brand conference hotels because I've been to most of them and found them all mediocre - fine, but not memorable. Hotel Le Crystal was in a great location close to everything I needed so I decided it was worth a try. I am very pleased to have made that decision! The hotel lobby is gorgeous -- refined yet simple, with a feel closer to modern European boutique hotels that what you typically encounter in the U.S. or Canada. Check-in went very smoothly. Having arrived right after 3-4 other people, I was surprised at how quickly and efficiently the hotel staff assisted each guest. Additional staff appeared to help seemingly out of nowhere the moment they realized that there was a short line. I was checked in and headed up to my room less than 5 minutes after arrival. One of the first things you can't help but notice is that the room keys have smart chips in them, which are necessary for operating the elevators and for also running the lights, temperature, etc. in your room. Requiring key cards for the elevator is a nice security feature that I really appreciated as a woman travelling alone. The hotel key also plugs into a panel near the door, which has buttons to help you communicate with housekeeping (e.g., \"do not disturb\" and \"please service room\"). I've been in many hotels where housekeeping seems to do things at their own pace, regardless of what sign you hang outside your room but that wasn't the case here. I'm not sure if it's the electronic message panel or just a very alert housekeeping staff but either way, they serviced the room almost immediately after I set the \"please service room\" button each day. I stayed in an Urban Suite, which was just lovely. Having a suite with a kitchenette (including Nespresso maker), oversized bath (with a fabulous rain shower), separate bedroom (with sliding door and ample close space), and many business amenities included (internet, calls, printing) was such a treat compared to the average major-brand hotel. I was able to work effectively at the desk in the very cozy ergonomic chair or I could also sprawl on the couch to get some reading done. Every piece of furniture is actually comfortable, and makes the hotel experience feel so much more like home. I have gotten used to paying $12-15/day for internet access at many hotels and then often having the internet be very slow at that, so it was a wonderful surprise to find that the intenet was not only included but actually very fast and reliable. I can't help but say more about the kitchenette. I loved having a little refrigerator, microwave, and dishware in the room. I like to bring home leftovers from dinner and don't typically have the option of re-heating them later when travelling on business, so this was also a nice change. There's also a mini-bar and pantry available for any forgotten items but I'd just buy snacks and necessities while out in Montreal. The Nespresso maker was truly the selling point of the kitchenette, however. It was such a luxury to have cafe-quality expressos available to me each morning without having to go to Starbucks. I fell so in love with the Nespresso maker that I came home and purchased one. I fortunately brought my swim suit based upon the description of the saltwater pool on the 12th floor. If you stay at this hotel, you really MUST take advantage of the 12th floor pool, fitness, and sauna options available to you. I went swimming each evening and just enjoyed the view from the outdoor patio (and hot tub) area afterwards. I didn't have an opportunity to try the spa but plan to do so next time. I met a couple of colleagues from the conference in my hotel lobby one night and they remarked, \"Wow -- this is your hotel?! I feel cheated!\" I brought them up to the 12th floor so they could see the amenities and city view, and they then felt especially cheated by their non-Crystal hotel choices. My room ended up being less cost per night than the basic room in the conference hotels, even based upon their discounted rate. I loved my experience but do have two recommendations/comments for hotel management, and one suggestion for guests. One suggestion for management is to make certain that the housekeeping staff replace the coffee supply each day. They were great about coming in and servicing the room when requested, and they did a great job overall. I can only fault them for not replacing the Nespresso pods that I used. I prefer a specific flavor/robustness of coffee and used those pods first, but the housekeeping staff didn't provide any additional pods at all until my 3rd day. I hoped for new coffee each day but didn't receive it until there was nothing left but decaffeinated pods. I also phoned in a maintenance request immediately upon arrival because my safe was broken. I left the room for about 3 hours -- not able to leave any valuables behind in the meanwhile -- and expected it to be fixed upon return. However, nothing had been done. I called again and the operator sent someone within 5 minutes, and he was able to replace the battery and fix it within 10 min. or so. I just wish I hadn't had to call twice, especially over something like a safe, which required me to stay with my valuables until it was done. My recommendation for guests who want a quieter stay: Request a quiet room or a higher-level floor. I was on the 4th floor and overlooking Boul. Rene Levesque and it can get very loud on Fri. and Sat. nights (all night). The hotel's soundproofing is not very good. However, Sun. and Mon. night were much quieter and I slept better. I'll be requesting a higher-level floor and/or a quieter room next time. Despite these very minor issues, I love this hotel and will be returning. I've raved about it so much that I'm going back for a family fall holiday in Oct. and have already booked my new reservation.

We changed our reservations from Le Germain to Le Crystal based on the reviews and the fact that this hotel offered suites,spa and a pool on site. Upon arrival, things did not go very smoothly. We checked in, specifically requesting a quiet room since we were traveling with a small child. We were placed in the back of the hotel in a smaller suite. Once our daughter was asleep, we concluded that our room was not the room upgrade we had paid for and we had a queen instead of a king size bed. However, it was too late to deal with it that night. Well, it was THE worst night of sleep.Garbage bins were located directly below our suite window and every hour or so, a big garbage truck would beep backing up,load and make horrible noises. Needless to say, we did not sleep at all that night. So much for a \"quiet\" room we requested. We addressed this with the front staff in the morning as well as the fact we were given the wrong upgrade to a room.We paid for the 2 upgrades(Deluxe) and were staying in the basic Urban rooms with a smaller bed. They changed our room to the appropriate suite that we booked and paid for our 20$ breakfast as they concluded it was their fault. Although our new suite was perfect, spacious, cleaner and quiet, we did lose a night's sleep, had to move all our belongings and unpack again at the cost of a cheap breakfast. The hotel could have been a bit more sympathetic since it was their fault the previous night was a disaster (on both counts!). The rest of our stay went better despite being tired from the previous night. The pool staff was excellent. Spa staff even better. Valet could honor client's requests. The restaurant was the other downfall... limited menu, we had to call them 3 times to get our order right and the food was mediocre.... oh, and no options for kids.Breakfast was VERY slow despite no one else being in the restaurant. We had to ask twice for our coffee and drinks. The first few days we asked front staff for diner restaurant recommendations. They seemed keen on sending us to fast food or greasy diners as we were with a child. Unfortunately, we do not dine at those establishments and did our own research and found good places (Montreal is FULL of great restaurants). The only worthy staff was a gentleman and a blond woman who worked there in the afternoon on Friday.They seem very helpful and went out of their way to ensure our happiness. The gentleman even called certain restaurants and asked them to make a plate for our child! We were pleased with his helpfulness. This hotel is beautiful and could have so much more potential if they stepped it up a notch or two in certain areas. We go to Montreal frequently and glad we attempted our stay at this hotel but still unsure if we would return or recommend based on how they handled the situation on the first night and how we were treated initially as guests.

We then decided to go to the pool. The young girl that was working there seemed mostly interested at looking at her laptop. At one time she went outside with another worker and it looked like they were both complaining about something. We decided to order a salad and something to drink, and waited, and waited. An hour later someone from the restaurant came to the pool and asked if anyone ordered any food. We said it was us and told him to cancel the order. He didn't seemed too concerned. The next night we decided to get turn down service while we were out. We followed the instructions and left a message. When we got back nothing had been done. I don't think anyone checked for messages. Our last night we decided to eat at their restaurant. I think this is the weakest link for Le Crystal. It was not very crowded but the atmosphere seemed chaotic. Waiters running back and forth - we were never really sure who our waiter was. The two men (probably restaurant manager and beverage manager) in charge took turns laughing it up loudly with one table for 30 minutes at a time - not really concerned about the other customers. I think if those two chipped in and helped their waiters, the chaotic atmosphere would go away and they would earn some respect from the wait staff. The food was just average, but very pricey.

She got someone from housekeeping to let her in, obviously without checking with the front desk. The woman going on and on and asks us if we saw her daughter's phone charger. We said we had not seen it. She insisted on looking around. We tried to move her along (or get the housekeeping staffer to do something), but she wouldn't stop talking and asking about the phone charger. They finally exited the room after a couple minutes. After standing there, dumbfounded, for a couple minutes, we called down to let the front desk know what had happened. We saw the lady from housekeeping having a discussion in the hallway with someone who appeared to be from management. I thought it was inappropriate to do that in the hallway, but I was glad that the situation was being handled. I totally know that the woman from housekeeping assumed that no one was in the room. We had been moved there unexpectedly, but that doesn't excuse her not checking first. We were satisfied with the response in the end.

We have tried five other hotels and chose this one based on reviews at this site and the desire to try yet another Montreal hotel. Overall we were pleased with our choice. Most of the rooms at this boutique hotel are suites. Our choice was a deluxe suite which has a layout with the bedroom located in the middle of the suite without direct access to a window. There is a glass see though panel that opens to the living area. The living room/dining area had two floor to ceiling windows that more then make up for the lack of an outside window in the bedroom. There was also a kitchenette area, and for once, more then enough storage space in the room and bathroom. The look of the suite is contemporary with a slight minimalist feel to it. The bathroom was very spacious and nice, but a little on the boring side for such an ample area. The only other area of the hotel that we used was the swimming pool which was very nice. It is located on the fourteenth floor with walls of glass on two sides. There is also an outside terrace with lounge chairs and a hot tub. Small changing rooms are nearby with showers, as is a sauna. The gym area was nice with big windows, but it did not have enough equipment for a complete workout. The spa is also located on this level but we did not investigate. We tried to have a drink in the hotel at 11:15pm on Saturday night and learned that this was not possible. This was very surprising and disappointing that a nice hotel this size could not provide this basic service. We also could not help but notice that the service at this hotel was not very friendly. We normally do not complain about service or even have service problems, but almost every employee we encountered was just barely friendly. Overall we enjoyed our stay at this property, especially the spacious room and nice pool. If those features are important to you then this hotel is a good choice for you.

However, the coffee in the Millesme cafe was not too bad, so it's worth paying the extra and getting your morning coffee there.

A gentleman in the hotel restaurant told us where the door was, but also quickly grabbed up our luggage and escorted us through the restaurant to the hotel. He ran off so quickly I couldn't even manage to get a tip out of my purse quickly enough to show my gratitude! I forgot my toothbrush and there was one in the room within 3 minutes. Actually, they brought 2! I got blisters from too much walking and there were bandaids in my room within 5 minutes. I wanted to ask a few questions about St. Joseph's Oratory and there was a fresh printout from their website at my door within about 10 minutes (amazing!). Whenever we needed a taxi, they made sure we had one - again, within minutes! They answered all of our questions about getting around the city and how to take the metro. They outlined things for us on maps. If they didn't know the answer to a question, they quickly found someone who did. We called to ask about a noise that was occurring early in the morning and they offerred a free upgrade (which we didn't take since we were already unpacked and plenty comfy) to a bigger suite or free breakfast - which was wonderful. They apologized up and down. Every request was met with courtesy, respect, and a smile. Nothing was an imposition. These people are so happy to do whatever you need. No matter what staffperson you ask for help, they immediately act on it. I asked a maid for the toothbrush, a waiter for directions, a restaurant employee where the door was, etc, outside of the front desk staff and concierge. Everyone is really on their toes!

The hotel was unable to provide us with side-by-side rooms as we had requested, but we were just 4 doors apart and this was not an issue. Our room was beautiful -- as described by numerous other reviewers, they are all suites, with separate living and sleeping quarters. I'm a mattress snob and thought the mattresses at the Crystal were extremely comfortable. My daughter slept on the sofa bed, which (being just 3) didn't bother her at all -- for myself, my experiences lying on it when reading books at night were enough to convince me I wouldn't want to spend a whole night on it! (But again, I wouldn't book a hotel room planning to sleep on the sofa bed -- just be warned if you have picky sleepers who will be using it that it is like every other sofa bed they have ever met!) The bathroom, with the rainfall shower and the soaking tub, was perfect. I nixed the pool on the last day for my daughter, as I found the water temperature a bit cool and she was developing a cold -- and she was perfectly happy playing in the warm tub instead! The amenities in the kitchen were perfect, with a sink, plenty of space in the refrigerator for leftovers, and even a microwave and kettle (and toaster, I think). I don't drink coffee but if I did, would have loved the cappuccino maker in the rooms. My husband, who's a \"regular coffee\" guy, would have liked a coffee maker that made more than a demitasse at a time. The pool area was beautiful, filled with light from wrap-around windows, and much larger than I expected it to be. As stated, I would have liked the water temp to be a bit warmer, but my daughter certainly didn't mind it and my husband didn't seem to either. The outdoor hot tub was the biggest I have ever seen, and my only wish is that it, too, had been a bit warmer (and I'm a person who usually likes to keep the hot tub under 100). Being outside, and being Canada, the air was cool enough that a couple of extra degrees in the hot tub would have been much welcomed. The location of the hotel is perfect for shopping, and it is convenient to the Metro to go farther afield. Parking was convenient and the valet staff were all quick and courteous (just be aware that they will add $26/day to your bill for parking -- as most of the other hotels in the area do as well). On previous visits to Montreal we have stayed at the Hotel de la Montagne and at the Delta. The Crystal would seem to be a more expensive option but good deals were available and we would definitely choose the Crystal first for future visits, all things being equal.", "Date": "June 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat Holiday Weekend\u201d", "Author": "bostonluke", "ReviewID": "UR30840353", "Content": "My wife and I just spent three nights at this wonderful hotel.

The expresso machine was a nice touch and the mini-bar fridge had enough room to put leftovers in it for a later heat-up in the in-room microwave. Everything still had the new-feel about it in the hotel. The pool and hot tub seemed to always be busy during our stay. It would have been nicer for them to stay open a little later into the evening. The only negative at all was the temperature in the room. The air conditioning claimed it would go down to 18 degrees celsius which would be about 64 degrees fahrenheit. It never got that cool, especially in the bedroom. At night we opened the two large windows in the living room but because of the bed being behind a wall, the breeze never really hit us and made sleeping a little too warm for us. We're the type that wouldn't mike seeing our breath when we sleep so it was a little tough on us.

The hotel reception, hallways, and bedrooms were decorated beautifully. The room itself was massive - had a separate living room, bedroom, kitchen area, and a massive bathroom! I was truly very impressed with the set-up. The sofa in the living room was also a sofa-bed. The kitchen area came with a kettle, micowave, coffee machine, tea, coffee, cutlery, and plates. It came in very handy a couple of times when we decided to get takeaway and relax in the room for the evening. There were 2 large television sets (!) - one in the bedroom, and one in the living room. The mattress and pillows were super comfy - you'll feel 10 years younger waking up! The walk-in-shower had 2 different shower heads, with excellent water pressure, and a large vanity area. The free newspaper at your door each morning was a very nice touch. However, my absolute favourite bit of the hotel was the spa area on the 12th floor. It was open from 7am-9pm, and the use of the facilities were inclusive as part of your stay. The excellent facilities included a very large hot tub (still can't stop thinking about it!), large swimming pool, 2 saunas, towels, and recliner chairs. There were lockers in the changing room which made things even easier. There was also a gym that was open 24/7. The cleaner that was incharge of that area daily was amazing - i have never seen a man scrub and polish repeatedly with a smile! Germs had no chance! He left the area immaculate when he was done, and would keep coming back to check on it. The front desk staff were superbly helpful with everything, And the free internet stations downstairs came in handy as well. In terms of value for money - i think we got way above and beyond what we paid for. We visited the Hilton Metropole for a conference while staying here, and there was just no comparison!! Hotel Le Crystal blew it out the water - i'm very glad we chose to stay at Hotel Le Crystal. So, absolutely thrilled, and if i ever am in montreal again, will definitely stay here again. The location was excellent - everything was within walking distance. Getting to the hotel from the airport only cost $25 each. We took a coach service called L'Aerobus. You can buy tickets from the booth at the airport, and the coach takes you into the central bus station. From there, a free shuttle bus service will drop you off at Hotel Le Crystal. On the way back, just call them one day in advance to make a reservation for your seat back on the coach. Otherwise you can take a taxi, but will cost a lot more. My only dislike about the hotel was the restaurant, in that there were essentially no vegetarian options on the menu. As a result, we didn't have any meals in the hotel's restaurant. There was an amazing vegetarian restaurant within 7 minutes walking distance from the hotel called \"Le Commensal\" - which is a must go to for incredibly delicious, healthy, filling food. Finally, i think they should have supplied & supported a Canadian Brand of toiletries (shower gel, shampoo etc) instead of Molton Brown London products. We went to Canada to experience Canada, not to be reminded of london!! But, other than those 2 minor issues, it was just lush!! Would happily pay all over again for another stay.

I spent a lot of time researching hotels in the city, and was surprised that this didn't make more 'best of lists'. I'm assuming this is the case because it is only a little over a year old. LOCATION -At first I thought we might want to be near old Montreal, but after walking through briefly, I understood why all of the natives frown on the area. I was considering Hotel Nelligan and am glad we opted for Le Crystal. Old Montreal is worth seeing, but it is filled exclusively with novelty tourist shops, a few restaurants, and obscure galleries. Lacks the charm of a Quincy Market in Boston, but was fun to walk through briefly. Le Crystal is right in the middle of downtown, great access to shopping and nightlife around the block, the arena across the street, and Le Queue de Cheval is literally across the parking lot. SERVICE -I originally requested an early check in to make the most of our stay, but this was not possible. Our trip did not get off to the best start, as we had to wait an hour and a half in the lobby. Needless to say, we were not pleased but didn't make any mention of this. When we were ready for check-in, they had upgraded us to the penthouse suite which definiely helped. The concierge was great as well, very personable and friendly. DINING We dined at La Coupole for brunch and really enjoyed ourselves. They featured an extensive buffet and everything was fresh and very good. ROOM -In terms of cleanliness, no complaints whatsoever. Given the room we stayed in, there were plenty of amenities. I really wanted a fireplace and the large tub. It would be nice if they had dimmers...plus, the bedroom lighting was a little lacking but the rooms were really as described. DVD player is only available upon request. Bathrooms are very spacious. The bed featured a very soft and comfortable Tempur-Pedic mattress and high quality linens. The kitchenette is definitely nice to have as well. POOL/OUTDOOR HOT TUB/SAUNA -Both were freezing, was really looking forward to spending more time in each and ended up using the tub which was much warmer. There are two saunas which are tiny, and can accommodate a couple per unit. The facility was great, just wish it was warm enough to make us want to stay and be comfortable. OVERALL My biggest complaint is that for the amount of money we spent, we didn't get to spend as much time to enjoy all of the amenities afforded to us. Would have really enjoyed the pool/hot tub more if they were heater but they were freezing. I really think that we found a great hotel there, and look forward to returning when it is not as busy. I don't think you will find another hotel with as many amenities, and the quality of the rooms and service was great.

To my knowledge, the Quebec government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tourist bureau gives a 5 star rating to six to eight hotels/motels in Montreal. The Le Crystal correctly received a 5 star rating because the facility is outstanding, the rooms, as accurately shown on the hotel web site are palatial and luxuriously equipped while the staff aims to please and correct any problems. We want to specifically thank concierge Valerie for her assistance. Our deluxe suite had a living room, separate bedroom with safe and great dimmer controlled lighting (except in the bathroom), multiple closets that were as large as a room and an amazing bathroom of two sinks, double bathtub and a separate glass stall shower with multiple shower heads. The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outdoor hot tub on the 12th floor balcony provided a grand view and adjoins the pool and a small gym. There are new treadmills, cross training machines and other exercise equipment. We mention quibbles which should not take away from the general outstanding nature of the hotel. So please do not read these quibbles as major issues. For example and oddly, various suites and rooms have different facilities. One cannot discern the amenities at electronic booking. It appears to be hit or miss, as stated by hotel staff, whether a suite/room has an electric stove or not in the kitchenette, has a tub or not (double sized and deep to fit two), has a balcony or not, has multiple closets or not (all suites/rooms have ample closet space). Concierge Valerie helped visit rooms and pick an available another suite with both the tub and a kitchen with stove. The restaurant seemed to be training kitchen and wait staff as well as still underdevelopment. The food and wine lists are promising Live jazz at night would have been nice, especially during the week of the Montreal Jazz Festival. Le Crystal provided the highest quality and numerous soaps, lotions, towels, bedding, blankets etc. that some guests asked to purchase to take home during our stay. However and maybe because of confusion from the plethora of luxury, it was hit or miss if we got replacements for some finished bath salts, some soap etc. While all suites/rooms have one or two H.D. TVs, we could not get one of the few available DVD players. The DVD players were assigned to other guests. We were told to wait for a return that did not happen in the six nights we stayed. (Neither could we get simple wires to connect our lap top to the HD TVs.) Such seems silly when suites retail for $300 to $500+. Yet, better to have spent time sharing the amazing tub and out on the town than watching movies. Another review griped about the bathroom lighting. Yes, it would have been nicer to dim the bathroom lights for a romantic soak in the amazing bath. Such would be a slight quibble given the luxury of the overall suite. Le Crystal is close to the Montreal Art Museum that merits a visit. The location i near two Metro (subway) stops in a corporate center part of town. However, a brief walk or ride probably is required for most tourist stops.

We were quite satisfied. The hotel is convenient located, one block away from the Crescent street. where there are many restaurants. We did not use the parking service of the hotel, as it was only available for valet parking, and it cost $24 per night. We parked our car at one of the Stationnement EM, which was only about 40 meters away, for $80 for four nights. We found it was easier for us in and out as we wish. The Urban suite we stayed was different from the one showed on the hotel's website; still, the room was clean and spacious. There were a lot of drawers and storage space, pillows, cushions and towels. Also, there are two flat screen tvs, one in the bed room, and one in the living room. In general we were happy with the service of the hotel, however there was some confusion with the bottled water provided on the counter. The first day I checked in, I asked the reception whether the water on the counter was complimentary. I had been told that the one on the counter is free and the ones in the mini bar are not, which I thought it was understandable and it should be. But, we got billed for a couple of times for consumption of the water on the counter. One bottle of water costs $7. After I made a complain, the hotel erased all the charge. Though I did not use the facility, but I had a quick visit of the swimming pool and the gym. It was on the 12th floor. The swimming is indoor with floor to ceiling windows, so it is quite bright, the hot tub is outdoor on the big balcony with a nice view of the skyscrapers and the Mont Royal. We enjoyed our stay at Le Crystal.

It ranks up there with Four Seasons and Ritz Carlton properties you'll find in the US. By the way, there is a Rtiz in Montreal and it is horrible - it is not a \"real\" Ritz and not affiliated with the real brand, avoid it if you can. I originally planned on staying there until I found out about the Crystal. The Crystal hotel is located right in the heart of Montreal, within walking distance to tons of shopping, across the street from the Bell Centre and blocks from the famous restaurant/club district. Upon arrival we we warmly greeted by the professional and helpful staff. From the moment we arrived and throughout our 5 night stay, we were impressed by the decor, amenities and staff. The room had both high speed and wired complimentary internet, two flat screen TVs, large bathroom, high end coffee/expresso machine, microwave, refrigerator and separate bedroom and sitting area. The gym was nice and had great views of the Bell Centre - plenty of equipment and very up to date. They have an outdoor area with a hot tub - their pool is saltwater and located indoors, adjacent to the hot tub area, separated by a glass wall. All of the exercise areas are located near a full service Spa, which is actually independent of the hotel - my wife used the spa extensively and had a great experience. Our stay at the Crystal and Montreal was made even more special with the help of the hotel's awesome Concierge staff - Valery was awesome, she provided great dining, nightlife and shopping recommendations, even getting us on guest lists for hard to get into nightclubs (and reservations at the happening eateries). What I really appreciated is that she provided genuine feedback on where to go and where to avoid - unlike many other experiences with concierges, which I've found send you to standard tourist traps where they get free dinners and benefits (commission) for themselves, in return for referring business. To sum it up, this place is awesome and a great value as well - the rates on their website are very reasonable and you won't find a nicer place at a better price in Montreal. If you have a Platinum AMEX Card and use them to for the reservation, you might save 5%, but that's about it.", "Date": "August 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cFlawless service but a little corporate\u201d", "Author": "RAVK", "ReviewID": "UR16432472", "Content": "I'm giving this hotel an above average rating mainly for the enormous bathroom and the overall size of the suite, along with pristine cleanliness and extremely courteous, professional staff.

We also liked the modern decor concept, although it did have a sterile, corporate quality. The pool area is beautiful. Didn't try the spa but it's a convenient asset. The only terrible thing about this hotel is the hideous lighting in the bathroom! We had a huge tub and separate shower, double sink, everything sleek and white... but the glaring, cold lighting made it feel like a hospital or laboratory. (On the other hand, they're generous with those fragrant Molton Brown toiletries). The bedroom lighting wasn't too cozy, either. You can't get movies on demand, strangely -- they offer only standard cable tv -- but you can request a dvd player and movies from their library. Fine hotel overall, with some quirks.

We had a suite on the top floor which was quite comfortable -- it was probably about 700 square feet. It had a living room with wall mounted flat screen television, sofa, coffee table a couple of chairs, kitchenette with microwave, toaster and Liebherr refrigerator that was amply stocked with all of the necessities (from juice and water to hard liquor). With 1.5 baths, the master suite had a king sized bed, flat screen television, double bowl bath vanity with separate tub and shower. All in all, pretty comfortable. Not top of the line finishes (a lot of ceramic mixed with some crema marfil marble), although I was pleasantly surprised to see the Liebherr refrigerator and Franke undermount sink in the kitchen area . The shower had a rainshower head and separate hand held, so they're definitely trying to make you comfortable. The bed was firm (which I liked) and the room was quiet, so I was pleased. This is a good hotel for business travelers or those who like/need a bit of extra space (for kids). The standard rooms are really quite spacious too, so I'd recommend considering one of those. We opted for the suite only because we were offered a pretty good rate for it, otherwise I would have booked the standard room. I would definitely consider returning. The bar is nice and overall I think the hotel offers good value for the money.
