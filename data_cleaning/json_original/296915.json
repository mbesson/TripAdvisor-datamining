When choosing a hotel I considered staying closer to the parc de forum since it would have been less expensive and more of a usual sized room for us spoiled Americans:) I decided against this and chose Pulitzer for its amazing location and modern style. When we arrived it was about 30$ cab fare from the airport. A bus would have worked but we were super exhausted and had a few suitcases. Upon entering the hotel we were both impressed by the decor and as many have said there is definitely a social atmosphere in the lobby. Service was always gracious and even though we tried to speak in Spanish as much as we could, the staff was quick to switch to English when they could see we weren't following them. Breakfast was delicious with fantastic cheeses, meats, and breads. The coffee was exceptional as well. We loved our room for its layout, comfy bed, sleek amd spacoius bathroom and best of all, stellar view. While we were there protestors were camping out in a nearby park. One nights we were walking up the street back to our hotel a line of police with riot gear on began matching toward us and the park at we came from. The doorman to the Pulitzer literally opened the door and swooped us inside. It was exciting to say the least And impressive that ey wer looking out for their guests. This is not to imply that in any way this area is not safe...it is actually quiet. Just know that protestors or futbol can cause the streets anywhere downtown to becomea little crazy. We were able to walk from this spot to the Cathedral, of course Las Ramblas (which a portion of that street is a little sketchy) and Parc de Guell to name a few.

Upon arriving we were booked into a single room with a king, and we walked into the room and our suitcases could not get into the room. My mother saw the room and immediately went downstairs to the front desk to try and increase the room size, if only slightly. They were very polite and dealt with her \"demanding\" ways and immediately moved us into a new and slightly larger room, but we had two twin beds. We were able to wheel our giant suitcases into the hall but could not get by the beds and there was no place to put the suitcases, or drawers or a shelf to get them off the floor. Each suitcase was placed by our beds and for the next two days there was a lot of side stepping and lifting. We are both very laid-back people who were excited about the beginning of an amazing trip, but I know less understanding people would freak out regarding this matter. The beds are very firm but have a nice rainfall shower. There was a slight balcony, about half a foot long, and as wide as the room so we could crawl out there and perch for a cigarette. The hotel decor is very beautiful, minimalistic and modern. Large chairs and sofas encompass the lobby with a very sheik bar. They even managed to find a vase, aka a watch pitcher, for a bouquet of flowers I obtained during dinner. The staff is very nice and my favorite part of the experience was the amazing roof-top terrace and bar. The appetizers are amazing, and they mix a mean cocktail while you gaze out over the shopping district. We were perfectly located to hit up tapa restaurants, bars, and the site-seeing bus tours. My only regret is not being able to spend more time in the city. Bottom Line: If you cannot afford the penthouse, and hate small rooms this is not the hotel for you.

However, our room was a little disappointing. It did not have the best layout but I guess they did what they could best with the space they had. As you enter, there is a long corridor which then leads to a small space which fits a cupboard and lounge chair. Then it's the bedroom which only fits the bed. I don't like watching TV from bed but you don't have a choice, the lounge chair is in the small square space next to the bedroom. If you have large pieces of luggage, other than the hallway, there is nowhere to put them. But if you put them in the hallway, it's hard to walk around it. I suppose the entrance to the room (a long hall way) makes it feel like it's your home/apartment but the rest of it feels a bit tight. The bathroom was nice though. We weren't facing the main road but could hear traffic and thought this would interrupt our sleep but it did not. It gets quieter at night and we're used to constant traffic passing by. Location-wise it was good. Again, it's another hotel right in the middle of it all. We walked everywhere from this hotel - to the beach, to Sagrada Familia and to Montjuc. However, if you prefer catching public transport, there are stops right near the hotel. There is also a Carrefour supermarket off La Rambla. We kind of expected a little bit more from this boutique hotel based on what we'd seen on their website so if we visited Barcelona again, we'd probably try a different boutique hotel. I guess we didn't find the Pulitzer special, just ordinary. I'm not sure how good the English is at the hotel though, at check-in I asked if there were any Christmas Markets near by and was told they are everywhere, on every street, around every corner. But afterwards, I realised they must have thought I asked if there were any Christmas lights. But in general, we found the English in Barcelona not that great.

After flying overnight from the US, we arrived at the hotel around 10:30am. They allowed us to check in early which was great and very helpful. We were able to change clothes, wash up and hit the town. It was nice to have the option to take a nap if we wanted though. Barcelona is very tourist friendly and the Aerobus from the airport to Placa de Catalunya was perfect. It is only 5 Euro and is only short distance to Hotel Pulitzer (maybe 4-5 minutes with luggage). Being so close to the Place de Catalunya also has the added benefit of being close to the hop-on, hop-off bus stop (actually it is the main stop). We bought 2 days passes which were perfect for seeing the city. The hotel is just around the corner from Las Ramblas, which we actually liked a lot. We thought it would be too touristy for our taste but it actually had some good shops and restaurants. It also had a neat vibe as it is crowed day and night. The hotel is clean, staff very friendly, free wi-fi, decent sized room and good sized bathroom (no bath tub in our room), balcony, and very nicely decorated with a nice lounge and bar area. We didn't have breakfast included and it was 15 Euro so we decided to grab it on the go. The restaurant looked very nice but we didn't eat there during our stay. We were able to store our luggage the last day while we did some last minute sightseeing for free. Only downside was the beds were 2 twins pushed together. Not that uncommon in Europe though. All in all, a great hotel, very good value and second to none location for people wanting to see a lot of the city and be centrally located.

The rooms here (we had a standard) were small but stylishly done, with a generous size bathroom and great power shower. The downside for us is that we ended up in a smoking room despite (I thought) having asked for non-smoking. This is really a negative as the smell of smoke was incredibly strong and unpleasant so if you are a non-smoker i'd really really advise making very sure that you have a non-smoking room booked before you go. Having said that it didn't take too much away from the staff. The lobby and hotel bar were very funky and the staff were great, really keen to help and make suggestions. I;d take any restaurant suggestions with a pinch of salt however.

This quiet location is a good place to base yourself for a trip to Barcelona. If you like to walk, you can get almost anywhere a tourist wants to go in half an hour. If you prefer the clean, efficient, well-marked metro, many lines come through the Placa Catalunya. (There are two other four-star hotels on this block if you want to compare styes and prices, but you can't beat the location.) The Pulitzer style is modern, but not austere. The lobby is a good size with many places to sit, a nice bar, with a small restaurant in the rear. The staff was professional and helpful whenever we spoke to them. We arrived early, so our bags were stored. We tried the buffet breakfast, so we could do some planning and catch our breath before heading out for the day. The food was plentiful, with a nice selection of meats, cheeses, fruits, cereals, and hot dishes, but at 16 euro per person, we opted for other choices the rest of our stay. Our superior room was long and narrow. It had most of the right moving parts: a safe in a small cabinet, chair, couch, large closet, flat-screen TV, good-sized bathroom with robes, but no desk or work area, and wooden floors. The bed was not plush and very soft as in some American hotels; it was a bit on the hard side, which seems more typical here. When the closet and cabinet doors were open, it was a bit hard for two people to maneuver in those areas. (I admit that this is being picky, because you are not here to spend too much time in the room.) The small hallways can be a bit noisy when guests come and go, because the hard surfaces bounce all of the talking and door closings, so ask for a quiet room away from the elevator. The bathroom is typical European. The shower has a hand-held head that sits in an adjustable holder. The tub/shower combo has a half-wall of glass to deflect the spray from going all over the bathroom, but it is not enough. Try as you might, the floor and surrounding area will have a water on it when you are finished showering, so make sure the cover is down on the commode. The hotel did not provide conditioner, but there were \"his,her, and both\" boxes with interesting items inside, in addition to shampoo, body wash, bar soap and lotion.

When we came up to the room, we realized it was facing the little atrium/terrace where breakfast was served. We called downstairs, and they rectified the problem immediately and we were moved to a street-view room. Rooms were well-appointed. Nice flatscreen, great amenities, and best part was the clean well-stocked bathrooms. Wi-fi worked perfectly as well. We absolutely loved the variety of food served at breakfast, which was included in our rate. If you book well in advance, they have a 15% discounted, nonrefundable rate that includes breakfast. Breakfast was served til 11am on weekdays, and til noon on weekends and holidays. That was a real bonus since we slept in every morning! The room rate also includes use of a *world-class* gym, we're told, but we didn't get a chance to check out the gym. We got our workout just walking all about town.

I personally think irons are necessary in rooms, as everyone there has brought there clothes folded up in a suitecase and most likely needs to iron them.

Reception staff were polite, welcoming and helpful, providing us with maps and fliers on things to see /do. The trip was to celebrate our recent engagement and I had mentioned this when I emailed to reserve a room because I wanted to ensure we were given a double bed, not twin beds, and a quiet room.

We were delighted however to discover that the room within was very spacious, tastefully but simply decorated with dark wood floor and doors, soft lighting, white walls with abstract art, and, Asian-themed room accessories. Both pillows, and double bed - emporer-sized - were extremely comfortable with crisp, white cotton linens (felt Egyptian). The bathroom was large, with contemporary fittings and most importantly, masses of endless hot water. As always, it would have been nice to have tea/coffee making facilties, or at least a kettle, but room service was efficient and prompt. The mini-bar was well stocked, and we were proviided with chocolates on arrival and departure, as well as a complimentary bottle of Cava (presumably to celebrate our engagement). Breakfast was simple Continental fare but met our requirements; we're not talking \"Full English Breakfast\" but what was available was fresh and there was lots of it. Word of caution to tea-guzzelling, UK travellers - ask for 'leche fredo' with 'English Breakfast tea'. We didn't eat in the restaurant in the evening but sampled the bar menu during the day, which was excellent; my fiance had delicious tapas, and I had a foccacia tuna sandwich -ununsual but extremely tasty.

I was greeted by a really friendly \"tourist\" (he had a map in one hand and a camera in the other) at the entrance of the hotel. He greeted me with a megawatt smile and held the door for me. while waiting at the check-in counter, I was observing the people around the lobby.

However moments later, when I looked out, I saw 4 men standing around our car and trying to open the doors. I hurried to front desk and seek help from the hotel staff. One of them was nice enough to follow me out. When the four of them saw us coming out, they made a dash across the road. My hubby told me that someone came up and told him that the stretch of road outside the hotel was meant for locals and when he drove up to the front, the guy told him that there is something under his car and if he moves his car further he will crush it. My hubby then got out of his car to see and the moment he opened his door, 3 other men came up and opened all other doors hoping to snatch something at the front or back seat. One of then men was the one who held the door for me. They were so swift and agile that my hubby did not realize their existence until i told him what I saw. It was really freaky. After the bell boy helped me off-load the luggage from the car, my hubby drove down to the underground garage. The men were there waiting for him. Somehow he managed to escape through one of the exits. It was rather stressful that night.

There is no clock in the room, so have your cell phone handy or bring your own. We stayed in a balcony room (there are only five on each floor) and while it was nice, it wasn't a \"must.\" If you have a room with a balcony, you can only open the window by using a handle that is located in the armoire next to the window. -The shower is a little odd, with only half a door (you have to see it to understand,) but the rest of the bathroom was beautiful, with great amenities, bathrobes, and slippers! -The TV only has one English channel, and the rest of the channels were fuzzy. -The hotel was a bit noisy due to the location and thinner walls. -There is an open rooftop on this hotel, but unfortunately, we didn't discover it until the last day we were there at night, and it is only open until 8pm. -There is free Internet access at their sister hotel next door, Hotel Regina.

However, on this occasion I was very pleasantly surprised. Hotel Pulitzer exceeded my expectations. It is a lovely, intimate, classic yet modern design hotel that could not be better located. Naturally, with wear-and-tear there are a few nicks here and a couple of marks on a wall there but it is in very good condition. The lovely wood floors in the bedrooms could probably do with a little more TLC but that's about it. The only things that slightly annoyed me was firstly that the frame of the mirror in the bathroom that sits above the sink had not been thoroughly cleaned and I had to wipe off a previous guest's toothpaste splatter (but that's not permanent) and secondly that, as another reviewer has noted, the wooden floors in the hallways do mean that when the cleaning staff start work promptly at 8am, you can be awoken by the clatter of the trolley. These are trivial cons through in comparison to pros. What really impressed me about this hotel, bar its chic design, it's fabulous rooftop bar, it's excellent cocktails and it's unbeatable location, was the service we received both when booking the hotel from home and whilst there. I needed to book three standard rooms - two for individuals who both wanted queen beds rather than twin and a couple who also wanted a queen bed - that were close to each other only a week or so before we planned to travel. I contacted the hotel with these requests and they responded very positively almost immediately. We exchanged a few emails and they were very helpful. Sure enough, when we checked in we had exactly what we had asked for. The reception staff were welcoming, friendly, efficient and always able to help with providing directions, restaurant recommendations, travel advice and the lugging of bags! The only thing to note is that the hotel restaurant is closed in August and the rooftop bar on Mondays. All-in-all we had a wonderful experience in Barcelona, in no small part due to this hotel, and though I very rarely say this, I certainly believe Hotel Pulitzer is value for money.

The hotel along with its sister hotel right next door (Hotel Regina) takes up most of the block just off the Plaza. We booked on the hotels website and were able to get a 10% discount as we stayed 2 nights, there were other discounts available. The room was very luxurious in d\u00e9cor with dark wood and big mirrors. Our room overlooked the street with doors that opened out into a very small balcony, just big enough to stand in. The street below was busy but the doors blocked out the sound when they were closed so we were able to sleep confortably. The bed was 2 beds pushed together, which seems to be common, but they were very comfortable. A minibar was also provided in the room, I was also able to connect to wifi on my phone in the room easily enought The bathroom was a good size with a large shower (no bath) and toiletries were provided as well as dressing gowns and disposable slippers. Hairdryer was in the bathroom. The staff were very friendly and helpful speaking very good English. The hotel was booked up so we had to move to another hotel for our last night in Barcelona and later we discovered that we had left a shirt in the wardrobe of our room in the Hotel Pulitzer. We went back and the person at the desk was very helpful, she took the details and then checked the room herself, when it wasn\u2019t there she went and checked with housekeeping and it was returned to us within 10 mins. I felt that this was fantastic service as other staff members I\u2019ve encountered previously would check the room and not bother doing anything else. Breakfast wasn\u2019t included in our room rate so I can\u2019t comment on that as we went to the caf\u00e9 on the corner for breakfast. We were at the hotel as friends were getting married and the wedding couple booked the restaurant for a large \u2018rehearsal\u2019 dinner. The food was lovely with nice sized portions. The restaurants looked to do good deals for set lunches but we didn\u2019t try them. The Hotel doesn\u2019t have a gym on site but you are able to get a free pass for one a block or two away but I didn\u2019t personally attend it. The main bar area in the hotel is just off the lobby and is very open with high ceiling. There is also a roof terrace bar which I loved as it was very relaxing and you are able to sit back in the sun with a cocktail listening to music playing Overall I loved the Hotel Pulitzer, it does have a very trendy boutique hotel feel but without the coldness that some trendy places have.

Everywhere you look there are gorgeous modern prints and interesting artworks, cosy seating areas and interesting design details like the glass elevator, quirky wooden benches and so on. That being said the hotel is looking a bit tired from a wear and tear point of view and some maintenance is in order eg there are nicks out of picture frames and polished floors that could do with a re-polish, however the contemporary fit-out made up for it to a large extent. Rooms are definately on the smaller side even by European standards so if you can afford to pay a little more and upgrade from the standard I'd recommend doing so. Breakfast was lovely in the enclosed courtyard. Being in our 40s and 50s we preferred the lobby bar for a drink to the terrace which would be heaven to the younger set. with pumping music and lots of beautiful people. If I was choosing to stay in Barcelona again I would be very tempted to return to the Pulitzer however would probably choose to stay in the old town 'Born' area - a bit quieter with more history and a more authentic Spanish feel. We tried to avoid Las Ramblas which was very noisy with a lot of young English tourists. Perhaps this is not the norm though as we were there during the world cup so it was crowded with very merry soccor fans cheering and hugging each other in droves.

I selected the hotel on the basis of previous Tripadvisor reviews, and I also emailed the Manager in advance of booking. I could not believe the service I received, he emailed me back within minutes and we sent a few emails back and forth about our requirements. I was so impressed. The hotel itself is literally 2 minutes from Plaza Catalunya - right where the airport bus arrives and departs. It was such a pleasure getting off the bus and being in our hotel 5 minutes later - without actually feeling like you were in the middle of town. The street it is on feels much quieter than the Plaza, and we had no problems with noise. The hotel is modern, stylish and beautifully designed without being pretentious or overdone which I hate and can't relax in. When we arrived in our room we found a bottle of champagne in an ice bucket with two glasses which was such a lovely touch for our anniversary. The breakfast is fine, we ate there on all three mornings. It is not spectacular but it is more than adequate. We had a drink in the fabulous bar area before dinner one night which was lovely. You get free use of a nearby gym and pool which my husband availed of. There is no hotel computer to access the internet but you can use the facilities in the hotel next door for free. My only small small gripe was that the room was very narrow, ie there was a very small space between the end of the bed and the wall. There is also a flat screen TV on the wall at the end of the bed and I managed to hit my shoulders on it twice despite being aware of it, sometimes you forget. Other than that it was a perfect stay, and I would most definitely recommend this hotel and stay here again if we returned to Barcelona.", "Date": "June 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cGreat Boutique Hotel\u201d", "Author": "JAG710", "ReviewID": "UR66324081", "Content": "Hotel Pulitzer is great!

We travelled with another couple. We got a really good deal booking through the actual hotel (409 Euros for 4 nights for 2 adults, excluding VAT for the basic room). I searched around and the hotels website definately gave the best deal. We opted not to include breakfast as we had read there was so much choice outside the hotel. We are quite glad we didn't. We did pay 20 euros for the romantic package which included a bottle of cava and breakfast in your room on the 1st day. The breakfast should have cost 30 euros, it was only a continental and not worth 30 euros. We took the eurobus from the airport to the hotel, 5 euros per person and I think the best way to get there, if you get off at the right stop that is. The bus takes you direct to Cataluyna square which is 2 minutes from the hotel, however we got off at the wrong stop, so stay on the bus until it reaches its destination. The hotel isn't very well advertised outside as we walked past is twice, just look out for the Visit signs. Check in was perfect from one of the staff, Derek, really friendly and helpful. I had emailed the hotel prior to arriving asking for some room requests one was to be next to our friends and we had a room directly next door to them. The room was lovely. As other reviews have said, slightly narrow but it's amazing how you get used to it. We had a room at the back of the hotel, so no balcony, but the doors did open so you could stand and get fresh air. Huge lovely bed, air con, full stocked mini bar (not too expensive, 3 euros for a beer, 11 for champagne..), lovely bathroom and ace shower. Bathrobes and slippers were provided to. There is free wifi which was perfect, no issues with it. We never ate in the hotel which I am a bit disappointed about as the food sounded lovely and the setting looked really nice. We did have cocktails in the bar (10 euros each) but they were worth it, lovely!!! The rooftop bar was closed as still winter season however you were able to take up your own drinks. We took up some champagen and sat outside and it was lovely, I can imagine it would be cracking in summer. The hotels location is perfect walking distance to Las Ramblas. I am glad we picked this hotel rather than one actually on Las Ramblas, it is very busy and bustly. Las Ramblas is amazing to walk down and see all the mime artists, but be warned, it is expensive to eat/drink on the street. We had lunch one day at a tapas restaurant and was over 100 euros for the 4 of us for not much food. But it was worth it to soak up the atmosphere of the street. We did the open top bus tour which is well worth it, you can get on the bus from Catalyuna square. There are 2 different tour operators, we opted for the Turisitic tour. It took us to Sagrada Familia which is worth seeing, but it also has multi language commentating during it by listening through the supplied free headphones. We also did the Nou Camp tour - it was amazing. Well worth doing. We also got a game while we were there which was just out of this world. We went to the Ice Bar which was good fun, 15 euros for 45 minutes including a cocktail, something different. We went to the zoo, nothing special about it but good fun, we hired a golf buggy to drive us round. The Majic fountains are worth a visit to.

As this is our 6th time in Barcelona, I can say that we have some previous experience regarding the location of the hotel and some other hotels to compare it with. I found this hotel on TripAdvisor and booked for 3 nights, finding a very good offer for the hotel and for the location itself. Speaking about that, the Pulitzer hotel is perfectly located right in the center of Barcelona, in Placa Catalunya. Of course, it's very easy to locate, as it stands in the back of Fnac (a large electronics store). The staff was very welcoming, speaking English and of course Spanish. The hotel is very elegant, I guess renovated, cause the building is quite old. When you enter the hotel, you have the reception on your left, the open bar and a lot of couches on the right and the restaurant and a patio in front. I read about a patio on the roof, didn't use it. The bar is nice, had a cocktail and some wine there. Rather expensive comparing to a bar in Barcelona, but it was ok. The room is very nice, the size is ok comparing it to some other hotel rooms in Barcelona and even in Europe. I don't know USA, but for Europe is ok. The furniture looks good, some of it gives me the impression that is just renovated, not new (can be only an impression though). You have TV, wifi internet, minibar, some snacks, safe box, heating, air conditioning. The bathroom is very clean and they provided all that one need (towels, shower gel, shampoo, toothpaste, toothbrush, shaving set, slippers and so on). Everything is very clean and the thing that they clean the room a little bit later than in other hotels was not a problem to me. The only problem we had was with the heating. First night the air conditioning (that provided heating also) worked, but there was no heat, only ventilation. We spoke with the reception staff in the morning and they sent someone to take care of the problem. When we returned in the afternoon, everything was ok so that's nice of them. Well, let's say almost ok, cause there still was a weird noise sometimes, during the air conditioning functioning. It sounded like a crack and I guess it was something like the plastic in the pipes heating/cooling. But I guess it has to do with the law of physics and it didn't occur so often so we were able to get a good sleep. Another thing in the category of heating are the windows, rather weak-insulating, but this is a common aspect in Spanish windows. And talking about the good night sleep, I appreciate the fact that they provide 2 kind of pillows, different sizes, which is good for those like me that prefer sleeping on a non-fluffy one. The fact that double bed means 2 beds placed one next to the other is not good. Double bed should be a big one which fits 2 persons, without the dividing line that 2 beds give.

I was looking for a hotel back in the fall of 2008 for myself and my parents. After spending several days comparing reviews, candid photos, and locations, I decided to book rooms at the Hotel Pulitzer. I COULD NOT HAVE BEEN HAPPIER! WHY? 1) LOCATION: I wanted a Hotel that was in the center of the City so myself and my parents could walk around easily. I also wanted to be near Las Ramblas. This hotel was perfect, as it is on a quieter side street - Bergera Street - and one block from Plaza Catalunya. You walk out the door and walk one block to the right and it opens up to the beautiful Plaza Catalunya. From there, you just walk south to La Rambla where you find the crowds, excitement, and things to keep you entertained. 2) DECOR: Beauftiful! Lobby has plenty of comfortabl couches and chairs where you can grab a cup of coffee or a drink from the bar and just relax with friends and family. The glass elevator provides views of the open centrum in the middle of the hotel as you ride upwards. The rooms were very clean; beds comfortable and bathroom was newly updated with great smelling products. 3) SERVICE: Though I did not really request anything, the staff was always very helpful and easy to speak with. They were very warm and friendly at check-in and always said hello each time I either left or entered the hotel. 3) VALUE: This hotel offers a great product and an outstanding price. The pricing on their website is straight forward and I feel is a good value based on what they offer. This is not all hype. I stayed here with my parents in October 2008 and then recommended a close friend of mine stay in here August 2009. He throughly enjoyed it, as well. And guess what? My friend and just booked a cruise out of Barcelona in November 2010 and guess where we are looking to stay, again? Yup....here!

Since we had made a reservation over the internet, we were given a free Barcelona city guide (the guide also includes Rome, Paris, and Buenos Aires). The decor of the room was mod design. The room had a comfortable bed, chair, stocked refrigerator (pay for drinks), TV with various language channels, closet, and storage chest. Floors were plank hardwood and may have been some of the original floors in the building. The bathroom had tile on the floor. Bathroom had a tub shower combination. Amenities included bathrobes, slippers and a \"man\" and a \"woman\" kit that included such items as comb, razor, toothbrushes, toothpaste, shaving cream, after shave balm, etc. The room is narrow, about the width of a cruise ship cabin, but longer. Doors opened out to a French balcony. The room did show some signs of wear, but was certainly clean. In a fire, I would certainly feel safe getting out of the building as the staircase was completely enclosed in concrete. Breakfast was available, but we considered the price too much and bought food at El Corte Ingles which is across the square near the airport bus stop, and brought it back to the room and put it in the refrigerator.

It wasn't the cheapest hotel, but after a lot of debate and research, this is the one I decided to go with -- many thanks to the members of Trip Advisor! Location: It was a wonderful choice. The hotel is so centrally located - in the heart of Placa Catalunya that you can walk to just about anywhere without an issue! La Rambla is right across Placa Catalunya -- so you're super close but not actually on it. The hop on & off bus stops are right across the hotel. Plenty of places to eat -- though they tell you to avoid eating on la rambla. If you walk about 10-15 mins, you're at Columbus Monument/the sea!! I loved staying here. Metro was conveniently located though I never once had to use it. Service: The service was excellent. The staff is kind, helpful and always cheery. Was able to answer any and all questions promptly. The room was always cleaned and tidy and replenished as needed on a daily basis. Room: I had a room on the 4th floor with a balcony overlooking the main street Pulitzer is located on. If I looked to my right, I could see Placa Catalunya. The bed was super comfortable; the room size is perfect for one person. There is a flat screen TV in the room, free Wi-Fi, a safe that was perfect to hold my passport and netbook. There was a huge closet with drawers, in addition, a separate armoire/chest. It was more for documents and such. A mini fridge fully stocked, robes and slippers - which are always a nice touch. The bathroom had sliding doors, which I loved, it also had a \"man\" and \"woman\" container, which included essentials from tooth brush, razor, combs, and personal items - I thought that was new and nice; haven't seen it in the states anywhere. The lights had three different modes in the room so you could dim it, keep only one light on or turn it all off right from your bed. Overall: I just loved the hotel, was made to feel very comfortable. The hotel did have a bar/restaurant but never ate there so can't comment on it.

As said numerous times before, very central. Just off Placa de Catalunya where there are plenty of shops, restaurants, bus tours start here etc. Close to Las Ramblas also. The street is very quiet and safe. 2. Staff. The staff from receptionists to waiters etc were all very accommodating and helpful. Not 'in your face' but couldn't fault them. Efficient calling taxis, advising restaurants, giving directions etc. 3. Decor. Found the hotel to be very tastefully decorated- chic, low lighting, candles, big pictures and mirrors etc. Rooms are long and narrow- probably bigger than I had expected from the photos. Extremely comfortable 6ft bed with lovely Egyptian cotton bed clothes. We enjoyed relaxing in the evenings in the lobby after dinner. Great chilled out contemporary atmosphere while still maintaining a cosy feel. 4. Food. I had booked the 'Romantic Package' which was great value- for an extra e20 we had breakfast on one morning included as well as a bottle of cava on arrival. Breakfast was very good- fresh fruit, cereals, juices, cheese, omlettes etc. We paid an additional e60 for a late check out- 6pm, worth the extra expense due to a late flight.

They make great use of their atrium over their ground floor bar. My partner and I were facinated at the 5 story open architecture what a great space! Our rooms was equally charming if a bit rough around the edges. We're not quite used to the split matress but understand that that is sometimes how beds are in other places. We diceded that a full Kin matress might not have fit through the narrow corridor leading to our room. In any case we slept soundly and were quite comfortible watching Spanish MTV on the flat screen TV infront of our bed. One thing that we had fun figuring out was the light switches. Again I chalk this up to my ignorance of other places and was charmed by the various moodlighting one had to cycle through to get the lights to actually turn off completly. Let's just say that it added charm to the room. :) The front desk staff were very accomodating as we were quite unprepared with our spanish. Directions and suggestions were offered easily and someone was always there to help. One of the great things about this hotel is the location. You are in the middle of this amazing city. Each day we chose a different compas point to explore and were never disappointed. I love Barcelona. I highly recommend the various esspresso drinks the city's caf\u00e9s have to offer. I also recommend ordering everthing in Spanish, or Catalan, if you are lucky enough to know it. Most are very helpful if they know a spot of English, or are adept with hand gesture.

Great if you want to walk to sights and restaurants in both the old city and Eixample. Standard rooms are indeed fairly narrow as most on here have attested, however they are much longer than I expected and bathrooms are very spacious. Everything is ultra modern and very comfortable. All amenities to pamper you have been thought of. This is definitely a top-of-the-line hotel. Unlike many of these 'hip'/'boutique' hotels, this one has no attitude, but rather a great service orientation. We were leaving Barcelona for 5 days before coming back to Barcelona for a lengthier stay. Even though we were not staying at the Pulitzer upon our return to Barcelona. They gladly held our large luggage while we did a short jaunt to Menorca with carry-ons only. Beds, linens, towels, A/C, furniture, flooring, fixtures, pillows and toilettries are top-of-the-line.

It was 106 Euros a night, which isn't cheap, but it's a steal for the location (right off Plaza Catalunya) and quality of Hotel Pulitzer. We spent weeks scouring Trip Advisor comparing reviews, to photos we saw against # rank, versus the cost, and settled on Hotel Pulitzer, a boutique hotel that ultimately lived up to all the positive reviews we read. The staff were simply AMAZING. I can\u2019t say enough good things about them. For starters, we do speak a little Spanish, which will definitely be necessary in Spain, BUT the hotel staff all spoke fluent English. It was a VERY nice surprise since that was not the overall impression we got from Spaniards. At the end of our 3 night stay, their English came in handy when we lost our rental car reservation (entirely our own fault, we were late to pick it up) and the staff went above and beyond what was necessary to help us. They directed us next door to a sister hotel (also a beautiful hotel, Hotel Regina I think it was) of theirs whose amenities they share, and told us that we can use the business center there (as well as the gym), they held our luggage for us downstairs, helped us track down train schedules (interpret them, give us details that are not otherwise provided online \u2013 like that tickets go on sale in person only, an hour before the train departs \u2013 no online same-day booking, on the RENFE trains), called other car rental companies for us to locate alternate car rental and most of all, letting us use the hotel phone for free and call all over Spain (literally, all over Spain) since we were heading out of Barcelona. We had requested a room on the highest floor possible (to avoid street noise) and we got a room on the 5th Floor (there is a 6th floor, where the rooftop bar is, I wouldn't recommend staying there, the music from the bar might be an issue...but I can't speak on that for certain). Though our roof was one floor beneath the rooftop bar, we were never disrupted by noise. Our room balcony had a view of the street below, and the room, though small, was adequate for two 20 something girls to fit in, and move about to get dressed. The bed was amazingly comfortable (a MUST after a long day of walking around Barca) and the decor was wonderfully modern and minimalistic, yet vibrant and warm. There were only two real negatives that we encountered. First, bathroom lighting was dim in general, but especially terrible when trying to apply make-up (an issue for young ladies \uf04a). Also, though the rooftop bar is really quaint and lovely, they served us our champagne (14 Euro\u2019s a pop) in cheap PLASTIC flutes (really unacceptable considering Barcelona is known for its \u2018cava\u2019 [which I frankly didn\u2019t care for]) and you would think they would take a little more pride in the presentation of the drink. Overall, Hotel Pulitzer met and exceeded my expectations. We did not dine in their restaurant, nor did we ever get a chance to have a drink at their lobby bar, but everything looked lovely.

We bought 10-trip Metro tickets and went everywhere that way, very fast and easy, less than a 2-minute wait for trains.

Around 40 Euro trip with bags to catch Saturday morning flight for two of us. Very much enjoyed everything Gaudi. Casa Batllo was within walking distance of the hotel, or two metro stops. Only disappointment in the trip was the Contemporary Art Museum, which had miniscule exhibits, and for very narrow art taste. Enjoyed all the tapas but did not find a great restaurant this visit.

I have to say that I was a little apprehensive because reviews had been so mixed - and there were many that mentioned a noise problem. Because of this (I had already booked!) I emailed ahead and voiced my concerns about noise, and had a lovely polite email back saying that a quiet room would be assigned to us. We arrived at the hotel very early (10.30) and were allowed to check in, which I thought was very nice of them. Service was always very friendly but efficient. The hotel looked very smart and stylish, and this extended into the room that we had which was on the fifth floor. The room was very quiet (wait for it!) at that time, and throughout the day whenever we popped back. Bathroom was lovely but had a silly sliding door that kept coming off the hinges. We were brought champagne on arrival (I think that was a perk for booking through Mr and Mrs Smith) and were very pleased with all room amenities - comfy bed, good air con, bathrobes, slippers etc. The room was very narrow as others have mentioned, but I thought that this was actually quite cool! I could see how it would be possible to bang your head on the TV though...... Rooftop bar was lovely, drinks weren't too outrageously priced considering that it seemed to be a bit of a 'destination'. We didn't try any food so I can't comment on that. Everything was pretty much a pleasant surprise - so many city hotels are bland and run-of-the-mill. HOWEVER!! The noise problem in the mornings that has been mentioned in quite a few other reviews is so true!! The doors bang (this started at around 8am and we had gone to bed quite late) over and over again because people (I assume that they must be cleaning staff?) come in and out and instead of propping the door open, they just let it slam. I am assuming that it must have been staff because I could hear the same thing happening all the way down the corridor! And when two of them were chatting it was literally as though they were in the room. Usually this would drive me insane, but I was awake anyway and we wanted to get an early start, so it wasn't too bad. But if I had been in my usual morning mood or if it had been a romantic city break where we wanted to lounge around in the room then this would seriously have disappointed us. I found it slightly amusing because it was exactly how others had described it. And here is my point, hotel Pulitzer management: It is admirable that you read, and respond to, all of the comments posted on tripadvisor, but what is the point of thanking people for their feedback and saying that you will act on it if you then DON'T act on it? It is such a lovely hotel, and I cannot fault it except for that one thing! There must be something that you can do with the doors to stop them slamming, and tell the staff not to slam them in the first place! If you are lucky enough to have feedback, then I think you should act on it. It's a shame to have this problem when you have such great staff and such a stylish place. Even though the noise was only in the morning (soundproofing from road and bar noise was excellent!) it is still not really acceptable. Otherwise it's a brilliant hotel.", "Date": "August 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Value": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Midlands", "Title": "\u201cReally good value and central\u201d", "Author": "Weasel12", "ReviewID": "UR39236694", "Content": "We have visited Barcelona a number of times before and stayed at the tope of the Paseo de Gracia area, so we were a little apprehensive about moving 'south'.

I had great expectations of Pulitzer after reading about it on several websites, through social networking sites, as well as personal recommendations. However, I was a bit disappointed for several reasons. (1) I was assigned what may have been the most run down room in the hotel. It was alright, except every socket in the wall was loose, the paint and wood were chipping off places, there were stains on the panel above the bed, and the window in the bathroom (which did not have an exhaust fan to my knowledge) was coming off one of its hinges. This seemed to have later been fixed. (2) The wireless internet had a very weak signal in my room. The technician did come in and give me an ethernet cable which I used. But it is incorrect to say there is functioning wireless in every room. (3) I asked reception for an iron and board: they said they did not provide that service and I would have to give my shirts to laundry for pressing which ended up going on my bill. That's fine, but the next day I saw one of the staff taking an ironing board and iron back downstairs from what must have been one of the rooms. I decided not to raise the issue. I think they were short staffed this week. The receptionist came to collect my laundry, the bar-manager to deliver the food . This really wasn't a problem though because it did not affect service delivery . You may ask why I recommend the hotel. (1) Well, it has an outstanding location just off Catalunya. (2) There is something charming about the hotel; it's small size makes you feel at home (3) The room, sheets and premises, lobby, etc, are all very clean and well kept and the lobby and lounge area is tastefully done.

I would like to thanks all the staff (Amada , Sergio (I think that was his name) and espically Raju (Again ... not surelly this the right spelling) about taking me by hand out side the hotel to show me where i can find the police dep. About the noise : There is no noise from the street (and I'm talking from both point of view : room 202 (ours) - located to front , and room 214 (our freinds) located to the back).

We paid 120 Euros and 20 Euros extra for the romantic package which was a bottle of Cava and breakfast for two in room. The hotel was right off Placa Catalunya and it was literally near everything. Metros, Las Ramblas, restaurants, shopping, beach. We picked this hotel because of the reviews and location and I'm so glad we did. When we arrived, I had used the ATM right next to the hotel and it didn't give me any money so I tried again and it said I used my maximum allowance. I checked my account online and saw that the money had been taken out of my account already. So we went into the bank to talk to someone and not one person spoke English which we found a little odd since every other country we were in, at least one person spoke a little. I went into the hotel and asked the girl at the front desk (Amanda) for some help. I was thinking maybe she could write something out for me to bring to the teller. She went above and beyond. She came with me into the bank to translate. One of the guys told her that it would take a half hour to come back into my account. So after an hour I went back to Amanda and said it's been an hour and still the money isn't back into my account. I told her that it wasn't a big deal if it took a few days, I just wanted to make sure I eventually got the money back. So she went back to the bank with me and we spoke to a manager who said that she would check the ATM at 2pm when the bank closes and to come back and she'll let us know what happened. My boyfriend and I wanted to do some sightseeing so we said we would be back around 2pm. When we got back, Amanda had gone to the bank for us and got all the information from the manager. She was amazing. I was told that in Europe, you shouldn't expect as high of level customer service as in the states but I don't think any person in the states would've done the same. As for the room, it was small but modern. Definitely the nicest place we had stayed our whole trip. The bathroom was bigger than other places too. The bed was comfortable. The air conditioning was great. They knew we were leaving for the airport the next morning so before I had a chance to ask, they asked me what time I wanted a wake up call and if I needed a taxi to be there. Room service started at 8am and we planned on leaving around 8-8:30 so we went down to the restaurant for breakfast instead. The most delicious breakfast too. Every other hotel offered croissants, maybe some cold cuts, bread and coffee. This place had bacon, eggs, croissants, breads, jams, delicious coffee, fresh juices, fresh fruit.

I asked for a non-smoking room (twin beds) and there was no evidence whatsoever of anyone smoking in there - no smell - it was really fresh. We paid what I think is a reasonable rate (109 euros per night - room only) for a very central hotel, and I should add that I have paid more in this country for inferior quality rooms - especially in London. The only drawback is that there is no tea and coffee facilities in the room (but I already knew this - I took a travel kettle). There is a mini bar that I didn't use (I did drink the bottle of red wine next to the safe, this cost 5 euros).

The hotel was just a few yards from the Placa de Catalunya and within easy reach of all the major streets of the Placa including La Rambla.

The hotel was stylish and clean. The crisp white bedding was lovely and the air-conditioning worked perfectly. Con's - Tripadvisor rates this hotel as a 5* yet the little booklet in the hotel labels it 4*. I would certainly not call it 5*, the Langham Place hotel in Hong Kong is a true 5* with a doorman, staff to take your luggage to your room, in room tea/coffee making facilities, better toiletries etc etc. Since I wasn't paying a 5* price then I wasn't too disappointed but this hotel is supposedly only 4 or 5 years old and is showing distinct signs of wear and tear. Dark hardwood floors and woodwork feature throughout but in several places in our room (314) the floor joints had separated significantly. A huge chunk of wood was missing from the skirting board. The glass shower panels above the bath don't do the job effectively as copious amounts of water can seep through the gap and end up on the floor. Adjusting the angle of the shower head didn't seem to make any difference. Also whilst the bedding was very nice the bed was as hard as a brick but that's just a matter of personal taste. Several of the chic white leather/PVC sofa's in the lounge area are in dire need of replacement as the leather/PVC is torn, scored or split in several places. Now as I said in the beginning I would still return to this hotel despite the con's listed above provided I got a good rate.

Due to the lackluster dessert, we decided to skip the restaurant as there are already so many choices of where to eat steps away. Ok, now the things I enjoyed! The crisp white sheets and bedding were very soft and clearly of a higher quality and my request to have 2 twin beds pushed together was followed as they did not have king size available. I loved coming back to a very clean room that smelled totally luxurious. Whatever cleaning solution it is they use, it certainly is not your typical one. And I agree that the mint leg gel was a refreshing end to a long day of walking about. The rooftop terrace was lovely for sitting in, even during the day just to read and relax a bit. The location is perfect; steps away from the metro and Cafe Zurich, and very close to the Eixample area where there are beautiful wide streets lined with lovely shops.

Location great and hotel ambience super. Young staff very attentive and well trained. Our biggest gripe as mentioned by others was the noise in the rooms coming from the central atrium at the bottom of which was the bar area.Rooms have wooden floors anyway so beware the clip clop of heels above or to the side of your room. In all these hotels that have rooms around a central atrium they need another door to insulate the noise in the hall area before the bedroom area and this hotel does not have these. In our case in room 210 near the lifts we could hear most comings and goings all night at the lifts and needless to say with the regular supply of inconsiderate guests who speak at full volume at even 4.00am we had basically three nights with interrupted sleep. On this basis I couldn't recommend the hotel to others.View from room 210 not great either other than great roof sculptures of the C&A building of all places! The breakfasts were so so with erratic service from day to day. One day with coffee top ups every few minutes to the following day when we had to go find it ourselves. Hot selections were also not kept hot for long as there was no heating system resulting in tepid bacon and burgers!! and scarmbled egg. The buffet breakfast at the next door sister Hotel Regina looked much better. We stayed on a romantic break package which packaged the breakfast s with a bottle of Cava which we drank in the bar on a Wednesday night when they have live music (finishes 10pm). Most of the other people in the bar on all three nights were local young vistors not staying at the hotel. Coffee price in bar E3.00. Had a bar meal on night two which was of good quality at Burger E10.50 with Artisan chips for E5.50. Other tips for your stay. Caught train RENFE from airport E2.60 each -change at Barcelona Sants still on RENFE to Pl de Catalunya. The road for the Pulitzer is off the Plaza directly opposite the Corte Ingles apartment store. Meals ; had a great al fresco meal at El Cafe d'en Victor which is near the Cathedral in the Gothic quarter. Menu del dia for E12.00 sit outside price -three courses and a carafe of wine with Sea Bass as main course. Decent meal also at Siddartha on Carrer d'Avenyo Try and go for the day to Sitges. We went by train at E5.20 return each, takes about 30 mins and it is a lovely place to sit in the sun and eat if you can at the Costa Dorada just below the church by the beach where you can while away the day with beer and tapas.

In fact, I'm going to go there and say that it was the best hotel I've ever stayed in. HP was the first hotel of our trip and it could not have started any better. The service, the decor, and the location were all superb. The rooms were small, yes, but sleek and modern and completely comfortable for two people who were mostly in and out. We had a room overlooking the street (which I'd recommend) with those classic Barcelona-style doors that open to a small balcony. The views were fantastic. The bathroom was also modern and sleek, with a dark granite decor. The bed had lots of pillows and was very comfortable! Another thing we really loved was the bar. The bartenders were true professionals and made the most well-executed cocktails I have ever seen! I greatly recommend trying some of the drinks on their menu because all that we tried were amazing. They really take their time and use great quality ingredients (try the mojito and the white russian!). They were also friendly and helpful. They recommended a tapas restaurant to us (Origens), that ended up being the best dining experience of our trip. The space is also cool. You can sit at the bar or settle in at one of the many comfy spots throughout the lounge. On most nights, there were small groups of people congregating throughout. There is also a really cute little back garden. One night while we were there, they had some live jazz, which just added to the experience even more! In addition to the service at the bar, the overall hotel service was also excellent. Never having been to Barcelona before, we had many questions and requests and they were always incredibly accomodating and friendly. Finally, the location was great, especially for someone just getting the know the city. It's a block of so from La Rambla, which is a great starting point for any direction you want to go in.

A half block from the tourist buses, and the Ramblas. I couldn't have been happier with the spot. My only criticism would sound silly, actually - the \"purity of design\" won out over some very practical things. No soap dish on the counter, for example.... so the maid winds up using one of the glass covers to hold your soap.... And not a single place in the tub/shower to hold the soap there, or put down the (very nice) bottles of shampoo they provide. \"My kingdom for a soap dish.\" (Just kidding.)

Brilliant!\u201d", "Author": "MariaGIreland", "ReviewID": "UR20647078", "Content": "I have just returned from a two-night stay in the Hotel Pulitzer in Barcelona. Our decision to choose this hotel was based on the reviews seen on Tripadvisor and most especially on the very genuine replies inserted by the hotel Manager. I did untold research regarding hotels for this trip as it was a very special trip for both myself and my sister. I wanted everything to be perfect with no time wasted fixing any mistakes or carrying out any re-working of our plans. We were not disappointed! We had a fantastic trip and this was definitely enhanced by this superb hotel. I actually feel quite hesitant recommending it as we wanted to keep it all to ourselves but that didn't seem fair! The location is perfect. It is literally a few steps from the central Placa de Catalunya. This proved to be an invaluable location as we were within walking distance of many of the main sights and on the route for the red and blue Bus Turistica (worth using, definitely if you are short on time). The hotel is situated on a quiet side street......so no noise at night! The staff in the hotel are very friendly (in a very understated, gentle, smiley way which we loved!) and extremely professional and efficient. The superb customer service actually started before we left Ireland at all! I had been researching the vast array of restaurants available in the city and became more and more confused. I eventually narrowed the list down to about 6 and couldn't make up my mind betwen them all. Because of the Manager's very genuine comments on this website, I decided that I could probably trust him to set us straight......and I was right! Within a day, I was contacted with restaurant suggestions for each night. I decided on two, and these were subsequently booked for us by Patricia at the front desk. No hassle, no problem just friendly, efficient service. What a pleasure! On arrival, we were greeted by Sergio at the front desk.He was very pleasant, friendly and efficient. (If you find that I am repeating my adjectives, that is because there are not enough to do justice to the standard of this hotel). Our check-in was handled quickly, our restaurant reservations were confirmed and we were given little \"appointment\" cards for each. Our room was excellent. I had thought that our room would actually be smaller so we were both pleasantly surprised by the space we had, The room is very trendy and modern, but most of all comfortable. There is excellent and smart use of the available space with your every possible need catered for. The suitcases fit underneath the bed; there is ample wardrobe and drawer/shelf space; the lights are controlled with switches which you keep depressed so as to alter the lighting levels in a slow manner and thus you can easily control the level of lighting you prefer. There is aircon, a lovely shower, a large mirror in the bedroom and a make-up mirror in the bathroom. We were provided with bath-robes and slippers and ample, very nice, toiletries. The beds were very comfortable. To avoid boring you, the room was more than perfect for our needs and exceeded expectations in terms of comfort. It IS narrow but definitely there is enough space so as not to be restrictive. After our return from the restaurant on the first night (El Passadis del Pep........HIGHLY RECOMMENDED), we retired to the hotel bar for a drink. The bar is very relaxing and is decorated as per the rest of the hotel....clean, crisp lines with modern , trendy furniture. The atmosphere is very mellow and added to the feeling that this hotel was fast becoming our home from home. The staff here were very pleasant and again helpful. We decided to have breakfast in the hotel for the sake of convenience and that was the correct decision! For \u20ac15, we had unlimited access to eggs, mushrooms, cheeses, stuffed tomatoes, fruits, yoghurts, various breads, various pastries, coffees etc etc. What a spread for that price. The staff here were again very friendly and attentive. The man on duty was particularly excellent as he really tried to make sure that we wanted for nothing. He was very gentle in his attitude and made us feel right at home. Fully fortified we headed off for our day but returned in the early evening for a drink on the outside terrace. After our meal that night (L'Olive.....again we would recommend this restaurant.....just go easy on the breads at the start. We overdid it a bit and found the subsequent courses hard going! Try the sole catalan style.....) we returned to the hotel bar for a night cap which again, provided a perfect end to a perfect day. A taxi was ordered for us for our early start the next morning and this arrived a little early, which suited us perfectly. The efficiency just went on and on.......... We would both HIGHLY recommend this hotel to anyone going to Barcelona.This is based on the staff, the hotel ambience and decor, the location and the facilities.

Unfortunately the hotel didn\u2019t have my reservation in their system so despite the booking confirmation I had brought with me I was kindly asked to take a walk (- I was even handed a map) while they tried to figure something out. We agreed that I should come back after approx 2 hours and before strolling out in the beautiful weather of Barcelona I was asked if I would like to leave my suitcase at the hotel. The location of the hotel is simply just perfect. Before going I considered staying at the Le Meredien at the Las Ramblas and without saying anything bad about the Le Meridien I have to say that I\u2019m glad I booked at the Pulitzer instead. This only based on location. When I returned to the hotel everything was settled and I was given a room at the first floor facing the street. I liked the room a lot but as I know this is solely a matter of individual taster I\u2019ve decided to post a few pictures from the room/bathroom so that you can decide for you self. It\u2019s not a big room but it got all you need. No turn down service though ;o) The hotel lobby is very \u201cfriendly and full of light\u201d \u2013 The same goes for the bar and the restaurant. At the 6th floor there is a very nice terrace bar which is a great place to wind down after a busy day in the city. It\u2019s even possible to have a snack but the choices could have a little more variety. The staff is really something. Whether it was the people at the reception desk, in the bar (terrace and lobby bar) or the two charming girls in the breakfast restaurant they were all very kind and very professional. I actually only have two little things I would like to mention as being less positive. 1) The noise level in the room from inside the hotel is rather high. Perhaps it was because I stayed at the 1st floor and therefore could hear almost anything going on in the bar on ground floor (porcelain more than people). A better isolated door would really have done it for me as no noise from the street outside ruined my night sleep ;o) 2) I\u2019m not really sure this has anything to do with the hotel but I would like to mention it anyway.

The lobby area, dining room and roof-top bar are all very nice, but the rooms are very small! We had even decided to book the 'superior room' as we knew that the rooms were small, but it also was very narrow and the only difference between this room and the standard room appeared to be the addition of a small couch. The width of the room, however, appeared to be similar, which me feel quite claustrophobic. As previously noted, there was little space to get by the t.v. on the wall to the desk area (you actually had to duck down to get by), and the sitting area by the desk was also quite cramped. We did have a small balcony, but couldn't figure out how to open the door. Similar to the previous reviewer, we were given no instructions on the room when our luggage was brought up. We also arrived from overseas around 11 am and were told that because other guests in the room wouldn't be checking out until noon that the room wouldn't be ready until around 2 (or possibly 1 at the earliest). We checked our luggage and tried to entertain ourselves, but after an hour of walking around returned to the lobby in the hopes that we could get into the room early. After listening to rather annoying new wave music for nearly 2 hours, we were finally let into our room at 1:55 pm. I have to admit that I was quite disappointed that no efforts were made to attend to our room to accommodate the fact that we had been traveling all night to get to Barcelona. We had also booked the romantic package, but despite previous reference to red bows and rose petals all we got was a bottle of cava delivered to our room. Positives of the hotel include a great location (close to the Ramblas and to several metro stops), very friendly staff (who helped with restaurant recommendations--including a very good nearby tapas bar), free internet, a good breakfast buffet, and a nice roof-top bar (we did not have a drink there though).

The staff were all helpful and very charming, even when I was peppering them with dumb questions. I really admired that when my wife and I were waiting on the sidewalk outside of the hotel, for a friend to pick us up in a rented car, the security guy on duty made it a point to stand near us whenever suspicious characters came walking down the street. 3. Smart contemporary and not over the top design. I am very sick of over-designed hotels. The pulitzer was classy. The lobby was chic and filled with cool-looking people our whole trip. The rooms, while nowhere near huge (this is Europe after all), were decorated smartly, with nice neutral and earthy tones. 4. Smart design touches in the room. The foldaway desk was great since I needed to do some work on the trip but didn't want to be tripping over the desk at other times. The light switches by the beds were well-placed.

I chose it originally through reviews on this site and I couldn't have been more pleased. I am a female who traveled to Spain solo and met a friend there, so I chose it first and foremost on its ease of getting there by myself. It's just literally a minute or two walk to the A1 airport bus which is hands down the best way to get back and forth to the airport. The staff at the front desk were very courteous and kind with my limited knowledge of Spanish. There was a tiny mix up in the bed configuration, but they solved it quickly and check-in was a breeze. I had requested a room with a balcony facing the street and I'm happy that I did. It lets in a nice amount of fresh air. We never found a problem with heat or air conditioning - it was always perfect and easy to control. The beds were very comfortable to me, and the linens were super clean and fresh. The bathroom was extremely spacious with nice touches and amenities. The shower was strong and hot water was never a problem. The whole room was very clean and smelled really nice. The design of it was very pretty with the dark colors and artwork and the flat screen on the wall was a plus, although the channels to choose from were not so great. But I didn't go to Spain to watch TV! While a lot of people have said the rooms are small, this is true but I never felt closed in at all. And Barcelona is a city to explore - not one to stay in the hotel room!! But upon return to it, it was a quiet calm haven to rest in. With two of us there, we didn't feel squeezed in at all. There's a spacious closet in which to place your suitcases and hang clothes. I didn't try the room service or the restaurants, as there are a bounty to choose from right outside the door. But I did get ice at the bar and they were happy to provide a bowl of it! I wouldn't hesitate at all to book this hotel again. It's location is far enough off of the Ramblas to be quiet, and close enough to walk two minutes and have your morning coffee there.

We picked this hotel having read the reviews. The best part of this hotel is it's location. It's on a side street, turning left out of the hotel it's less than one minute's walk from Pl. Catalunya and turning right it's less than one minute from a Starbucks cafe. Room : We were not fortunate enough to get an upgrade as others did, so we had the basic room which is quite small width wise without the couch but with one armchair. The television is on the wall facing the bed and every time we passed it we felt we were going to hit our heads. The lighting is very nice and you can dim them if you are in the mood which is a nice touch. There are robes and slippers provided. The bathroom is very nice with nice fluffy towels and shower gel, shampoo and moisturiser provided. There is also a man and woman box which has a toothbrush, toothpaste, razor, etc. but one thing missing is cotton buds which is usually provided in 4* hotels. We booked the romance package which included breakfast and a bottle of cava. For anyone else booking this package, apparently the cava is delivered to the room around 7pm in ice bucket with two champagne glasses. We had to ask when it would be delivered. If we hadn't and only returned to our room late after eating, I would imagine the cava would have been warm at that stage. Our room was on the 5th floor to the back of the hotel which got the sun for most of the day, looked down on the back of the hotel and onto the next street on which C & A is located. There was no balcony but the window doors opened in with a railing outside. If you are to the front of the hotel, there is a very small balcony with standing room only. The street is not very wide and you only get the sun in the evening. Breakfast : This is served until 11am during the week, later at the week-end. It comprises of juices, cereals (no cornflakes), cold meats, cheeses, fresh fruits, scrambled eggs, mini saugages, crispy bacon, bread rolls, bread to be toasted, yogurts, danish pastries and doughnuts. We arrived down for breakfast at 10.30am to see a waitress taking plates of what looked like really nice shortcake cookies, we presumed to a different location in the breakfast room. We soon realised that they were clearing away and these were not available when we would have liked them with our coffee and tea to finish. If you like coffee there's no problem but if you like tea, like me, they bring a cup of warm water and a tea bag. You get the milk from the large jug for the cereal. Most 4* star hotels we have stayed in have teapots and small jugs for cold milk which make it much more user friendly. Pulitzer Management please take note. Restaurant : Not open Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday nights. Having stayed previously in the AC Diplomatic which is a further 5/10 mins away from Pl.

Later I learned it had great reviews on tripadvisor.com, and I was not disappointed. There was some problems with the room: specifically, the lighting controls were weird and hard to manage and master, and oddly the shower head flew off repeatedly when the water was turned on. There was no fix for the lighting, but the hotel quickly fixed the shower head problem. (Nice touch: the shower head was placed high on the wall -- nice for us tall folk.) Another weird issue -- the bar soap was tiny and smelly. I expect more from a high-end hotel. Otherwise, the room was fairly design-y. Dark wood floors, dark wood furniture, and a firm (comfortable) bed. One down-side of the dark wood everywhere was the lack of lighting in or near the closet. I was constantly afraid of leaving something behind in the drawers or on the shelves. The electric outlets in the room for charging cell phones and plugging-in laptops were not easy to reach, but the in-room safe was big enough for my 15\" Macbook. Good things about the room: minibar was fairly inexpensive (2,20 euros for water) and free WiFi in the rooms. All rooms in the front of the hotel had small balconies overlooking the street with a view to Placa Catalunya down the street. My Wallpaper* guide to Barcelona mentioned that rooms 306 and 506 had extra space and a leather couch. I can vouch that 406 had the same extra space and couch. Nice and big, but a weird lay out in the long thin rectangular room. However, the fire escape map on the room door showed that most rooms were tiny. Be warned. Ask for one of the bigger rooms. As for the common areas, the bar area looked comfy although I did not take advantage. The breakfast buffet was great and included in my 300 euro room rate, so I can't comment on the value. I did not get room service, but I believe it was 24 hour service. Location-wise, it was quite convenient to Las Ramblas and the #1 underground metro line. And if you have to get to the hotel from the airport and there's a huge line for taxi's, the #17 bus from the airport stops just a block from the hotel (1,40 euros I think).

At 120 Euros a night, it was also a good enough value not to matter. Our one complaint about the room was the heat. Others have also mentioned it in their reviews of the hotel: the a/c doesn't work in the Winter, but the sun is strong enough on the southern side of the building that our room was unbearably hot unless we kept the windows open all night and the blackout curtains drawn all day. We weren't bothered by traffic noise, but a very light sleeper probably wouldn't do well with open windows. I recommend requesting a room that doesn't face south.

Plaza Catalunya is also perfect for Tourist Buses, Tube station etc., being just 150 yards from the door of the hotel. Breakfast - All the usual fare \u2013 cereal, fruit, cold meat, bread etc..

Aerobus and tourist bus leave from/arrive to here so it was more than handy. If you're a shopping fanatic it's also a great area with both Cortes Ingles within feet of each other and Las Ramblas just around the corner. Some great small boutiques down the side streets here. When we arrived we were shown to a smoking room which didn't suit. There were no indications of preferences when booking on the site so we just assumed that it would be non-smoking. We went back down to reception and were given a new room straight away. Although we were asked if we had used anything in the room which I found a bit unnecessary as we had literally been there for 2 mins. Otherwise I found the staff courteous and pleasant. Overall the room was lovely. Great design in some areas and made the most of the space. Bathroom overall was nice but the only thing that let it down was the staining on the marble tiles as mentioned in previous reviews. The thing is that the bathroom was spotless otherwise but the staining probably looked worse that it actually was. I'm sure there's some kind of cream to improve this..... The new room we were given unfortunately didn't have the view of the previous one of the side street. Instead it looked out over the main street and the breakfast room/terrace. The main street was quite noisy but you soon got used to it. Also you could hear the odd peep from the other rooms and the hall especially when they were wearing heels! Breakfast was good. No complaints here. Room was nice and bright and terrace was lit up at night. It was while we were here that we realised where the music was coming from which woke us up each morning when we had the door open. Not great but we were getting up anyway. Lobby very nice too. Lovely rioja and great atmosphere. One of the only times I've had room service in a hotel and it was fantastic! We had the burgers and they were just what we wanted. Recommended if you're feeling a little tired and can't be bothered to go in search of food.

If you stay in the back of the hotel, where the rooms get direct sunlight, your room will be very warm (about 80 degrees). If you stay in the front of the hotel, you will not get direct sunlight and your room will be much cooler. Still, there is no individual temperature control. If the central heating is on, the entire hotel is set to the same temperature. Your comfort will be at the mercy of the person who has set the temperature, or the placement of your room to the sunlight. When we first checked into the Pulitzer we were given a room in the back of the hotel, facing the sun. Because it was near 80 degrees in the room (maybe even warmer), we didn't stop sweating. It was gross not being able to cool down. Later on that day Jose said we could move if the room didn't get any cooler (thank you Jose). So we moved to a room in the front of the hotel. It was smaller, but MUCH better. I prefer climate control and service over room size any day. The room in the front of the hotel also had a small standing balcony (which we were supposed to have had to begin with). To make the climate more comfortable we just left the huge windows wide open, with a big fan blowing the cooler outside air into the room. (You will have to ask for the fan, they aren't usually in the rooms). The hotel's heating system is so powerful that even with the window open on a winter night and a fan blowing in the cool air, it was never too cold. The temperature in the room got down to 65 but not much lower. If you are a person who loves warm indoor air, or perhaps has poor circulation, or a person who keeps your thermostat set to 72, you will love it! If you are a person who loves the ability to control the temperature: making it warm when needed and cool when needed, you will hate it. Because you cannot control the climate in your room. The location is great and right in the center of things. It is possible to walk nearly everywhere from this hotel. The hotel is literally next door to the Best Western Premier Hotel Regina (which appears to be run by Jose and the same team from the Pulitzer). Are the rates better there? Might want to check. There was also quite a bit of construction work happening at the hotel. On our floor there were missing ceiling tiles. The exposed rafters weren't so pretty to look at. My advice would be to make sure the pipes aren't exposed visually. See photos. The rooms are not sound proof. A couple times I heard people in the next room use the bathroom. And when we would shut our door I could hear something fall off the wall in the next room (the doors are heavier than the construction of the walls). It was no problem with us, we thought it was funny. But if hearing your neighbors use the shower or restroom bothers you, bring along some ear plugs. Also, the floors are not hard wood in the sense of having hard wood flooring like the rooms at the Bowery Hotel in NYC. They are inexpensive wood laminate. There were several spots in the room, halls, and on the elevator where the laminate was coming up or bubbling. The \"man\" and \"women\" boxes in the bathroom are a cute idea, unless you're two men, or two women. Then, of course, it isn't so cute. The bathroom floor could be cleaner (you can clearly see \"stains\" where prior male guests didn't quite make it into the toilet). The rates are not very high, but as the old saying goes: \"you get what you pay for.\" If back in Barcelona I might stay here again if I had a cooler room in the front of the hotel. But I might try one of the nicer hotels in the Eixample area or maybe the Meridien. Within walking distance, Casa Calvet was great for dinner. And not expensive. On a whole, the food in Barcelona is disgusting. Everything is either fried, fishy-tasting (not in a good way) or covered in mayo. Hunting for a single vegetable or healthy dish is an exciting way to spend the afternoon. We did find a couple Tapas bars within a few blocks of the hotel that had one or two clean, healthy dishes. Tip: Skip the hotel's breakfast. You can get more food for the same cost (or less) at any of the tapas bars nearby. The blonde girl at the front desk is not good with customer service skills. I asked her if a specific tourist site was open for visitors (it was a bank holiday) and her response was, \"I don't know....\" then she just stood there and looked at me... She didn't bother to pick up the phone, make a call, and find out. (Jose, no worries - don't bother to respond about this. The excellent service of everyone else at the hotel made up for her lack of enthusiasm. ALL the other people were incredibly generous, friendly and great. Plus, Amanda is a genius.) I give this hotel an \"Average\" rating because it was average. It wasn't super great yet it was far from terrible. But I honestly feel it's right down the middle.

If you are a light sleeper you could request a room away from the courtyard but quite frankly I was so tired from all the sightseeing and I confess the great food/wine in Spain that I fell asleep right away! The only issue I had was that the safe in the room did not work. To be fair the staff at the front desk called the technician right away and it was replaced the second day while I was out and I was able to store my passport etc for the rest of my stay.

Although I had contacted the general manager and asked for an early check in, we waited until about 1:00 before we were able to check in. We found the lobby to be very shabby and when finally showed to our room there was construction on our floor (which was never disclosed when I contacted the general manager about early check in) The room was especially small, the beds (twins) were pushed up against the window, what I thought was a balcony room ended up overlooking the top of other buildings and the room was \"really\" narrow which I understand is typical of European hotel rooms but this was beyond small. The bathroom was so narrow that you couldn't fit two people in it, although that would have been difficult since there was only one sink which kept clogging up. The resturant was not open for dinner and didn't open until 2:00 for lunch, so we were forced to find something else. Although the staff was helpful there seemed to be a lot of confusion when we asked for help. I confirmed out flight for the next day, but found out later, after we arrived at the airport four hours early, that the reservation had changed. We stayed in another hotel the first night we arrived in Barcelona and that was a wonderful experience and were disappointed that this was the way we ended our trip. The most laughable thing was that they allowed \"one\" kleenex for two people in a little sample box marked for women, guess the men don't need kleenex.

To details. We booked a superior room, which does in fact have quite a bit more space than a regular room. All rooms are somewhat narrow and long. The nice flat screen TV's are mounted at the end of the bed, but you have to duck around it to access the other side of the bed. Best part of the Pulitzer is the decor, which is very hip and cool. Our room had great artwork very nicely framed and presented. It also had a great huge sliding door from the room to the bathroom, which had a very modern feel with full natural stone sink, floors and such. A nice leather couch was part of the superior room layout. Only downside was either due to poor selection of stone for the bathroom, or poor cleaning, hard to tell which. Unfortunately the lovely bathroom sink area had round glass stains all over it, and the floor had many water spot stains by the tub. This marred what could have been a true 4 star hotel room. There was also what looked like coffee spill stains on the wall by the bed. This could all have been easily fixed by a coat of paint and buffing of the stone in the bathroom. The lobby and bar on the ground floor is very nice, with white leather everywhere and a nice feel to the place. The location of the hotel was perfect for sighseeing in Barcelona, and just off the major thoroughfare enough so that noise was not an issue. Other than the bed being too hard for my liking (my wife loved it), sleeping was no problem at all. Other than Andrea, who was exceptionally helpful, unfortunately the rest of the front desk staff was clueless when it came to assistance. One desk member suggested a cab was necessary to get to a restaurent that was clearly only a 10 minute walk down one of the largest and most travelled streets in the city. The front desk staff seemed very young, and not very well trained. My advice is to seek out Andrea for recommendations and assistance. Although the Pulitzer was good value to money, and had a great location and many positives, I would look for something else next time I was in Barcelona.

G Taylor September 25, 2007 Dear Mr. Roig: Please forgive us for not speaking Spanish. On June 21 of this year, we were attacked by bandits on the interstate just outside of Barcelona . The thieves cut our tire, held us up, and stole my girlfriend\u2019s purse containing her passport, wallet, credit cards, cash, and irreplaceable personal items. One of the worst experiences of either of our lives. We quickly rushed to the nearby toll booth to call the police, but were told by the attendant to go to the police station in the city square. We parked the car close to the square and frantically ran into the Hotel Pulitzer to ask to use their phone to cancel our credit cards and to ask directions to the police station. As you could imagine, we were very shaken up and very emotional, especially as neither of us had ever been robbed before. Mr. Luis Carasa and Mr. Jose Sanchez calmly and professionally asked what had happened to us, and then allowed us to use the hotel\u2019s staff phones to cancel our credit cards, free of charge and undisturbed. They also brought us refreshments and helped us to calm down. Mr. Carasa and Mr. Sanchez then offered to allow us to stay in the hotel at a special rate (we learned later that this took some juggling). This was both of our first time to Barcelona, and the mugging is an isolated event, but the kind actions of your Mr. Carasa and Mr. Sanchez afterwards went a long way to make such a bad occurrence better. They both went out of their way to help us in our time of need. We are both very grateful to these two gentlemen and the Hotel Pulitzer for the kindness and exemplary service we were given during such a bad situation. Mr. Carasa and Mr. Sanchez are a shining example of the many good things about Barcelona , and because of their actions, we would gladly return to Barcelona and would gladly stay in your hotel again (but where else?).

The lighting system in the room was also a bit of a mystery....they were all set up on a dimmer kind of system but we could never quite figure out how to turn the light off we wanted without trying every light in the room. But the bed was very comfortable and the location couldn't be beat. A word of caution - and this is not intended to be positioned as the fault of the hotel - but watch your belongings very carefully. My husband and I stopped by the front desk to check a dinner reservation one night on our way out the door. My husband walked up to the desk and I took a seat on a bench / ottoman just off the lobby. I put my purse down beside me on the seat and watched what was going on at the desk. Within 2 minutes my purse was snatched without me noticing - and it was literally right beside me. The hotel is located just off Plaza Catalunya and a thief could easily cruise through a busy lobby and make their way out the door without anyone noticing in a matter of seconds and disappear into the crowded Plaza. Everyone knows to be extra careful out on the streets, but just a reminder to not let your guard down once you hit your hotel - an easy thing to do when the hotel is on the high end like this one.", "Date": "September 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong", "Title": "\u201cFantastic hotel!\u201d", "Author": "EwanHongKong", "ReviewID": "UR8699113", "Content": "My friend and I stayed at the Pulitzer on a short city break.

The hotel was clean but does need a freshen up of paint in places. We had a room to the front of the hotel with a small balcony. The room had everything we needed and was very comfortable. There is a nice bar on the ground floor and also a roof top bar. Both are nice and relaxed and worth a visit.

It was fortunately available, and exceptional value at 310 Euros per night. We arrived on Thursday afternoon after a decent flight. The reception staff were very cheerful, and I had paid for a 'celebration package' for the room. This entailed roses, champagne, chocolates, breakfast in bed, and a nice hot bath to await us. We were given our key and shown to our room. Upon entering my wife (who suspected nothing) , was blown away. The room was beautiful, decked out in chocolate browns , whites and greys, and luxurious. The room was very large, with a 4 poster bed in the centre. It really could not be faulted. As if we weren't already delighted, I pulled back the curtains to reveal an amazing Terrace/balcony, which was just decadent. It was very large, decked in solid wood throughout, and had loungers , remote controlled awnings, plants and a large table. We felt like royalty. The bathroom also didn't disappoint. Whilst quite narrow, they had made best use of the space with some natural light, and both a wetroom and a bath. All fixtures and fittings were of the highest quality. There are numerous other things that I could mention, including a fabulous Denon Speaker system throughout the suite, which allows you to connect your ipod and enjoy music in the bathroom, bedroom and terrace. There's also a 42\" plasma tv, and various books. Breakfast was good, pretty standard fare, but nice. The location is perfect, a stones throw from the market square and las ramblas.

We booked through the hotel website (EUR 170.00 per night for two nights during July 2007) and felt quite satisfied with the price. We arrived and were warmly received at reception. The common area in the lobby / bar / restaurant were all very welcoming though by the time you walk up and down the first floor you can tell the hotel is 'squeezed in what is a relatively narrow building'. We were given a room on the 4th floor (I guess one of the cheap rooms??) which was very very small (I think most of the standard doubles are this small) but had most amenities you could think off. The bathroom is very narrow but had a very comfortable shower. The surfaces in the rooms (simple wooden furniture that passes as modern furniture) was losing its luster with small cracks in the veneer / paint. None of this is paritcularly distressing because we weren't intending on spending much more than nights in the room. Though we were content with the room we discovered much to our dismay that the worn feel of the room carried through to the lighting (which was a real pain to use, using gradient lighting knobs), where we could find no way of turning off our night lamps (they have no switches on the lamp, rather a wall gradient switch). We took out the lightbulb, went to sleep, and complained at reception. They were very quick to accomodate us in an upgraded room on a higher floor (which was still small but much more comfortable) and threw in breakfast on Sunday. Generally greatly relieved that the hotel had such a positive customer attitude we went off for sightseeing and shopping. One last problem occurred on Saturday night where the hotel's air conditioning broke down. We were told on Sunday that it was a general problem (not only our room) and we were fortunate it hadn't been a sweltering day (Barcelona can get hot and humid in summer).

We appreciated the bedside control of all lighting within the room! The glass lift makes an unusual feature & as we were on the 5th floor, gave us a lovely view of the bar area below. All the public areas are modern with very comfy white leather sofas & chairs. We enjoyed a relaxing pot of tea here after a busy day sightseeing ! Breakfast was buffet style with lovely fresh fruit, cooked breakfast and the usual cakes & pastries. More than enough to last until lunchtime! Each & every one of the staff we came across were very helpful, professional & polite. Initially there was a slight confusion on the type of room we had booked so we were shown 2 different rooms for us to choose which one we preferred. You can't ask for more than that !

The Hotel Pulitzer was by far the nicer hotel. I stayed there for 5 nights and had a wonderful stay. The hotel is rather modern and is located in a fantastic location. We walked the city North, South, East and West and the hotel could not have been a better starting place. If you take the subway you are 2 steps from a metro stop and the airport bus stops 2 steps away. There is also a Starbucks on the corner for those that need their coffee fix! We vacationed with friends so I can comment based on two different rooms. We were both on the 3rd floor. We were in the back and my friends in the front. As many Barcelona reviews indicate the street noise was obvious. If you are a light sleeper you might want to look for a hotel with a lot of floors and request a room high up! We had no trouble sleeping, but our friends were light sleepers. Also, the weather was unseasonably warm and the air-conditioning seems to only work in the summer. We opened up our window and were pretty comfortable. The look of the hotel is very modern and with all modern furniture you get a lot of deep cushions and it takes a while to get comfortable. The lobby and lobby bar has a lot of room to sit and relax or have a drink before and after dinner. We did not eat in the restaurant so I can not comment on the food. As for the quirky \u2013 the rooms are very comfortable \u2013 we had a queen size bed \u2013 but the room is long and narrow. On the wall at the foot of the bed is a flat screen TV that is easy to hit as you walk by it. Also, it may be a small thing, but there are no soap dishes in the bathroom so you never really know where to put the soap. Finally, the light switches are very hard to figure out. It took us 2 days just to figure out how to get the bed side table lights to stay on while the rest of the lights are turned off. In fact, our friend\u2019s room there was some strange problem with the lighting controls as the left bed light was turned on by the switch on the right side while the right bed light was turned on by the switch when you walk in the door.

When we checked out, we asked a staff member to call us a taxi to the airport. He did this very efficiently, which was great. When the taxi turned up, the driver took our bags, put them in the trunk, and then went to talk to the staff member who had called him. This seemed a bit strange, since the driver already knew we were going to the airport. It looked to us as though the driver gave the staff member money, although it was done discretely. When we got to the airport, about EUR8 of \"extra\" charges were added to the meter (the charge normally used for tolls, etc). Not speaking Spanish well, I didn't want to argue, but something weird was going on. In total, the rate was about EUR10 more than going that other direction.

It definitely has an internal noise problem especially on Wednesdays when the bar is heavily occupied. The noise level coming from the bar on every Wednesday is unacceptable and makes it impossible to sleep. And we were in a quiet room located of the bar! If you are over 1.50 meter asked for a non handicapped room!! (See below.) The hotel shows pictures of suites next to stating the price for normal rooms in Jacbson hotelbook so you find your normal room to be a lot smaller and without a couch. This hotel presents itself as one with rooms for the handicapped and fully handicapped accessible. Well we were in such a room and as we work with the handicapped and design rooms for them on a daily basis we can tell you it is not!!! The shower is inaccesable as the guiderail blocks the entrance. Almost impossible to click it up as it is very stiff to handle. Next to impossible as you can only operate it with one hand. Shower head no higher then 150 cm (we measured it!), so if you are non handicapped but over 1.50 meter taking a shower is not easy and washing your hair proves to be a circus act, bending over like a Chinese contorsionist. The shower door consists of three separate parts already for non handicapped almost impossible to close. And how you should do that even sideways, we do not know. No chair in the shower! The shower itself lies some 5 cm deep, which makes it inaccesible with a wheel chair and you should enter and leave it sideways. Without a lot of assitance undone. The toilethandrail is only on the left and blockes the washing basis partly in combination with a waste basket whcih you can move but will be put back by hotel personell. Behind the room door there is a steep ramp. Opening the door and passing through requires some strong assitance. Watch out not to fall as the going doing part cannot be seen as you enter (the first time). And the parquet makes it very slippery. The only mirror in the room is ritght on the ramp so unusable. Wheeling around the room with a wheel chair is impossible as there is too little room. Behind the bed only some 40-50 cm. So you cannot reach the other side of the room and the light switches located on the other side. Trying to reach them over the bed is also not such a good idea for the handicapped as the beds then slide apart on the slippery floor and you might end up between them on the floor. (Futhermore they only operate with dipswitches that require a college degree to operate.) Also entering the balcony proved to be impossible for the handicapped. So desk and safe are also unreachable. Hanging your clothes: impossible as the door cannot be opened due to the fact that the wardrobe is blocked by a chair in front of it. This makes it even very unpractical for non-handicapped. (moving the chair is no option a there is too little room and it will be put back by personell on every occassion.) We left some of our comments at the hotel and gave them permission to contact us but they never did, so obviously they do not care to make any improvements. Normally we do not post pictures but in case we make an exception to clearify our point. We wonder how they can avertise this as handicapped accessible. By the way Barcelona is only accesible for the handicapped in some places. Sometimes you need to walk down steps to reach the elevator for the handicapped....", "Date": "December 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cCentrally Located\u201d", "Author": "dafos27", "ReviewID": "UR6269659", "Content": "We originally booked this hotel via Clarion Hotels, but the hotel was sold before we made the trip. The new owners honored our rate without fail. The Hotel Pulitzer is on a side street off Placa Catalunya. The hotel is very clean in the lobby, restaurant, bar, and in the rooms. Although the rooms are small, they are very comfortable. There was a huge closet to store your luggage, many shelves and drawers. You can pack all your clothes away if you're here for a week or more. The bathroom was equally large with a nice large granite sink and the shower has sliding glass door. The door to the bathroom does not open on a hinge, but slides on tracks, which was not obvious (initially). Toiletries are provided such as shampoo/conditioner, shower gel, razor w/cream, hand lotion, comb, toothbrush, robes, disposable flipflops, shoe shiners, and cotton pads for makeup. Way more necessities than most hotels provide. We had a balcony with two door french doors that looked down into the street. The A/C and heat worked fine and the rooms have a safe and LCD television. The room we had was on the second floor, close to the street so the noise level was louder than normal for most hotels. In Barcelona, trash is picked up at all hours of the night, but with the doors shut and the A/C on, it was not an issue for us. If you require complete quiet, you should not get a room on the street side or near the bar area. The hotel staff was very helpful with side trip arrangements and getting our taxis. I can't say enough good things about this hotel. The internet is available next door at the Hotel Regina for free. There are only two connections, so you might have to wait. The terrace on the top of the hotel was not open due to construction, but we did spend some time up there enjoying some views, but moreso the weather. Lastly, the hotel is centrally located to where all the action is. We walked to all the restaurants we ate at and it is a two minute walk to the Catalunya Metro stop which is one of the hubs of the metro system. Also, very close to Las Ramblas which is one of the main streets in Barcelona. You can't possibly go wrong with this hotel.

It is walking distance from shopping in the Barrio Gotico and restaurants on the Paseig de Gracia. The hotel staff was very friendly, helpful, and spoke English. They even helped us map out a road trip. The room was a good size, the bed was a comfortable queen (which is hard to find), and the bathroom was modern and a good size. The hotel itself is modern, and has the feel of a luxury hotel with the personality and service of a small hotel. I would recommend this hotel to anyone going to Barcelona. I reserved the room through Clarion's website, and got a good rate. My only complaint about Clarion is if you book early and then need to cancel a day at the start of your trip, they will reprice your entire reservation. So if you book early, but may need to cancel a day, book two reservations on their website. We stayed at another hotel during our two week stay because the hotel was booked a few days, and all and all this was our favorite. The only thing missing was a business center with internet.

Yes, the Pulitzer is a triumph of design, but the location, on one of the dull streets off Catalunya is seedy at best, and the hotel lets itself down in a number of aspects. First point to note is that if you have vertigo, or just a pretty severe fear of heights, then this is NOT the hotel for you. The glass lifts had me quaking in my boots, and the waist high glass railings which look out over the ground floor bar on each floor were enough to make me feel ill. I also wondered at the sense of the waist high railings - very little to prevent the intoxicated leaping over. The rooftop terrace is nice, again once you don't have a fear of heights, however the bar never seemed to be open although the hotel literature said that it opened from 8pm. The rooms are fashionable and comfortable, although the overall black and white aesthetic gives a rather clinical lasting impression. The bathroom was also a good size, with plenty of toiletries, but the sink and shower really lets the hotel down. The sink, of a freestanding marble square style WOULD NOT DRAIN! If for example, you washed your teeth, the sink would fill up and then take twenty minutes to drain. This problem must have existed before our stay, so I'm very surprised that the hotel placed anyone in the room. The showerhead also could not be removed, which reminded me of public swimming baths.

I agree with other reviews that this hotel is in an excellent location and that it is stylish. What has not been mentioned, and maybe it only affects rooms overlooking Bergara (or Vergara) Street, is the noise. We were on the first floor. The soundproofing on the balcony doors is non existant. The street and traffic noise from people going by lasts until about 4am. Then building work appeared to start close by, at least that is what it sounded like - rubble being poured down a funnel into a skip. The hotel next door looked like it was being renovated. Then there was the garbage collection. Then the street cleaners hose down the roads and pavements, then the morning traffic starts up again (except Sunday). Got about 4 hours sleep a night at best! Probably can't blame the hotel for the noise but they should put in better glazing. Other than that the hotel was great. Breakfast was filling and was a good start to the long day. The bar was relaxed and the roof terrace was nice for a rest and a view during the day or night, although the outdoor bar was not open when we were there (bring your own beer!). The Metro station is just round the corner and the bus from the Airport ( a bargain at 3.75 Euro) drops you off at the other side of Placa Catalunya Sq (outside the Cort Ingles department store). We will definitely return to Barcelona, and now that we know where everything is, will have a more relaxing time.", "Date": "April 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cLovely hotel\u201d", "Author": "Minky007", "ReviewID": "UR4829881", "Content": "We stayed at the hotel for two nights, for a wedding anniversary trip to Barcelona. The hotel is on a side road. It is in a fantastic location, just off Placa Catalunya. Make sure you take the open top bus from here. This is the best way to see the city and gain perspective. We arrived before our room was ready (at 1pm) but they quickly sorted this. Our room (111) was lovely. Long and narrow but didn't feel small (probably because of the high ceilings). The bathroom was also lovely with big fluffy towels! Within a few minutes of being in our room, there was a knock on the door and a bottle of Champagne, with the compliments of the hotel staff (for our anniversary). A lovely little touch! I only have a couple of negative comments for the hotel. First, the English language TV channels in the room are limited. We didn't spend very much time in the room but it would've been nice to watch something other than Sky News/CNN/MTV when we were there! Second, is that the hotel is noisy. This is due to a combination of hardwood floors throughout the hotel and open internal balconies on each floor, which made noise travel and echo throughout the building. My tip for this is to request a room as far away from the lifts as possible. I can't guarantee that this will solve the problem but may help! Barcelona is a fantastic city. Lots to see and do and great food. If you don't mind paying, go to Noti and Moo for some delicious food!!", "Date": "April 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London's fashionable Soho", "Title": "\u201cA chain hotel pretending to be a boutique\u201d", "Author": "KeithTalent", "ReviewID": "UR3845432", "Content": "I wouldn't stay here again, despite a great location (v. central, just off Plaza de Catalunya) and designer (if empty) bar.

They acknowledged they are having problems - but this isn't much consolation. Rooms were very smart, if a little small. They were noisy, thanks to clunkingly heavy doors which slam constantly.

It is very stylish and although the rooms are small they were not claustrophobic. Breakfasts were good in a very pleasant setting. Price is reasonable for the quality. I would definitely stay again. Only one 'but', mentioned by other people - instead of nice double bed to cuddle in a romantic city, we were given two single beds pushed together. We didn't want to waste time and effort asking why and for a different room - and in the end I was sorry I didn't push the point.

It's perfectly located on a quiet street right off the Plaza Catalunya, two blocks from the start of La Rambla (main walking street) and all roads leading to other parts of town. The hotel is brand new, not yet listed in all the guide books, boutique-style, modern and friendly. Lots of dark wood, white sofas/furniture, modern art and very high ceilings. The rooms are built around an atrium with glass elevators. The rooms are very large, clean, modern, quiet and have a flat screen tv and the bathrooms are very large with all the amenities. The spacious bar/lobby area is an oasis from the hot weather - the bartenders are spirited and friendly. You have a choice to sit outside or in a lovely garden for breakfast. The breakfast is included in the room rate and offers many choices from all kinds of fruit to eggs, meats, cheeses, breads, cereals and yogurt. The front desk staff is fantastic. Everyone speaks English and are all knowledgeble and friendly. Julian, the night manager, knows all the ins and outs of Barcelona from years of experience in the hotel business in Barcelona.
