I was very pleasantly surprised when we entered the hotel room... or should I say apartment! It was decorated to the hilt and had a wonderful balcony view of the bay. I really thought for the price, we would get a flea bag compared to the prices of the other hotels around, but it was nothing of the sort. The linen was fresh, the beds were comfortable, it had a better kitchen in it than I have at home (granite counter tops, stainless steel appliances, etc.) and the furniture/artwork was extremely stylish. The bathrooms were average but roomy and clean. I could have stayed here for a week but had to catch a cruise ship!! Very close commute to the Port of Miami (they offer shuttle service upon request for a small fee per person). The only thing I found possibly wrong was what others have commented on... breakfast was for 2 and I had 5 in my family, so had to pay an additional $13 for each of the kids, but we would have spent that at a restaurant so it was not a problem. Just know that going into it and it's all fine. The front desk were rather standoffish, but helpful when asked. This could be their attempt at being professional, but it came across as rather unapproachable.

I am not sure that the checkin staff are pleased with this arrangement as the service can feel rather haphazard. My unit, 2209, felt like a spacious one-bedroom apartment with a pleasant city view. The upkeep was very lacking however: cracked floor tiles, mismatched cheap and slightly tatty furniture, rusted doors, and paint blotches on the dark carpet (which hadn't been vacuumed in ages; I made two requests to housekeeping to do so on my second day). The trick here is to request a modern, well-renovated unit. It is potluck really as each owner has their own idea of what is a pleasing, comfortable place. The breakfast is plentiful and in a nice environment. There is a well-equipped gym and a small pool, although not recommended for sunbathing as the many tall buildings surrounding the property block the sun. The free, yes free!, metromover stop is only 2 blocks away; one can marvel at the tangible improvements in downtown Miami whilst riding to Bayside or to connect to a South Beach bus from the centre. Notice: they charge a daily 'facilities charge' here (plus tax) which is on top of any prepayment made through a booking website.

It is a good, central location in downtown Miami. There was a Publix within walking distance although we had to ask for directions because it is down a side street. This is not a standard hotel. Rather, it is a condominium unit which has full-time residents. The rooms and surroudnings were clean and the lobby actually smelled like soap. The rooms are definitely spacious and the full kitchen was a bonus. There was also a washer and dryer (although we didn't use it because we had just arrived in town). We ate lunch in the hotel lobby restaurant. Service was extremely slow and we were limited to what type of alcoholic beverages we could order because the bartender wasn't on duty. My only complaint is upon arriving home our credit card had a separate charge from the Fortune House for $7.49. I called the hotel and they explained the charge was for the mini-bar. I told that we didn't use the mini-bar but we had noticed that there were 2 Coke bottles in the trash can when we arrived in the unit. They took my name and number and said they would get back to me.

The run down - as we pulled up to the Valet, Miami police officers were entering the building. That should have been a sign. Not sure what the problem was. During our check in, the front desk clerk kept stalling our check in procedure to help other guests who would randomly approach the counter to inquire on different things. Finally, we went up to the room and was surprised to see a kitchen en suite - and more surprised to see stark cold accomadation for $189 per night. Then the tiled floors - filthy, sticky. Bedroom carpeting - my toes curled just looking at it. I did not remove my shoes the entire time. Furnishings in the place looked second hand and run down. A dirty \"suede\" sofa pushed right up to a tv, make shift dining room with wrought iron dining chairs. I did not venture into the kitchen for fear that I would lose sleep over what I would see. The bathroom had an odd smell to it that resembled roach spray. The bathroom drain and the sink drain were clogged. I could not stand in the shower to bathe properly for fear of what would come back up through the drain. THEN,,, bed time. The bed was hard and lumpy, the pillows were of cheap foam. The sheets were the rough and there was one flat sheet on the bed with one coverlette. When I pulled back the coverlette... a DRIED BLOODSTAIN on the back end of the coverlette. I freaked out, so disgusted. pushed the coverlette onto the floor and tried to contain my emotions because we were both VERY tired after driving a long way from Key West. We laid down to sleep and then the dog barking started. The accomadation seems to be mixed with rentals and suites so you have permanent residents in the building with dogs. Between listening to 3 different dogs bark and hearing a man shout at his dog to \"shut the f-up\" I was on the brink of finally falling asleep when the shouting and fireworks began outside The next morning I came to find small red itching bites on both my arms and upon inspection of my luggage I have discovered bed bugs. What ever you do, do not stay here. It's not all that inexpensive when you consider we paid $189 through expedia for the room, an additional $20 for valet (there is no other option for parking) and I have incurred an additional $100 expense to have my clothes dry cleaned because of the bed bug infestation in the apartment. I still don't know what to do with my suitcase.. do I throw it out? We basically rented someones ill kept, filthy, bed bug infested apartment for $300 (all expenses accrued).

I had booked a suite for two nights at the hotel, and was assigned a room on the pent house level. After traveling for business over a span of about 40 years, I thought I had seen everything. However, this hotel provided me with another reference point for the term \"Hell\". The only item that I can truly grade as \"good\", was the valet service. The room was furnished by IKEA! If you think I'm joking, then guess again. It was really furnished by IKEA. The bed was not provided with a box spring, under the mattress, and was lumpy and provided no support. The pillow were also lumpy, so I guess they were a matched pair. After one night on this bed, I had a sore back and neck. The sheets were not fitted, and of course moved around the mattress. The lamps were second hand I think, and were about one foot high. The ceiling fan did not work. The television's did not work, and also had no controller's, which also made sense then. The furniture in the living room also came from IKEA, and was dirty as well. The front door to the room was loose, and not secured. The bathroom had one light fixture, of which one bulb was out. There was no vent fan, and no air movement. So the only way to cool the bathroom down and remove the fog from the mirror was by waving the door back and forth for about 3-4 minutes. This was not great, due to the quality of the food in the restaurant. \"DO NOT EAT IN THE RESTAURANT\", if you want to stay friends with your digestive system, and not upset your wife. Trying to see the city with a colon that want's to commit suicide is not a good idea. This restaurant would be a better alternative than water boarding in my opinion. The United Nation's should also investigate the hotel for trying to pack a large number of people into a small area for the free breakfast. People were having to stand and eat, because of the lack of tables and chairs, and being told that they would be charged if they tried to take the plate and cup to their room to eat. Have you ever seen how people are packed into a subway during rush hour? Even though I had paid for two night's, I checked out after the one.

We were also unable to give our daughter a shower or shower ourselves since the bathtub and bathroom was unsanitary and was filled with mildew and mold. In addition the toiled did not work properly.

We rented a two-bedroom Bay view suite and requested one bedroom with two twin beds. This was a family trip (parents and sisters). Unfortunately, we arrived at different times, after our parents, who had accepted our reservation with two queen beds instead. We were told they were going to move us but never did, so one of us had to sleep in the couch. No big deal for us but keep this in mind if you need two twins. Our apartment (this is a condominium partially managed as a hotel) was very nice, with white ceramic tile floors, modern and tasteful furniture, and a modern kitchenette with nice looking appliances. Two of us stayed for two weeks, so this was important although we didn't actually cook. Bathrooms were okay, spacious and comfortable for a long stay. Bedrooms were rather small. Dinning kitchen area very good size. Flat screen TVs in bedrooms and living room. Very nice bay area from the balcony; unfortunately there was no patio furniture in the balcony--something I missed. The gym was good, nice size, but older equipment. The pool area very nice and comfortable. They provide you with clean towels as well as fresh water with lemon slices. What was not very good was housekeeping. Granted, there was daily maid service, but do not expect much cleaning. The maids will not make your bed but just tidy it up, clean the bathroom and change your towels (not necessarily for a full set of towels--my hand towel or floor mat was many times missing) and put dirty dishes in the dishwasher. You will return to a place with dirty dishes if you do not bring any dishwashing liquid with you. Floors were not swept or otherwise cleaned in the two weeks that we were there. No dusting furniture either even though I made sure that the tables were empty so that they could clean. Wi-Fi is available but very unreliable. At least in our floor (25) the signal was very weak, would disconnect me every few minutes, and when it worked, it was very slow. Breakfast for two persons was included (only my parents registered, that may be why). Parking is not included; $20 a day if you are staying in the hotel; $5 a day if you're a visitor. We couldn't understand the parking policy. If you come in once a day and leave once a day, you're a visitor. If you are staying in the hotel and come in/out also once a day you're considered a resident. Front desk service was very good. All the staff was very courteous. The hotel is located on a side street between the Four Seasons and the Conrad. Five to six blocks from a grocery store, Walgreens and a BP gas station. Seven blocks from the Mary Brickell area. Many good restaurant just a couple of blocks away. I'm recommending this hotel based on value and location. You cannot beat their prices in the Brickell area.

There were no TV remote control and they said they didn't have any to give me till the next day. By the way, this is not a cheap hotel. It is located in a very nice part of Miami. I asked for another room and they told me they did not have any more rooms. So we had to stay in that awful room. In eight days I checked out. At check-out I expressed my experience but there were no apologies or compensations, basically, just an I don't care attitude. I am not saying the entire Hotel is awful but the room I had was truly awful and the staff did not seem to care.

We needed to be close to the port as we were heading out the next day for our cruise, and I hated the idea of spending $150+ before I'd even gotten on the boat. To make it even more stressful, I'd never been to Miami. SO...I thought, based on the reviews, Fortune House had just as high (and in most cases a higher) rating. All I could do was make an educated guess and hope my thriftiness hadn't gotten me in trouble again. The taxis at MIA seemed to be well regulated, so the attendants let us know that it was in the downtown area and that would cost around $25 (about 20 minutes away). We ended up spending about $29 as the city's street signage wasn't all that clear and our driver had never heard of Fortune House. Turns out, it was directly across the street from the Four Seasons. Looking out the window of a cab you can't always see much looking up, which is where the signage was (so don't drive past the Four Seasons or you've gone too far, and then start looking up at the front of the buildings...I think it was a soft pink color). We pulled in just around 9:30pm Saturday night and right away the valet was there to open the door for us. He buzzed us in (yay! I already felt safe) and we walked in to a marble-filled room. The receptionist was friendly and welcoming. Before we could even get our bags in she asked my name and before I could finish my first name she was saying my last. It was like they were waiting for me (not bad for $92 bucks =) ! She quickly went over the amenities (pool/spa, deli downstairs, internet access, etc) and handed us our key which also had a magnetic key to give us access to the elevators. When we went down the halls I looked for signs of construction as I remembered comments from reviews I'd read, but everything looked new. This place is super-spacious!!! It is straight-up an apartment. My mom and I were just going to share a bed so we had the 1-room unit. But the kitchen had a dishwasher, pots/dishes/et al, and a full washer/dryer. The patio was more for stepping out for some fresh air, not for laying out on a lawn chair and having a BBQ. The living room had a nice-size TV and a stereo system. I could tell that they weren't finished updating the bathroom (so no luxury here) but it wasn't dirty. The bedroom was simple, but more than adequate. It had a walk in closets and full ironing board. This was definately set-up for guests needing to stay a while. So what didn't I like? Well, I didn't bring a car so I didn't have to deal with the \"high cost\" parking some lamented, but even though there are tons of hotels nearby (Marriott Courtyard, etc) there aren't really any places to walk to for a quick bite. You'd do best to order in pizza, unless you want to spend big bucks at the neighboring hotels' restaurants or catch a cab to a restaurant. Their deli was almost closed (but it was almost 11pm I think) and the items that they sold (carton of eggs, jug of milk, etc. since the sandwich items were already put up) weren't what we were looking for and the snacks were kind of costly. Oh, they did have a mini bar, so you wouldn't starve if you just had to eat something from the room (they had CupNoodles, M&Ms, Pringles, and other snacks). I did see a grocery store from our balcony, but I only would've went there if I'd been staying longer. Remeber, we were just passing through, not sightseeing. When we checked out, the receptionists were really friendly, patiently answered our tourist questions, gave us great advice about the port and boarding, and called us taxi. It cost us about $12 to get to the port which was about 3.5 miles away (less than 10 minutes). Overall, I wasn't looking for a resort-like Ritz Carlton enviornment, but I didn't plan to pay almost $100 for a cheap motel. My friends who stayed in South Beach or the Marriott down from us for a few days before our cruise left Miami, were all mad that they'd spent so much money for hotels that weren't \"all that.\" Fortune House is definitely a perfectly good place to stay.

I managed to get 1 night accommodations at this facility for 124.00 per night on expedia with taxes (143.13) and I was very happy. Why? because; 1. I was within 1 block of the French Embassy (3 mins walk) 2. The room was spacious enough for myself, with a kitchen - I did not need but it also had a washer/dryer and a large walk-in closet. 3. Staff was accomodating, I had to check in early (without prior notice) and it was handled very well. 4. Parking was safe and easy (NB. expensive as with everywhere else $16.00 per day taxes included) 5. wide variety of TV/ cable channels to choose from. (plenty spanish stations- I guess because its MIA) Cons: 1. The bed is average along with it small pillows and ugly comforter 2. bathroom average. not as bad as some report, but does need some work, in terms of decor 3. noisy a/c 4. waiting to see how long they hold the deposit on my card. 5. difficult to make overseas calls from the room. This place may not be for everyone, but it surely is a good deal for the location, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a reasonable price in that area.", "Date": "April 29, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Virginia Beach", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay before cruise\u201d", "Author": "brianl_s", "ReviewID": "UR4987892", "Content": "I had a hard time with this condo/suite after I booked it and then finding either bad reviews or not enough reviews/old reviews. I actually attempted to get out of staying there. Since it was around spring break this task was impossible and we did end up staying here for one night before we left on our cruise. The location is excellent; it sits in an upscale part of downtown Miami (Brickell area - financial district). There is some construction going on but easy to look past. Lot's of very nice condos going up around here....we took a nice walk to the semi-arch on Biscayne bay and could see the cruise ships. Our one bedroom suite was on the 26 floor, ceramic tiles almost throughout, nice furniture in great room, full kitchen (we didn't really need), great views from balcony, bedroom was nice and entire place was clean. Front desk was courteous and efficient. The bagel barn downstairs has decent food for a quick breakfast. This condo/suite may not be suited for the business traveler who needs many amenities and services but I found everything I needed and more. Also, they had late checkout (noon) and when I went down to checkout I asked them to call a cab to go to the terminal. By the time I checked out (which consisted of giving them my key) a cab was already out front waiting for me. I would definitely stay here again.", "Date": "April 19, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Brunswick, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and very clean!!!!\u201d", "Author": "Madeleine52", "ReviewID": "UR4827343", "Content": "March 17th, 2006 We spent one night at the Fortune House before taking a cruise the next day.

My family was going on a cruise and I needed just one night in Miami. I had never been to Miami before and was already spending a fortune in limos', transportation and decided to stay in downtown Miami for the convience to the Port. After purchasing this thru Hotwire and then reading the reviews, I was horrified but realized that there wasn't anything I could do. I kept on reading more reviews that weren't good so I called Hotwire and spoke with them. They basically said they can't do anything. Great!! A week before our trip another bad reivew so I called the hotel myself and spoke to them about my serious concerns. THen I called hotwire again and this time they said that since I had found 3 different sources with bad reviews, I could cancel my reservation . That's great I said but everything left in Miami is now over $400 and up - no good. I kept the reservation and went down with worry. Upon checkin, they remembered me and my conversation and went overboard trying to be nice. The lobby is beautiful and the place is clean. We had a one bedroom that was clean and no problems at all. The front desk was very helpful with getting taxi's for us and getting us xtra towels and bedding for the pullout couch(that should have been there to begin with). Would I stay here again- probably not but for one night it was certainly fine and the hotel did their best to assure us and make our stay the best it could be.", "Date": "March 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Rooms": "2", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa, Florida", "Title": "\u201cLast resort hotel!\u201d", "Author": "julyernie", "ReviewID": "UR4559318", "Content": "The first night we had a 2 bedroom condo with kitchen that was was void of all utensils etc. Items were requested but we were advised the unit is \"as is\".
