Compared to budget hotels in the USA such as Hampton Inn, Holiday Inn Express, Fairfield Inn, it comes in waaay behind. Don't expect ANY of the little things that you get at one of those hotels, e.g. shampoo!, facial tissues, hand or face towels, two trashcans, free tv (yes, 10 GBP per day to watch regular TV; I didn't do it). Don't bother to ask the front desk for a razor or toothpaste or plug adapter because they will be happy to point you to their vending machine or the store across the street. I was there 4 nights/5 days. I actually enjoyed the breakfast buffet (it is normally 7 GBP per day, $10+ but mine was part of the package). The \"bar\" beer selection was pathetic with no real english beers on tap (Carling?!) but this was not unusual around Excel Centre. People attending Excel are probably on a fixed per diem and can probably find a' better hotel nearby or a short tube ride away for the same price.

We needed to be at ExCel all this time to exhibit at a show. We booked it as it only cost \u00a3404 for 6 nights and other hotels were over \u00a31,000 for the same time frame. I went with very low expectations hoping for at least a comfortable bed and a clean room/bathroom. I was not disappointed, the room was small and box like but to be expected however the bed was comfortable and changed every second day. We needed extra pillows and these were brought to us very quickly. The bathroom is pod like but the power of the water in the shower was great and we never ran out of hot water. One thing is you only get 1 towel per guest so everyday we had to ask for another on returning from Excel for the next day. I like most women need a separate towel for my hair. There were no drawers for keeping underwear in but we soon worked out a system and just kept socks etc in our back pack. The carpet is very lacking in underlay but its clean and you don't go to these hotels to be in the room any longer than sleeping in them. The staff were all polite and attentive none rude as previous reviews we had read. All levels of English were good too. We never ate in the hotel as it was a loud rabble every time we passed through reception. Although we never heard anything when in our room apart from the odd plane. My problem was more with other guests rather than the staff, they were rude and impatient as the lifts are not big nor fast. I would say you will be ok here if you go right to your room then right out in the morning then its fine, all 6 days we were there was some very strange customers and very rude ones. The location is about a 5 min walk from Royal Victoria DLR (other reviewers on here complain of distance) I am not good at walking and I found it acceptable however signage is poor from the DLR to Ibis. We tended to go to Stratford (Westfield) on the DLR to eat at its only \u00a32.60 return off peak and there are 75 restaurants and some fab shops, if you did want central London (mental busy place) then the DLR to bank is easy then pick up the central line.

For example, when I stayed here at the beginning of December 2011 I had a room directly opposite the lifts on the second floor. As I soon as I closed my room door, I heard nothing ..no noise at all from the comings/goings in and out of them. Whilst the room carpets are rough and practical, I was impressed with the bathroom/toilet set-up and how it was encased in it's own pod. Was kept clean and felt clean. Additionally, I found the beds to be big enough for a big chap like me and very comfortable indeed. The compact wardrobe/shelf unit in the corner was also very useful. On the downside, I would avoid the breakfasts and also the wifi provider 'orange' whose service whilst I was there was very very poor. There is the option to use the Ibis cabled internet which comes with TV/Film extras but that is more pricey. I didn't use it so I cannot comment on this service. The staff at the bar and reception were friendly and helpful. Both areas can get pretty busy so patience is required. During my stay the whole world seemed to be staying there !!!

The rooms were ok, there were a few stains on the floor and on the sheets, and the towels we tiny and absolutely threadbare, they didn't even dry my hair let alone the rest of me. But the shower was hot and the bathroom was clean, the television worked and the rooms were a nice temperature. The room wasn't partcularly expensive and generally lived up to my expectations. The DLR was cancelled, obviously this is no fault of the hotel, but not one member of staff could tell me where the nearest bus stop or train station was. I had to wander to the nearest off licence to ask the shop assistant. As a result travelling in and out of London was a nightmare and the replacement bus service was useless, totally unreliable. When I asked for a Havana and coke I was given something totally different, and despite having a bottle of Havana hanging behind the bar, they insisted they didn't have any. Although the staff appeared friendly the language barrier made life a bit difficult. Due to a family emergency I had to leave the hotel in a rush on the Sunday. I left a new jumper at reception when I had to rush for a taxi. 15 minutes after leaving the hotel I realised I had forgotten the jumper. I phoned the hotel and the receptionist confirmed he had found the jumper, he confirmed the style, size, colour and where it was from. I called back during the week a further 9 or 10 times, and asked for someone to call me to confirm a time to pick up the jumper. NOT ONE person called me back, and I ended up with double my usual mobile phone bill from phoning the place! In the end they eventually (after I insisted I speak to the manager)I was told they had lost the jumper. I then got an email from laterooms to say they had actually found the jumper, and to get in touch with them so they could confirm it was mine and send me it. I called a further 3 or 4 times and to my expectation, not a single call back, I also emailed, and only after I complained to laterooms again did someone bother emailing me to say that in fact, they didn't think the jumper they had was mine, and could I confirm (for what felt like the 100th time) the description of the jumper. I did this and have still had no reply. Cutting my losses, even though the jumper was a new angora mix from Marks and Spencers, it cost more than one night in the hotel! I would have still left a reasonable review if they had told me straight away that they were sorry and had lost the jumper. But the way the staff just ignored my calls and requests was really infuriating. I have worked in a hotel and if I had ignored phoneback requests that many times I wouldn't have lasted more than a week. My friend also booked a room here, and there was \"a mix up\" with the bookings, the hotel was full and she had no room (even though she had the confirmation on a piece of paper), they organised for her to stay in another hotel, but the fact that they didn't have a room for her in the first place is testament to how horrendously the hotel is run.

I booked the accommodation way back in June on the internet. On arrival at the hotel I tried to get parked in the hotel car park but it was full so unloaded the family and luggage and got my wife to check in while I stayed with the car. My wife advised me that the check-in process was swift and efficient and that because she had some paperwork that I had printed off prior to leaving, she was called to the front of the express book in queue. I parked the car and on my return to the hotel, made my way up to the fifth floor and located our room. Luckily, our two rooms were not too far apart and on the same floor so we could keep an eye on our daughter and her friend. First impressions of our room were that it was very basic with very little room for us to put our luggage. I was amused at the washroom-from the outside it was a semi-circular type structure with a white door( which dropped upon opening) and was difficult to close fully. If you have used a toilet on a train, then you will recognise the design of this room. Full of cheap looking plastic fittings and not very pretty. The room was air-conditioned but I could not get it to heat the room when it got chilly later in the evening. On the controller, it mentioned the hotel's environmental policy and how the air conditioning was configured to comply with this policy. You should think about your customers, Hotel Ibis, even though I applaud your environmental policy. I was cold and the fact that I could not heat the room disappointed me somewhat. My wife and I decided to eat in the hotel that night and after waiting ages to get some drinks at the bar-there was nobody behind the bar which seems to be a common theme at some hotels-we went in to the restaurant and again had to wait for somebody to come and seat us. The menu had some good food choices and we took some time to decide what we wanted before we placed our order. We had a sharing platter to start with, which was excellent. My wife followed with a fish dish and I chose the slow roast belly pork with a side of fries. When the mains eventually arrived, my pork looked great, with some nice green beans, some rosti cakes and a nice tangy jus. It's a shame though that they had hidden the burnt bits of the pork by turning it upside down on the plate. In places, it looked like it had just been rescued from the crematorium and tasted bitter where the burning was. The other major disappointment was that the side order of fries were only lukewarm and soggy. I did try to attract a waitreses attention, but once the food had been put on the table, nobody seemed to be interested anymore so I didn't succeed in getting either the pork or the fries changed. Also, at the bar there was no visible price list so I had to ask the prices of the draught lagers on offer. Even the staff struggled to find the prices for me. I decided to have a go at the draught Grolsch and to be honest I didn't enjoy it. It didn't taste crisp and fresh as it should do and it wasn't cold enough. And then it was bedtime. I had booked two twin rooms and I was surprised to find my single bed was wobbly-it was like sleeping in a dinghy. Now there is no excuse for this so, Hotel Ibis, you have let yourselves down again. On a more positive note I found the hotel to be a modern looking building, which had been decorated for Halloween.

Far from the center (it takes about 1 hour and switching from DLR to the tube or bus) the Ibis does not live up to the International standards of a 3* hotel. The bathrooms are built in (oddly I might add) with the shower cabin, otherwise pretty good size showers, but since this is a close by the Thames river hotel you can smell it though the drains. Of course the fact that the housekeeping is not doing their job helps a lot too. And not that I didn't announce the front desk about it, because I did, twice, and that's how many times in a week the room got cleaned. Except that, I did get the bed folded. And that's that. For those travelling from outside of UK no matter what you are told, watch out for the payments done. The pre-authorisation in UK will block the money in the account and the seller is allowed to take those at any point within the 30 days. So unless you want to get double charged I strongly suggest you pay when you get there. Our luck was that one of the managers did know that had happened in other cases with visitors from outside of UK and did not charge us twice (Selene thank you - I have to say she was the only one trained for the job, the other front desk attenders knew only the speech to be told). The closet is small and oddly shaped as well, barely room to put clothes for a couple of people staying in for a few days. The noise level is ok, excepting the planes - watch out the London City Airport is too close and has quite a bit of traffic. The positioning of the room may help some but not too much. Overall it was an overpriced hotel for the services rendered. The Breakfast is expensive good thing it's not included, you can manage to eat somewhere else or grab a sandwich on the way. Two supermarkets are close by, Nisa and Spar, strongly suggest the Spar which is further but cheaper plus they do have better offers.

The room also had a desk which was ideal for your laptop and doing a bit of work or planning your next day in the metropol.

My guess would be that as the Olympics approach, that engineering work will become more and more frequent so if buses arent your thing, it might be worth investigation before you book this location.", "Date": "June 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brighton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cI wouldn't recommend it\u201d", "Author": "1elou", "ReviewID": "UR114483357", "Content": "I stayed only one night for a weekend leisure trip at London and wanted something good but not overpriced.

First of all the location is not convenient if you want to do some sightseeing, especially due to maintenance works to DLR at weekends (the underground line that serves this hotel) that means a lot of discomfort regarding transportation. Second, a really bad behavior was about an offer that they refused to provide. In the hotel website there is the statement 'AS AN ISIC CARDHOLDER YOU WILL RECEIVE A FREE BREAKFAST AT ibis' but when I asked they refused. About the room, the view was a wall. Regarding the bathroom amenities, there was only one bath towel and no hand towel. When I called the reception to provide me one towel, they asked me to go downstairs to the reception and collect them myself! In the room there is no hairdryer, not even a cheap basic one, and the situation was the same, go and collect from the reception if you want to use!

We later changed our minds about having the breakfast as we had to leave earlier then expected and therefore we were no longer going to stay for the breakfast and asked for the \u00a315 to be refunded. We were told by reception there was no record on there system that we had paid the \u00a315 and we were asked who checked us in. We told them it was the young girl with long brown hair and she had even given us change, they still said there was no record of the payment in which case she may have pocketed our cash. We then asked to speak to a manager to which we were told there was no manager on site in the hotel and they are unable to refund us as they cannot get in contact with the member of staff that had checked us in. We were given an email address for he manager and we checked out \u00a315 pounds lighter. Food - Ordered a pizza from the bar which was awful and a drink which tasted as if it had past its date. There is one local shop opposite the hotel which is extremely over priced. Parking - This hotel shares its car park with the hotel next door the Novel, on arrival there was an issue with the gate and we had to wait while it operated a one in one out service. Once you check out of the Ibis you have to go to the 1st floor of the hotel next door to pay the \u00a315 pounds overnight fee.

Service was friendly and efficent. whilst waiting we glanced at the food menu, it appeared reasonably priced and the selection was varied. The main areas were clean and well maintained. The alcohol prices were reasonable aswell. Our room was on the 4th floor and right at the end 449. It was clean and comfortable. The bathroom is more of a wetroom. The rooms are budget, but like i say they were clean and comfy. Things like hairdryers are available on request. But tea and coffee are supplied and rooms made up daily. The towels are small and only one pillow is provided. However i am sure if we had asked they would have offered us some more, but we didnt see the need.

The hotel had a lot of business people from the excel centre and school children from abroad. Niether caused us any bother at all. The hotel itself was located about 2mins from the royal victoria stop on the DLR. We bought a day travel card at 8 pounds each and changed at canning town for the tube. Canning town is one stop from Royal Victoria and One stop from the o2. We went into london on both days and it took s about 20 to 30 mins depending on were we were heading. We ate at the o2 on both nights as it has a good selection of bars and resturants. We had no trouble getting about and saw lots of sights. The tube is being upgraded at the weekends so be mindful of this. The bus replacements are frequent but not as quick as the tube. Your travel card will be valid on these. London as usual is pricey but a good getaway. AS for the ibis its a great hotel. Breakfast was buffet style and varied in its selection. The bottom line is i travel frequently and know you go were you can afford. Ibis isnt glitzy or glamourous but it serves its purpose well as a base.

Rooms were being refurbished during our stay, but we weren't affected by noise or paint fumes, even though they were working on the same floor. We were on 7th floor of 8, and there didn't seem to be anyone else on our floor or above us - or at least, we weren't kept awake by noisy neighbours! :-) The room was clean and compact with basic facilities - tv, kettle etc. Unbranded tea & UHT supplied, but no biscuits - this is a 'budget' hotel, after all. Had read on here that they only supply two teabags (this is true) so we brought our own teabags & milk so we could have a cuppa whenever we wanted. Comfy bed, total 3 pillows in the room, 10.5 tog duvet but the window opens enough for fresh air (close to the airport, but the flights don't go at all hours). There's no safe or ironing facilities in the room, and no free wifi throughout the hotel. Bathroom functional, walk-in shower, some sort of showergel provided & a teeny bar of soap at the basin. Main gripe here - the bath towels are really TINY, thin and threadbare. We left them to be changed for our 2nd night in the hope of better ones, but the fresh ones had proper holes in! So to the rest - the hotel bar is small and was very noisy when we stopped by for a pre-dinner drink on the Friday night. We didn't eat in the hotel, so can't comment on food. Locally, there are a few places to eat within very short walking distance. The curry house dished up good food - eventually. Given that the waiter's complete ineptitude from start to finish meant he missed some stuff off the bill, we decided not to complain ;-) The Italian (Zero Seven) would probably have been great on any other night. Unfortunately, there were too many staff on for the number of diners, so we were literally pounced on by various different waiting staff from the moment we sat down until we asked for the bill at the end.

The shower design was one where water tended to collect on the bathroom floor, unfortunately (standing, no bathtub). No major problems with hearing noises from upstairs/other rooms. Small TV had a few UK channels and 1/2 channels from other European nations. The front desk could have been a little more helpful - they did not seem very interested when we showed up to check in, and initially tried to tell us that our stay did not include breakfast (which in fact we did pay for when we booked the room - they later caught their mistake). No such problems at check out. There was a medium-sized supermarket out front which was very convenient and open till fairly late. Other than a few other hotels and the Excel center, there didn't seem to be much else out here.

Room very basic although we had one facing the river with a view of the O2. Clean tidy with tea and coffee facilities - my only complaint was that the bathroom isn't very nice, the door doesn't reach the floor by at least an inch, not very nice if you want a bit of privacy. The breakfast was ok, plenty of cereal variety but the cooked food wasn't very nice, I had beans and they were very salty and I had to leave them. Muffins were very nice though. A basic hotel that does what it says on the tin, wouldn't give more than 3 stars and would not stay there again - even for the price.", "Date": "February 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cNice location, beware the car park charge.\u201d", "Author": "Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR93146286", "Content": "Beware the high car park charge if you use the Novotel car park next to the Ibis. \u00a314 for the night!!

In general the kids were well behaved, but it made it very difficult to get on the hotel computers, breakfast was absolutely packed from about 8-9 every day, and the elevators took forever!

First, the hotel is *extremely remote*. It takes an hour or more to get into central London by light rail and the tube. Next, the rooms are very small, barely sufficient for a solo business traveler and terrible for a family. The hotel is extremely crowded--the lobby, bar and restaurant were packed to overcrowding. The hotel is very loud--it seems to cater to children's tour groups, so we had pre-teens running and yelling down the halls at night. The restaurant's food is poor and the restaurant staff were rude and inattentive. The bathroom doors are so stiff that my 7 year old daughter couldn't get out of the bathroom by herself. We also had problems with the hotel laundry--the first day our laundry wasn't even sent out to be cleaned and the next day one of the garments returned damaged.

If you must stay in this area, check out the other hotels nearby (including a Novotel and a Crowne Plaza). Better yet, stay somewhere more central to London and commute to your meeting. (There are limited restaurant choices, few tourist attractions and limited nightlife near the ExCel/Docklands area. Many more fun places closer to London proper.)", "Date": "July 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "The WIRRAL UK", "Title": "\u201cwell priced hotel in quiet location\u201d", "Author": "HotelValueHunter", "ReviewID": "UR67877286", "Content": "I stay in the London ExCel exhibition and conference centre area at least 2 times a year. I write about all the hotels I stay in on the ExCel complex so I direct you to my user name to get my reviews on the other adjoining hotels I have stayed at. If you are travelling to this hotel on the DLR alight at Royal Victoria (RV) as there are fewer steps to carry luggage up and down. Out of the station across the zebra crossing and at 10 O' Clock is a wide path between the apartment blocks. Walk along this path and you come onto Western Gateway. Turn left and the IBIS comes up on your right hand side after about 250yds. This hotel is fantastic; I find no problem with the room size and the staff friendly. My room was cleaned everyday to my satisfaction and on checking in I asked for a room with a view of the dock and my request was granted. From reading other reports I think people are expecting too much for the room rate you pay. I have now stayed here 8 times in 5 years with nothing to really complain about (except small bath towels, and small ironing boards in the ironing rooms). The restaurant food is basic fayre but good value. I calculated the cheapest 3 course meal with a 0.5L bottle of still mineral water would cost about \u00a315 per person. Bar service does get people very frustrated in this IBIS but the secret is to stay at this hotel and use the bar in the sister hotel Novotel right next door. The Novotel has a far superior bar but the prices are only about 20p dearer per pint. The Novotel has floor walkers, so once you have your seat the floor walker will take your order at your table and bring you your drinks. You just then settle up one bill at the end of your visit. You cannot charge the Novotel bar bill to your IBIS hotel room, which is the only real drawback. As they are part of the same hotel chain I do not see this as a big problem to sort out. This would benefit A-Club members to ensure they maximise their points earned from these two ACCOR hotels. If staying for a while, there are two convenience stores (SPAR, NISA) to get your hotel room supplies along Western Gateway. There are lots of eateries around the IBIS hotel and I found the quickest way to know where they all are is to pop into the ExCel centre next to the IBIS and get the free local restaurant guide from the information desk. The ExCel venue is open even if no events are happening and contains Coffee Bars and Newspaper/sweet shops and free cash machines. If you are staying at one of the on-site hotels this is a great bonus to be able to use these facilities. If you want a cheap light breakfast rather than pay hotel prices a bacon sandwich costs around \u00a33 and there are plenty of tables and chairs down the main wide central isle to sit at and relax. I have also come across a WEB site which will be useful if you are staying at this hotel and visiting central London to see the sights. It is walkit.co.uk this site shows you the quickest walking route between two locations. If you are visiting London for the sights start your walking journey at Westminster Tube on the Jubilee line (change at Canning Town on the DLR). All the sites can be walked from here. walkit is a great site for seeing London on foot.", "Date": "June 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wimborne", "Title": "\u201cAn Experience\u201d", "Author": "lucydepper", "ReviewID": "UR67580875", "Content": "My partner and I booked into the hotel as we were visiting the o2 areana that evening.

Since there were 300 kids staying in the hotel that night, and we had similar schedules, many times, I would have to wait more than five minutes for the elevator, or lift, I guess, to come to my floor. And by the time I got on the lift, more and more people would try to stuff themselves in and the just the trip going downstairs was terrible. Everyday, I had to take the stairs (WHICH ARE NOT EASY TO CLIMB UP AND DOWN!) so I often had a workout, even though I don't really need one... The rooms are TERRIBLY small, smallest I had ever seen. I think my college's dorm room will be bigger than what I saw! There are up to two beds in there and if you have a third guest, you can have a fold out bed near the window. The TV's quite small too with not too many channels (not interesting ones, too). Overall, the room was clean. The restroom (or washroom, I guess) was ALSO VERY SMALL! I remember how difficult it was to just go to the washroom...The weird door with NO LOCK (very very bad...I remember one of my roommates intruded on another still inside the washroom without knocking and my other roommate got really mad) and I remember the shower was weird, too. Oh yes, I remember; the shower cover was very weird with HOLES in it! so if the shower accidentally sprayed outwards, even with the shower cover there, the water can spray on the washroom floor! I remember the room floor was all wet when I stepped out! Another thing, there's no bath tub and the shower floor is almost flat, so the water can run under the shower cover and go on the washroom floor. The washroom, however, was also clean. It's nice that the London Underground is so closeby the hotel, which is perfect for anyone who is visiting. ESPECIALLY business people who are always on the go! It takes maybe 2-3 minutes to walk to the station. This hotel is probably the best for business people, since the rooms are so small, they look like they should house only one person. The one thing I hate about this hotel is no free wi-fi internet connection! But what I loved is that there's a free phone you can use downstairs! At least it was free when I was there. But the lines for the phone were long for me, especially since we were ALL from outside the country. Still great for business people always making calls! Breakfast is not bad, but you get very sick of it. I hated croissants after that.

A couple of posters gave me the heads up on the Ibis Excel and after checking its reviews on here I decided to go ahead and book it. I just got back today! I visited London with my 11 year old son for a respite break from fostering, we were looking for a hotel to use as a base after busy days sightseeing. The hotel is situated at the Docklands which initially seems a bit of a way out from Central London, but once you get on the jubilee line its a straight ride through to Canning Town and then just one stop on the DLR to Royal Victoria. you need a travel card to cover zones 1 to 3. The hotel is a 5 minute walk from th DLR, exit the station take a right and then follow the road as it bears around to the left its right next to the Excel centre (i put the directions down because we couldnt find it when we got off the DLR and wandered around nervously for a bit and there were loads of workmen around as the area near the DLR is under development) The hotel was just \u00a355.00 a night and so for 4 nights we only paid \u00a3220.00. It was half term as well and so we expected it to cost more. (Breakfast not included \u00a35.50 for adults and half for children under 11) The first impression was good, the hotel was clean, the carpets/floor, the tables, the bar was well stocked and the waiting area was bustling with life as many guests sat around comfortably having a drink and having a laugh. The hotel reception staff were very friendly and helpful which put me at immediate ease as this was the first time I had travelled to London for fun rather than on business or training. We were served quickly and efficiently and given directions to our room, which was a bit small but was situated on the 3rd floor and had an amazing view of the waterfront. (the morning views were amazing) The bathroom was spacious and the shower was huge and very powerful. The bathroom was very clean also. Tea and coffe faciilities in the room as standard.. The double bed was comfortable and there was a single bed in the room too. There was sufficient wardrobe space but not enough storage space for our cases which ended up on either side of the bed which was a bit inconvenient, but not major at all! The rooms were cleaned well each day and re stocked with all facilities. We ordered food from the bar on one night only because the restaurant said it would be 40 minutes as they were so busy, but the service at the bar was good, if a touch pricey. \u00a37.50 for a v small margherita pizza. Drinks were overpriced too \u00a31.80 for a tiny glass of coke, seemed less than a regular 330ml cans worth! overall we were very pleased with the Ibis Excel and decided that it was a good value stay and the next time we went to London we would definately book there. (top tip, make sure you leave over an hour travelling time to get back to Kings Cross, we only just made our train this morning as there's such a long journey back to central London.", "Date": "February 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "East Kilbride", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "kylieclyde", "ReviewID": "UR12429403", "Content": "Me and my sister stayed here for one night as we were down to see the Spice Girls :) It was a great hotel to stay in but we only stayed for one night, i might feel a bit different if it was 4 or 5 days as the rooms are quite small. They were clean and the view from our room was amazing, right on the water. The staff were ok, we were asking how to get to Madame Tussauds and they didnt have a clue what i was on about so ended up having to look up the net ourselves but managed to get the directions to the tube from them, which was only 5 minutes away! We got an all day ticket for the tube for \u00a35 which got us to madame tussuds and the o2 arena. We tried to phone a taxi company but they were going to charge \u00a330 to get there and back to and from the o2 arena. The area around the hotel seemed like a ghost town there was nobody about anywhere. The bars that were near the hotel where empty. I think this may be the time of year that we went as everybody would have left after the new year. We got 2 diet cokes from the bar before we went to bed and it cost \u00a33.50 so god knows what the alcoholic drinks cost! The breakfast was great you can take as much as you want from a large choice of fruit, yoghurts, bread, meat, baguettes, croissants, muffins, tea & coffee. The only thing that really worried me was when we were leaving we asked the receptionist to call us a taxi. When the taxi arrived it was unmarked and there was no meter in the car so i think it was an unlicensed cabbie.... not a good move as we are two young girls travelling alone!

Downside, staff were unhelpful and in some cases frankly rude. There is one public computer in the 'business centre' and as I experienced at another Ibis hotel in London, Internet access is easy only if you're affiliated with the Orange telecommunications group.

A friend of mine works that exhibition and booked an extra room and offered it to me, even at no cost it was disgusting. I am shocked to read some of these reviews as it was the most appalling experience I ever had in my life. In fact as guests walked down this was consistently the talk on the lifts (elevators) and all public areas, namely how appalling the place was. The hotel staff were rude, not just unfriendly or unhlepful but outright rude. The rooms were so basic it was frightening. As you enter it smells musty or something, then you realise that your bed is two small beds on a wood frame that is half the size of a normal single. the mattress is thin, almost like they would issue in a jail or at a summer camp. The sheets dirty (place a dot with a pen on your pillow and sheets the first day and you will see them until you leave. The shower is clean but the entire bathroom is a cubicle built into the room. Water fluctuates so you may have it on hot and get a burst of cold and adjust it hotter then get burnt, I complained but this went unanswered. They give you two towels that are somewhere between hand and body towels, very odd. Almost none of their staff has a true fluid prooficiency of English, most being imported from France, and the service is reminiscent of being in the worst sections of Paris. They claim to offer wifi yet when I paid and did not get and used it and it went out, FOUR times, they not only would not call the company on a free phone number for me, but they did and put through to my room later to charge me a pound for each of the four calls, I was astounded. If you are the camping/trailer type then this may be acceptable for you, but if you need to stay in accomodations more than what you would expect a jail to offer, by all means go spend the extra 30 pounds a night and stay at the stellar hotels nearby like the sister Novotel and the Crowne Plaza both of which are fabulous and offer great service and nice rooms.
