Overall, this hotel is not a top class business hotel compared to some of the other options in the area. We got off to a bad start by having to wait 45 minutes for the shuttle from Pearon to pick us up. It never did appear (every other major hotel in the airport area had their shuttles picking up guests at the designated area), so we jumped on the Marriott's shuttle and walked over from that hotel. Which was ironic, given that we usually stay at the Marriott but had decided to try the Westin this trip. Check in was fine. Staff offered up a half hearted apology about the shuttle, but still managed to place the blame on us, saying we needed to call first. Room was OK at best. Leaking tap (leaking up through the hot water faucet onto the vanity), loose shower head and various minor repair issues, but nothing outrageous. In general, there is a feel of disrepair throughout the common areas of the hotel. The lobby features a lot of brass fixtures, but nobody has polished them seemingly for months. The doors of the elevators have not seen the working end of a cleaning brush for eons. Again, nothing to make you go running out into the streets with your hair on fire, but not up the business class hotel standards. Staff at the breakfast restaurant were outstanding.

He had in his hands a little space heater (VERY UNSAFE!) and told me they only have a/c in the hotel (IN TORONTO???) and that I would need to use the space heater for heat.

We didn't have any trouble finding good parking spaces as some of the other reviewers noted, but this may have just been good luck on our part. The parking is outdoors, which can be a negative in the winter depending on weather. The room and bathroom were very clean and well kept. The bed was comfortable and the Westin \"Heavenly Bath\" was great as usual. The room featured a floor-to-ceiling window overlooking the city. We were given a room on the 14th floor so the view was amazing. The stay was great overall. The only minor issue we had was that our wakeup call came 30 minutes late. We were already up so it didn't affects us, but given this is an airport hotel, you should be able to count on the call. Overall, we would recommend the hotel for airport travel.

The only thing keeping this from being a 5-star review from me is that the hotel website states that check-out time is 1:00pm, while the hotel itself has it listed as 12:00pm. When we asked the front desk what the check-out time is, they said 12:00.
