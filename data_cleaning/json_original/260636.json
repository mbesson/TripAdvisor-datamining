The hotel is in the exact standards of Campanile network. Way better than Ibis or Etap, but for the same prices. It is very confortable and very clean. Tha bathrooms are also very nice (unlike the pre-mounted small bathrooms of Ibis hotels, for example) Everything has been refurbished and redesigned (furniture, flat screen TV, etc.). The breakfast is modest, but good enough (at 60-70 E/night in Barcelona, one shouldn't expect Novotel or higher standards). The prices are very good. The value for the money is excellent. One should know that this accommodation is suitable for people having their own car (personal or rented). From the highway it is very easy to reach, and for visiting Barcelona, one can either drive to the closest subway station and park there, or drive right to the heart of the city, but then the parking fees will be much higher. I stayed with my wife for 3 nights (we came from Alicante by car) and for us it was a very convenient stay (easy to reach, low price, and easy to reach the city). I stayed in Campanile hotels also in Paris and in Cannes. Each time it was a very good choice. So I would strongly recommend this hotel to people looking to spend less money on hotels, but still to have a confortable stay, but they MUST have a car.", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Poznan", "Title": "\u201cGood, if you're traveling by car\u201d", "Author": "RomanSad", "ReviewID": "UR76526740", "Content": "Hotel is located far from the city center, close to the highway (although I had a problem to get there by car).

Not so here. Despite their stated child policy, this was completely ignored by the staff and we were told that we would have to take another room for our 2 year old and 5 year old. In fact, although it still states on their own website that an extra bed is added at no charge, we were told that they only had rooms for two people maximum and were simply turned away. The location is, in principle, very convenient. It's just beside an excellent shopping centre and we had planned on staying there for a shopping trip. However, it's virtually impossible to get into the hotel or indeed shopping centre as there are no signs at all from the motorway that most people will be travelling on. We spent over an hour going backwards and forwards along the motorways which surround the area before we found (by chance) a way in. Consequently, it's no surprise that the hotel was almost empty even in the peak of the holiday season as I'm sure many people just give up trying to reach it. Unless you're very familiar with the road layout around Baricentro where the hotel is, it's not worth booking as you'll probably not manage to reach it.", "Date": "August 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pontevedra", "Title": "\u201cA little bit decepted\u201d", "Author": "magari91", "ReviewID": "UR4985647", "Content": "We spent Easter at this Barcelona hotel & when we arrived we quickly realised that this 3 star hotel is quite much like a 1 star cheap roadway motel. A little bit decepted but what can you expect for 60\u20ac a night. The only good thing it had is that domestic animals were admitted. The restaurant & caf\u00e9 is far much expensive for what it really offers so it is better visiting the chinese buffet lunch in the shopping centre right next to the hotel because for around 10 \u20ac you cant eat as much as you want. If you are visiting Barcelona without a car NO NOT book this hotel, also by car it is very far from city centre & the worst thing are the indications to Barber\u00e1 del Valles (hotel's location) from the city centre (it is really difficult to get to the hotel) If you are going to visit Barcelona book in advance a hotel in the city centre you will surely appreciate it.", "Date": "April 18, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Surrey, England", "Title": "\u201cCheck you location carefully\u201d", "Author": "EleanorK", "ReviewID": "UR4067356", "Content": "I wish I had read previous reviews more carefully, as the description given of the local amenities and transport links were very misleading. The Hotel itself is good value for money, and the staff helpful - but the location is terrible. The nearby bars, cafes and restaurants are in a soul less shopping centre which shuts at 10 pm every night - not very Spanish! The Hotel is also located near to a motorway so there is a lot of traffic noise. Worst of all is the journey into Barcelona itself. A 20 minute bus journey, and the bus only runs every hour, (the last bus back to the Hotel from the station is at 9.40 pm), then a 30 minute train to the centre of the City.

When booking it we were given the impression that it was convenient to the city centre - it sooooo isn't. You have to take a train to the city of valles (better part of 1Hr) and then catch a bus to the hotel (another 20mins) from outside the train station. The train journey is long. The bus does not run at night, on Sundays or on Feast Days..... We ended up paying more on taxis than we would have if we booked a more expensive hotel closer to the city centre. Although the hotel itself is of an average standard, I would not recommend it to anybody (unless you have a car) as a base for visiting the city of Barcelona. Its just too far out.
