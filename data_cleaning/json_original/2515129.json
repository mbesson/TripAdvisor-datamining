Our standard room on the 1st floor was nicely presented, small (aren't they all in Paris?) but not too small and had a nice bathroom. However, our room was hot and the air conditioning console in the room didn't seem to work. We raised this issue with two different staff members and neither fixed the problem (they were friendly enough...just didn't fix the issue). We couldn't open the windows at night because the street below was noisy (with the windows shut it was very quiet) so had two rather stuffy nights in our room. It wasn't unbearable, just slightly uncomfortable.

Each time had exceptional service. This is what I mean. The first time I traveled to Paris, I was alone and was robbed late Saturday afternoon (when all banks and post offices were closed) before I was scheduled to leave the following day. The hotel front desk clerk LOANED ME 100 Euros for food and taxi to get to the airport. Unbelievable! Since I felt I was still getting my bearings when I made the second trip to Paris, I stayed with my friends at Left Bank--St Germain again. I LOVE the location--near Odeon Metro, near Seine, near Louvre, so close to everything. I especially enjoyed opening my window onto the street late one Friday night in May, seeing the couples walking arm-in-arm up and down the sidewalk. And this may seem silly, but I love the name of the street--Rue De L'Ancienne Comedie. So, for all of the above reasons, when my husband and I decided to honeymoon in Paris, I chose MY hotel again, but this time, we booked the suite. Imagine a December dusk in Paris, temperatures in the upper forties. From one side of the suite we can see the Eiffel Tower; the opposite side we have our window open--cool, fresh air. We have a clear view of Notre Dame, but even more wonderful, we can hear the Notre Dame bells chiming across the city. I will never forget that moment. From our hotel window on New Year's Eve, we could see all the fireworks and lights at the Eiffel Tower celebration while we comfortably toasted in our room and had our first kiss in the new year. Have to mention Sinan--the hotel desk clerk. What a wonderful young man. So helpful to us in every way. This is MY hotel.

It is the first time we have visited Paris and I had researched many hotels in many locations before we left. For first time visitors who wanted to be close to attractions, cafes, shops and metro stations we found St Germain Des Pres to be the best location and Hotel Left Bank the best hotel option. We were really impressed with our hotel room. It was small and cosy with a lovely bathroom including a bath. It looked exactly as the picture on the web site showed (which doesn't always happen). We arrived on a very chilly Paris day to find a beautifully warm room with a very comfortable bed, the staff had put the towel warmer so we had toasty warm towels ready for us - much appreciated after a 30 hour flight from Australia! The area of St Germain des pres is a wonderful, safe area full of cafes, small specialty shops and galleries. It was a real treat to wander through its little streets during the day, but what really suprised us is how the streets come alive in the evening. The atmosphere nearly every night of the week was really exciting and fun. We always felt really safe walking the streets in the evening and using the metro was safe, easy and inexpensive. The hotel is in walking distance from Notre Dame, Jardin du Luxembourg, Louvre, Seine River and if you're keen for a big walk or jog, the eiffel tower. There are so many cafes around the Hotel Left Bank, we had breakfast in a different cafe everyday for the 8 days of our stay, they were all lovely, staff friendly, nice and so helpful with the language (most people were more than happy to speak to us in English even though I could speak a little French). If I was ever lucky enough to go back to Paris I would absolutely stay at Hotel Left Bank again - thank you to all the staff, we had a perfect stay!

Standard rooms looked tiny for the supplementary beds offered and suites were expensive. When we finally found what we needed, it was a triple room in Hotel Left Bank. Larger than a standard room, it had a comfortable, full-sized third bed in a separate area. Nicely decorated, it reminded us of the interior of renaissance ch\u00e2teaux. The bathroom was also large by Paris standards, offering a double vanity and a full-size bathtub with shower. Everything looked recently renovated and was in perfect working condition, except the elevator, which broke down twice in five days. We found a non-refundable deal for this room on booking.com and the hotel tried to charge our credit card immediately. Unfortunately, the fraud detection system at the credit card company considered this transaction suspicious and denied it. The hotel then emailed us asking for another card, but never tried to use it, instead a few days later notified us that it has cancelled our reservation. It took several phone calls to booking.com, the hotel, and the credit card company to finally sort things out. If I came across a similar deal again, I\u2019d definitely call the credit card company first. The hotel has a great location, at a short walking distance to the river Seine, Place Saint-Michel, Ile-de-la-Cit\u00e9, Notre-Dame, Saint-Chapel, Boulevard Saint-Germaine, and the Luxemburg gardens. The two great museums, Louvre and Orsay, are somewhat farther, but still within comfortable walking distance. We even walked with our six year old back from the Eiffel tower, following the banks of the river and then Boulevard Saint-Germaine; a very nice, but long walk. The metro station (Odeon) is just steps away and there are plenty of restaurants, bars and cafes nearby. It is a touristy area of Paris, where you are just as likely to meet fellow travelers as locals. Since we like researching hotels before we go, we rarely have surprises. This time, we had a pleasant one. We\u2019ve expected a standard continental breakfast, little more than coffee, baguette and butter and were pleasantly surprised that there was a much better variety of food, including cold cuts, cheeses, yoghurts, and cereals. We didn\u2019t rate this hotel the usual way, by comparing it to other hotels we\u2019ve stayed in. Central Paris hotels are a category of their own, with high prices and tiny rooms with windows often opening to dark interior courtyards. Public spaces are cramped, if they exist at all, and hotels offer few services. It would perhaps make sense to compare it to other Paris hotels, but while we have been to Paris before, we don\u2019t have that much personal experience with Paris hotels. We gave this hotel top rating because after hours of research online, it was the best we could find for our needs: a comfortable triple room within our price range in a good location.", "Date": "May 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAbsolument the archetypal Parisian experience!\u201d", "Author": "SojournerTraveller", "ReviewID": "UR108307779", "Content": "Accompanying sister and sister-in-law for their first ever weekend in Paris, I decided we could do with a little more elegance and old world Parisian atmosphere than the usual small hotel in St Germain des Pres I have stayed in since my student days.

We love this hotel and would definately stay again. It is the best location with easy walks to so many sights, and so many excellent cafes and restaurants. Shopping is great, metros are close and it's just a great area for us. The receptionists are all friendly with some being very friendly, and are all helpful, with some being very helpful. They kept mail for us and booked a couple of restuarants for us. We had emailed them asking them to book a shuttle from the airport for us, but this didn't turn up and when we phoned the shuttle company they said that there was no shuttle booked for us. Not sure who was at fault but it was inconvenient and the taxi we had to catch was almost triple the cost of the shuttle. Also on the morning we left, we had asked the receptionist to book a taxi to the station, and she had said to check out with 20 minutes to spare for her to call the taxi. Well, it actually took 50 minutes for the taxi to arrive and if I hadn't planned on arriving at the station so early, we would have missed our train. I think that pre-booking the night before would make me feel better. The double on the 6th floor, is very spacious by French hotel standards and has a great view of Notre Dame. We used the free wifi both in our room and in the lobby. The bathroom was great with a shower over the bath. In a perfect world the towels would be bigger and whiter but that never seems to happen anywhere. The breakfast is more than adequate, with juice and hot drinks, cold meat and cheeses, friut, cereals, boiled eggs and plenty of pastries and cakes. We have no complaints at all about the breakfast, and it certainly is enough to sustain you for hours. On the morning we arrived, our room wasn't ready but we were able to store our luggage, and we were then offered coffee and tea, which we accepted. It came with a basket of pastries and croissants, and we were not charged for this first breakfast, which was very nice.

We wanted a central place to stay, that was safe so Saint Germain was at the top of the list and so was this hotel. The hotel is very French from its exterior to the room we had. We had a triple which was a longer room than normal ones. The decor was awesome!!! You knew you were in Paris by staying here. I loved the motif they had that was in the room, the way the room was set out and the furniture that was in it. It was just so french and everything you want to have a Parisian feeling on a trip to Paris. I loved it!! The breakfast was really nice, you got Croissants each morning as well as toast, cereal etc. It was a great way to start the day. There is alot of Nutella too, which i have always loved so that was a bonus each morning. They would also cook eggs for you if you wanted them. The hotel is central. It is a few streets down from the Pont Des Art Bridge which is my favourite bridge in Paris and was used in the last episode of Sex and the City. The Louvre is not far from this bridge on the other side of the Seine and Notre Dame is probably 20 min walk from the hotel. The Eiffel Tower is a 10min drive which is all the way on the other side of Paris compared to where the Louvre is but we took a taxi and were there quite quickly. It really is the best area to stay in Paris. We walked around Paris which you should do here so Saint Germain was a good place to begin that walk. There are alot of cafes, restaurants that we ate at which were really nice right around the corner. And souvenirs a plenty in the same strip. There was also a lovely jewelry shop on the corner that we bought a few things from and it was cheap enough. The only downside we had was on checking out. The cleaner one day of the 4 nights we stayed said we had taken bottles of coke out of the snack bar, because my friends had empty bottles on their nightstands from the day before. We knew we didnt take anything out of there so reception waived it so we didnt have to pay which was good. it just made me wonder how do they check when someone uses the snacks in the room, do they check it is full each morning?? Or just go by what you have sitting in the room like what we did and assume you have taken something that's in there?? It wasnt a big issue for us and was resolved immediately so i would gladly stay here again next time i am in Paris regardless of this.

Paper-thin doors and walls with no insulation made it seem that everyone who got off the elevator was actually standing in our room. I asked about the \u2018sound-proofing\u2019 that is advertised on their website and was told that yes, it is being done, but no, it is not possible to achieve much of a result due to the age of the building. We think the owners would be wise to replace the doors and insulate around them as this may help with some of the noise.

In fact, we even got down to granularity in the French language as I called it \u2018construcion\u2019 and he called it merely \u2018travail\u2019 or light work. I would have felt so much better if we had been offered a discount on our next stay at the hotel, or given some other type of compensation, as a matter of goodwill. The attitude, however, was one of \u2018tant pis\u2019 or \u2018too bad.\u2019 Consequently, I spent the rest of the time stopping at other boutique hotels and touring their rooms, so that we have a shortlist for our next stay there. \u2018Tant pis!\u2019 NOTE: Our room (#205) was 4 feet from the elevator.

We were six people in total - four adults, a teenager and a toddler - and we stayed together in the suite on the sixth floor. This room was an amazing find - we paid 300 euros per night (booked directly with the hotel) for all of us in a really perfect location. The room rate also includes free breakfast, which we found rather unimpressive (but free, unlike many Paris hotels) as well as free wireless internet - but the signal didn't reach the sixth floor so we ended up sitting in the lobby or on the stairs. The suite itself was really perfect, and entirely unique in this central location (it was the only place we found that could accomodate all of us). The suite is divided into two rooms: the \"bedroom\", which has a permanent double bed, pullout single bed, armchair and desk, and the \"living area\" which has a couch that converts into two single beds, several small tables and chairs, and a minibar. The bathroom is clean and fairly spatious. We also had a baby crib set up in the living area, and the room was not overly crowded. There is a view of Notre Dame out the window of the bedroom, and a partial view of the Eiffel tower out the window of the living room. Everything was clean and the decor was nice (there are photos on the hotel web site). Service at the hotel was rather mixed - some of the front desk staff were quite friendly, while others were borderline rude. The breakfast staff were all generally rather rude.

I then realized that our room shared a common wall with the restaurant next door, Le Procope. The noise we were experiencing was from a party at the restaurant.

This was our last night and we had to leave early the next day to fly home, or I would have called to see if we could change rooms.

I kept putting off booking a hotel for my trip to Paris because everything is either ridiculously expensive or poorly reviewed. I then stumbled upon the Best Western Left Bank on LastMinute.com. The reviews were good, and the Best Western website had a decent deal: approximately 800 euros for three nights including tax. We booked it a week before our trip and hoped for the best. My boyfriend and I like luxury, but we weren't willing to spend thousands of dollars. Overall, I was pleased and would stay again if I was traveling to Paris on a budget. The positives: 1. The staff was very polite and helpful, and all (at the front desk) spoke perfect English. There was a problem with my credit card, and rather than canceling the reservation, they quickly contacted me and helped resolve it. They also helped us arrange our transportation back to the airport since there was a strike the day we left. 2. The room was small, but spacious for Paris--and very clean. It had a large, comfortable bed, full-size desk, and plenty of room for two to move around without feeling claustrophobic. It had a nice window that opened over a small courtyard. 3. The bathroom was a good size, and large for Paris. It had a glass wall and real shower, rather than just a tub like many Paris hotels. The toiletries weren't very good, but that's a non-issue for me as I like to bring my own. 4. GREAT location. It's in the artsy Left Bank, close to the Sorbonne and many (less expensive) bars and cafes. I wish we had explored the bar scene more, actually, but we were often tired from long days of sightseeing. It's also very close to a Metro line (Saint Michel) and a quick walk to many of the main attractions, like the Pompidou and Notre Dame. You can take a leisurely walk to the Champs Elysees and Eiffel Tower, or easily take the Metro. There's also a fantastic bakery across the street with pain au chocolate for 1 euro! 5. Free wireless in the common areas AND guest rooms. (You have to sign up for an account, but it's still free.) A couple complaints: 1. DON'T GET YOUR LAUNDRY DONE HERE. It's a total rip off. We spent over 70 euros cleaning two men's shirts, two men's undershirts, a pair of women's pants, and a handful of underwear/boxers. It turns out they took it to a nearby launderer; I'm sure we could have taken it ourselves for one fourth of the price. 2. They lock the main door after about 10 or 11pm, and you have to ring the doorbell to have the doorman come get you. It's never a major problem nor wait, but it's a little bit irritating if you like to stay out late in Paris! 3. There's no outdoor space. Considering the prices in Paris, we would have appreciated a garden or rooftop in which to enjoy cheap champagne and cheese from the grocery store. The courtyard was pleasant to look at, but there was no way to access it. The indoor space was small and very old-fashioned Paris, but pleasant enough. Overall, the hotel was great and I have no major complaints. I'd stay again, although next time I would probably splurge a bit more on the hotel and plan to get some groceries rather than eating all my meals out.

We had walked by the BW a few times (our original hotel was just 2 blocks away) and it looked quite nice, too too big and with some style. We walked in on Sat morning, explained the situation, and they could not have been nicer -- showed us to a very large \"superior\" room on an interior courtyard, very quiet, and very cool. We grabbed it, and with continental breakfast included, plus free internet and a computer in the lobby, it was barely 20 euros more per night than the tiny, hot room we had before. The hotel is tastefully furnished, admittedly the style is a bit more \"chain\" hotel than we usually prefer, but it was very nice, very clean, and very comfortable. Next time we might opt for a room facing the front of the hotel, so that you could have the benefit of a bit of a view and little more light, but we were totally focused on quiet and airconditioning after 3 nights of heat and noise.

No large king size beds, no sitting rooms in your room, no whirlpool bath, no chocolate mint on your pillow. No lounge room or bar, no restaurant in hotel. But you get a very nice, comfortable, quiet, air-conditioned, clean, and safe place to rest after a long day of tourism, for a reasonable price by Paris standards.

Staff is minimal, two, at most three, people at the front desk during the day plus cleaning and service personnel, but all are courteous and most staffers speak English. Night staff consists of a single person at the front desk. Breakfast, generally included in the daily rate, is very nice. Enough choices to satisfy most appetites and to give you a great morning start. Generally served until around 11am \u2013 if memory serves.

As has been oft repeated in the reviews here the location is superb. You're in the heart of St. Germain, just south of the Quartier Latin, and a pleasant walk from Ile de la Cite and even the Louvre. When it came to dining we never had to venture very far. Our days began with the very generous and statisfying included breakfast at the hotel. Our days ended with meals at the many different restaurants in the immediate area. On the hotel side of Boulevard St. Germain, just up the road from the hotel we ate at Alcazar which was an excellent Parisian brasserie with a modern touch and also at Le Procope, also a brasserie but more traditional in style, which is literally next to the hotel. On the other side of the Boulevard we ate at Les Editeurs and the Horse's Tavern. Of the four I'd have to say that the best was Les Editeurs. We also wanted to try Le Comptoir across from Les Editeurs but it's a veritable dining hot spot with local folks lined up out the door waiting for one of the restaurants few tables every night we were there. I suspect it would have claimed top spot had we been able to partake. There's an excellent boulangerie across from the hotel and Carrefour market just up the road and around the corner where we could stock up on water, juice, fruits, cheese and pretty much everything else. It was a great place to put together picnic lunches that we enjoyed in the Luxembourg and Tuileries gardens. The Odeon metro stop is a super short walk away and can take you East-West on the 10 (which is a direct line to the Tour Eiffel) and North-South on the 4 which can bring you directly and quickly to Montparnasee or Chatelet/Les Halles from which you can easily connect to virtually all of Paris. From the two metro lines you can directly reach three of Paris' large train stations: Gare du Nord (which goes to the main Roissy airport), Gare de l'Est and Gare d'Austerlitz. Taking all that in to consideration the location of the hotel is superb. The staff were very cordial and the rooms were traditionally appointed. We had a standard Rue de l'Ancienne facing room and as has been said here, the lively evening street sound was never a noise problem. The bathroom was standard size. Space wise mentally prepare for smaller European living dimensions relative to North American hotels. As much as I try to do so, I seem to always be a little taken aback at the living space adjustment.

My wife and two teenage daughters spent two nights. We had some difficulty finding a hotel in Paris that could accommodate four people in one room, but Room 06 at the BW Left Bank fit the bill. Room 06 had a nice Parisian feel, especially after having spent four nights at the Le Meridien Montparnasse which was more of an American style hotel. Room 06 was on the first floor and very close to the front desk and the breakfast area. It was very quiet. The room had three permanent beds (two put together to create the equivalent of a queen size bed and one twin size bed built into an alcove against the wall). The fourth bed was a portable bed that was brought in. The room also had a desk and chair. As a result there was not much floor space left but it was more than sufficient since we did not spend much time in the room. The bathroom was very large for a Paris hotel with a marble floor and vanity. It had a bath tub with a hand held shower head with an attachment on the wall for a hands-free shower (no shower curtain however). A breakfast buffet was included in the price of the room and open from 7-10am. It was more than sufficient... basket of breads/croissants, meats, cheeses, toast, yogurt, fruit, cereals, coffee, juices. The location was excellent. It was just a few steps from St Germain Blvd and its numerous brasseries/cafes/shops and the Odean metro stop. It was a bit tricky finding Rue de l'Ancienne Com\u00e9die coming out of the Odean stop the first time since there are a number of streets that come together at this point on St Germain Blvd. But we eventually found it. The hotel is within easy walking distance to Notre Dame. The service (front desk and breakfast attendant) was understated and reserved. All of our requests were met and questions answered sufficiently. The only negatives were the hot water ran out the second night when our daughters were taking showers, the shower did not have a curtain so the floor got a bit wet when showering, and the mattresses were a bit firmer than I would have preferred.

We have visited Paris numerous times and love the 6th Arrondissement, (St-Germain/Luxembourg.) I had several hotels in mind, but settled on the Hotel Left Bank, which offered some great rates. This hotel belongs to the Best Western chain, but you won't find anything resembling what we think of with this chain in the US. It's located at 9 rue de l'Ancienne Comedie, which is near the very popular intersection of several streets which join together, where there are numerous cafe's, restaurants and stores for fresh breads and pastries. The hotel is small and very charming. The people working at the front desk were very friendly and helpful. Our room was small, but the norm for Paris and the bathroom had a full bathtub with the hand held shower which could be attached to hang overhead. The room was clean with a queen bed, desk and chair, wardrobe and small refrigerator with the TV sitting on top. The bed linens were crisp and the bed was very comfortable. The hotel is also equiped with WiFi. Our room overlooked the main street, which was pretty noisy all night long if you opened the window, but when it was closed, you couldn't hear a thing. Our only complaint was that the room was pretty warm and we really needed to open the window for cooler air at times, but couldn't sleep once the window was open. We were there the first week in March, so this may not be a problem during other months or you should ask for a room at the back of the hotel. The breakfast was pretty norm for most European hotels, but the breakfast room was very nice and the lady working there made sure we had coffee, tea and fresh breads. There were also hard boiled eggs, cheese and meats, along with cereal. You can ask for scrambled eggs, but will pay extra for them. We would stay at this hotel again and feel you simply can't beat the location. It's only a block from the Odeon Metro Station and you can walk to almost everything, and we did.", "Date": "March 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cLeft Bank Best Western: Service Issues\u201d", "Author": "wheeltravelerToronto", "ReviewID": "UR26654964", "Content": "We have just returned from a 3 night stay at the Best Western on the Left Bank. We looked for days on line for a room that provided wheelchair access and would accommodate 3 people. Almost all hotels required that we rent a second room which would have made our already expensive stay in Paris even more so. The Left Band hotel provided a triple room with wheelchair access for 240 Euros. First, the highlights. This hotel is ideally located, minutes from Notre Dame, the Louvre, the banks of the Seine and in the middle of small streets filled with sidewalk cafes, art stores and boutiques--a quintessentially Parisian experience. The hotel does not at all recall the hotel chain of North America; rather, it looks like a small Parisian boutique hotel. The breakfast included with the price was provided in a small cozy room. We enjoyed the breakfast and appreciated the service provided by the women responsible for this aspect of the hotel's hospitality. The bedroom and bathroom were both very large and comfortable by European standards. The room was dark with only one window opening to a small outside area that was not accessible to guests; however, its location on the ground floor was very quiet. A word of warning for those in wheelchairs traveling by themselves, although the hotel is billed as wheelchair accessible, there is a step to enter the building and the room's bathroom though spacious is not built to barrier free design specifications. The beds are too low for easy transfer to and from the wheelchair. In all, however, I found that with only minor assistance from my husband, the access was not too bad. The only real problem we had with the hotel is the unfriendly staff at the desk. The staff were not actually rude, but neither were they proactive with advice or even with greetings. When we checked in, the man at the desk continued to talk on the phone for several minutes before acknowledging us. We were never greeted on leaving or returning to the hotel. They never asked if our room was comfortable, or if we were happy with the room. When we checked out we asked for information to the bus stop heading to the train station and the information provided was wrong. It sent us in the opposite direction and as a result we missed our train back to England. Perhaps this cool, indifferent service is typical of Parisian hospitality, but it contrasts unfavourably with the experience we had in English hotels and left us with an overall unfavourable impression of the hotel and to some extent, it coloured our experience of Paris.", "Date": "March 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Missouri", "Title": "\u201cLoved this place!\u201d", "Author": "eurotravelerMissouri", "ReviewID": "UR23328100", "Content": "We just spent several nights at this wonderful little hotel in a fabulous neighborhood in Paris.

No need to discuss the size of the room because everyone knows Paris hotels are tiny. There was a desk and two chairs and two people could sleep and move in the room just fine.

The continental breakfast is plenty sufficient and nicely presented and we LOVED the fact that breakfast was served until 10:30am! The location is also great being right in the middle of it all in the Latin Quarter and just across the street from a metro stop. Plenty of restaurants, shops, ice cream and even Starbucks all within arms reach.

At the same time, within one or two blocks are literally dozens of restaurants and cafes of all types that offer great food at modest (for Paris) prices. We were amazed to find just a half block over on Rue de Buci five or six cafes fully occupied at 10:00pm on a Thursday, with the street crowded entertainers and passers-by. Not rowdy, just lively! Later in our stay we found that continuing on south on Rue saint-andre de arts down to Saint MIchael continued this lively street scene. The hotel itself is comfortable with no particular complaints. There are only about five rooms per floor on five floors, so it isnt particuarly busy, except when trying to get the elevator down when checking out in the morning. The only problem we had was when my wife turned on one of the lights it blew a fuse. When we reported it the next morning it was fixed by the time we returned. The breakfast is included and offers a small buffet, along with rolls and hot drinks served to the tables. This actually becomes a plus when you consider the cost of alternatives (with kids) and the time it would take to go elsewhere.

My husband and I and two teenage boys just returned from a four day stay at the BW ST. G. We had a mixed experience--the location is fabulous, the street scene charming and wonderful, and the hotel is mixed. The baths were great--renovated, clean and lovely, with fabulous hot water, towels, and toiletries. The beds were very comfortable with great linens and pillows. Rooms are so small it is almost painful: I had to wait to pack until my husband was finished as the space near the closet and bureau was too small for two people. I guess this is typical for Paris. Decor was dark and felt oppressive. Breakfast was ok--not great. Plastic wrapped cheese, no whole grains, canned fruit. Eggs to order for a few euros was a great option. Coffee and oj were good, and in Paris, breakfast is rarely included so this was great for us. Our boys loved the crepe shop two doors away and ate crepes every day! The common spaces are too small to sit in very much--much more of a B & B than a hotel. One PC terminal in the lobby, not free, but free wifi at a cafe almost next door if you bring a laptop. The staff were very disappointing. I do speak some French, but they often spoke too fast for me to follow and were annoyed when I switched to English or asked them to repeat themselves. We had a serious misunderstanding about a tour we wanted to take--they booked us with a company that they said \"we use\" rather than a company that we wanted that offered decidedly different tours, via a Segway. Obviously, they misunderstood us, but \"bike\" and \"segway\" are very different. While they refunded our deposit, this illustrates the weakness of their English. When I needed to cancel a lunch reservation, they gave me the phone number rather than offering to do this for me. Maybe this is too much to expect of a Best Western? They were also unfamiliar with the \"velib\" program, a bike pick up and drop off program in Paris that requires a French based credit card. When I asked about picking up a bike, they said to use a credit card. Later I learned (from another hotel) that one needs a french credit card. How could they not know this? This is not a small matter in a tourist city. My feeling is that the hotel needs a concierge, and the front desk attempts to function as one, but is weak on English, annoyed at being overwhelmed by guests, and undertrained. However, the basics (cleanliness, linens, coffee, baths) are solid. The area is fabulous, and as one always walks in Paris, other reviews that complain about the location are wanting to be in the monuments area, arrondisement #1. It worked for us, and one does not go to Paris for the hotel, so thanks to the fabulous local street scene, with shops, musicians, crepes, cafes, and more, we had a great time. Would we go back?

It is fabulous. I am picky about the little things (linens, beds) but I have to say there were no negatives for me here. Keep in mind that in Europe the rooms in hotels are much smaller than in the United States unless you stay at a very pricey place--like the Ritz (and even then, you cannot be sure it will be that big). So here are the best things about this hotel: 1) It's CLEAN. You could eat off the floor. 2) COMFORTABLE: the beds were firm but soft and felt new. The linens were also soft and I wasn't too warm or too cold. 3) The bathroom is pretty big for European standards and has a hair dryer in the room. They gave us extra towels each day and I only asked once. The shower gels smell good and the shower is very strong with a lot of hot water (this is a luxury in Europe). 4) It's an airconditioned hotel--another luxury in Europe. 5) BREAKFAST! I love their petit dejeuner. You can order eggs for a few euros extra but the rest if included in your room price. The Madame who runs the breakfast speaks fluent English and will get you anything--all while keeping the area spotless. They will bring you bread/croissants, coffee and you can choose from cereal, yogurt, salami and ham and muffins. I really looked forward to getting up. 6) The front desk staff is wonderful. All speak English fluently and go out of their way to be friendly and helpful. They'll make any call you need. Of the most help is the quiet, reserved but ultra efficient and intelligent Franck. Franck will very calmly do what you need him to do. also emailed the hotel directly a few times before I left with general questions and he wrote me back within a few hours. Merci, Franck!! Vous etes tres sympa!! 7) LOCATION: I was not thrilled with Paris' transportation system. The buses are hard to use, taxis do not exist and the metro is, well..........you just better move fast because it's like NYC. So we walked a lot. This hotel is near everything. You can easily walk to all the museums and get over into the Right Bank. The St. Germain neighborhood is so quaint and there are a lot of places to eat. On one street over is (Rue Gregoire) is this fabulous cafe called the St. Germain Cafe (look for Gabriel in the entrance asking you to come in; take him up on it and order the French onion soup) and a few steps away is a yellow building with crepes...........amazing crepes! 8) It's QUIET. You won't hear a thing in other rooms and you can't hear the noise outside. It was so quiet that on the morning I forget a wakeup call, we ended up sleeping until 11:00. And that is way late in St. Germain. As a city, Paris was difficult for me. It was too big, too crowded and reminded me of New York, and je n'aime pas New York. So I looked forward each evening to returning to this hotel, where I could take a hot shower, get into bed, read my guidebooks and watch Law & Order in French.

We have stayed at this hotel 3 other times in the past couple of years. The very last time we stayed there was Nov. 22-24 with some friends that were visiting from the states. I had also just previously been there 2 weeks prior to that (Nov. 7-9) with my mom and daughter. For both occasions, I had booked and requested the same triple room (604) through the hotel (Lorette handled the booking). On the Nov. 7 trip, we were given that room. It's a room that I've stayed in before. Very nice with 3 separate beds and windows that look out over the street on one side and the other towards Notre Dame. When I checked out of the hotel on the 9th - I confirmed with Lorette that we were getting the same triple room on the 22nd. When we arrived on the night of the 22nd, this triple room had \"magically\" been transformed into a suite and was not available for us. I reminded Lorette that I had confirmed this room in the initial booking and then again just 2 weeks earlier, but she said that the room they had given us then was, in fact, a suite - and that I was just unaware of it. The room that WAS available for us was a dark \"dungeon\" room with 2 small windows. Yes, it had 3 beds, but it was very cramped and cold. After I saw this room, I went back to discuss with Lorette - who made no apologies - just that the room we thought we were getting was now really a suite and unavailble - unless, of course, we wanted to pay over 400 euros. So much for honesty and customer appreciation. When I was checking out on the 24th, I spoke with a couple who had just arrived and were waiting for their room in the lobby. They had booked through Best Western and received one of the larger triple rooms for a much lower price than what we got for the \"dungeon\". 2 lessons learned - First - we, personally, will never go back to this hotel. Second - if we book again at a chain hotel - never, never book through the hotel directly. I've always booked through hotels directly in the past and received good service (and better rates, usually). This is not the case anymore. One more side note that should have given me a heads up - for what's it's worth. On Nov. 9, before my departure from the hotel, I had inadvertently left my hat in the downstairs bathroom of the hotel. When I got to the train station at 2:00 p.m., I realized that I had left it and called the hotel. The man who answered at the reception said they were too busy to look for it and that I should call back at 6:00 p.m. Needless to say, by the time they got around to it, the hat was gone. I wish I didn't have to give this hotel such a bad review. It used to be really a nice place to stay in a great location, and there are a number of employees who work there who are very nice and really try to accomodate.
