Despite its proximity to 5th Ave the hotel provides a quiet and relaxing atmosphere. Newly renovated, the rooms are very comfortable and well maintained. We stayed for 10 days in February and March in one of the penthouse rooms with our young children aged 8 & 4. The staff were amazing and went out of their way to help us. They always responded quickly and efficiently to any questions or issues we had. Our apartment faced 16th but we were never kept awake by the noise. One night a Mariachi band played outside our window at Sirenas and while it was noisy, it was still early (around 9pm) and they played for about 10 minutes. It was fabulous watching them from our balcony. I guess if we had wanted complete quiet we would have chosen a location much further from the 5th ave throngs! Even though there were four of us in the apartment we didn't have problems with the hot water. The maids did an excellent job cleaning the apartment each day. One of the air-conditioners wasn't working when we arrived but the staff followed up immediately and provided regular updates about when the repair people would arrive and how quickly it could be fixed. We swam in the pool every day and it was always clean - the staff were constantly scooping leaves. The new cafe opened while we were there (I think we were their first official customers!) and we had breakfast there each day for the last few days of our stay. It was excellent and I would definitely recommend eating there. We also shopped at Mega and used the apartment's facilities to make our our own breakfasts. We used the hotel's Transfer/Tour service. Antonio collected us from and dropped us at the airport and also arranged a guided tour to Chichen Itza. The service was outstanding and excellent value. He happily accommodated our request for a diversion on the way back to Valladolid for lunch and our guide, Sergio, also adapted the tour to suit the age of our little girls.

We stayed in a studio penthouse and while it was not as big as we had envisioned, it was sufficient for our needs. We booked \"room and breakfast\" through Expedia and although this was a surprise to the hotel, they kindly obliged and we had a simple but filling breakfast sent to our room on the days we requested. I do hope this issue has been resolved with Expedia. The hotel is an easy 3 minute walk to the beach. They provide nice large beach towels. The pool gets minimal sun but is still pleasant for an afternoon dip. Daily, we saw cleaning and maintenance crews working diligently to keep the grounds looking attractive. We did fall asleep every night to the sounds of music from 5th Avenue, but is was jazzy and soft from a nearby restaurant and I really didn't mind. The rooftop patio has a beautiful view of the ocean and is nice to just go to, sit and enjoy the ocean breeze when your beach day is over. Our room did have a private rooftop Jacuzzi as well, but it was kind-of a joke, we couldn't get the water to heat up enough to really enjoy it and when it was at its warmest, the jets wouldn't turn on. If you are looking for some restaurants that aren't quite so \"touristy\" ask the concierge about Cactus or UTIL Pasta Factory, we were lucky enough to learn about them from some visitors who had been there a month...and they were the best places we ate at all week!

I've been to Playa 5 times over the past couple of years. This was my first stay at Acanto and will be my last. Here is an objective review of this property: Pros: New. Condo-style apartments. Convenient location. Friendly staff (but so are the staff in any other hotel in Playa). Cons: Construction was NOT complete when we arrived. I repeat: NOT complete. We had to wake up to drill and hammer noise every morning! Of the 7 night stay at Acanto, the apartment was cleaned 3 days and the maids \"forgot\" to clean the apartment 4 other days. There was NEVER any soap or shampoo in the hotel throughout the entire stay. On 2 mornings, there was NO water in the apartment. Every day, a choice had to be made between taking a warm shower or shaving with warm water as the hot water can't last for both shower and shaving! If there are more than 2 people staying in the apartment, then good luck with having enough warm water to just shower. The hotel does NOT have a beach lounge, despite what the pictures show. It is simply close to the beach (just like all other hotels in Playa). While the staff was friendly, they were incompetent. To get something done, you have to request it at least 3 times- example getting toilet paper. While the hotel looks nice and is built like a boutique condo, the insulation is terrible, and you can never get a good night sleep as you can hear people outside your apartment all night and morning- walking up the stairs, taking the elevator, the maids chatting with each other, etc. While the pool looks nice, it is tiny and is exactly behind the reception desk overlooking the street. This does not make it a great place to relax given all the traffic in and out of the hotel and people at the reception. Also, don't count on having sunshine in the pool area for an extended period of time as the hotel is constructed such that the shadow from the building will soon cover the pool area. Also, you have to grab beach towels before 11 am otherwise, you're out of luck as the towels are gone by then. Overall, the hotel seems to promise more than it really delivers. Stay at Acanto at your own risk.", "Date": "March 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cTranquil boutique hotel - great for families\u201d", "Author": "Vik D", "ReviewID": "UR125654856", "Content": "Our first time to Playa Del Carmen, and 3rd time to the Cancun/Rivera Maya area. We travelled with our 5 month old daughter and 2 friends for 7 nights and got a 2 bedroom apartment thru Expedia (best price). Before leaving the U.S., Joel called me to place us in an apartment on the main floor, so we wouldn't have a tough time with the stroller - very nice. The apartment was beautiful (Rm 3) - this hotel is fully renovated as of Dec 2011, all stainless appliances, granite countertops and showers, LCD TVs. Our TV wasn't working but they fixed it the same day for us. You have several Amercian channels like TNT, Universal, and a few other free cable movie channels. The 2 bedroom apartment has 2 bathrooms which was a plus. The facility is kept extremely clean, and they are always cleaning the pool of leaves and seeds. The cleaning staff did a nice job every day in the rooms. There's plenty of silverware and cups and plates for you to use. If you don't wash them then the cleaning staff will (though we did it ourselves because that's the right thing to do). We needed a stove pot to boil water for the baby bottles and they happily gave us one - the cooking utensils are minimal but if you need anything additional, just ask for it (don't buy it at a store like another review said). The location is perfect - right off 5th Ave, right in the middle of the 5th ave strip on 16th st. I felt like if we stayed further south off 5th Ave it wouldn't have been as nice. Security at night was nice, and made us feel safe (though PDC is very safe in general). Breakfast was very good across the street at Sirena, and included in our price - eggs, fruit, club sandwiches, toast, etc. Get your coffee at Starbucks, and get the fresh squeezed orange juice instead. Sirena is good for a quick dinner if you like as well. I guess the restaurant next door isn't ready yet, because it was only open 1 day. I recommend that you walk to the local supermarket \"Mega\" (it's huge and just like Shoprite, Waldbaum's or A&P in the U.S.). Get your water, juice, bread, snacks all there and then take a $3 cab back to the hotel. There's a Walmart nearby as well. The rooftop of the hotel has a BBQs and jacuzzi's, which was awesome. We reserved it one night and grilled chicken, chorizo and burgers up there and brought an iPod dock for entertainment. The sunset from the rooftop is amazing! There is a new elevator which worked just fine for us. Raphela, Joel and Luis were accommodating and very helpful. They helped us book a car on the last day by searching on the internet and calling places for us. We went to the Tulum ruins and also toured the town of Tulum's boutique hotel strip down there (amazing beaches!!). Check our Rosa Viento towards the end of the strip - Miguel is the best there. Pros: Location (16th St and 5th Ave), newly renovated hotel, very comfortable king beds, BBQ and jacuzzi rooftop, great staff, tranquil, full kitchen, dining and living room space, bathroom in each bedroom, 1 block from the beach, nice small pool. WIFI in the lobby and also available in each room. Cons: As Playa del Carmen is full of nice boutique hotels, this is one of the best. Don't expect grand hotel luxury like room service - for that, you need to stay at a large resort which we didn't want to, as they are not downtown where you want to be. This isn't really a con, but you should be aware. Rivera Maya has alot of mosquitos so be sure to bring OFF! bug spray and you will be fine. Nice to have: Showers could use more water pressure, but otherwise they were fine. The water all over Playa Del Carmen in alittle salty - I believe the city processes seawater into normal water - we got used to it, no big deal. Recommendations: When getting breakfast in the morning, always request prepaid passes for the restaurant Sirena across the street and never goto Indigo for food (it's the worst). Restaurants - La Parilla (mexican), 10 (Diez - argentian steakhouse); Bars/Clubs - Mandala (insane!), Fusion (fireshow); Beach clubs - La Mamitas, Kool, Wicky's, Sensi. Anything you buy, negotiate half off!! Go to the 7Eleven near 12th St and use the HSBC ATM inside to get Pesos ($1USD = $13 pesos). Pay for everything in pesos and you will save a ton of cash and credit card foreign transaction fees. Use Expedia (Best Day Travel) or the hotel directly for transportation to/from the airport for best price and peace of mind. Use the WIFI on your cellphone at the hotel for Skype phone calls, much cheaper than international cell phone roaming. Remember 2 things - Everyone is on Mexican Standard Time down here, ie. service literally takes 2x or 3x the time. You will order food or drinks and they will come like 30 minutes later. Lastly, rule of thumb is to always be nice in spite of frustration - if you're nice, you will be taken care of much faster than if you are rude!!", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "South San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat place & deal\u201d", "Author": "SFOPeter", "ReviewID": "UR125325752", "Content": "I stayed here 4 nights with my son in a 2 bedroom condo.

It was our first trip to the area. We decided on Playa del Carmen vs Cancun and debated as to staying in an all-inclusive but opted for the condo instead. This was a good decision as we saw more of each other, enjoyed a few meals in the condo (food shopping at nearby Mega Store was convenient), and delighted in choosing from the endless availability of fine restaurants nearby. The Acanto is steps to 5th Av and proximity to the beach made our holiday (without a car) perfect! The street is quiet, though we occasionally heard music late at night (from 5th Ave)... but it was a high peak time after Christmas and through New Year's Day. I would recommend the Acanto Hotel because it was clean, convenient and mostly for the amazing service of the staff. They were responsive and accommodating. (especially Joel & Luis) We hired the driver affiliated with the hotel and Antonio made our trip exceptional (see attached picture). Antonio (business is Cancun-Shuttle-DIrect) transported us to and from Cancun airport as well as a private full day trip to Tulum, lunch at Oscar & Lalo's Restaurant and to the quiet, idyllic Ecopark Kantun-Chi where we enjoyed swimming in the cenotes (5)! Antonio knew where to go and would show anyone a good time, regardless of their interests. The condo unit was beautiful and the beds were very comfortable, though the hot water supply in our shower was insufficient. We also felt that the kitchen could have been supplied with a few basics, (paper towels, dishwasher soap, ice cube trays, coffee filters, dish towels, steak knives, salt & pepper). As The Acanto has recently reopened (after complete renovations), perhaps these have been remedied. Maid service was exceptional, too. The cost was a bit high though opting for a private bedroom and bath for the boys made it special and luxurious for all.

With a group of five, we stayed in two rooms: a 2BR penthouse condo and a 1BR penthouse condo, both in the main building (apparently there's another condo location a few blocks away). It was a good configuration, because we were able to cook and really had some space to spread out. Our group had some very specific needs, so I communicated with the Acanto staff several times in advance about details. They responded right away, and were super accommodating about things like making sure both bedrooms in the 2br penthouse had queen or king beds (not twins), and answering questions about local resources. The penthouse roof terraces were especially lovely -- each one included a four-person hot tub, table/chairs and loungers, and an outdoor kitchen area with gas grill, sink, and counter space. (The railing-free spiral stairs to the roof are a little scary, though!) The hotel is one longish block from the ocean, and the setting feels more \"town\" than \"beachfront,\" but our view was pretty nice from up there! The beach itself has the kind of fine, light, powdery sand that dreams are made of. You can walk all the way up either the beach or the main pedestrian drag (Avenida 5) from near the hotel to the Cozumel ferry building, and there are endless resources for entertainment, dining/drinking, etc. along either route. We bought groceries at Walmart and later at Mega Mart (which is much better and closer), but you can also preorder groceries from the hotel and they'll deliver them to your room for a 20% surcharge, which seems like a pretty good deal. At our request, Acanto also made reservations for us one night at Yaxche, a great Mayan restaurant a few blocks away. Yum! The Acanto Hotel is very newly redone, so there were occasional glitches, like the elevator not working for a few days (it also doesn't go to all upper-floor areas), and no phones in the rooms to call downstairs or to other rooms. There were also a few byzantine little quirks to the facility -- for example, they have to turn on the hot tubs and the rooftop grills for you in advance (you can't just do it yourself, and you have to plan ahead). And because the hotel is at the edge of Avenida 5, there was a bit of wee-hours noise from carousing tourists returning drunk to wherever they were staying (this only happened a couple times over the weekend). But overall it was pretty quiet, and felt very private and relaxed. The vibe was great, the decor nice (especially the wall art), the location excellent, the beds very comfortable, the Wi-Fi ($10/day) reliable, and the onsite staff were some of the nicest, most accommodating people I've encountered at any hotel worldwide.

For being in such a prime location, I was surprised at how quiet and peaceful the rooms were. We appreciated consistently comfortable slumbers. What especially impressed me at Acanto Hotel and Condominiums was each staff member. Each one was so helpful in answering all the questions I had at any time of day. We appreciated the 24-hour security, too. Acanto Hotel representatives helped me coordinate car rentals, dining arrangements, and taxis with ease and competitive pricing in a polite, helpful, and pleasant manner. Guest services were superior, and the atmosphere of true hospitality was a class act. We hope to stay here again!", "Date": "January 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Canada", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Stay at Acanto\u201d", "Author": "claire19841987", "ReviewID": "UR123860219", "Content": "We are renting a 1 bedroom condo for a 6 week period at Acanto and we are very happy with our selection.

It is pricier than others but we were prepared to pay this, as we expected top service and an easy-going time in Playa del Carmen. We were terribly disappointed due to numerous issues, which piled up as an unsatisfactory experience. First, according to the reservation from Hotels.com we had breakfast included. However, the hotel claimed they received no information about this and after a few days demanded us to pay for breakfasts. Second, the building/renovation was nowhere near done. The room was (almost) ready but some others were not and paint smell and noises were present in common areas. In our room items were obviously just removed from a package or they were still on one. Third, we lacked enough information about hotel procedures as the room had no information file or instructions about roof top common areas, safety locker, deals with beach clubs, local sights etc. In addition, there was no phone in the room (even though according to the Hotels.com there was supposed to be one) so we had to walk to the reception for every issue. When asking about this, we were explained that the hotel is such a small venue the rooms don't need a phone. All in all, the most disturbing experience was that some of the issues listed in Hotels.com or Acanto's own webpages were missing or claimed not be included (breakfast, bottled water, slippers, phone, even though they were supposed to), which caused an uneasy feeling when discussing with the personnel. We ended up having a not very relaxing holiday trying to solve the problems. In the end the most serious issues were solved. However, it took several discussions over more than one day. To say something nice about the hotel, the location is excellent and cleaning worked well and maids were very friendly.

We booked for 6 nights and stayed in a 2 bed room suite with another couple. The suite we stayed in was very spacious and the layout/design was nice. It was very clear upon arrival that they were not ready for us to check in as the maids were still cleaning when we arrived. We also noticed that the hotel was still under construction. I wasn't too bothered by this at first however, for the next couple of days construction began early in the morning and we were unable to sleep. Our room had a separate entrance and a balcony that faced the common area which appeared to convenient at first however we quickly noticed that neither of these entrances were sound proof. We barely got any sleep and always were awaken early due to the noise from the other guests. The elevator bell is pretty loud and every time it stops on the floor that makes a loud noise that we can hear in the suite (make sure you don't get a suite by the elevator because it is also a high traffic area). Hot water was also an issue. By the time one person finishes their shower the hot water tank is already empty. We had to plan the timing of our showers so that we each got hot water. Twice during our stay we woke up and there was no running water in the suite. Housekeeping was also a big problem. Almost everyday housekeeping would clean in the early evening. We would come home from the beach around 5:00 pm and the rooms still weren't clean. We never received any soap from the moment we got here -even though we asked everyday. Two of the days they ran out of towels and almost everyday they didn't put any toilet paper and Kleenex in at least one of the bathrooms. One day the maids did one bedroom and didn't clean the other room. As for the hotel pool, the pictures are very deceiving. The pool is tiny and inconveniently situated. The front staff was friendly and helpful to the extent that they could be given all the circumstances. The location of the hotel is the big highlight as it is very convenient. This was the one saving grace. I think that this hotel needs to get their service together.
