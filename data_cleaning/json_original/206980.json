The man at the Front Desk was really helpful and spoke no English. When I asked for directions he broke out a map,when I couldn't figure out the air conditioning he came up and turned it on. The wifi worked the whole time and the room looked exactly like the picture. This is a small property that is in Madrid but a suburb. The metro is 100 feet away and if you stay here you must know it is not centrally located. But it is clean extremely inexpensive and a great value. Did I mention free continental breakfast and free wifi?
