{"Reviews": [{"Content": "good place close to everything in Tokyo Nice little hotel in a great location, right next to Gotanda Station (Yamanote Line and subway). The main problem is the rooms are VERY small! One small suitcase is probably all you should plan to have with you if you stay there. And remember to bend down to go under doors if you are tall. But my room was very clean, the shower room was tiny but very clean. Staff was invariably friendly and helpful even if their English wasn't that great. The free internet connection in the lobby is a bit slow but it does save you money compared to going to internet cafes. Breakfast (Western and Japanese) is abundant and tasty, and there are plenty of eateries and convenience stores all around. The place appeals to young Korean travelers as well as small families (in both senses), it seems. For around $70 close to downtown Tokyo, you can't ask for more. I'd stay there again.", "Date": "Jul 18, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR139249683", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "bruthiaux"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066854-d1083477-r8140326-Toko_Hotel-Shinagawa_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "1083477", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
