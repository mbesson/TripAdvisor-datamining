And then we then found a lot more to be troubled by: - the lift was dirty, and did not always work - carpets were dirty and there were various unpleasant odours in different areas of the hotel - laundry bags were left lining / blocking corridors - doors which opened directly over the top of narrow staircases, with no warning sign - room windows which did not lock - TVs which had virtually no reception - dirty bath, with hair in it - no plug on sink (our request for this to be remedied was ignored) - worn out soft furnishings - shower that leaked onto floor - another shower with no temperature control (only very hot) Concerned about cleanliness, security and accident risk (particularly for the kids) we cut short our stay and left. The receptionist did not seem surprised, and promised the manager would contact us. We've heard nothing.
