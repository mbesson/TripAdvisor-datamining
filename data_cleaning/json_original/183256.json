As mentioned in other posts, the parking is terribly small. We arrived later in the evening, and were able to get the last spot available, however due to the many pillars, odd parking arrangement, it was troublesome to park. The overall appearance of the hotel is dismal, needs paint, renovations. The carpet on the floor was old, and the stairwells had broken windows. A very odd layout for a hotel as well. The elevator ride was sketchy, and the only ice machine is in the basement. However, the rooms were remarkably clean, and comfortable. The air conditioning did not work very well, however we were able to open the windows and let the room cool down. Also, the hotel was very quiet. Beds and pillows were super comfortable. The continental breakfast was okay. Typical waffle, toast, cereal and fruit. Would have been nice to see yogurt or another healthier option. Location is great - a five minute walk to St. Denis. Lots of little bistros and shops, and a 5 minutes cab ride to St. Laurent for night life. Overall, for under 100$ a night, its not a bad stay, if you are looking more to experience montreal, and not necessarily live in the hotel.", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, hotel was alright.\u201d", "Author": "tintinarcher", "ReviewID": "UR127455974", "Content": "For cheap travellers, this is a great hotel for you..!!

We called reception and asked them to look into it while we had to leave. Realizing that they probably won't be able to fix the AC (it sounded like the rotor was dying) I confirmed that we'll be offered a different room if these problems are not taken care of. When we got back to the hotel, I inquired at the reception whether the issues were fixed and the receptionist confirmed that all was good. When we walked up to our room we found the same roaring AC with no signs of anybody even looking at it (I put some papers on top of the cover and they remained untouched). But worse, the whole washroom was covered in dirt including the towels, the sink was still clogged and was filled with water full of some dirt and hair and there were some tools all over the washroom.

The room we had was reasonably clean and serviceable however the bed was as hard as a rock. I woke up the next morning barely able to move. My back was so sore I had to take painkillers. Once the painkillers kicked in and I was able to walk again we went downstairs for breakfast. Not worth setting the alarm clock for. Muffins, toast, croissants, cold cereal and the ubiquitous DIY waffle maker served with some pretty terrible coffee. There are many good cafes in Montreal and if you choose to stay in this hotel you should make a point of finding one. As I said before, the location IS very convenient. The downside to being near the bus station, however, are the \"colourful\" people who tend to hang out near them. On our last night we encountered a hooker looking for cigarette butts on the side of the road. She started yelling at us in French, grabbed her crotch and wandered off.

I was fooled by the pictures and booked in here, at a very pricey rate. Despite paying over $150 night I had to pay another $18 day to park in the \"garage,\" (in advance) with no guarantee of a spot in the very small lot. The bedding would have disgraced a stable, seriously, the blankets and sheets were rags. The elevator is frightening, I rode it once and took the stairs after that. Security is a joke, there is a back door with no locks that opens to the street, allowing access to the hotel 24 hours a day to anyone. The air conditioning was never able to get the room below about 80 degrees during the day. The bathroom was moldy and lit only by a very dim fluorescent fixture. The TV offered very few channels. The best aspect of this hotel is the location, however the neighborhood is flooded with homeless people who will accost you, especially in the evening. Here is the kicker - I sent an email to Comfort Inns after my stay complaining about the lousy condition of the hotel. The hotel owners then billed my credit card an additional $300. When I questioned this charge I was told it was because I soiled the room carpet with hair dye. Leaving aside for a moment that I doubt you could have noted anything short of a gallon of bright red paint on the hideous and badly stained carpet...I don't dye my hair and if I did, why would I do so in a hotel room? Isn't that something hair salons do? I am still fighting the charge through my credit card company, of course it is especially difficult because it was incurred in a foreign nation.

You could probably find better accomodations if you book a rate of $120+ at the 4* across the street. That being said, I am pleased with this no-frills hotel and will continue to stay there. This time, I had a room with what I could actually call, \"a view\". From the 6th floor east, I could actually see Olympic Stadium and the Jacques Cartier Bridge. What a surprise. I've only ever faced the courtyard and buses before. Room was good quality, decent furniture. Bed was soft in places, but not uncomfortable. I was surprised to find my room actually had a sofa too, it was a good-sized pad. Quibbles about my stay: - The breakfast is a poor, poor production. It was almost impossible to find a table, and everyone rushes down at the last minute between 9:15 and 9:30 to get whatever is left. Instead of starting brekkie at 6:30-9:30 they should have it 7:00-10:00, at least on weekends. The line up for the waffle maker (that's what everyone is after) is about 5-10 people when it is busy so it can take a good 15 minutes to make waffles for yourself if you have to wait. This breakfast experience is similar to my last one when I stayed here, so they really need to do something about this, otherwise is just a token \"breakfast is included\". I'd describe it as \"Continental Plus\". - Elevator: The same picture has been in the elevator since this was Hotel Taj Mahal. The whole car needs a complete reno. Too bumpy, slow.

First, when i first checked in, the lady told me that i would have to pay an additional $12 + 17.83 percent tax for every additonal person staying per night and i had 5 people including myself which means i am paying over $100 including tax just to have them stay with me in the same room. Initially i planned on sneaking them into the room instead so we don't have to pay it, but after we decided that we will pay, the manager by the name of Adrian told my friend and i that the room only allows a maximum of 4 people because of fire policy which means that we would have to book another room regardless. I feel as though they are trying to rip me off because first the lady told me that we would have to pay additonal and now they're saying that we would have to book a second room. I've lived in quite a number of hotels, and i've never heard of that policy before. And Mr. Adrian addressed that if police was to come that all of us will end up in jail. During our whole conversation, he was very rude. I highly doubt the professionalism of this hotel as he only created more problems for me instead of helping me solve my current issues. We ended up having to switch 2 different hotel rooms because the sinks were either broken or chipped. We ended up climbing a whole lot of stairs because of how the hotel is structured. I became so intolerant i had my friend go with him to check the room before we moved everything there. During that whole time, the manager did not offer to help us carry any of our belongings when he clearly saw how the 2 of us were struggling. After we FINALLY settled down in a room, our friends came in to get their belongings and the manager STALKED them to our room and stood outside watching us move our stuff. I feel so humiliated by his behavior when he was aware that we have another hotel room next door. After my friends left, i closed the door and being the crappy hotel that it is, the door slammed shut. In a split second, the manager knocked on our door and told us to not slam the door or else he would call the police on us for disturbance. In addition to that, parking is HORRIBLE. We paid $17+ tax per night for parking, and it wasnt even a legit parking. My car and everyone else's car was very vulnerable to scratches and what not with all those poles and stuff in the middle of no where. The way you enter and the way you exit is from the exact same \"door\". Their called \"parking lot\" was not even capable of parking 20 cars and they had 100+ rooms? Ironic much? And when i complained to the manager, he insisted that there are parking space and that it was good, but i didn't pay $17+ for a crappy parking spot which could potenially cost me more if my car were to get scratched. On the last day when i checked out the rep i dealt with was much nicer and more professional. Sadly, the manager that i had to deal with was nothing in comparison. In conclusion, i strongly do not recommend this place for anyone whether it's just a one night think or long term because right next to them, there's this place where they charge wayyy cheaper, and their rooms might not be as nice, but their service is 100 x better. And surprisingly during my friends stay at that place, the rep told him that we can call the police on Comfort Hotel as there are no such fire policy of 4 occupancies.

Breakfast was okay, but first day after having eggs had stomach problems and spent the day in bed. Did not eat hard boiled eggs again. NO FRUIT, NO YOGURT. They had two Asian tour groups in at our time of stay with 4 people per room, may be why there was no hot water. Girls at front desk were really nice and helpful.
