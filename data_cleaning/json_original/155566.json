She not only got us toothbrushes but when she heard we hadn't eaten since noon the day before she made sure our room service order was there in 15 minutes. We thankfully ate and fell into bed.

I wish we knew all of the names but we can only personally thank Josie and Rolf. You will never know what you did for us by being so kind and how it helped a wonderful local family. The room service food is fabulous. (We ordered the caesar salad with shrimp and a pizza 3 times!) We actually did end up with about 12 hrs to see the 4 sites we were hoping to see and because of the PRIME location we did it all.

Very Mickey Mouse...is this the flagship brand of ICHotelsGroup, or Motel 6? Ironically, there's another one of their hotels down the street, the Holiday Inn, with free internet. They're way behind the market....internet is now a utility....kinda like charging for toilet paper. Thirdly, on top of the delivery charge, the 15% gratuity automatically added to the room service bill. I take offense to someone telling me what I think of their service. The big loser here is the staff, as I always tip at least 20% for \"average\" service. And fourth, the $1.50 charge for local calls, including 800 numbers. Again,very Mickey Mouse. They have to decide what market segment they want to compete in...if it's top tier like the Windsor Arms or Four Seasons nearby, then raise the rates and stop nickel-and-diming the customer.

Don't have a strong view on the value for money , as my company paid for the stay! My double room cost about \u00c2\u00a3200 (C$300) per night for bed and breakfast - slightly less at the weekend. The main room was a good size, with a large double bed, sofa and chair around a coffee table, and another chair by a writing desk. I had a front facing room (735) with a view of the museum over the road, and a more distant view of the CN tower. The bathroom had a shower cubicle and separate bath, which was a definite plus - plenty of towels and toiletries, with a wide mirror behind the bathroom sink. There was also a full length mirror in the wardrobe door. Ample wardrobe and cupboard space for clothes. Amenities - large flat screen TV with about 40 channels (BBC world, a few US, and lots of local and national Canadian). Hairdryer (which I didn't use so no idea how good it was). Iron and ironing board (ditto). Mini bar and coffer maker (ditto) Small in-room safe (which I did use and is a must for any hotel to be honest). I slept fine, the bed was very comfortable. I could hear a little traffic noise - not an issue for me, but could be an issue for a very light sleeper. Hotel is conveniently located for upmarket shopping. Also a 2-3 minute walk to St George subway station (direct link to Union Station). Handy Hint - first time I went to St George, I got a week pass for the subway which cost about \u00c2\u00a325 and which saved the hassle of buying a ticket every trip. Breakfast options included with my meal were substantial (e.g. \"The Canadian\" - tea or coffee, toast, fruit juice, small plate of fresh fruit, bacon or sausage served with eggs and fried potatoes). Enough to set me up for the day! Service was very good - friendly staff generally, who provided information about local bars and shops, called taxis, stored luggage while I explored Toronto on my last day. A nifty idea they have is a PC in the lobby on which you can check in online- if you then need to print a boarding pass, the PC is linked to a printer at the reception desk. Looking round Toronto, I went to an ice hockey game at the Air Canada Centre (fun experience, and easy to get to from Union Station), I went to the Ice Hockey Hall of Fame (vast amount of memorabilia, heaven for the ice hockey fan but mostly lost on me), and the CN tower (Handy Hint - \u00c2\u00a326/C$40 buys a Total Tower ticket, which gets you to all the various levels of the tower plus several ground floor attractions including a 3D film and a fun river-ride simulator) Overall, definitely enjoyed the stay, and hoping that work will put me up there again if I need to visit again!", "Date": "January 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Katonah, New York", "Title": "\u201cSmall, Intimate in a Big City\u201d", "Author": "FrancisMcInerney", "ReviewID": "UR123399971", "Content": "We've stayed at this hotel at least ten times in recent years.

The Park Hyatt looks and has the feel of a 5 star hotel (and has a great rooftop bar) - this hotel is tired and there were lots of \"niggles\". GOOD POINTS 1) If you want to be near high end shopping, then this hotel is a good location. You are about a seven minute walk from Holt Renfrew (a great department store - a bit like Harvey Nichols in London) and almost opposite the Royal Ontario Museum. You are also close to the Bata Shoe Museum. 2) The gym is ok - however, I think if you were staying here at peak time, you would struggle to get on the machinery - there isn't much but what they have is good (2x treadmills, 2 bikes, 1x cross trainer and some weights. There is no rower which is a disappointment.). The pool is nice though - it is indoor and is a nice size. Would be good for children. 3) The bedrooms are comfortable enough - nice linen. 4) Bathroom had separate bath and shower which I always like. BAD POINTS 1) The bar was only open in the evening - which was a shame as we sometimes wanted to go into the bar early afternoon and grab a drink and snack. 2) The food menu was very limited. Not many healthy options either. The breakfast however was fine. 3) We had to wait ages for our lunch order - and we were the only ones in the restaurant. A wait of 35 mins for 2 cold orders is simply not acceptable - no real explanation was given either. 4) They seemed to be really \"tight\" on towels and shampoos etc - a bit annoying to have to call down for extra. 5) There was no turn down service - I rarely use this but it is nice to have and actually having fresh supplies of shampoo etc brought in would be nice. 6) I resent having to pay for internet - (although there is a free standalone computer in the lift foyer) 7) Wouldn't give us a check out later than 1.00pm (we wanted 3.00pm) without us having to pay for it. This is despite the hotel being very empty. This was in stark contrast to the last three branded hotels (Hilton, Renaissance) I have stayed in when I was allowed until at least 2.00pm and on one occasion until 4.00pm. 8) We couldn't get the ATM bank machine in the lobby to work.

This would be the most upscale place that I've stayed in and I was not disappointed. The hotel is in a quite upscale neighbourhood in Toronto and is pretty much across the street from a prominent museum, and within walking distance of \"high class\" shopping. The look and feel of the hotel is in keeping with the neighbourhood. I stayed in a standard room and found it to be very spacious with very good amenities. I particularly liked the bathroom, looked just like what you see on their site. Though I've used them many times I never really liked the shower in the tub set-up that most hotels etc use, I was pleased that they didn't. I also made use of the mini-bar which was kept daily by the \"mini-bar guy\". The service there was excellent, certainly the best I've experienced. The lady who checked me in was so cheerful I even became skeptically waiting for her to turn. She never did. The staff were consistently friendly, professional, and prompt in their service. My memories of my interactions with the waiters/waitresses, concierge, clerks, doormen, maids are devoid of negatives. After I returned to the island of Dominica I perused more meticulously the mini-bar tab and didn't agree with some of the charges..nothing major. I communicated this with a clerk by email and once again was treated to true professionalism. A supervisor got in on it as well until the bill was quickly rectified...no fuss or headaches from thousands of miles away. Months later I am still impressed with the service that I experienced.

On my first visit, while travelling with a good friend of mine, I happened to let on to the concierge that the next day was his birthday and I was looking for some information on events that he and myself and some of our local friends could attend rather than simply going to a bar all night. Not only did the concierge deliver on the event information in a prompt and thorough fashion, but the afternoon of his birthday we returned to our room to find freshly-made chocolate-covered strawberries waiting with the birthday wishes from the hotel. This sort of care is only an example of the quality of service offered. Also worth mentioning is Proof vodka bar in the lobby - especially the bartender Mike, whose conversation and mixology are both top-notch. The rest of the staff stand out as well, I wish I could take the time to mention each one by name. However, no hotel is perfect so allow me to mention the remarkably few negatives I've experienced here as well: Signatures has some excellent food. I've only eaten there twice, but it was quite good (aside from some chicken that was a little salty). The problem is that the meal was lacking atmosphere as we were the only table occupied in the restaurant. Both times. It definitely means you have what amounts to dedicated service, but without any music being played there was a sort of creepy feeling. The second time I visited music was being played at a very subtle level, however, appropriate for such an environment. I don't know quite what to make of the manager at Proof - the gentleman I've encountered as manager twice may simply be shy or may not love his job, but either way a guest shouldn't notice. With the level of service the staff provide, anyone not measuring up to that level stands out. It seems this is an environment where the service succeeds despite the management rather than the other way around. This is likely due to many of the staff predating the newer management. I've not been in a few months, so perhaps this has changed. Back to the hotel itself - the televisions in many of the rooms need updating - flatscreens should have been installed some time ago. The rooms are wonderful until you see those bloody old TV sets - it clashes totally with the contemporary look of the rest of the space. Other than that, I really cannot think of anything else. From the location (in the heart of Yorkville, but close to the Annex) to the staff, the Intercontinental Yorkville remains, absolutely, one of the best hotels I've stayed in. I look forward to returning again soon - it's never been anything but a pleasure.

You have to pay for wi-fi, which I would expect to have available free as a basic standard. Also, they don't provide breakfast, unless you pay for it in the hotel restaurant.

Despite that, the hotel did have a heads up a couple days prior but did not contact us to let us know. Naturally, we asked if there was anything they were planning to do to make it up to us. However, the manager on duty felt strongly that because it was not the hotel's fault, he should not have to provide us any sort of compensation. After being quite indignant with us, he finally asked what we would like. We suggested free internet & free valet parking (about a $35 value). For a while he balked but finally agreed.

The aircond in our first room didn't work and was noisy (some guests complained the same in the past and we thought IC had fixed this. Nope they sure didn't). So in the 32C heat, that was unbearable in the room. We called engineering who came and changed the filter. After 2 nights of hell (hell as in hot room temperature), we couldn't bear it anymore and asked to move to another room. Hotel moved us but the second room's aircond barely worked. It was better but was noisy and the room wasn't cold. We had to leave the hotel on the 3rd night so didn't bother to change the room again. On check out, we told the front desk clerk. Her response was \"Really? I'll ask engineering to check\". But it was the way she said it that made us feel her \"concern\" was not genuine. Not impressed with her service. Also i left my cell in the room. I called housekeeping (thanks May!) who found it and told me it would be available for pick up at the front desk. When i arrived, i approached the front desk (the same girl who checked us out) that i was picking up my cell. She asked for my name, a photo id, and the room i stayed. I gave the details to her. She then returned my photoid and asked me to go speak with her manager who keeps all lost items (such as cell phones) in her safe. I then had to wait for the manager to be available and then explain the same thing to her even though i had already explained to the clerk. It was a complete waste of my time to go over the same details to the manager when the front desk clerk could have done that for me after I've expalined to her in the first place. The manager was extremely helpful and managed to locate my cell. Bottom line: If you don't mind crappy front desk service from that girl and a non-working aircond in this hotel, by all means, stay here.

Their rates are usually set in the same spectrum as well, and tend to congregate to the same locale. This is probably a true statement in general, while it may vary a little bit for individual market or properties. In the case of IC Yorkville, this is certainly the case. So, the question is, how would it differentiate itself from the competition and create customer loyalty. They have answered it well, with a world class customer service. It may sound boring. And customers are inundated by clever marking propaganda and promises these days about putting customer first. However, when it does happen, people would still recognize it. The staff members that I encountered were friendly and responsive. They are ready to go above and beyond. They stand behind their words. I have top tier status with Hyatt, IHG, Marriott and Fairmont, and mid-tier with SPG and Hilton. The service I received at IC Yorkville is truly exceptional.

I also stayed on some extra days to visit friends & family in the area. This is one of the best big chain hotels I've stayed in. The hotel is very conveniently located across from the Royal Ontario Museum, and is in the heart of some of the most exclusive shopping areas in the city of Toronto. The University of Toronto campus also extends into this area, which means there are a lot of reasonably-priced places to eat, as well as more upscale restaruants. The hotel is simply but tastefully furnished, and is spotlessly clean. It was a relief to be in a place that didn't have the pervasive cleaning products odour that so many hotels have. My single room was very large very clean and well laid out, with a king-sized bed, desk, couch, chair and 40\" (I think) LG flat screen TV. The bathroom was palatial with separate tub & shower areas. The only negative aspects were the temperature, which was too hot for me, even with a settable room thermostat, and the noise. My room was right on Bloor Street, which is a major artery with a lot of traffic at all hours. With the window open for cool air, it was loud at times. However in summer and winter you would be running the in-room heating/cooling system, so noise would be reduced. If you're a light sleeper ask for one of the rooms at the back of the hotel. The staff are exceptional. Everyone I encountered was friendly, professional and went the extra mile. Two things in particular stood out. I arrived at the hotel with a coat that needed repair, and the concierge arranged for the in-house cleaning/sewing staff to not only clean & repair it but completely refurbish it, for a very reasonable price. The second was the responsiveness of the restaurant and banquet staff to my requirement for gluten-free meal options. All the wait staff were very familiar with gluten-free needs, but the kitchens had no GF items in stock. By the third day of the conference, they had brought in GF bread, rolls and waffles, and also created a wonderful dessert for one of the coffee breaks. This kind of recovery shows a remarkable attention to detail and concern for customer comfort.

I managed to get one of the remaining unrenovated rooms on priceline (for 90 USD / night. Wow) - which was a great value. Check in was a breeze. Everybody on the way in was very friendly (the doorman and desk staff), despite it being 11:30 PM on a Sunday. I felt especially welcomed by one front desk staffer in particular (I think her name was Sarah - but I'm TERRIBLE with names). She welcomed me back to the hotel every time I walked by (ninja stealth or otherwise), and seemed genuinely happy to chat when it wasn't busy. Many of the little things are probably going to get addressed with the reno's. The room was in need of a few repairs (shower head, cracked tiles & chipped bathtub), and the television had seen better days (the power button was crushed, and the TV itself was from the turn of the century). However, for $90 / night in such a fantastic location, those were minimally distressing. My remote didn't work at first, but after I mentioned it, it was fixed in the time it took to meet a friend for coffee. The king bed was amazing. The fitness centre was more than enough for my needs. Two treadmills, some other misc. machines, and enough weights that 1-2 people could work out at the same time. The pool was also quite nice. I didn't get to try the restaurant or vodka bar. Others have mentioned the high price of internet. That bears repeating. Despite my best efforts - there was no free wi-fi in surrounding buildings to borrow from. I'm sure the internet provided for $12 / night IS quite fast, but since I was staying for 9 nights, it actually ended up being cheaper for me to go purchase high speed internet from Wind mobile once I landed (Stick was $60, internet was $25 / month and it too, is fast :) Summary: Highly recommend, fantastic service and just a small couple snags.

My husband owns a hotel in Montreal and so we are accustomed to travelling all over the world. I have to say that we were pleasantly surprised at how charming this smaller version of the Intercontinental chain is. When we first arrived (Feb.19) the front desk clerk (Monique) was most charming. We checked in at 6:00p.m. and the hotel was full so she did her best to get us an upgrade since our reservation which was for a kingsize bed werea only available at this time in the suites. She then called one of the managers to approve the upgrade. He was even more pleasant than she was. The doormen were extremely helpful since we did not know much about getting around in the city. We had drinks before going to dinner at the bar in the hotel. Amber, the bartender/waiter was extremely nice and knew his drinks and cheeses very well. All I can now say is that we will be going back often to Toronto for business and the Intercontinental is the place to stay in Yorkville. Thank you to all the staff for taking such good care of us.

Perhaps it is an old hotel, nothing really fancy about the rooms, the location is good, and the staff membes are great. I always like those doorman boys are very good, professional, eager to help. This time around, I was revisiting this hotel with an elevated priority club membership - royal ambassador. Like before, I had two reward nights and one paid nights, on the check-in, the lady was pleasantly addressing me by offering to just combine the two separate bookings into one paperwork, and upgraded me to a StudioSuite. I did request 816, close to the gym workout/fitness room but it was unavailable. When I was asking about the benefit of accessing the mini-bar for being a RA member, I got a clear answer. After checking in, I was afraid of being overcharged and phoned the concierge desk about the minibar access, i was offered a quick and clear answer quickly. Even though the mini-bar was not re-installed, but I was happy that I was abble to get some soft drinks after working out and sunna room, given the bad weather outside. When I was checking out on Sunday, the checkout lady was asking if I was aware of the mini-bar benefit during my stay. Although the guest rooms could use some re-skinning or refurbishing or renovations (the latest was that the flat-screen TVs are being installed in all the rooms, and my room did have a new TV), the lobby and the function room floor (2nd) look very classically luxuous and splendid, and I like alot. Overall the minor issue is that the TV inputs are still analog (yes, installed new flat-screen TV), and the channel choices are not great. However, I still overall have received good impression on this hotel. I do think the staff members are great. I travel to Toronto a lot, and used to stay in the city centre Intercon hotel (the old Crowne Plaza upgrade), but now feel a lot to prefer staying in this property. I also love the 24-hr fitness room access, and self-adjusted sauna room, which I used every day. I assume this hotel might still be a good choice for many conference goers, as the guest rooms are not particularly chic, just steps away from the ROM and Yorkville shops, and easy access to TTC subway stations, I would recommend others to stay here.", "Date": "February 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario, Canada", "Title": "\u201cBest Customer Service in the City\u201d", "Author": "coledale60", "ReviewID": "UR96850207", "Content": "The Intercontinental Toronto Yorkville was an integral part of our bachelorette party celebration on February 5th. We planned to have dinner at a local restaurant in Yorkville so we needed to find a hotel close to the restaurant where friends and family could gather before dinner and where some could sleep after the party. There are several upscale hotels in this area, all of which were checked, but none met the criteria like the InterContinental Toronto Yorkville. It was the obvious choice. From the moment I walked through the front door of the Intercontinental and spoke to Rolf Kenda (Front Office Manager), I was so well taken care of that I cannot think of another hotel experience that comes close to matching the customer service I received. Mr. Kenda's easy and professional manner made my experience very positive. He remembered my name and used it within moments of my introducing myself. When explaining the details of our upcoming special event and the type of room I was looking for, he willingly volunteered to show me several rooms that he felt would meet my criteria. I decided to reserve The Executive Suite and Mr Kenda offered a special deal which allowed me to book the adjoining room as well. Anything I asked for was provided including an early check in and late check out allowing the bridal party some extra time to relax. The entire staff at this hotel helped us to make our special event more memorable. We arrived with decorations which the door staff helped us take to the room. The housekeeping staff also assisted by bringing special treats for Saturday night and providing what we needed to clean up before our departure. The hotel was in a perfect location for our event and it provided a clean, classy and comfortable stay.

Carolina highighted the best features of the city which kept us busy and entertained and James also provided us with knowledge about the city as well as local information to get a better understanding of the best things to do in a short amount of time. This involved taking the time to check flight times, train times, sport schedules. Again, we did not eat at any of the hotel restaurants as we normally llke to try local cuisine and explore the city. We ate at a restaurant called Thai Basil which was so delicious and only a 10 minute walk from the hotel as well as at Marche in the Hockey Hall of Fame Building which serves a variety of foods. The best aspects of the hotel were: - location - comfort of the bed - Concierge service - Business centre in order to check emails and flight details with option of printing off ittems - Standard of cleanliness - Quiet hotel Would also recommend going to see Niagra Falls while in Toronto.

At the last minute, we asked for adjoining rooms over email, and the request was handled impeccably, as were all of our requests.

Moreover the service was quick and the bell staff friendly and efficient. Our plan was to spend the day shopping and enjoying Toronto with perhaps a nice dinner thrown in to boot. Unfortunately, I became quite sick, and as one might imagine, plans changed dramatically. We stayed in for much of the trip and and we down-sized our culinary ambitions. As a result, we did not get a chance to sample the hotel's cuisine, though the menu looked interesting.

It is hands down my preferred hotel. Recently (Early December Weekend) I had a formal event to attend and considered trying a different spot; Intercontinental Toronto Centre, (BIG MISTAKE BTW). Long story short after an absurd amount of rudeness from Toronto Centre I canceled all intentions and went over to speak with the Intercontinental Yorkville. Even the way I was treated during the booking alone made me feel like I was nuts for ever picking a different place. Ok now that I've offered somewhat of a backstory, let's get to the details of the Yorkville Intercon on its own. STAFF: TOP NOTCH! I cannot stress this enough, all the staff very pleasant and kind people. I have yet to encounter anyone working here that was not polite or courteous or respectful regardless of the customers status (student or professional, does not matter everyone is treated exceptionally well). They go out of their way to make sure everything goes smoothly and that everyone is satisfied to the best of their ability. The Front Office Manager (Mr. Rolf Kenda) even came out to greet me and ask if there was anything else needing attending (I thought that was a very classy and nice touch). I also want to mention Mr. Park, one of the employees at the front desk, he made the booking of the hotel a no brainer as far as deciding went. These two gentlemen alone definitely saved my Christmas Formal experience. THE ROOM: I stayed in an Executive Suite (got a room upgrade) and it happened to have been the same one I stayed in one of my previous stays. They had also recently renovated it but it still had its classy charm to it. I had a great view of the ROM and the Royal Conservatory of Music building as well as the City view and despite being so close to traffic it was VERY peaceful. The bathrooms were pristine, the sitting room was very cozy, the upgraded Flatscreen in the bedroom was a nice touch, very luxurious all around. I cannot express enough how comfortable their beds are. I generally have trouble sleeping but every time I stay here I literally am out like a light until I need to wake up. Also, all the rooms I've stayed in here (and keep in mind I've stayed to the best of my knowledge in at least 4 different rooms in this hotel), have all been sparkling clean (I've stayed in the Superior to Deluxe to Executive Suites and all rooms adhere to the same standard of cleanliness). THE AMENITIES: Anytime you make a request, they are always very timely with their services. I needed a few glasses and they arrived within minutes, although I don't know when they started charging a delivery fee for them, that must be new because a year ago that was never an issue, but just a small hiccup and hardly a problem. The Pool has a lovely deck with a view if you go out onto the terrace (although I've mostly stayed in winter so that's not really on my list of places to post swimming haha), I ALWAYS make it a point to enjoy the Sauna and Steam Rooms. The Gym was pretty decent although the heaviest dumb bells they had were 50 lbs, but I guess anything heavier and they'd be concerned about people sustaining injuries, but it would have been nice to have been able to push something heavier. Proof Vodka Bar and SkyLounge Patios are a must if you're looking to grab a few drinks. I love the vibe, its trendy, classy, the bartenders are all very competent and friendly (again an ongoing theme at this fine establishment). Also SkyLounge (Spring and Summer) has a really trendy, sexy and romantic vibe to it. A definite must as far as taking a date or spouse for a few drinks and just enjoying the weather. OVERALL / VALUE: It's sad that the idea of \"you get what you pay for\" isn't a universal truth, but at the Intercontinental Yorkville it truly is and much, much more. Toronto Centre made me want to not renew my Ambassador's Membership after how I was treated but after staying again at the Yorkville Location, I renewed on the spot. I do a fair bit of hotel-ing in Toronto and I figure why not, considering this is more or less my referred location. Every time I stay here, I'm beyond satisfied. When my friends and colleagues ask me to recommend a good hotel downtown, it's really a no-brainer in my opinion.

My preference is for smaller boutique hotels. The location is good if you like to shop high end retail. Holt Renfrew, Prada, Gucci and H\u00c3\u00a9rmes are just down the street with lots of upscale boutiques within a few blocks. (My husband probably wished it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t so easy for me to spend lots of money.) Easier on the wallet shopping at H & M and the Bay is also near by. The Royal Ontario Museum is just across the street if you want a museum to visit which offers lots of variety. Many good and very good restaurants are in the area. Downtown attractions including the CN Tower are further away but can be reached in about half an hour by walking or much faster by taking the nearby subway. It was a $12-15 taxi ride to and from the Four Seasons Performing Arts Centre on a Friday night. The hotel offers the amenities and services expected in a bigger chain which advertises itself as a luxury hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c restaurant, lounge, room service and a small fitness centre with a lap pool. It has a business centre which must be on the second floor with the conference rooms since I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see it in the lobby. The concierge desk is prominent and the staff in the lobby are quick to ask if you need assistance. I tried the restaurant for dinner and breakfast. The choices are not vast and not cheap but the food and service were good. The lounge is very expensive but in the evening was full of lively younger people who didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to be put off by the cost of drinks. Our room, a deluxe king, was very roomy with a sitting area as well as a work desk. The bathroom done in marble has both a tub and separate shower and was spacious and very clean. In room coffee or tea was complimentary as was the small safe. A cash mini bar and snack tray was also offered. The room and bed were comfortable and quiet as the windows faced an inner courtyard and we were able to leave the window cracked open during the night for fresh air. All the housekeeping staff we encountered were very friendly and did a very good job maintaining the room. The hotel is getting a bit dated in some ways. The room we had did not have a flat screen television so common in many hotels now and the two elevators were very slow. Internet connection, not wi-fi, was available in the room but at a cost of $11 per day, when most places now offer internet for free. All in all, my complaints are minor. I would not dissuade anyone from staying here. However, I doubt I would stay again. If I was in Toronto for pleasure, I would prefer to be further south in the downtown area where there are a number of good boutique hotels and closer to more art galleries, theatres and performing arts centres.", "Date": "November 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Long Island (NY)", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location But Not 4 Star\u201d", "Author": "RandJ0806", "ReviewID": "UR86218009", "Content": "I like to preface reviews by saying that I work in the luxury travel industry. So I know that I am nit picky. I also know that if I worked in a different field, it is likely I wouldn't notice some of the things I do. When I was in Toronto for work last year (and at an amazing hotel that unfortunately wasn't available this time), I fell in love with Yorkville. The location of the Intercontinental is its best asset. The hotel's prime spot on Bloor Street makes it worth it - I love the quaintness of Cumberland and the diversity of Yongue Street. The metro is around the corner. I also discovered an amazing bikram studio virtually next door which only enhanced my stay further, especially after a long trade show. (If you like yoga this is one of the most beautiful studios I've ever seen!!) The marble clad lobby looks as though it could do with a renovation. The condition is fine, but the gold accents makes it look a bit dated. My room was inconsistent and one of the strangest I've been in for awhile. The desk chair was significantly chipped and as others have said, the TVs aren't flat screen - the later of which isn't a big deal to me, though I was surprised to see the power button didn't work (remote was fine) and the screen made a buzzing sound at times. The bathtub had a chip/crack in it, although not a big enough deal not to use it. The room looked like it was missing furniture. There was a huge open space that was clearly in need of something and across from the empty spot was a wicker lounge that looked like it was meant for a patio. I'm guessing that at one point there was a couch in the space which must've been needed elsewhere but instead of replacing it, a piece of misplaced furniture landed there. I was surprised there weren't any bathrobes in the rooms, as that is the norm for 4 and 5 star hotels. I also didn't sleep well, though the bed looks like a dream. I thought perhaps the troubles my first night were due to the event I had the following day but even post event, I couldn't sleep through the night. I never have trouble sleeping while at hotels so I'm not sure what the problem was. The hotel directory states that 24 hour room service is available, but if you take a closer look at the menu, in actuality it is from 6 or 6:30am to 11:30 or midnight. I didn't order room service so I can't speak about its quality. Service elsewhere was good. Reception is happy to answer your questions and loans out umbrellas on rainy days. There is a $30 charge if these are not returned. Unfortunately mine got lost at the trade show I was attending, but the hotel kindly voided the charge. I didn't eat at the hotel's restaurant - I recommend Shogun on Cumberland very highly! But if you don't like Japanese, I would suggest a walk along Youngue Street where the options on offer are endless. Really good bubble tea there. I also followed someone else's recommendation from here and had breakfast at Over Easy, which is next door. Yum! Pick this place for its location.

While typically a very expensive hotel, I managed to get a last-minute reservation through Priceline for approximately $125 per night, which I consider a bargain. Having stayed a few times at the Intercontinental in downtown Toronto on Front Street, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve wanted to stay out at the Bloor Street/Yorkville location, as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a much-hyped hotel. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get me wrong, this is a very nice hotel. At $125 a night, it was a grand bargain, however, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth the regular, non-Priceline rate. Parking is expensive, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to be expected in Toronto. I opted for valet parking, as it was only a couple dollars more than self-parking and it came with unlimited entries and departures from the garage across the street. I was extremely disappointed with the rather expensive internet, which should be complimentary if you are paying a couple hundred dollars a night as many guests pay. Several other extras \u00e2\u20ac\u201c turn-down service stands out \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that typically come were missing. I also found the in-room amenities lacking for a hotel of this grade. Only two towels were provided, and they were very rough to the feel and cheap. There was no bathrobe provided, and the toiletries were just the standard offerings. I was opening they would have a higher grade of toiletry offerings. The queen bed itself was spacious and comfortable, but the pillows were horrible. Lighting in the hallway and room could be improved, especially in the rooms. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor was befitting of Bloor Street, but it was ruined by a television from the Ancient Regime. The service was prompt and friendly. The concierge was very accommodating when called upon. I was satisfied with a dinner recommendation that he made, but wished he would have advised it was in the gay neighborhood. My only poor experience was departure when I left an expensive battery charger for my digital SLR camera in the room. I called the hotel four times. The first time I was put on hold by the operator and waited for 10 minutes without anyone picking up. The second time I called the concierge and he called me promptly looked into it and reported no charger was found. I found this hard to believe and called back and spoke with the manager-on-duty. She promised to look into the matter, but never called me back. The fourth time I called and spoke with another manager-on-duty. He was very understanding, but after an hour or so reported that the director of housekeeping himself couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find the missing charger. I assured him that I left it in the room and even provided an exact location. The logical conclusion is that a hotel maid took the item and failed to report it. Sadly, this happens probably at all hotels. And now for some positives, the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s location is outstanding. While it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a tad removed from downtown Toronto and the Financial District, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s within walking distance of the city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best shopping as well as major sightseeing stops such as Queen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Park (the Ontario Legislature) and the Royal Ontario Museum. The concierge advised me to take the subway or a taxi for further destinations, but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind walking and spent most of my time on the city streets walking all the way to the Rogers Centre and Harbourfront. All in all, I had an enjoyable stay that would been better with a few improvements. If you can secure a reasonable rate, I would recommend the Intercontinental on Bloor Street.

So we figured out that we actually got a better deal than the $395/night. We also were given a room upgrade to the executive suite which was very nice. We had two bathrooms and a living/dining room separate from the bedroom. It is in need of some minor updating and one of those spring cleanings that gets every nook and cranny.

There was also a subway station nearby. The lobby of the hotel was small, but check-in was quick and efficient. The decor was luxurious and elegant, but not over the top. I really liked the service in this hotel. They were quick to respond to any request that I or my friends had made. I had brought some food which I would like warmed, and they microwaved it for me (they did charge $3 for warming though as tips, but it was not a problem for me). Finally, the best part of this hotel was their indoor swimming pool located on the top floor. This amenity truly was the icing on our stay, and you must make sure not to miss it! The pool was adjacent to the fitness room and relatively small in size, but the water was comfortably warm and you could see the skyline of Toronto with the CN Tower on the horizon.

Physical location: The hotel is located across the street from the Royal Ontario Museum, and that was one of the reasons for choosing it. This is a relatively small hotel with very little parking to be found in the area. We valeted the car at a nightly cost of $35. There is no driveway/dropoff area; you simply pull up to the front of the hotel when there is a small parking area that is kept clear. The nearby area is dotted with fastfood chain restaurants (McDonalds, Tim Hortons, etc.) Since we were busy visiting museums, we did not venture out to sample the local fare. Physical: The hotel has an on-site restaurant and a bar that serves food. We were upgrade to a spacious studio suite that had a comfortable sitting area and a king bed. The roomy marble bath had a smallish shower and seperate tub. The room was clean and seemed to have mostly new Rattan furntiure. The TV was somewhat small and old. A smallish swinning pool and fitness room are located on the 8th floor. Adequate but little more. Wire and wireless interest are available at a cost of about $12 for 24 hours. Service: The room was serviced daily with a turn down service in the evening. Our only extended contact was with the valet/bellman, who we found friendly and accomodating. Food. We are an evening dinner in the restaurant. The fixed price menu offered three choices of which we tried two and found to be very good. The menu offers three courses and a different wine for each course for $50, which we though to be quite reasonable. The waiter was very accomodating, and since we were the only people in the restaurant, we received ample attention. We ordered a dinner from room service and found one of the two choices to be absolutely terrible. I complained and the waiter brough complimentary deserts when he came to fetch the trolley. A nice touch. A complimentary Continetial breakfast we quite meager, but then it was free. We will likely choose this hotel again when we visit the ROM.

We got a great rate on Hotwire, and were pleased with our room initially. On the Friday night as we were trying to sleep, all we could hear through the windows was loud music from the nightclub below. I think this may be the first time I've stayed on the courtyard side of the hotel, hence why I've never noticed before. It was so loud until after midnight, we could not sleep. Also, we were annoyed by this intermittent sound from the vent or ductwork that resembled an airplane landing in our room. It only lasted about 10 or 15 seconds, but happened about 3 or 4 times an hour, making it a long night of tossing and turning. A call to the front desk revealed they had no alternative room to put us in, which they cannot control, I guess, if they are sold out of our room type. Even for the cheap price we paid, we were disappointed. This hotel is in a fantastic location, in one of the nicest parts of Toronto. Easy subway access,Tim Hortons and Starbucks near by, lots of shopping and restaurants. If you are going to park, use the self parking around the corner on Bedard Street. It was 30 dollars for 2 days parking, instead of 30 plus a night for valet. Also, the underground area of the parking lot has access to the hotel elevators. Overall, not a terrible experience, yet I've had better stays here, and at other nearby hotels. If we could have been accommodated by staff, it may have made it a little better for us, and more comfortable.

As previous posters noted, the Intercontinental Yorkville is well-situated on Bloor Street, near the Yorkville shopping district, the Royal Ontario Museum, and the Royal Conservatory of Music. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central, steps away from a major subway line, and in a good, safe neighbourhood. If you have business in the Financial District, this is a bit out of the way (likewise for concerts/games at the Air Canada Centre and the Rogers Centre), and I would probably choose a different hotel (such as the other Intercontinental). But if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re here on leisure travel or for an event (like the Film Festival), and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a car, you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do much better than this. This is a modestly-sized (less than 10 floors) boutique-hotel, that meets Intercontinental standards (though it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t anything special). Rooms were clean, modern, with fresh facilities (LCD TV, clean bathroom facilities). Hallways are neat and proper, and decorated in a classical style. The fitness facility has a decent size, and the pool area has a view of the CN tower. Rooms that face Bloor Street have a better view of the city (and possibly the CN tower, depending on the floor), but Bloor street gets pretty frequent taxi and garbage truck traffic in the early morning. There is also a condominium being constructed next door (December 2009), but it looks like the exterior is finishing up. If visiting, and had a good deal/Pricelining this hotel, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d strongly recommend this. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one of the top chain hotels in Toronto.

She told me to go ahead with my friends to enjoy the trip to Niagara and that she would personally escort my Dad to our room once it was ready and then she would call me to let me know that he was safe and sound. Very nice service...and she delivered. I was definitely worried but once I got the call from her, she told me that he was fine and then transferred the call to the room so I could talk to him.

My only complaints here would be the shower which had black mould on the ceilings once I turned the light inside the stall on day 2! I didn't see it the first time I showered in there. The only other complaint would be the noise that comes up from the ground floor if you have a room with a courtyard view, which we did. Our first night was a Saturday and the main floor has a vodka bar which seems to be quite the trendy, hopping place. I didn't check it out because I didn't pack appropriate clothing for that type of evening. It can be a bit noisy. On the Sunday night, there was a wedding reception which was even noisier! But all in all, it made for some great people-watching...and you CAN see right into the rooms across the courtyard! My 76 year old father happened to catch some interesting views during the afternoon I was away! He was embarrassed but I thought that was hilarious! The hotel has the lounge and a fine restaurant, but I was plenty happy having some beers and some pretty decent food at the pub located just down the street. There is also a Subway, McDonald's and a pretty busy breakfast place all located right beside this pub...and all of these are across the street from the ROM (which most unfortunately, I didn't have time to go visit). There is also a Tim Horton's just down Bloor Street in the opposite direction. So your food choices are decent if the hotel restaurant is not your style. The fitness center is nice with good equipment, a steam room and a sauna. The only thing that was a little disappointing was the pool since it was a lap pool that was very narrow and only 3 feet deep so I had to wait until the two people that were in there finished using it. There is only room for two people to swim comfortably. Obviously being on the top floor only allows for a certain size pool, but the pictures I saw made it look a lot bigger than it was. The outdoor patio was very nice since I went out there late one night to enjoy the beautiful night sky and the weather. Transportation (taxi) to Roger's Center cost $11 to the game and $15 on the way back since traffic was heavier. More than acceptable and better since they dropped us off at the front gate which minimized walking for my Dad. The taxi to the airport EARLY on Monday morning of a holiday weekend cost $57 with next to no traffic. If you are taking a cab to the airport at ANY other time, ask for the flat rate which will be $55. I figured we could do better than that considering the time we were leaving, but no such luck. As others have stated, the subway is very close which gives you another option to get around. The only reason that I said the hotel was not what I expected was because when I told my friends in TO that I was staying there, they said it was an amazing hotel that all the celebrities stay at when in town. I have been fortunate enough to stay in those type of hotels before (5 Star) and this just wasn't one of those. It is truly a four star hotel. That being said, the service was excellent, the rooms were very comfortable and I would definitely recommend it to others.", "Date": "September 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "darcy4u", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Stay and Vacation\u201d", "Author": "darcy4u", "ReviewID": "UR40026312", "Content": "I was very happy with this hotel.

If you desire or expect that kind of immediate, hands-on service, then there are other hotels in the area that might be more suitable. My request for a quiet room, away from elevators and the seemingly endless condo construction on Bloor Street was respected, and that's what mattered to me. The room itself was spacious and furnished in a tasteful, modern way - with good quality linens on the bed (and a mohair throw in bold orange for a stylish touch!), contemporary art on the walls, comfortable chairs, and a fairly large marble bathroom. The location of the hotel is excellent, almost directly across from the ROM (Royal Ontario Museum), a block away from the Gardiner Ceramics Museum, and half a block from two subway lines. The only possible downsides: even on the sixth floor, we could sometimes hear the subway (TTC) trains; I'm not sure if the sound varies with weather or braking speed or what, but we were hearing them only occasionally, and they were faint, like the rumble of distant thunder. Even so, if you're very sensitive to noise, then this might bother you. The other thing I noticed was that the shower (separate from the bath) was on the small side, not so much as to be bothersome for the average person, but it might not be comfortable for some who require more space.

The least inexpensive room was a studio suite at approx $400 the first night and $284 the second. A bit more than we wanted to spend, but after reading the great reviews, figured what the heck! I had requested an early checkin which was not guaranteed, but was assured the latest the room would be ready is 3 p.m. - we arrived at 3:45 pm and was told the room was not ready yet. The front desk gentleman was kind enough to upgrade us to an executive suite, but it only had a king bed rather than 2 queen. We figured we could manage and at least we could go clean up right away. Got into the room and thought it was very nice - until my 10 year old daughter found a condom on the couch. Thank goodness it hadn't been opened. The bathroom was also dirty. Called down to the front desk and they asked us to hold on for a moment. The Manager got on the phone, apologized profusely and notified me we were being upgraded to the Penthouse Suite. Was thrilled with how accomodating this place was - so we met her at the elevator and proceeded up to the top floor. Although the room was okay, it was not what I envisioned for a penthouse suite that goes for $1600 a night- carpet was fraying all over, rooms looked outdated. Again, the bathroom was dirty, but this time I just cleaned the toilet myself. Then, I pulled the comforter back and found a blood stain on the sheet. Yuck! Called back down and of course, they sent housekeeping which changed only that sheet rather than remake the whole bed. The Manager did send us dessert and vouchers for breakfast - so again, very apologetic and tried to make things right. Next day we went out fairly early and returned about 12 pm. Was surprised that the \"service room\" sign was gone and that housekeeping had come already. Walked in and found all of our breakfast plates and such still on the dining room table, but the bed had been made. Then the final straw - the housekeeper had must of been hungry because she ate some of our leftover breakfast. I could not believe it and decided I really did not want to stay any longer.

The amenities were great (a shower and a bathtub, a wonderful bed where the duvet cover is clearly changed after each guest, great tv, internet access). - So quiet: I didn't hear neighbours and only moderate amounts of \"outside the room\" noise. I am a very light sleeper and this is so often an issue for me Hotel Services: - Room service was great. I have a few allergies, and their attention to that was fantastic. The service was friendly and the food was good. My only complaint, and this is across the board for Toronto hotels (except the one by the Skydome) is the delivery charge + 18% gratuity! I don't mind paying a delivery fee but I would like to be able to judge whether the gratuity is earned or not!! - The workout facilities are adequate. There are several cardio machines, weights, and a few weight machines. There isn't much space for those of us that like to do free weights and ab exercises, but it also was never busy so I can't complain about that. The pool and hot tub were also on the top floor with the workout area but I didn't use them. - Laundry/Dry Cleaning: I had to use these services and they actually had three choices: rush (for one hour or so), same day and overnight! I left them some things in the morning and when I arrived that night the items that needed pressing were pressed and the dry cleaned items were cleaned. Great!! And the price was only about 25% more than I would have paid at home. Location: - It's just around the corner from St. George subway station which is great Subway station... easy access to both the North/South line and the East/West line so whether you are heading downtown or out to the Danforth you are just seconds away from easy transportation - It's in Yorkville! So if good food, shopping and the best spa's in Toronto (Stillwater) are on your agenda you can't go wrong. Park your car and never need it! My only comment for improvement to the hotel is that their restaurant doesn't open until 7am for breakfast. For the business traveler this is too late!

The staff informed us through the intercom that we should be on standby while they checked it out. After a few minutes, they came back on the intercom and notified everyone that it was a false alarm. Had this happened during the day, I would not even waste my time mentioning it but the fact that it happened at 2am was an extreme disturbance. The next morning, we had a letter from the hotel manager apologizing for the inconvenience. Other than this incident, our stay was very comfortable. The beds are one of the best I've had and turn down service was nice. During our 8 days, we walked everywhere and must have walked up and down Bloor Street about 20 times because of all the fabulous shopping to be had. We didn't eat at the hotel restaurant because you can walk outside the door and find so many other affordable choices. I wouldn't hesitate to stay at this hotel again.

Although it can be pretty difficult to get to because of all of the construction across the street at the museum. The doorman was walked greeted me before I could even get out of my car. He was more than helpful. Then when I entered the hotel, the people at the check-in were also helpful. The only negative thing about my whole experience was the parking. The parking is around the block and actually comes around behind the hotel. I think we had to pay about $25 a night. But it is a big city. I won't say how much I've paid in NYC. However the elevator from the lot to the hotel were out of order and I had to carry my bags up two flights of narrow stairs. Besides that, I loved this hotel. First off, it has probably the best fitness area I've ever seen in a hotel. There's a suana and a steam room in the men's locker room. I've never seen a steam room in a hotel. The equipment in the gym area was pretty nice also; treadmills, free weights, and Nautilus machines. There's also a really narrow pool adjacent to the weight room. The rooms were pretty small but that's what you can expect from any major city hotel room. Nice bedding, nice size TV, really nice bathroom; seperate shower and tub. I really enjoyed the hotel which is right in Toronto's SoHo district. It's only two blocks from the subway and two stops from the Eaton Centre where everybody is. I'd definitely recommend to anyone that wants a nice quiet hotel in Downtown Toronto.", "Date": "May 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Point Pleasant, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "Bailey2004", "ReviewID": "UR3802034", "Content": "Stayed for two nights August 15-17. After reviewing all the hotels and reviews, I was having serious decision problems. I ended up booking through hotwire at a great rate. Great location! in terms of subway, traffic and a ten minute walk to the Annex which has numerous restuarants, bars and shops. Yes, it is a couple of miles to the CN tower and the harborfront, but with tourist season in full swing, do you really want to stay down there anyway? We walked down there and took the clean and easily marked public trans back to our hotel. We had a courtyard room. Yes, the hotel is traditional, but with nice touches like the robes, separate tub and shower, windows that open, etc. We definitely slept well there. Avoid the Skyy Lounge...great furniture, good drinks, awful service. Over Easy, which was mentioned in another review was great for breakfast. There is also a money exchange place a couple of doors down. Ballard ballroom, which is traditionally a college bar had great service at the bar for a few drinks. Our bartender was giving us samples of the brews before we decided on which one to drink. If you like Sushi, go to Sushi time. Nothing fancy, but good food, reasonable and cold Sapporo's. Avoid Tim Hortons and visit the Reagle Beagle on Bloor(yes, the same name as the bar on Three's Company) cold beer and good service. Visit Casa Loma, the shoe museum and go the Steamwhistle Brewery at the Harborfront for samples and a tour of their microbrewery...awesome and enlightening! PS...If you take the ferry from Rochester, it is around 16 dollars (CAN) cab ride each way to the hotel. You do not need a car in Toronto.

And what a lovely place it is! We'd booked a package through the Toronto Tourism site run by the Toronto CVB, which promised us a \"superior\" (aka standard) room. When we arrived, we didn't even have to ask the hotel about upgrading us - they'd already done that. Our room on the 6th floor (it's an 8-story building) was perfect, spacious and nicely decorated. It faced the inner courtyard, not the street, so it was very quiet. Bed was terrific - firm but forgiving mattress, crisp linens - really comfortable. Air conditioning worked well, and the thermostat displays temps in C and F. The bay window opened for fresh air. The bathroom was large and clad in marble. Wouldn't mind having one of these at home. The marble shower was little cramped, but no real complaint. The hotel's service was top-notch. Check-in was quick, efficient and done with a smile and a \"Welcome.\" The concierges know everything about Toronto and were most helpful. Once when I called for some information, they answered the phone \"How may I assist you Mr. (my name)?\" Nice use of Caller ID. :) The turn-down service each night, with dimmed lights and classical music on the CD/radio, was classy! The hotel's Yorkville location is the best. It was an easy walk to great little restaurants and pubs and trendy lounges. With a subway station right around the corner, getting around Toronto was a breeze. Indeed, I parked the car when we arrived and never saw it again until we left three days later. And yes, I used the city-run self-park around the corner on Bedford Street. The previous reviews were right on the mark: rates are half what the hotel charges, and the garage elevator takes you right into the Interconti's lobby. The only negative that I can think of is the in-room coffee: it's $4.95 per, which I didn't know until we checked out and found the charge on our bill. Oh well. Also, while the rooftop pool was nice, I wished the hotel had a whirlpool for those of us who prefer soaking to swimming laps. All in all, this ranks as one of the loveliest places my wife and I have ever stayed. No question that this is where we'll stay whenever we return to Toronto.", "Date": "August 21, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Long Island, New York", "Title": "\u201cLackluster.

My group and I were not impressed. First, I found by calling the Hotel three days before the trip that our reservations sans one room had all been cancelled. This even after guarenteeing them via American Express three months prior. After apologies and being reassured the reservations were reinstated, we arrived to two out of the four rooms with one bed each causing four grown men to share two beds for an evening. More apologies and told that the problem may not be able to be fixed due to a full occupancy. After much insistance, we were granted the correct arrangements. Also, the \"Ambassador Club\" (which I joined when I reserved the rooms) ammenities were not delivered. I had to call the front desk (who apologized for the mix-up) to make good. Added to that, the baggage handler lost my \"exclusive\" Ambassador luggage tag. Upon checkout, the bill was incorrect. After much discussion with the assistant manager, I was assured it would be corrected. That remains to be seen. Stay tuned. The hotel was clean, fantasic concierge, the staff friendly however, this was not the luxury hotel I thought I was getting. The bed was lumpy. The decor, dull. The furntiure, very ordinary.

We travel with our dog and the hotel and staff were most accommodating to her, making us all feel welcome. The hotel is right across from the University of Toronto; while there was some construction going on, we were still able to cross Bloor and take her on to the campus for long walks. Additionally, there are nice neighborhoods behind the hotel to walk in, and a small city park within a block. This worked out great. Only down sides: if you travel with a pet they tack on a 50.00 additionally charge \"clean up fee\" for the pet (rather ridiculous in our case, but worth it to be able to have the dog with us) AND they put us in a smoking room on the third floor. I am a little sensitive to cigararette smoke but we were able to clear out any lingering odor easily with the AC (and -- I love this -- you are in a hotel room where you can actually open the window -- how wonderful this is!) The room was large and bathroom REALLY large, with separate shower and tub, marble flooring. Bed very comfy and a true king, which we were promised. We did not get the duvet which they make much of in the advertisement for the room, but bed covers all in good shape. Everything very clean in our case. If traveling with your pet, be aware they have a 50 lb. limit but on a call to confirm they seemed a little hesitant as to what their policy actually was. Be sure to confirm. The hotel itself is not that impressive from the exterior, but don't be put off. The interior, from the lobby on, is beautiful. The lobby itself has beautiful marble flooring, and the Harmony Lounge and Signatures restaurant are beautiful and immaculate. There is also a cute Sky Lounge in the courtyard of the building -- nice tables and lounge furniture to either dine at or just have drinks. Had the best drink I've ever had there -- the raspberry mojito. We didn't find the drink prices out of line for an upscale sort of place. Service throughout -- from check in to concierge, bell men, bartenders -- all excellent -- friendly and nice. Breakfast was included in our rate -- and it was very good. You can order off menu in the restaurant (or eat in your room, from what I understand) and it was delicously prepared and beautifully presented. An excellent value. Bloor Street was a little busy for my tastes, but if you duck into the neighborhoods of Yorkville behind things quiet right down. We did not use the self park option behind the hotel as other reviewers had -- we were afraid our Tahoe was too tall to pass below the gates. We shelled out the 30.00 per night for parking, which we could have done without but couldn't see much of an option. Excellent restaurants in the area, many with outdoor dining (most let you bring your dog with you!) I found Toronto to be MUCH more dog-friendly than Chicago, which we visited in May. Dogs seem to be allowed on every mode of public transit, space allowing -- we took our girl on the double decker bus, the trolley, and the subway. We also went on a fun schooner sail in the harbor which was a great way to see the city waterfront.
