{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Short but sweet stay We stayed at this hotel while stoppping over from hawaii back home to baltimore. We only stayed one night, but we have no major complaints about the property. Although at first we were given a room with two beds after talking to the front desk man we were given a room with one bed at no extra charge. The man was very nice and welcoming and helped us through the small inconvenience. We were able to get a good nights sleep and wake up in the morning to catch our plane back home.We enjoyed san francisco very much and although we werent able to catch many sights we are DEFINITELY returning for a longer stay sometime next year.", "Date": "Sep 6, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR412399896", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "bmoneyman"}, {"Content": "Chambres meubles pas tres chers   showReview(8692177, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 11, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR309081867", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "pthellier"}, {"Content": "Esperienza terribile...   showReview(8550918, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 30, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR641452700", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "hailie22"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60713-d674036-r8668085-Vantaggio_Suites_Jefferson_Square-San_Francisco_California.html", "HotelID": "674036", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
