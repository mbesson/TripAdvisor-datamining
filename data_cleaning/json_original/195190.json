The location is about as perfect as can be found if you want to be near the tourist things in the center of the city. The price is very good for a hotel in Madrid. The staff was reasonably friendly and very efficient. Long distance calls back to the States were very reasonable. I was traveling with a friend who stayed in another room and both rooms were very clean each day. There is a small store about three blocks up the Gran Via (in the direction of the Palace) which had a good selection of food and drink and reasonable prices. I have no real complaints about the hotel but the few things which would be improved are as follows. Granted both myself and my traveling companion are Americans, not thin but not huge and we had trouble fitting both into the elevator at the same time but I realize they have to fit the elevator where it can go without altering the walls of the building. The beds, while clean and adequete are not very comfortable, the rooms are extremely small maybe 16X8 feet, excluding the bothroom. The glass by the bed to control the water (keep it in the shower) does not work well but the tub is great. The walls are very thin. I could hear my friend in the next room coughing. There is an inroom safe which is very easy to use and much easier than having your money, etc locked up at the desk. Nothing really bad to say about this property and the good certainly outweighs my small complaints. I would not hesitate to stay there again. There is a metro stop about three minutes from the hotel. Starbucks (if you don't want a better place for coffee) is across the street and there is a McDonalds about two minutes away. Chuea, big party area, ecletic area is a very short walk from the hotel.

It's in a part of the city where you can feel comfortable walking at night. There's always people passing by without it being too noisy. However, this is almost the only good criticism we have (that, and the porters, who were always there to greet us). The first room we booked had an overwhelming mothball smell and the second one smelled like sewers. Both of our rooms were on the sixth floor. The carpet in the hallways, although it seemed like it was vacuumed, is in really bad shape and needs to be shampooed. The room in itself was decent, just what you would expect from a Best Western room. Although advertised as a 4-star hotel, we would definitely not give it more than a 3.5. The rooms are old and need to be renovated before they can be considered a hotel we'd recommend. The bedheads were really old as well and were not in top shape (and looked a bit unclean). The bathroom in one of our 2 rooms had a bidet and the other one did not (not the problem) but instead had a huge mark on the floor where the bidet used to be. There were small holes in the floor and other holes were covered in sealant that looked like gum. The shower drain was awful and the tiles were cracked in some places. The room in itself was not in tip top shape. That being said, as previously mentioned, the location is great. The hotel is close to everything you need.

They do advertise an airport shuttle, but on arrival at the airport we were quoted a 40 minute wait, and the return journey was at a fixed time every hour, which didn't match our flight times, so we decided for the relatively small additional cost to use a taxi (c. 35-40 Euros each way).

I've seen it hold a max of 4 people, but go up alone when you're bringing luggage.

If you walk down the side street, there are great smaller shops and smaller bars. I was able to walk to all the places I wanted to go, indoor market San Miguel, Sol plaza, shopping, eating, all within 15 mins walk. A bit further, but possible, are the museums Reina Sofia and Prado, etc. probably took me about 30 mins to walk. There was scaffolding in front of the hotel when I was there, didn't bother me, as I didn't want a room facing the street anyways (I was initially placed in a room which did, but it is true, you can hear everything from the street and would get very loud at night). The new room I was assigned to faced away from the street and was very quiet. My single room was small but had everything I wanted, a comfortable bed, a free safe (some places make you pay 1 Euro each time you use it) free wifi in the room (confirm for yourselves if it is free, as I may have gotten a deal with it included) and a fridge and heat/ac control. Traveling solo, I felt very safe walking around by myself and to and from the hotel. Now, the only bad thing I have to say about the hotel is this: every time I came into the room from a days outing I could smell a bad odour from the bathroom, possibly coming from the other rooms' bathrooms via a vent, or possibly the sewage system via the toilet. It wasn't overpowering, but still a smell nonetheless. As my purpose of travel was to enjoy and explore Madrid and the rest of Spain and spend only my sleeping hours at the hotel, this is not enough for me to not recommend the hotel, as I would stay there again.

The biggest problem with this being that we had advised at checkin that we had an international prepaid travel mastercard and would be using that to settle our bill.

Unfortunately they gave us 2 twin beds instead of one double - always a hindrance with a male couple traveling together. We were on a higher floor that had a charming view of Madrid rooftops.

There is a small Juliet balcony but it's the side of the hotel that had scaffolding so it was pretty useless. Being on Grand Via also had its drawback as there was a protest outside an office building across the hotel - you could hear the bullhorns even with your windows closed.

We checked in and were given a room on the fifth floor, I opened the door to find people's luggage in there- there was obviously still someone occupying the room. I went straight down to reception and they were apologetic and gave us another room straight away. We sat at the bar for a drink every evening. Although I didn't catch her name (my Spanish is not very good) the lady behind the bar every evening was lovely and always inviting. I think she deserves a mention! Breakfast was reasonable. I'm a vegetarian and there was plenty of food available for a vegetarian. There were pastries, breads, fruit, yogurts, cereals eggs and cheese. All in all the stay was extremely pleasant.

The entrance to the hotel is on a side street to Gran Via, the most famous street in town with lots of stores, coffee shops and restaurants. You can walk from here to most of the sights and there are several metro and bus stations nearby. Unfortunately in the pedestrian area to the right of the Gran Via metro station there seems to be the red light district. Room: we booked the executive room and I think we probably got the best room in the hotel: on the 8th floor overlooking the Gran Via. The room is pretty small (I expected it to be bigger for an executive!) with ugly PVC flooring but on the plus side the bathroom is very nice with complementary liquid soap and shower & hair gel. The room is overall nicely furnished but the bed is too low and the matrace is only placed on top of it in the middle so there's a big gap betweet the matrace and the wall, which might look fashionable but it's uncomfortable. The view of the room is on Gran Via but they're restoring the building front so there's scaffold right in front of the windows which ruins the view. For our entire stay I have not seen any workers doing any cleaning and painting on the building front. Breakfast: the usual bread rolls, toast, boiled eggs, hams, sausages, bacon, cheese, pastry, croissant, muffin, three types of cereals, fresh fruits but microwaved scrambled eggs and no salads. Ice cubes for the juices was a nice touch. There's also miso soup with rice which I found unusual. Free wireless internet: username and password is provided by the reception free of charge upon request. Even though connected to the network with 2-3 lines, the internet doesn't work most of the time. I constantly have to try to re-connect until it starts working but even then it works only for a few minutes. Lobby: very nice with a bar, comfy couches and two computers connected to the internet (username and password from the reception). I checked in for our return flight on one of them and printed the tickets directly to the printer at the reception at no extra cost. Staff: they get the job done but it wouldn't hurt if they would be friendlier and most importantly if they would smile a bit. What I found incredibly disturbing is the cleaning lady cleaning up in the rooms next to us at 8 in the morning! The walls are thin so I could hear her bump into things, speaking loud and vacuum clean like she was right next to me. Of course on a more normal time for cleaning up when the guests are in the city, like at 12 at noon, her cleaning stuff was on the hallway but she was nowhere to be found. Gym: there's a gym on the 8th floor but we didn't try it.

You can't fit in there with your suitcases. They are slowww... I went to register and asked for a room with view to Gran Via. They gave me a room on the top floor and it smelled like death. View was magnificent but I opened the windows to see if the fresh air would get rid of the smell. Wrong! Add to that, the internet was not working up there. The room was nice, but the smell killed it for me. So I immediately went down and asked for a room change. They said they didnt have any more single rooms with view to Gran Via but at that point I didnt care. They gave me a room with a view to the side street in the older wing of the hotel. What a pleasant surprise! It was considerably older looking than the other room (Decor and furniture speaking) but it was BIG! A single room with a full sized bed, the internet worked perfectly and the bathroom was spacious. I thought they had given me a double room by mistake so I needed to clear that up before they charged up my cc.... but no, it was a single room. The hotel is being remodeled so there are pieces of cloth covering the hallway carpets. The location is excellent, but for such a demanded hotel, two slow elevators don't cut it... do not stay here for over $100 a night... stay if there is an offer. If you are a solo traveler, make sure they put you in a single room on the old side of the building... these are big and comfortable. The other ones are very small. Would I stay here again?

Our room was on the 5th floor, if you are scared of heights ask for a room low down, as the only problem with the room is that if you open the French door style windows, directly below is the Gran Via, and the only thing seperating yourself and the air is a knee high railing. The bathroom was rather impressive and came with a mini hair dryer, although this was not much use, however you can ask at reception for an English plug adapter for no extra fee. The bedroom served a purpose and the beding was cleaned daily, along with the towels.

We didnt eat at the hotel at all as we were out exploring the city, a couple of tips: - If you stay here you won't need to use the metro other than to get to the Airport and Santiago Barnabue, everything else is in walking distance. - Do not bother going out in the evening before 9pm for drinks/food, it starts getting buzzy at around 10.30pm. - A great restaraunt at great value is Turf, which is in the Heurtes neighbourhood in a plaza called Plaza Santa Ana.

The Best Western Arosa is alright, but definitely not a four star hotel, with exception of the prices of the items in the minibar and the prices of the laundry service. They are grossly overpriced. The single room I stayed in was tiny and the smallest ever in a hotel that is supposed to have four stars. The bathroom wan't very large either, but both bedroom and bathroom were clean. As i almost hotels these days, you have to specifically ask if you want a change of sheets and towels. The best abouth this hotel is the great location. Around the corner of the Gran Via, five minutes away from the Puerta Sol and ten minutes from the Plaza Mayor. It is a shame that there are many prostitutes only two streets away who aproach every single male with the offer of a cheap blow job. The police should really do something about that because Madrid in July is much to hot for any of that kind of action. The reception of the hotel is on the second floor and sometimes (not very often) there is a doorman at the frontdoor. The English that is spoken at reception is very basic, but that is the same everywere in Madrid. In Madrid schools clearly don't put a lot of emphasis on learning children foreign languages. In Lisbon or Barcelona almost everyone speaks English, but in Madrid you have to look very hard to find someone who does, even in the tourist industry. Back to the hotel. The elevators are tiny and can only hold up to four (not to heavy) people) at the same time and less if you have luggage. Don't bother with the breakfast. It really is worth \u20ac13,95. There are enough places closeby that will provide a decent breakfast for around \u20ac5. And do visit on of the shops of the Museo the Jamon near the Puerto Sol. Beer, wine, sandwiches (ham, chorizo, cheese), all for \u20ac1 an item. But you have to stand at the bar. For someone used to the standard of a Best Western the Best Western Arosa in Madrid is a bit of a disappointment.

I found this property to be very much of a mixed bag. Now don't misunderstand; I'm not a total novice a European hotel standards. If you look (as I have) at other Madrid hotel reviews, you see a recurring theme; room size, noise and lack of customer courtesy by the staff. This place had ALL of these issues, but I only cite them as a negative when they go beyond what I consider acceptable even given the location of the property.On the plus side, the common area and reception were very nice and in good shape, my room (such as it was) was clean and the cleaning staff did a good job keeping up with it. Also, as others have pointed out, it is in a very central location. On the negative side, however: my single room was a tiny monastery-like cubicle, without the good beer. Literally maybe 6 x 10 feet, and with a bed hard enough to fit in county lockup. That wouldn't have been a huge issue, though, if it wasn't for the noise. The location of this property (just off Gran Via) was a real negative in terms of traffic noise, and you can hear ALL of it like you were on the sidewalk with newpapers covering you (in fact the bed was somewhat similar to a sidewalk). I actually was given a room with a balocony overlooking the street, which was nice (heck, the hotel staff may have even thought that they were doing me a favor), but even on the 8th floor, the noise at night was extreme - and I am not one of those light sleepers. That was not the worst of it, though. My room was also right next to the maid service room, and you could hear every bang, thud and creak coming from there. I can attest that they were a hard working bunch that kept extemely long hours. Finally, I also want to echo what has been reported by other reviewers; the hotel reception staff is quite unfriendly. This to me is unforgivable. WHY would someone go into the \"hospitality\" industry if they couldn't at least pretend that they liked people?? I mean, look....we don't need to go pick out curtains. I just expect a modicum of courtesy and professionalism, rather than sighs of \"I wish I was getting a root canal\" when I check in. Come to think about it, I'm changing my rating to two stars. All in all, if you get this place at what passes with the current exchange rate at a good price, I guess you could consider it, but i know there are better places for the dollar in Madrid, becuase when I cencked out of here (after 5 days), I checked into one, where I;m currently staying. This place has some smaller issues, too, but as far as room size, noise and friendly staff; much, much better. Last two points: the complimentary wi-fi was in good working order and quite fast. Also, the breakfast was pretty good, too (although at 13+ Euros not free, but not unreasonably expensive for a hotel meal).

If you are travelling at the weekend; it can be very busy; make sure the agent books your tickets next to each other; because in our case she booked us completley in different carriage and sitting areas; luckyly realised it before the departure and changed it. One of the places you should try to eat is Museo Del Hamon; abundance of cured meat; cheese (Oveja and Manchego is the main ones); wonderfull succulent calamaries; fish dishes and lovely warm baked bread in the premises. This place is always busy; non stop; the food is alot cheaper then the other similar delicatassen places. If you eat at the bar is cheaper then sitting down; it's entirely up to you. I find it sitting down more comfortable and enjoyable.

If you are looking for a hotel just to sleep and in a good location - this is it! I would say the hotel itself is a 3 star, but I give it a 4 because of the location. I stayed in a single room for about $60 US dollars per night. When I checked in I asked for a quite room (reviews say Gran Via is very loud, which it is). The clerk gave me keys to two types of rooms and let me choose. The 1st room was not on the busy street, quiter, but VERY OLD and run down. The 2nd room I chose was facing Gran Via, but much nicer with hardwood floors and a larger bathroom with full tub/shower (not very common in Europe). Gran Via is loud and sirens go on all day and night (fire station a few blocks away), but the views are great. Every morning I would wake up and stand on my balcony and just look at the craziness going by. The location really is great. Starbucks and H&M are right across the street from the hotel. A few blocks behind the hotel is blocks and blocks of shopping and restaurants. Plaza Mayor and Puerto Del Sol are a very close walk (window shop along the way). I might stay here again, just because it was so inexpensive and clean and did the job...but if you are looking for somewhere with more atmosphere, then I would look elsewhere. The lobby area is very outdated and no action. I pretty much just showered and slept in the room. If you are looking for a great plaza that has the biggest concentration of Tapas Bars, walk about 10 minutes to Plaza Santa Ana. Its super crowded at night and has lots of action going on. METRO DIRECTIONS FROM AIRPORT: It was very easy to take the Metro - 2 euro ticket. About a 40 minute ride.

Breakfast was not included in my room price but it was a reasonable E13 for a good selection of hot and cold dishes with fresh coffee. Wireless internet is complimentary. However, the location is both a benefit and a problem for the hotel. While it is convenient, it is noisy. Although the room windows seem to be well-insulated, it cannot prevent the loud Madrid traffic noise from disturbing your sleep. Madrid is a very noisy city so if you're a light sleeper, ask for one of the few interior rooms that are situated further from Grand Via or stay elsewhere (but ask about street noise). Also, the between-room insulation was not be adequate because I could hear muffled discussions from neighboring rooms. Even an interior room may not help a light sleeper at Arosa.

It was an excellent experience all round and I can recommend this hotel without reservation. We were allocated a room on the 8th floor which had an outside view of a side street and Gran Via. (Room 812) It had been refurbished in Japanese style and was smart, well equipped, clean and the bathroom was very impressive being all black, cream and chrome and very well equipped. Bed linen was very clean, firm bed was comfortable. Towels were white and fluffy. The only slight thing I could say was that the bed was in Japanese style and was very low and wouldn't be suitable for anyone elderly or with arthritic joints as it was quite a job getting up and standing up from it first thing in the morning! :-) We had a 'sort of' balcony, a little wrought iron grid across but nowhere to step out on. Check in staff were excellent as were the door staff. The lifts were efficient - one is extremely small and a bit claustrophobic! You can always wait for the larger one if it's a problem...... Rooms were very quiet and ours was air conditioned which meant we could close the French doors at night. We didn't use the mini bar - and were disappointed there were no tea/coffee making facilities. We didn't eat in the hotel as we thought 14 Euros pp was very expensive for breakfast. Over the road at Pans & co they do a breakfast deal for just under 2 Euros which was excellent. We ate at night in a restaurant called Ribs which was just around the block behind the hotel. Great steaks! The great thing about this hotel is the location - it is smack bang in the middle of everything and the excellent hop-on-hop-off bus stops right opposite (by Pans & co) We spent a day on that - swapping lines and the blue line goes up to the Bernabeu. The stadium tour at the Bernabeu is one of the best - possibly THE best - I have ever done (and I've done San Siro, Nou Camp, Man U, Maracana and many others) I booked the bus tour online and it was all very easy. It really is the best way to see Madrid & get bearings - and the buses are VERY busy all day long. (If you are on the top deck in October - which is really the only place to be - it is quite windy, take a wrap) We endorse the comments made by other reviewers about the area beyond Macdonalds up the Gran Via - *very* dodgy with a high police presence and a lot of beggars & working girls. No-one was aggressive though. When we arrived I had booked online for Aerocity and was extremely annoyed to be told to 'wait 5 mins' at their desk and then this kept being repeated.... After 30 mins I started to become angry and after 50 I told them to forget it and got a taxi (40 Euros, not cheap) The hotel reception were extremely helpful about it and rang Aerocity and they apologised profusely and assured us they would be there for the return journey. They were in fact 10 mins early and were fine going back. Knowing Madrid better now and knowing how close the Gran Via metro stop is to Hotel Arosa I would most definitely use that next time. I was extremely impressed with Madrid - the buildings are fabulous and the whole ambience of the city is good. It is also extremely CLEAN. We just didn't have time to do everything eg go in the Prado and so with East Midlands airport on our doorstep and cheap Ryanair flights we shall be returning to do the museums and galleries and also to go further afield to visit L'Escorial, Segovia, Toledo and maybe even Seville.

However, Spaniards and other Europeans don't eat a breakfast like North Americans do. One more thing, if you are in to bullfights, then you'll want to go to the Corte Ingles and ask where to get tickets. Unlike the websites we paid 6.50 euros per person and it was great. The subway from Plaza del Sol to las Ventas is only 1 euro each way and it took 6 minutes to get theres. ONE FINAL THING, the bellboys were very heplful when it came time to weigh my luggage.

The closet and drawers were also large (much too much for a single person!) and there was even a safe to put valuables in it (you need to run your credit card through it to use it). Best of all was the location: literally 50m from the metro station (which is located near a McDonald's), and if you take a walk further down the street it's located you end up right in the middle of the shopping district that leads up to Metro Sol: within five minutes you have access to all branches of the El Corte Ingles stores (supermarket section open until 10 pm -- good for buying supplies for the next day or for dinner) as well as movie theaters (the glorious Callao theater included) within walking distance. Be aware that just on the other side of the McDonald's is a less savory area that you should not walk down alone if possible: even though there is a police presence there it can be intimidating for a first-time traveler.

The Metro is the only way to travel, buy a 10 stop ticket, we bought one of these between the two of us and it lasted for our whole stay of 3 nights, well worth it for 6 Euros with the 1 Euro supplement from the Airport. The open top bus is well worth it and you can swap and change from the red bus to the blue bus, although we thought the red bus tour was the best. The Palace and the Mayor Plaza were both lovely places to visit, the atmosphere while visiting here was so relaxing and while walking and sitting around you seem to go off into your own little bubble! The main park on the tourist map with the boating lake is also a fantastic place to loose yourselves in, with a picnic you can spend the whoe day in there and you must hire a rowing boat an incrediable 4 Euros per boat for 45 minutes, an absolute must, so romantic if your with a loved one.

Booked by my partner as a Christmas treat I was slightly dubious when I read some of these reviews but they were all unfounded! It is literally a few steps from the Gran Via where you have access to the Metro, MadridVision (the open top tourist bus)and local transport. But mostly unnecessary as most things are well within walking distance - Sol, Plaze Mayor etc Our room was fabulous! We were in 529, obviously newly refurbished with the biggest bed seen outside USA! Easily able to avoid partners snores.......... Really modern, chrome and white bathroom with powerful shower and decent sized towels. Only down point here, two large mirrors were both in bathroom and obviously steamed up after a shower! Note to Best Western - move one of them to bedroom - ladies don't like putting make up on in the reflection on a picture! We didn't experience noise from outside and it was good being able to look down on the hustle and bustle of busy Madrid. Breakfast was OK (served 7 - 11) but we had it included in our rate. Lounge very plush and elegant and drinks served here were very reasonably priced. Yes, reception is on 2nd floor and lifts were tiny but does that really matter....... Only serious problem we had was the advertised Courtesy bus to and from airport. Upon arrival at airport we asked at Tourist Info where it stopped and were duly advised where and that it was 'on the hour'. This was a ltttle long for us but it was a beautiful day so we decided to wait. After about 25 mins a Best Western bus arrived but the driver told wouldn't take us (he was picking up people for another BW hotel) but told us that the Arosa bus went from Terminal 4! We were in Terminal 1! We then got the public bus (No. 200 and 1 Euro fare) to the centre of Madrid and a taxi from there (9 Euro). Coming back we booked the shuttle the day before and paid our 2 x 9 Euro fee. This bus then dropped us at Terminal 4! This might not mean much when reading this here but it's about a 20 minute bus ride between these 2 terminals! A free airport bus transports you around but I would certainly consider another option if travelling in and out of Terminal 1! Thinking about it now, it may have been worth 'tipping' the bus driver from the other Best Western hotel to take us - it was only over the road from the Arosa. Think it was called the Atlantic! As regards eating out in Madrid, its mostly tapas type places so you need to know what you're doing! We eat at the Botin one night (reportedly the oldest restaurant in Spain if not the world!)and it was excellent. Bit of a touristy place (Hemingway eat here) but worth the effort and experience - approx. 100 Euros with wine for 2. Booking is advised. All in all it's a wonderful city! We took a 2 day pass (19 Euros each) for MadridVision to cover the 3 tours (historical, modern and monumental) and this was excellent value for money. First day we used it for the actual tours and next day we used it to get from place to place. Having said that, it's a fairly compact city and walking is also a good way to get around.We loved the Palace and Opera House area and it was lovely sitting outside here on a warm March night watching the world go by.
