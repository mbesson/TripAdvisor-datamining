Despite this, The Upper House has exceeded anything that I have previously experienced, or could have imagined, of a hotel. The hotel itself is very beautiful, with tranquil spaces and elegant decor. The rooms are remarkably large for Hong Kong, and the full wall windows allow stunning views. Each room is actually effectively four rooms, with a large living room/bedroom + dressing room + bathroom (with enormous bath, more view, TV and amazing shower) + toilet. With the heavenly Ren toilettries, although I'm in HK for a conference, I feel as though I have had a week in a spa. The location is very central, and the hotel is on top of Pacific Place shopping centre and Admiralty, so travel anywhere via MTR (the super efficient, clean, safe, easy to use train system) is so easy. It's 10 minutes in a taxi to the HK Medical Conference Centre (and about AUD$8), for any doctors considering where to stay for a conference. It's the Staff which really make the hotel so special, though. The Staff go beyond being willing to do things to improve your stay to actively seraching for ways to do this. There are many examples in the reviews, but I've had two experiences in particular. I was expecting a parcel to be delivered from a shop, and it did not arrive. I rang the concierge to ask whether anything had been delivered, and they asked the name and location of the shop. They then rang the shop, ascertained when the package could be delivered, arranged for this, and rang back to confirm with me. I over-shopped, and asked the staff about posting items home. They arranged for three different sized boxes to be left in my room, then arranged for the boxes to be weighed, and costed different ways to send the items home. Super impressive. If you're considering where to stay in Hong Kong, stay here. It's perfect for leisure trips, and have made my business trip an absolute pleasure. You'll be so glad that you did. I may well have to be dragged out.", "Date": "September 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Potomac, Maryland, United States", "Title": "\u201cVery cool hotel.

I once called the Four Seasons in Hong Kong here in Tripadvisor the \u201cHarvard\u201d under the hotel management, but this one is the Stanford. In terms of quality, it\u2019s a bit the Olympic gold race between China and the US, not sure who wins the most gold medals . I arrived at HK airport and was forgotten to arrange for a pickup by the hotel. I called my contact person at the hotel and with the blink of an eye I was tapped on the shoulder by the hotel driver, ready to bring me to Upper House in a fashionable Lexus SUV (doesn\u2019t that tell you all? Something different from the Rolls Royce that The Peninsula Hotel sends to pick you up). In terms of comfort and services, this hotel is among a select group of contemporary, trendy hotels in the world where elegance, guest service space and luxury is the predominant mindset of the hotel staff. All you can possibly think of is here, well almost, that is. Two exceptions that would make it even more attractive, no Spa and no swimming pool, but actually that is not too big a deal as the hotel is gladly providing a day pass for swimming pool at the nearby Shangri-La hotel. For an eclectic traveler this is a very good alternative to the Four Seasons (more for business) or the Ritz Carlton (Kowloon). More accurately I think I prefer this hotel over the FS and RC in Hong Kong. Located in Pacific Place, close to Hong Kong Island Central, yet more quiet and conveniently close to the Pacific shopping mall and nearby JW Marriott and some restaurants and cafes. The hotel reception starts at the 49th floor (where does that remind me of? Park Hyatt in Tokyo - remember \u201cLost in Translation\u201d?) while you being greeted on the ground floor by a very welcoming staff at the lower level at the hotel entry. You will be escorted to your room where you will find a whole array of modern amenities, among which a Illy espresso machine and tea boiler, the fridge is filled with cooled drinks, beer is free, as is water and soda drinks, wines and other selection of drinks are available against a price lower than what you normally being charged at major hotels. Even milk is available free for those (like me) who love it. And if you like sweets, chocolate M&Ms, Milano cookies, nuts are free and will be refilled every day. The small service unit provides cutlery, nice China cups, a teapot and even a toaster. The bathroom is very spacious with bath and (rain)shower, a nice subtly lighted wooden art piece and comfortably big towels. One slight criticism here, the mirror lights in the bathroom aren\u2019t particularly attractive (they might you look bleak, athough there is a switch to lower the color). The beds are, unlike what incidentally was mentioned by another guest in Tripadvisor, very comfortable, soft, yes they are, with soft feather pillows (want a different pillow, I am sure Guest services will provide it). I stayed in a \u201cStudio 80\u201d on the 48th floor on the \u201chill\u201d side as the harbor view is not was it used to be anyhow (mostly cloudy and grey at this time of the year). A dressing-walk-in room with nice bathrobes (I have been told they are a favorite in the hotel\u2019s shop), a large Samsung LCD TV screen, wifi - included in the price \u2013 and speakers with sufficient equipment to hook up your iPod, iPad or other mp3 device for your music to be played both in the room as well as in the bathroom. The beds are Four Seasons quality ,as are the pillows. The ultimate service was when housekeeping came to change the inner part of the curtain rails into ones that do not let in any light in the room (I am sensitive to light coming in the sleeping room). Superb! The hotel has a very nice restaurant (I heard Swire, the group owning this hotel) hired a New York chef) and lounge at the same level as the reception, 49th floor, a popular place for having late afternoon drinks and a subsequent lovely dinner, overlooking colorful high rise buildings, glowing in the evening light (like you only have in HK, if you are lucky with the smog and weather). Two small things that are not available which would make this hotel the absolute contender for best hotel in HK, are the lack of a swimming pool and of a Spa, but as said that is being arranged for in the nearby Shangri-La hotel. If you want the Lexus hotel car is available for rent (be it against a pricey ticket, more than 70 euros for the hour). The staff goes out of its way to make your stay wonderful and does things many hotels do not offer (which hotel sends a bell boy to accompany you to find the nearest bank?). Overall this is the sort of hotel that has set a whole new standard in the hotel business.

The rooms are understated luxury with wonderful views of Hong Kong; the bathroom is amazing ... ... ... imagine a deep bath, with natural light flooding in from the large windows, remote control at your finger tips for the TV situated (secretly) behind the mirror panel. Our time at the Upper House was as if we were at 'home' with complimentary minibar and wifi - expresso coffee maker and the most wonderful selection of teas are provided for when you need that extra lift. There is so much more to this hotel that I would run out of superlatives - you open up a drawer and are delighted to find crockery and cutlery, another drawer a toaster was found. Yet another drawer in the desk produced a small scissor, correcting fluid, 'post it' and a eraser. As well as the comfortable luxurious bedding the hotel management have thought of all that their guests might require; it is a philosophy that other hotels would do well to also take on. Breakfast was most enjoyable at Cafe Gray, compliments to the chef and the staff for the food and service. I would also recommend the Cafe Gray Bar - take time to relax, spend time with friends and take in the incredible night views across Hong Kong.

This was a very pleasant surprise after our extremely disappointing stay at the Ritz-Carlton Hong Kong just a few weeks before (see review). The Upper House is in a great location at Pacific Place - the best place to be on the island other than Central. It's a short MTR ride from the Airport Express Hong Kong station - or a short taxi ride if you have bags. The hotel was previously the Marriott residences before a major refurbishment by the Swire Group a couple of years ago. It's also managed by Swire Hotels. Our room was very large, well designed with wonderful views. It had a comfortable sitting area and massive bathroom. After a long flight I just loved taking a relaxing bath, gazing out at the view and catching up on a bit of TV secretly housed behind a mirror panel. So unique to enjoy a hotel bathroom with amazing views and natural light. Luxury bedding, complimentary minibar and wifi are other features to enjoy. We stayed in a Studio 70 room. The whole hotel is exquisite - with thoughtful well executed minimalist design. The artwork throughout the hotel is superb. The technology in the rooms is cutting edge. The service was excellent - so nice to be taken to our room for check-in. There is a beautiful library and a lovely cafe/bar area with extensive views of Hong Kong. We will definitely be returning to the Upper House next time we are in Hong Kong and would highly recommend it as one of the best boutique hotels we have ever enjoyed.", "Date": "June 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cOne of the best hotels\u201d", "Author": "catb14", "ReviewID": "UR132705077", "Content": "The hotel was amazing.

Upon checking in I wondered why he was so ga-ga about this place. Having stayed at the Shangri-la across the road and Marriott under Upper House, my initial reaction was very much neutral. The hotel is in the same Pacific Place complex as Marriott, Shangri-la and Conrad, doesn't have a swimming pool, has a small gym on the 48th level and a restaurant on the topmost level - 49th. Enough, I'll now explain why this hotel features in the top 3 in HK. Firstly, for business travellers the free high speed wi-fi access is a great boon, most other hotels in this category charge hefty fees. Secondly, the mini-bar (which they call maxi-bar and stocks beers, juices, sparking water) is compliments of the hotel except for the wines. Thirdly, the smallest room of 70 sqm is bigger than most hotel rooms in HK; I had a king sized bed, an L shaped sofa in the bedroom with a writing desk, iPod loaded with music and connected to the jewel speakers in the room. The bedroom opens into by far the largest wardrobe, bathroom area I've seen in any business hotel. The bathroom has a shower area and a bathtube to the side facing a TV for leisure. Now coming to the service, the check in is the best that I've ever come across, you don't have to wait in queues at the reception, one of the staff comes up with you to your room where you can relax on your couch with your welcome drink whilst he runs you through the check in procedure on his iPad. I had requested for a few sachets of English breakfast tea and guess what, every night, I had 4-5 sachets of English breakfast in my cabinet. Also, on the first night, I removed all the water bottles from the bar to ensure that they revert to room temperature as I am not in a habit of drinking cold water, from day 2 (and I stayed there for 11 days), all water replacements were left out. They clean the room in the morning but return for turndown service in the evening where they draw the curtains in the bedroom and bathroom (make sure that you do so because the glass is see-through at night). Water is placed beside the side of the bed where I slept and bathroom slippers neatly placed underneath. Cafe Gray has superb views of HK and Kowloon harbour. The breakfast options are extensive and the dinner was quite good. They have an extensive wine collection. The restaurant and the bar are open to non-hotel guests as well. The only recommendation that I do have for the hotel is to give another phone on writing desk that is a regular wire-connected phone. The reason I say so is because on the first night my wireless phone was not connected properly. I couldn't make any calls and had to use the phone in the restroom. The next evening I had to call a hotel representative to the room who came and connected the phone and I could then only make calls after the cordless had charged. Would be nice to have a back up in the room. All in all, wonderful service at this boutique, highend business hotel.

As the staff say \u2013 our house is your home. This was certainly the case from reservation through to post-stay follow up. An exemplary experience. No wonder it has been included in the 2012 Conde Nast list for best hotel room in the world. We are very regular international business travellers and the Trip Advisor contributors gave us confidence to stay here for a short vacation \u2013 and we had high expectations. The hotel surpassed these. Nothing was a bother, everything done with a smile and thought. Whether it be organising a booking at a nearby top restaurant (and unbeknown to us organising a premium window table) to booking four people into Cafe Grey for dinner at 30min notice on a Friday evening to supplying a zippered travel bag to use for extra luggage. The rooms are HUGE (by any city\u2019s standard, but especially in Hong Kong). More like an apartment with a large privacy door between the dressing, bathroom and toilet area. The insulation was so good that you could not hear anyone from part of the room/suite or guests in any adjacent rooms. Although contributors have kindly shared their photos I have added only one (of the view from window). At check in we were met by Paul who personally escorted us to the room and gave an orientation. Complimentary bar fridge, Illy coffee pod machine and snacks in appropriately named containers (like \u2019yummy\u2019 for the baby M&Ms). Wonderful REN products through the bathroom and a giant bathtub (including bath salts and grooming products) with separate TV to watch or listen to your ipod. There was also a huge walk in Vichy shower. A real treat. Although we ate at a number of top restaurants, we found Cafe Grey (on level49) to have a very high standard \u2013 both for breakfast and dinner. Very generous and wide range of choice for breakfast, good coffee (hard to find in Hong Kong) and wonderful dinner (the salmon and chicken main courses were highlights for me). It was a different world to the adjacent Marriott hotel. More intimate, calm and personal... and for a similar price. To me there was no comparison.

Ok. I don't blame you if you read this and figure I work at the Upper House... or my brother-in-law Moe is the General Manager... or I have some vested interest in the property. Well, I don't, he isn't, I don't. Now I can riff. The Upper House is hands-down THE BEST boutique hotel I have ever experienced. In the opinion of this seasoned, world traveler, it is one of the BEST hotels, large or small, in the world. Upon arrival my wife, son, daughter-in-law and I were warmly and sincerely greeted by staff... awaiting us at the Porte-coch\u00e8re. Our first glimpse of the property was the warm and inviting entrance. Dancing modern flame posts-lights illuminated the stone sculptures and raked grey-sand Zen gardens. Our \"dedicated\" greeter seemed to know us. At the Reception Counter the General Manager happened to be there (where wasn't he we later realized... everywhere at the same time it seemed... the very best type of management at a property like this... I call it \"management-by-walking-around.\"). He and our greeters had a momentary discussion, she then said, \"You are a family. We don't want to put you in two separate rooms. We want you stay in our Penthouse at no additional charge.\" Really!?! Our rooms (2 of them) were Studio 70 rooms, looked beautiful but they were The Upper House lowest-cost room type at HK$4500 per night. These folks were upgrading us to a HK$30,000 per night Penthouse at the Studio 70 price so that my family could be together. We neither asked for nor expected anything. WOW. We were escorted by Peggy (the Pleasant) up the long escalator to a secondary little lobby. Beautiful stone sculptures abound. More flaming post lighting. Past a Starbucks-like private cafe counter (for hotel guests). Even the elevators were beautifully appointed with soft lighting and artwork. We were shown to Room 4805. The hallways were softly and warmly lit. More sculptures... and into the Penthouse. Un. Be. Li. Va. Bull. The Penthouse was magnificent! Warm, inviting, comfortable furnishings. Two beautiful bedrooms. Views of the harbor and the city and the peaks (almost 360 degrees). The bathrooms were large with room-sized showers, large soaking tub, great amenities. They brought us tea and pastries. The room had a well-stocked bar (all free except the wine), gourmet cartridge-type coffee machine, cannisters of candy bars and bags, Milano cookies, granola bars, and more. The sound system and much of the room functionality it controlled by an iPod Touch. Fantastic, comfortable, quiet, spotlessly-clean, well-appointed rooms. The staff could not do enough for us throughout our stay. We asked where an ATM was... they walked us to it across the street. The GM stopped by at our breakfast table the first morning. We chatted for 20 minutes. He kept referencing things to do and see... then he just walked away and returned with a Luxe tour book box-set which he asked us to accept with his compliments (that's about a US$25 set). On the last night of our stay (my son and his wife were staying two more days... and The Upper House insisted they stay on in the Penthouse) we found two fine-quality leather tote bags in the living room, each with a beautiful, boxed, scented candle gift wrapped inside the tote. And did I mention the warm milk and homemade cookies set out every night in our rooms? I just can't say enough. I've stayed at three other fine hotels in Hong Kong in years past... all 5 star... all with impeccable reputations and truly great service/rooms.

I stayed in Hong Kong for 8 days in 3 hotels. The first couple nights I stayed at Marriott near the airport which was pretty good too but very standard room in Hong Kong. Then I stayed one night in Hyatt in grand central and that experience was pretty bad because the hotel is really old and the suite was really small compared to the money spent. The remaining nights I stayed at Uppder House and the experience was EXCELLENT. ROOM: The room is double of the size compared to the regular rooms in most of 4 or 5 star Hong Kong hotels although half of the room is used for bathroom space. I love the free snack and drink bar especially when I returned to the hotel late at night. The Hotel uses \"REN\" skincare products and I LOVE IT! They gave you one cosmetic bag full of REN products everyday even though you don't finish them. I had harbor veiw 70 room and the view is really amazing. I also loved the sitting area next to the huge windows over looking the ocean. I had my coffee and snack early in the morning or late at night looking at the view and listening to the iPod jazz songs the hotel provides. They also provide free wifi. SERVICE: The customer service is amazing too. I had a package delivered oversea and the front desk helped me to track it while I was out. When I returned, it was sitting on my desk already. Anything I asked, they figured it out for me with very professional manner. FOOD: I went to the 49th floor for breakfast and I wouldn't recommend it. There are TONS of good food out there. The breakfast was fancy but wayyyy over priced. LOCATION: Excellent location. It's right next to Marriott and connected to Pacific Place which is one of the stops of subway, but it has the quietness outside of the busy mall. In my opinion, the location is great. The ONLY thing I am a little bit disappointed is Upper House is sort of like an \"Apartment\" not really a \"hotel\", so it gives you lots of comfort feeling of a \"home\", so maybe that's the reason they don't have pool and spa. Therefore, I went to spas at both Mandarin Oriental and Ritz-Carlton. If you don't care about the 116th floors ocean view of Ritz-Cariton, you should consider going to the spa in Mandarin Oriental which is much better. I love their extra facilities and relaxation room.

A place where the most beautiful design meets the most impressive and ultimate comfort. It's also a place where you'll find a dedicated team trying their really best to anticipate all your needs and providing the highest standard of service. Consequently, it's really hard to find a sanctuary and more especially in a city where, usually, people are always in a rush. A sanctuary is also a kind of cocoon, a \"home sweet home\" where leaving from is so hard... It's something so special like a gem and when you find one, trust me, it gives a very amazing emotion... A few days ago, maybe i've had one of the most incredible emotion of my life cause i not only find a urban sanctuary but THE urban sanctuary, the place i consider as the most fantastic city hotel of the world where everything has exceeded all the expectations. First of all, The Upper House is superbly located between Central and Causeway Bay, up to the most elegant mall of Hong Kong. It offers stunning views on the bay but on the city as well and do not think the mountain view is uninteresting cause all the rooms facing the mountain offers a green breathtaking scenery and actually this is maybe my favorite view cause it's so relaxing. All the accommodations of this very special and exclusive hotel are just amazing. Starting with 700sq. feet, all the studios and suites will be a peaceful and very elegant retreat during your entire stay. The Upper House has been designed by the very talented Andre Fu and the result is more than exquisite. The choice for materials is excellent and you'll fall in love for the scheme of colors melting light green with purple, grey and bright wood. Everything is beautiful and just unique and what to say about the bathrooms... I almost lost my voice the first time i saw the most sexiest bathrooms in the world with an elevated water area with a deep bathtub and a fabulous view on the city. The Upper House is also the place where you'll find the most exclusive amenities ever. A very good selection of REN products but a very special comfort kit as well comparable as the one you could find in the best Airline First Class, a beautiful shopping bag and a very practical travel bag. I've been just impressed by it and hot milk and cookies during the turn down service is really well thinking. I loved the complimentary maxi bar with jar of candies and cookies replenished every day. very very special... So, let's say i've been again so satisfied about this hotel which has a very important space in my heart. However, after my first visit, THE urban sanctuary as i like to qualificate this hotel, i complained a bit about the service which was not as good as i expected. This new visit erased the impression of my first visit a few years ago. Now, the team of The Upper House is absolutely amazing. Each person working in this hotel is incredibly nice, friendly and professional. They really don't stop to try their best to make your stay unforgettable and memorable. Everybody will greet you by your name with always a nice word. It's remarkable how great is the improvement and the management team headed by Dean Winter is simply fantastic. The Guest Relations manager Paul is adorable and he really makes our time in this property the most delightful time of our life.... I really want to thank all this team for this great job. Now you understand that a stay at The Upper House is one of the most special thing to do in a life. Nothing can be better in Hong Kong, in Asia, in the world. This property is the most beautiful possible and you'll be treated as somebody very special at each second of your stay.

I certainly did not regret doing so. This is a fine hotel by any standards. The staff are young and eager to please without being obsequious and the check in and check out procedures are effortless. The hotel is peaceful and relaxing, the rooms wonderful (previous reviews have said it all), and the sole restaurant, Cafe Gray, a haven. Breakfasts were always a pleasure, as were the two dinners I enjoyed. The hotel is a triumph of both style and substance and any criticism seems churlish - just occasionally though style wins over substance. For example, if you want to watch TV when in the bath (and why ruin a good bath ?) then you have to sit at the plug and overflow end, with associated discomfort. Also the positioning of the washbasin in the loo cubicle is bizarre - it's far too close to the seat and would have been better placed on the opposite wall. These are, however, truly minor strictures in the context of a wonderful hotel which I would unreservedly recommend to the business traveller. One last point -it's location on a one way circuit serving 4 hotels means that at peak times it is difficult to get a cab. The staff recognise this and go to extraordinary lengths to commandeer cabs at the start of the circuit much to the chagrin, I imagine, of the other hotels.

Over the years I have been a regular at The Mandarin Oriental and have also used The Landmark Oriental, The Island Shangri-La, The Conrad and The Grand Hyatt. What makes The Upper House special is the sheer size and luxury of the rooms and the outstanding staff. This was our second stay and we had booked a 70 square metre harbour view room. We were upgraded to an 80 square metre harbour view but asked to be downgraded again. The 80 sq. m. rooms are at the ends of the building and the one we were shown looked out on to other tall buildings - by contrast the 70 sq. m. rooms we have used were in the centre of the building with very good views of Victoria Harbour. The \"maxi bar\"is well stocked and the bathroom and dressing room are great for wallowing in. If you want large marbled reception areas and big pools and gyms, this hotel is not for you but if you want a centrally located luxury hotel and really don't need much more than the room this is worth considering. It is not cheap but prices are in line with the other centrally located hotels on Hong Kong Island and the rooms are much bigger. The staff are young and enthusiastic. Somehow they seem to remember your name and nothing is too much trouble. Breakfasts in Cafe Gray on the 49th floor are not cheap - around USD 68 for two - but are from an a la carte menu (no buffet) and cooked to order. If you want a cheaper option there is a coffee shop (Cova Coffee) on the 4th floor of Pacific Place mall on top of which the hotel stands. There is also a cafe that serves breakfast at geEAT (that's how it's spelt) which is attached to the food supermarket in the basement of the mall. The rooms have kettles, coffee maker, toaster, cutlery and crockery so you could always buy your breakfast from the supermarket (the shop opens at 10.00 a.m. but the cafe opens much earlier) and eat it sitting on the sofa of your room gazing out over the harbour.

My friend suggested the Upper House, and I tried. It is located next to Conrad and Marriott, but had a definitely different atmosphere and a bit like a hideaway. The hotel makes you feel like a special person, and they treat you that way with personal attention. Upon arrival, I had reserved a standard room, but somehow they upgraded me to a huge suite. The standard room is already large to begin with, but the suite was huge. I had 8 guests come over to spend in my living room, and we all sat on the sofa very comfortably. The bathroom was surrounded by windows and I enjoyed the panoramic views while bathing. I was told not to forget closing the automatic shades when bathing after dark... The rooms are very simple designed, and thats what I like. But the amenities were very stylish and they even offered playing cards... The mini bar was all free, and they had candys and chocolates, and toilettry kit for takeaway. I loved the bathrobe, so I decided to buy one. There were few areas I found needs improvement. The carpet was stained, and some staffs seemed unexperienced. I had to wait more than 5 ringtones until the front desk answered my call. But all these were covered by all the positive aspects. The real downside for me was that they had no swimming pool and a tiny fitness room, but I was so busy that I did not have time even if they had those features. So if you are bringing children who wants to play at the pool, this is not for you. I was there for business, but I definitely would want to return next for holiday with my wife. They have a nice restaurant called Cafe Gray Deluxe, but I thought it could be better. The hotel is located by the cliffs, and my room had spectacular views of the bay, the city, and the mountains. It is near Admiralty on Hong Kong side, and just 5 minutes away by taxi from the convention center. If you want the hustle bustle excitement of Tsim sha tsui, then I don't think the location is very convenient, but if you want a quiet and peaceful atmosphere, I would recommend the Upper House. Its close to the financial district too, so good for executives on business. The rates are quite expensive, and some writes that its not worth what you are paying for, but even if I was not upgraded, I will still be satisfied with what I paid.

The first and most notable thing is the staff - every member of the team is attentive without being overbearing, they go the extra mile, they respond to every request quickly and efficiently and with professional enthusiasm, PLUS the hotel is so well managed many things that contribute to a comfortable stay have been pre-emptively thought of so you don't even have to ask. Some small but random details: The hotel is immaculately clean without ever smelling of cleaning products. I am allergic to dust and mould and also to chemical frangrances and the upper house housekeeping team do an incredible job. They have good quality tea in silk bag tea bags in the room - this is a small but noticeable detail and a huge improvement on most hotels providing paper-bag Liptons or Twinings. They provide elegant unisex toiletry travel kits in the bathrooms with excellent REN face products, hand sanitizer, mouth wash, toothbrush etc. There is a decent nail file and nail polish remover wipes. They think of EVERYTHING! They chose REN products for the shower, body and hair care, plus bath salts and oils. REN is a high quality beauty brand made from natural ingredients, with no synthetic fragrances, perfect for anyone who is sensitive to chemicals or has allergies, plus just a quality product in general. My husband loved the products too. Finally, and rather obviously, the hotel's design is exquisite. Elegant, calm, modern clean lines, the space is both aesthetically beautiful while also very comfortable and functional. Something very special about the rooms - there are huge corner windows in every room due to the unusual shape of the original building. Our suite was generously sized (1200 sq feet is HUGE in a city like HK) and each of the three main rooms had a huge corner of windows, making a total of 6 walls of windows. It was truly spectacular. Plus the hi-tech aspect of the room makes it very comfortable, everything can be controlled either from an in room I-Pod system or a simple button control system by the bed. I can only remember one other time when I experienced this level of hi-tech ease, it was in a Tokyo hotel years ago and from memory the Upper House system is even more sophisticated and user friendly. Allergy/chemical sensitivty extra notes - Positive: they provided me with allergy free bedding which was great. The rooms have some carpeting but are mostly hardwood floors. It is immaculately clean and I could not notice residue of fragrance or chemicals in the linens or in the rooms or elsewhere on the property except Level 6 - discussed below. Minor Negative: There is no chemical residue or fragrance anywhere except in the level 6 area where you can sit and have tea inside or go out into the \"secret garden\" and lawn area. This interior space where you must walk through to get to the elevator to reach your room each time has some heavily fragranced candles burning. This is unfortunate but at least it is the only space in the hotel where they seem to burn scent or if they do burn candles elsewhere then it is the only place where the scent gathers to a degree that I notice it and it makes me headachey as I pass through. Every other common space seems to be scented candle free. Perhaps they could burn 100% essential oils instead of chemically perfumed candles? Then there would be a therapeutic aspect to the scent and almost no-one would have an adverse reaction, generally even the most sensitized immune systems and allergies can handle essential oil scents. The location is great, quiet/calm yet still very convenient. Public transportation is close by, or take short cab rides anywhere you might need to go in Central. The hotel is walking distance to all random conveniences and services you might need in Wan Chai (VIM pilates studio, Murray River Wine shop, next door to the wine shop a great inexpensive laundry service, on the same street a small health food/organics store, other small stores with fresh fruit & vegetable juices). The restaurant is very good. I ate 1 lunch there, 1 dinner with friends and we always enjoyed the room service hot breakfast. There is high tea but I did not have it. This was our honey moon and the Upper House did EVERYTHING possible to make it a memorable and comfortable stay. We received a complimentary upgrade to a spectacular suite and it really made our trip. The actual suite was huge and gorgeous but also the generosity and thoughtfulness of the upgrade also made it special. Every level of management and staff seemed like the were always taking that extra step to make sure you have everything you need - we spent in total 7 nights at the hotel on 3 occasions, coming in and out of HK as we made side trips to other places in Asia and every time we checked back in to the hotel from being away they had earl grey tea waiting for me (with soymilk on the side) with either cookies or chocolate covered strawberries. Our bags which we had left behind were already in the room waiting for us and the allergy free bedding was already on the bed. That level of efficiency and thoughtfulness really made an impression on me and the Upper House stands out as my best hotel experience not only of this trip but of any hotel ever. I have stayed at various Amans (all gorgeous and fantastic in their own way) and numerous other excellent hotels, but the Upper House has managed to make such a strong impression on both my husband and myself for the extra small details - they just get it right!", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles area", "Title": "\u201cExcellent experience at Upper House\u201d", "Author": "Kate133", "ReviewID": "UR123070723", "Content": "Fabulous ending to three-week SE Asia vacation.

Everything from, sofa, desk, wood paneling, in-room scultures, fine tiles and natural stone, lighting, the bathroom rain shower and tub, to the overall size of the room can not be describe by words alone. The Upper House truly belong in the upper echelon of luxury hotels for its design and for it's 5-starred service. At peak hours, it can be very difficult to hail a taxi (even with the help of the staff in front of the hotel), as most taxis are taken by customers of the much bigger JW Marriott next door to the Upper House. The Ipod in our room never worked properly even though it was replaced by the staff once, and the wood floor does tend to creak a lot as you're walking on it. If you opted not to buy the daily breakfast package (at Cafe Gray Deluxe), there are many other options in Pacific Place Mall downstairs or you can give Cafe Gray a try as we did one morning. The food is very good (fruit compote of mangoes and berries was excellent). Throughout our 5 days at this hotel, we were greeted everytime by everyone from housekeepers, drivers, clerks, bartenders, waitstaff with a warm smile and a greeting. I was particularly sensitive to the bad service habits of some Asian service providers towards other Asians customers, but I was pleasantly surprised that none of those old, outdated attitudes were found at this hotel. We were made to feel welcome and we were treated with respect and smiles.", "Date": "December 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cStay there everytime when I need a hotel\u201d", "Author": "P_edmund", "ReviewID": "UR120943833", "Content": "Stayed there last weekend for my birthday!was awesome!!

For me, perfection in terms of a hotel product. Small hotel hospitality adds an entirely new experience to hotel travel, and if this is the Swire brand of hospitality, I hope there will be much more of it. This is a hotel that you do not so much stay in, as become a part of the experience. The space in the guest room is pleasantly neutral giving the feeling of floating in to the environment and existing within it, versus fitting in with the room. Bright, light, airy, floor to ceiling glass, oversized space, thoughtful comfort, unobtrusive design and decor. A guest room that you really have to find good reasons to leave, so pleasant is the existence inside the space. The overall property also demonstrates that you don't need an abundance of everything to make a memorable experience. The food and beverage offerings are limited by comparison to many hotels in terms of number of outlets, but in this case less is more based upon, again, the quality of the space as well as the fare on offer. The working desk and the bathrooms are a clear standout, although this is unkind on the rest of the room experience, which really leaves nothing to be desired from the quality of the bathroom amenities through to the supersoft bath robes. The single comment that I felt could deliver a real improvement for the business traveller; a matching business desk chair of the quality of the rest of the room. I daresay, then I would never leave. I didn't have the cause to interact with the staff of the property to a high degree, but the occasions when I did so were polite, professional and efficient, and with a genuine interest in the welfare or the experience of the guest. However, not needing much help from the team for me is also a compliment to the thought around the overall product. It's all at your finger tips. Congratulations, Marcel and the team. It's not easy to get the product and service mix so well balanced, and as such it deserves to be recognised. I'll be back. Many times!

I get a bad back but it was perfect, it just ate me up. The room also had a yoga mat, umbrella, the best wardrobe space I've seen with soft closure drawers. The aircon worked perfectly and no noise. It was a touch entry system into the room and if you had your 'do not disturb' sign on it glowed through the wood outside the door. Housekeeping were very efficient. I would go on about the bathroom but the photos are everywhere for everyone to see. It is THAT good. The design and layout is genius.

It is pure luxury with great service from great staff. Depending upon your reason for visiting HK, its location could either be good or bad. Its primarily a business hotel located on top of the JW Marriot hotel, however with its own small entrance and foyer next door. Located in Pacific Place it is some distance from either the subway or the ferries. Local shopping is also some distance away, however for those who want desinger shops, the Pacific Plaza is opposite with every possible top level store represented there as well as some excellent eating places. Being small also means that it is quiet, however we found the Cafe Gray on the 49th floor full of business types and very noisy, making a quiet drink or meal out of the question. The rooms are large for HK standards and contain all the mod cons that you would expect. Very comfy bed and complimentary mini bar were highlights. A full length bath with views out over the harbour was a delight. My only gripe was that there was no buffet breakfast, but rather an expensive a la carte service which also makes for a longer wait if you are in a hurry.

The VIPs are greeted by name on arrival and taken to their suite at the top of the Hong Kong skyscraper, panoramic views of the harbour surround them as the hostess checks them in on a hand held tablet PC. You would be forgiven for believing that this is the opening scene to a James Bond Movie as this is exactly how I felt as we were met by the immaculate staff at the Upper House. I booked the Upper House during a stopover on the way to Australia for our honeymoon and I wanted to try something else rather than the Four Seasons, Mandarin Oriental and the Peninsula. Our preference is for modern boutique hotels and the Upper House is the epitome of this genre. As you will notice from the date of our visit, (a year ago), this review has been submitted time late. This has allowed me to stay in several hotels in various locations world wide since our stay at the Upper House and I can report that it is still head and shoulders above anywhere I have stayed to date. The suite features an Audio Visual System that allowed me to stream music through the internet to every part of the suite, an ipod touch featuring local information and the ever popular Espresso Machine and MaxiBar (free sweets and chocolates). The hotel is in a central location on Hong Kong Island, allowing us to easily make our way to the major attractions and destinations of the city by MTR and Taxi and the tower is also attached to a high end shopping mall if that is your diversion of choice. Waking up in the morning, opening the electronic blinds at the touch of a button and having an espresso watching the city of Hong Kong come to life below you is a memory that will stay with me forever. There are many more details to our stay such as the cookies and warm milk brought to our room shortly after arrival, the complimentary toiletry bag, the extra luggage holdall, the glossy coffee table books about the history of Hong Kong..... these are just a few. The entire experience was sublime and made us feel like the most important people in Hong Kong.

This is my second time of staying over at the Upper House, and I have to say the problem I discovered during my first stay didn\u2019t quite dissolve, but instead I found other problems that made me want to say something. First of all I don\u2019t think I need to say anything about the d\u00e9cor and spacious size of the room. I know it is very rare to have such a huge room in Hong Kong, but since there are so many new hotels opening in China, I\u2019m very spoiled with all these cool modernly designed hotels with giant rooms, which is why I wasn\u2019t considering too much about the space they have is any special. And then it\u2019s the breath-taking view that some of the guests loved. I think you often would find it very interesting just looking out of the windows if you don\u2019t live in somewhere with such surroundings. But I live in Shanghai so this again isn\u2019t anything new to me. Anyways, none of these is want I want to comment about. What I really want to say is that I don\u2019t find this hotel very comfortable to stay with, especially the soft mattress that the centre part sinks down a little. I already felt it the first time and made a complaint to the hotel. They sent some staff and put a piece of supporting board underneath, but it didn\u2019t help at all. I don\u2019t have a back problem so lying on a softer bed won\u2019t cause me any pain, but what about someone who does have back pain and also the older people? During my second visit it was the same situation again, and this time both my other friends who stayed with me together also felt the same way. Another unpleasant thing is the air-conditioning system. The three of us woke up a few times during the night either feeling cold or sweating. I must say this 24-hour-all-seasons-around-air-con-on situation is everywhere in Hong Kong. Everywhere we went the air-con was on cold even people on the streets are still wearing jackets and boots. I strongly suggest the Hong Kong government put up a regulation on air-condition usage like Mainland China did years ago that no public air-con system is allowed to go lower than 26c in summer. It\u2019s definitely healthier and saves a lot of energy too. To be honest I can\u2019t say the bad situations I encountered is the hotel\u2019s fault, but rather is the investors\u2019, who probably should have put in better quality beds. The hotel guest-experience manager later on called several times to apologize and sent us free fruit and lavender spray to help us sleep better. Perhaps they can tell the investors to buy some new mattresses? Another thing that bothered me a little is the breakfast menu with quite limited selections. The food wasn\u2019t top quality either. It was really one of the few moments I said to myself that I wish I stayed in a different hotel. Despite all of the problems I met, I still feel that the staff there are genuinely trying to help their customers. This made their service quite memorable to me, but do I want to give up my good-night sleep? I don't think so.", "Date": "April 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "greenwich, ct", "Title": "\u201cWhy stay anyplace else???\u201d", "Author": "Greenwich_CtLcp", "ReviewID": "UR100995548", "Content": "This hotel exceeded our expectations and then some.

I was expecting quite a lot from this somewhat new hotel, as it has been recommended in a few travel magazines and won some interesting awards. So after staying some nights at Langham Place Mongkok, my partner and I crossed the harbour to The Upper House for a one night stay before flying home. Location: Not many people know where or what The Upper House is, even the locals. I get more than a few raised eyebrows when I tell my HK friends I'll be staying at The Upper House, so it was half expected that the taxi driver didn't know of this hotel either. Not a problem, since I asked him to take us to Pacific Place. He dropped us at the entrance to the mall on the 4th floor, there were no signage or large logos that tell you where the hotel is, so after asking around for a few minutes, was finally directed to the lobby. It was next to Marriott, but do look hard, even the entrance is somewhat obscure. Location of the hotel is ok - not terribly fantastic or exciting. However, I assume it will be good for business travellers, since it is located right in the middle of the business district, and one MTR station from Central. Below the hotel is Pacific Place shopping centre (not exactly below, but perhaps located in the same building but no direct access, you will have to get to the next building to get to the shopping centre - you get the idea), an upmarket mall which isn't all too different from IFC in Central, but much smaller. I'm not one who spends much on high end brands, so the shopping centre didn't interest me much. Around it however provide some different shopping options, but it will require a bit of a walk to get there. All in all, didn't think the location was anything to write home about - take the MTR to Causeway Bay if you want more options. Check in: When I stepped into the 'lobby', I approached one of the staff to tell him of the booking I had. Other staff around didn't appear to friendly, which is somewhat strange as I expected the service standards to be better. My check in staff was pleasant however, he escorted me to my room on the 38th floor and showed me around. The check in was finalised with the iPad. A quick tour around the room was provided - the staff was trying very enthusiastically to wow me with all the features etc, but all I wanted to do was to get some rest so I couldn't wait for him to leave. Not a problem again, I understand that some guests will need a little orientation given the features of the room and the hotel (not that there was many - more to come later). Room: When I stepped into the room, I wasn't wowed by it as I thought I would be. The ceiling was low, so it felt a little claustrophobic. The interiors were done tastefully, subdued colours and a lot of wood, it felt comfortable lounging around in the room. I have to add that the hotel was very huge, quite rare for HK hotels. They provided a semi-free mini bar, all snacks and drinks were free less the wines and champagnes. Snack selection was ok - cookies, nuts, M&Ms and sweets. I thought the M&Ms and Mentos sweets were cheap however, given the price paid for the rooms, I expected better quality stuff. Coffee and tea were provided, although not Nespresso, but it was acceptable. Drinks selection were the standard choices, although I wished they could stock up on more water. Ah, the bathroom. It was the highlight of the room. The bathtub was huge, and provided a stunning view of the HK skyline. Nothing beats taking a bath in it after a long day out, there was a television if you need something to watch. The standalone rainshower was great too - overall the bathroom was simply breathtaking. Amenities provided were of good quality - REN skincare. There was a pouch to take home with you too, excellent if you are taking a long flight after the stay. The bed is very comfortable, had a good night's sleep in it. The air conditioning in the bed room was not working well however, so I was feeling hot after being under the sheets for 15 mins. Had to open the doors to the living room and bathroom to get some cold air in. The wood in the bedroom was a problem too, as it creaks when one walks on it, so it was difficult to get to the bathroom without disturbing my partner sleeping. The lighting controls in the room was terribly difficult to use. In a bid to be minimalist, minimal controls were provided. There were no individual controls, and I had a hard time trying to understand how it all worked. Frustrated, I gave up after a while. The air conditioning was mediocre - the minimum temperature you could set was only 21 degrees, not enough for someone like me who likes his room cold. Views were fantastic, looking out to the harbour, and at night, the lights made it more beautiful. The numerous glass windows made the room special, and I loved how you could fall asleep amongst the skyline, or just chill with a drink looking out after a day out. Some nice touches in the room were provided, such as complimentary playing cards, a few coffee table books, iPod touch to play music etc. It was however lacking in some amenities however, e.g. iPod dock, DVD player etc. These ought to be standard amenities, given the quality of the hotel. Hotel amenities: There was a lounge at the top floor of the hotel, opposite the restaurant. Some good selection of graphic books, but that was all to it. The fireplace was supposedly a highlight, it was nice, but unimpressive. No drinks or snacks provided at the lounge, which is a pity. There was a gym just one floor below, a small and cosy gym, with some cardio machines and a few high tech machines. There were some free weights too. Free earphones to plug into the cardio machines were provided, together with towels, water, apples and muesli bars. A garden was located at the lobby level, again, the design is minimalist, nothing much except a few lounge chairs. There was free WiFi provided throughout the hotel, the speeds however was somewhat slow. Not acceptable as high speed internet is very cheap in HK. Service: If there is one thing this hotel is lacking, it would be the service provided. Staff were generally indifferent, they didn't bother any greetings, except for a few who were pleasant and warm. One gets the feeling that they were somewhat stuck up, and this added to the whole 'cold' feeling the hotel was giving out. Check out was quick and easy, they will automatically charge to your credit card once you check out, no papers to sign etc. You can view the bill on your television screen if you like; a good idea since I was rushing to the airport. Check out staff were miles friendlier, so they did redeem themselves a little at the end. Overall, I cannot help but get the feeling that this hotel places too much emphasis on design but not on the experience itself.

Positives: * Very efficient and welcoming booking process. The concierge/guest experience team seemed to go well beyond the call of duty by asking what could be done to make the experience better (they provided a DVD player in the room so we could watch DVDs for example). They organised restaurant bookings in their own place and elsewhere in advance. They also noticed that it was my partner's birthday and asked about his interests so they could buy an appropriate gift * Friendly checking in procedure. No paperwork, it's all done in the room on an ipad. Can imagine some people might not like that but this particular girl was chatty and friendly, and we were in no rush so was fine * Well appointed room. The hotel is new, so there wasn't any shabbiness. Very automated with remote control lighting and curtains etc. For Hong Kong, it was very spacious too. * Views on 38th floor. They do make a fuss about reminding you to shut the curtains at night so that others can't see in! Helpful as it can be easy to enjoy looking out when at that height * Good food in their restaurant (can't remember name but it's on the top floor) * Wireless internet and free mini-bar snacks and soft drinks. Nothing rubs us up the wrong way more than extortionate charges for these in normal hotels. It was one of the main factors in booking this hotel originally! (it was a debate between this and the mandarin oriental) Cons: * I specificially booked a harbour view room, since my partner loves it (we used to live in HK), plus we got engaged in front of it. But it wasn't really visible unless you stood in the far corner of the room and looked round the side of the building. Naturally I assumed that this couldn't be the harbour room but didn't want to make a huge fuss (they had said the hotel was fully booked) - also we were recovering from NYE party (!) However, I did double check this when checking out (you don't receive a paper bill to check these things so I had to ask). I was told it was a 'partial harbour view' room. I disputed this and after a bit of attempting to get out of it (\"ah but it's a larger floor size\".. \"it's the same floor size as the city view room of the same category, which is cheaper\" etc.) and checking the internet booking form to see if I was lying, they conceded the difference. I did double check this had been corrected when I received the bill via email, and it had * I had to ask three times for extra drinking water to be delivered and it never arrived. Not great after a New Year's Eve weekend in Hong Kong * When changing the TV in the bedroom, the remote control activates the TV in the bathroom. Bit annoying when either a) you want to watch different things in different rooms, and b) it doesn't always work and you end up watching one and overhearing another, or one doesn't turn off when you shut down for the night. Not a dealbreaker, but didn't seem well thought out * Another small issue, but there is a separate mini-room in the bathroom for the toilet. The huge bathroom has a light switch but I personally don't feel the need to light an entire mass of space just for a tiny cubicle, especially at night when the other half is sleeping. If they could add another switch in there, maybe with a dimmer even (!) then it would be an improvement. Again, not a deal-breaker * Location is ok, and great in the grand scheme of Hong Kong. For a tourist that wants to do all the designer shopping it's great, right next to Pacific Place. Can be a bit difficult to find at first as taxi drivers don't know it, but you just need to tell them it's next to the Marriott (by Pacific Place). Can get out at the Marriott lobby, it's about 10metres away * They didn't actually provide any gift to my partner! After all the emails back and forth I was quite looking forward to seeing what they came up with. There were a few things wrapped up (branded pen, notebook etc) which I thought must be the gift, but when we checked out there was a big bundle of similar looking presents so maybe this was the christmas/new year thing they did. There was also no card of mention of his birthday during the stay so they must have forgotten it. Not a deal-breaker again, but gives the impression they are not totally on top of their game. Overall, it was very good and I would recommend it. If I had a choice between this and the Penninsula, I'd definitely choose the latter - for a start, if you book a harbour-view room, you actually do get a harbour view room (and it is amazing). A hotel like this doesn't need to resort to those sorts of gimmicks to get a few extra bucks out of its guests. For the other 'cons', I'm tempted to give the benefit of the doubt as it's new. But I would hope it sorts them out and doesn't end up one of these 'style over substance' trendy hotels.", "Date": "January 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong", "Title": "\u201cIt was my birthday - so they gave me a birthday cake.

The rooms are spectacular. We booked the cheapest one and found it was really a suite rather than a room. It didn't face the harbour but still had a fantastic view all the way from Admiralty (near the centre of town) to Causeway Bay (to the East). This is because the floors are so high up (we were on the 42nd floor) and enhanced by almost floor to ceiling windows. The decor in the room is very contemporary with lots of natural materials used in its fixtures and fittings. The bed was king size and comfortable. The bathroom was very stylishly decorated and has a separate bath and (rain) shower. For convenience and privacy, the toilet is in its own separate part of the suite. The bathroom has electric blinds controlled with a special remote (so you can open and close them from the bath if like!) There is also a TV recessed into a wall above the bath. It is possible to listen to the audio from the bedroom TV in the bathroom. So, if you want to watch the bathoom TV, first make sure you turn down the volume on the bedroom TV using the buttons on the wall next to the bathroom's (double) sinks . Otherwise you will hear audio from both TVs at the same time. The rooms also have a \"maxi\" bar i.e. a super sized mini bar. All the contents are free, except the wine. This is a great idea that I wish other hotels would follow. It means you don't feel ripped off if you decide to take something from it - because, in effect, you have already paid for it. Of course, it also means that you are more likely to make the best of it before you leave! The hotel restaurant breakfast was delicious and very plentiful. It is served as in a restaurant and not a buffet, which I much prefer. It is well worth adding this to your package.

This excellent property occupies the last top floors of a building which is divised with an other hotel but each has its own entrance and management. Marvellously designed by Andr\u00e9 Fu, one of the most talented Hong Kong interior designer, The Upper House is like a cocoon in the middle of this vibrant city. Right away you'll get in the lobby, you'll be very surprised but impressed as well by the elegance of a decor very pure, so actual and ultra comfortable. To be honnest, i don't think i've seen such a wonderful design over the globe and despite my numerous experiences in five stars properties. Mr Fu is really a great artist. Concerning the rooms (\"studios\" cause the smallest one is not under 70 sq. meters...) and suites, you'll find the same atmosphere of pure elegant design with deep carpet, clear wood and large windows overlooking a breathtaking view of the mountain or the harbour. We have been allocated in a Studio 80 with a gorgeous view on the mountain side, a green scenic view we can't forget... But inside, everything was simply fabulous with a lage L-type sofa, a bed so exquisite you'll do not want to move, a complimentary mini bar with a good selcetion of soft drinks and candies and cookies, everything is a very tasteful scheme of light green, cream and grey colours. We felt a bit like being at the top of a tree and this impression is totally relaxing and just unique. But the most impressive part of our studio 80 was the bathroom full of deluxe amenities and even a travel kit full of great skincare products you'll be able to bring for your trip back home... The bathroom is a living room in itself with a dressing area, two large sinks with a perfect lighting and a few steps going to a stand alone bathtub with terrific views and a TV dissimulated behing a mirror. For people who prefer an energizing shower, no problem, you'll have a perfect rain shower available in this exclusive space. So, if there was only the design and the comfort, let's say The Upper House would be the best city hotel over the globe with a very good value if we compare with Mandarin Oriental, four Seasons or The Pen and which is able to offer a different experience. However, in an hotel, there is also the service and unfortunately, this is on what The Upper House has to work. We haven't found a great staff and first of all, on arrival, very messy, not especially smiling and not really efficient. Why not to escort us to the first floor where there is a large sitting area, simply beautiful instead of asking us to wait on a not comfy sofa located right next the the door. We have been waiting for about 15-20 minutes, time for them to find somebody to escort us to our room but we didn't feel perfectly welcomed and this is unfortunate cause it gives a disappointing impression of an hotel so beautiful. However and fortunately, the guest relations manager who escorted us was nice. However, at the restaurant, the staff is arrogant, not friendly at all... They don't wanna make customers happy and they act like in this kind of ultra trendy places i hate. Each customer has to be treated as the same and not only the VIP... Moreover, the breakfast wasn't really good, at least under the expectation you can have of such a nice place. I've talked about these problems with the management but none of them seem to be very concerned despite of a few cookies, hot milk with a GM message placed in our room as a kind of gesture... Why \"hot milk\"??? I don't know... Oh i forgot, we received a candie and an umbrella as gifts on departure where staff was a bit more efficient but i regret the GM didn't call me... To conclude, yes, i still recommend The Upper House i consider as the best hotel in HK. At least simply for the decor which is just impressive and the comfort absolutely unparralelled. So i just hope the service will change and become more professionnal and nice and if yes, in that case, The Upper House will be a urban paradise...", "Date": "December 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cLuxury hotel right in the heart of Hong Kong\u201d", "Author": "mschoe64", "ReviewID": "UR88586515", "Content": "Very trendy and modern luxury hotel, great rooms, very spacious, everything felt brand new, fantastic service (as almost everywhere in Asia), definitely worth trying when you are in Hong Kong.", "Date": "November 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Spring Lake, MI", "Title": "\u201cService, views--and SPACE!\u201d", "Author": "jackandstace", "ReviewID": "UR86607534", "Content": "Spent 2 nights on a business trip to HK in the Upper House.

We have taken lots of photos and plan on replicating it the next time we build. The service is very professional and first rate. The restaurant is very good with a good selection to choose from. I wish every check in was so simple and easy. No stopping, straight to your room. Love the iPod and being able to order room service electronically. How many hotels offer free mini bar including chocolates, biscuits and drinks? We used very little but that's not the point, we could of and that meant something. It's centrally located and close to everything.

A self-confessed Four Seasons Hong Kong junkie, I thought that no hotel could ever match its impeccable service, stunning location, unbelievable facilities and F&B. Boy, was I wrong. Upper House just blew me away - exceeded all expectations and then some. I had more OMG moments in this smallish, stunning boutique hotel in the very convenient Pacific Place than I care to remember. Let\u2019s start with reception: nice and discrete ground floor welcome, warm and enthusiastic without being gushy from an impeccably groomed and professional team. It also smelled gorgeous. We were terribly early (7:30am) and not expecting our rooms to be ready. No problem at all, and a suite upgrade to boot! Immediately whisked away for a comfortable in-room check-in, we had our first OMG moment \u2013 the jaw-dropping views of HKG harbour. Then we focussed on the room, HUGE barely describes it. Sprawling more like it, and oh so comfortable. More OMG moments followed \u2013 the fit-out and interior detailing all extraordinary. Beautiful timbers, impeccable craftsmanship, easy to operate touch-button controls for everything; brilliant lighting, TV and in-built sound system wiring the iPod to all rooms, including bathroom. A minibar with complimentary beer, soft drinks and juices \u2013 there is a God! And oh, what a bathroom \u2013 two rooms actually, one with twin vanities and TWO inbuilt dressing tables and stools, separate loo and more space than you\u2019ll every use; then into a corridor, up some broad, flat, LED under-lit stairs to the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance, the \u2018bath\u2019 room. A free-standing, centre-of-room bath surrounded by picture windows with HKG and its harbour spread beneath you. Covetous REN products complemented this spectacular offering. Tucked behind, a large cubicle with rain-shower seemed almost superfluous but equally inviting. It was then off to Caf\u00e9 Gray Deluxe for breakfast and service that was so sharp and on-the-ball it almost made you weep with joy. Highly attentive, knowledgeable and thoroughly accommodating, staff could not do enough. You knew they really cared. Needless to say the food was beyond delicious and the coffee, without doubt, the best in town. We returned later for afternoon tea (book through a Virtuoso travel agent and it's complimentary, as was the room upgrade) and the best I\u2019ve ever had \u2013 so contemporary, flavoursome and original it puts all the others to shame. Sorry Peninsular, your high-tea is well and truly trumped here. The adjacent bar proved a knock-out venue for cocktails that evening \u2013 very pricey but with the level 49 views and supremely comfortable all-window nooks it was incomparable. The interior design and comfort here and in the caf\u00e9 brings more OMG moments. No, there is neither pool nor spa at Upper House, only a small but useful gym. No big deal though - I popped 20m across the road to the Shangri-la to do all that. Great facilities and not the least bit inconvenient. And a pool that almost rivals the Four Seasons\u2019. Upper House was one hotel I never wanted to leave. A flask of warm milk and cookies on turndown was a nice touch but the take-away espresso waiting at 5:45am on checkout really sold me.

With the bar and cosy semi private booths on the right and the main dining area straight ahead, the inimitable style and refined aesthetics are both soothing and sophisticated. Service It\u2019s not that hard to build and create a great looking restaurant, however, while one can build and create the most amazing places on earth it takes people to make them a reality.

More than that, it\u2019s carried out in a genuinely caring manner. Making this a place where casual meets sheik with attention to service. On our visit our service was superb and again proves that in Hong Kong, it is indeed the five star hotels that can attract and retain quality people. Food While there has been \u201cmixed\u201d reports in the media on the food, on our visit we ordered a variety of dishes, all of which were both enticing and delicious. Mixed Oysters with Crab legs (the latter already carefully slice open for easy access) being tastefully presented on a bed of ice, both the Oysters and the Crab were of the freshest and finest. Other dishes to follow where: Pork Chops tenderly cooked with a nice selection of vegetables, a whole Lemon Sole cooked to perfection with a tangy light lemon sauce, and Beef Cheeks, being tender and gelatinous accompanied by a light sauce and medley of vegetables. Now this is were some other reviews had differing thoughts, but my point is this. Good food done well, prepared fresh and with attention to detail is the key to success. It is a simple as that, and while some diners may have different conceptions or follow other fads in reality there is no need for food to be convoluted or complicated. This is where Caf\u00e9 Gray Deluxe excels, with quality produce and a traditional approach, neither will never go out of style. Overall it further elevates the dining status for which Hong Kong is famous. Dining at Caf\u00e9 Gray Deluxe can be like dining anywhere else in the world and certainly comparable to, Tokyo, London, Paris and New York.

There are four elements that mean I will always come back to The Upper House when I'm in Hong Kong.

Secondly, I love the fact that the WiFi is free, the shower gel is REN, there is a well stocked (and free) fridge full of beer, water, juice and milk, and an espresso machine. As one previous reviewer noted, the hotel has been thoughtfully configured to meet the needs of travellers. Thirdly, I love the clean lines and the cleverly designed rooms; who wouldn't with the smallest room circa 70sqm and a bathtub that allows you to both watch TV and gaze over Hong Kong Harbour.

I had chosen the Easter Package which included airport pick/drop by limousine and breakfast. As soon as I walked outside the customs check at the airport, there was a hotel representative waiting for me at the arrivals hall. She took my luggage and escorted me directly to the Mercedes waiting for me outside. She asked me about my flight and if I had been to HK before. The warmth made me feel like I was being received by someone I knew. When I got inside the car the driver gave me a cold towel and a bottle of water to make the ride more comfortable. Great touch. When I arrived at the hotel there was someone waiting for me outside and she greeted me by my name. She took me directly up to my room and explained the whole concept behind the hotel.

The breakfast also was the best I have ever had. It was a la carte with gourmet cuisine. The check out and drop back to the airport was with the same level of service as the pick. There was a hotel representative waiting at the airport who upon my drop even checked me in! Amazing.

I've been to their sister hotel in Beijing - The Opposite House - to eat and drink and it's a fabulous venue, bordering on being a little too stylish and maybe a little cold side of cool. The UH in HK is probably the best customer service I've had from a hotel as long as I can remember. From the minute i got out of the taxi, I was shown a seat and then quickly accompanied to my room. It was only then that the passport and credit cards were requested. A nice touch not to have to queue in a lobby. The hotel staff then gave me a little tour of the room and highlighted some of the unique features. The room itslef is huge for the standards typical in HK, Tokyo, London or New York. It is beautifully stylish. The large bathroom with bath overlooking HK harbour is wonderful and they have very nice design touches everywhere. The iPod Touch system to get to know the hotel ammenities and to order room service works as an 'ooh' moment but when I ordered room service, I still got a phone call to confirm, so no real benefit for the customer I don't think. Where they missed a trick is to have music pre-loaded on the iPod, although they do have cables to hook up your own music if you have it with you. The best thing about this place though is that the people who developed it are obviously seasoned travellers and understand what drives most people crazy - the additional charges. The fact that UH do not charge for internet access, do not charge for standard beers and soft drinks from the mini bar, coffee and cookies - to the extent there's even a sign inviting you to take the candy home if you want to. Thsi tells me they get it and it makes such a huge difference. I went for a look at their top floor bar and restaurant but decided to come back to the room as the restaurant isn't really the place for lone diners - but did look great - and the bar had a function on. The fact I couldn't go to their only bar was the only disappointment I had during the stay and I think they need to rethink this policy. When I got back to my room there was a souvenir gift of a rugby ball to celebrate the HK 7s weekend, which I thought was another nice touch.

On arrival we were met at ground level by a very friendly and knowledgeable staff member who took us to our suite and then explained how many items were operated. This was in keeping with friendly but respectful tone of the service, which we preferred to the often austere and detached service found in some luxury hotels. The check-in takes place in the room. The room had north and easterly views. The previous reviewer has pointed out that there is a building site where HMS Tamar used to be located- however as it was 46 floors below it did not trouble us at all. The main thing you see from the room is Hong Kong harbour and its surrounds. The living room is spacious and comfortably furnished. Whilst every guest would furnish the ideal room differently, it is a very pleasant room to spend time in. The bed, whilst being softer than I am used to (ditto the pillows although I now understand you can request firm pillows)., the bed was still very comfortable. The bed sits in ther middle of the room, which at first seemed odd but grew on us as the days passed. There is a large spacious closet to hang two peoples clothes, as well as pleny of room to dress near the closet, rather than next to the bed. The bathroom is stunning, with the bath as its central feature, set in the middle. The bathroom has two external walls, so one can sit in the bath gazing at Hong Kong. Whilst it is certainly not the largest bathroom we have had in a hotel ( the one bedroom suites at the Wynn take that prize) I think it is the most stunning and atmospheric- at night the lighting is fantastic. The previous reviewer has criticised the lack of power plugs in the bedroom- they are there, just hard to find those near the bed. He has also criticised the lack of automated blinds- they are being retro fitted. He also said he found the suite noisy. We found it one of the quitest rooms we have stayed in. Maybe all the rooms beside us, above and below were vacant- I dont know. All I know is that the room was very quiet. We live in a quiet part of Sydney on a very large block of land, so any noise at night disturbs me. We did not have difficulties with reflections on the windows other than at night with the lights on. We also had no difficulty with water pressure. As to filling the bath, it will inevitably take some time to fill given its size- it is huge! It is true that the a key is not required for entry to the floor, but this is central Hong Kong, not Mexico. We lived in Hong Kong for 4 years- it is not a high crime city. I understand the manager of the Upper House spent most of his career with the Mandarin Hotel. This shows in the attention to detail and the attitude of the staff- everyone we dealt with was first class. Whether it was making a dinner reservation for us, attending to our car or escorting the pizza delivery man to our door, it was all efficient and friendly. For anyone planning to rent a car in Hong Kong, which we always do a for a few days, at the Upper House your car is parked at the front entrance so you can gain access easily to to retrieve those items you forgot to bring up to the room. The Upper House is a wonderful hotel for a couple to spend a relaxing week in Hong Kong. I am amazed that anyone could fail to enjoy this hotel. Any criticism I would have would be quibbles which are really just personal preferences. My only criticism is with the room service menu- it is very limited. I will be very surprised if that is not recified very soon.", "Date": "December 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "JAKARTA", "Title": "\u201cNice but doesn't meet my expectations\u201d", "Author": "BENLEE123", "ReviewID": "UR50858227", "Content": "The Upper House Hong Kong, managed by Swire Hotel group is a design-driven luxury boutique hotel which only recently opened and thus still brand new. Tipped to be the new Landmark Mandarin with a view ( and larger rooms ), I was eager to see if it lives up to all the hype. Also, the special promo rate ( stay 1 night, get 1 night free ) the hotel was having also enticed me to try. Arrival I booked a limo ( Lexus ) to pick me up from airport. The hotel sent a Mercedes instead. I was told I have been \u201cupgraded\u201d as my chauffeur tried to convince me that the Mercedes is better than the Lexus. OK, I thought bec it does cost more for the Mercedes. In actual, it\u2019s because the Lexus wasn\u2019t available for some reason. Was slightly disappointed because I thought I can try out the new Lexus. Anyway, small matter. On arrival, a lady staff escorted me to the room. The check-in was done using some kind of wireless tablet device. It will be cool if it didn\u2019t hang a few times on the spot. I was told all guests are given in-room check-in. In fact, the hotel doesn\u2019t even have a dedicated reception area or concierge desk. A counter with some staff are positioned at the entrance which serve the role of reception, concierge and bell-hop. The Room I booked a one-bedroom suite called the Upper Suite. It\u2019s an expansive 1230 sq foot suite with large wall-to-wall windows that have views of Victoria Harbour, the Peak and Hong Kong central city skyline. Unfortunately, it also has a direct view of a rather ugly construction site. I also have problems enjoying the view because of reflections. More on that later. The living room is very spacious with a large sitting area that can sit 5-6 people comfortably. The bedroom has a large comfortable bed with nice linens. The bathroom is the best of the bunch, with separate vanity and bath area. A large shower cubicle with the new skyshower overhead and a good size tub facing city view and overall have a very \u201czen\u201d feel to it. There\u2019s a TV in the bathroom that when switched off, it\u2019s actually part of the mirror. Very Cool. The suite is decorated throughout in subdue beige tones ( as per the website photos ). There\u2019s extensive use of blond beige wood partitions throughout the suite. It\u2019s all very minimalist and streamline. The fittings and furniture are indeed good quality, but not exactly top of the line. Overall, I can\u2019t help but feel that there is a lack of wow factor, it\u2019s very understated, minimalist and residential than luxurious. There\u2019s just too much wood around, all of the same or similar texture and color. Yes it\u2019s a matter of taste but it feels bland and boring to me. The hotel provide a \u201cMaxi Bar\u201d with free sweets, chocolates, soft drink, mineral water and beers. There\u2019s also a weird ( and in my opinion extremely ugly looking ) coffee machine that looks like Wall-E. Some cons about this suite room, nothing really serious but still some are compromises and some are just plain annoying. - For a boutique hotel that supposedly placed a heavy emphasis on service, I\u2019m kind of surprise there\u2019s no welcome amenity or even a welcome letter in the suite when I checked-in. - There\u2019s no DVD player. You can request one to be installed in the room, but it\u2019s \u201csubjected to availability\u201d. In this day and age, one would expect a DVD player to be a standard room amenity for any 4 or 5-star hotel. This is a careless omission on the part of the hotel which I feel inconvenience the hotel guests. - There\u2019s no automated blinds for the windows, kind of strange for a hotel that prides itself on having the latest in-room technology. To make matters worst, there\u2019s actually lots of windows in this suite and the bedroom does gets warm during the morning, so lots of opening and closing of curtains manually. - There\u2019s a lack of plugs in the bedroom. Some are hidden in practically inaccessible areas like below the side table next to the bed. - As mentioned, there\u2019s lots of window at all sides of the suite, most of which are diagonal to one another and consequently, there\u2019s lots of reflection, which spoil the view. The view itself isn\u2019t that great either, it\u2019s not an unobstructed view and doesn\u2019t face the best side of the harbor ( for my suite at least ). - The soundproofing is not good. I can hear people walking around in the room above me. It\u2019s not distracting enough to disturb my sleep but still annoying nevertheless when I\u2019m awake. The poor soundproofing may have something to do with the origin of the building housing the hotel, which was constructed initially as an apartment and subsequently refurbished to a hotel. To the hotel\u2019s credit, they did try to resolve the problem by asking the hotel guest on the room above me who was checking out to quiet down. The noise subsided a while but afterwards, the cleaners were cleaning the room and the noise return\u2026 Oh mine. That\u2019s where I decided one night is enough at this hotel. - As if the soundproofing issues wasn't enough, the extensive use of wood in the suite cause constant creaking sound on a regular intervals, even when I\u2019m just switching on the lights or walking in the room or even when I\u2019m not doing anything! Click Click Clark Clark \u2026. - The water pressure could have been better. It take ages for the bathtub to fill up ( 20+ mins ) and the rainforest shower which is great end up feeling unsatisfying because of the low water pressure. Let\u2019s just say I prefer rainforest showers that \u201crains heavily\u201d. - The toiletries provided are a relatively unknown \u201cREN\u201d brand but I don\u2019t find them very good. It hardly foams. - Room service menu have only a handful of choices. I guess nobody will bother to order room service most of the time. - The guest floors doesn\u2019t require a cardkey to access, a considerable security risk I think since the hotel is accessible through the entrance and on the side balcony. - Notice that the soft drinks in the Maxi bar wasn\u2019t replenished during turn-down. Not sure if it\u2019s policy not to replenish or simply the housekeeping has forgotten. Common Areas Before I checked in, I already knew this hotel is a boutique hotel ( only 100+ rooms ). I was thinking it\u2019s like the Landmark Mandarin. However, the Upper House is even more boutique than this. There\u2019s no Spa for example. There is no swimming pool. There is a small gym which is self-service and accessible by using the room cardkeys. It\u2019s empty when I was there and I don\u2019t see any staff attending and it makes me feel uneasy using it alone. There\u2019s no designated reception and concierge area but there's staff at the ground level and lobby to attend to guests request. The only place that one can sit or meet visitors is a small sitting lounge area at the 49th floor that served also as the hotel\u2019s \u201clobby\u201d. There is only one caf\u00e9 that serve ala carte breakfast / lunch and dinner. I took a quick glance at the menu and as expected, it\u2019s astronomically priced. To be fair, I can\u2019t hold this against the hotel. Perhaps the food quality is very good which can justify the price. Anyway, I didn\u2019t try. Instead, I choose to have buffet breakfast at the neighbouring Island Shangri-la and was glad with my choice because the food there was excellent and the staff service outstanding. Service Hotel staff are all polite and friendly as expected since it\u2019s a boutique hotel but none really go out of the way to do anything extra. It\u2019s basically just standard 5-star service in Hong Kong, ie fast, polite and efficient. However, to be fair, there isn\u2019t much opportunity for them to really demonstrate their service capability to me since I end up staying only for one night ( although I booked two ). One point to note is that the staff English language ability are very good, including even the housekeeping staff. Notice also some staff share the elevator with me on several occasions but didn\u2019t bother to greet. Probably they are not sure if I\u2019m hotel guests or patrons of the caf\u00e9 since we all used the same lift. Conclusion Under promotion, it\u2019s good value at HK$6688++ under the stay one night get one night free promotion which works out to only HK$3344++ a night. For this price, you got a huge suite at one of the highest hotel in Hong Kong. This promo rate should be particularly attractive for travelling couples with small children. If it is not under promotion, I\u2019m not so sure. Size and spaciousness is one thing, but somehow, the room just feels too \u201cresidential\u201d for me instead of luxurious. I felt like I was staying at a really nice service apartment instead of a luxury hotel. Sure, maybe that\u2019s what the Upper House aspire to be, a \u201chome away from home\u201d for it\u2019s guests. However, not all hotel guests, like myself for example, like to stay at a hotel that reminds them of their own home / apartment with it\u2019s residential style rooms and d\u00e9cor. Overall the Upper House is a disappointment for me because my expectation was quite high and it haven\u2019t been met. It\u2019s certainly nice and comfortable but luxurious? Sorry, not in my books. There isn\u2019t anything serious to find fault with, but there is enough small faults and inadequacies here and there as I mentioned above which distract from a satisfying stay. I also wish the hotel has positioned itself as a high-end service apartment or a specialty design hotel instead of a luxury boutique hotel. For those desiring a really luxurious boutique hotel experience and don\u2019t mind not having a view, the Landmark Mandarin remains the superior choice in my humble opinion. I\u2019ll rate the Upper House a mere passable 3/5. If they can correct those faults like sound-proofing issues and others, it\u2019s deserving a 4/5. Will I return? Highly unlikely. In fact, I intended earlier to stay 2 nights, but check-out after one night and went back to my old favorite, the Four Seasons. The Upperhouse is a nice hotel but it just isn\u2019t my cup of tea. So if you want to choose to stay at this hotel, make sure you can appreciate it\u2019s minimalist design/d\u00e9cor and accept some of their limitations.", "Date": "December 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "dallas", "Title": "\u201cBetter then a 5 star with views to die for\u201d", "Author": "starfe", "ReviewID": "UR50115430", "Content": "It has everything.

Service was excellent, they are clearly trying very hard to please their guests. The only slight quibble I have is the very limited room service menu and only one in house restaurant , also with a pretty limited menu.

Designed by world famous Andre Fu to be a place of residential calmness the Upper house has certainly done it's job. The Upper house is described as an upward journey beggining at the ground floor where guests descend on escalators and up a lift to the 49th floor where the restaurant and lounge is. With few facilities and just one world class restaurant and bar, the Upper house is a discreet hideaway for movie stars and famous chefs alike visiting Hong Kong wanting to get away from the crowd. Also the hotel which starts at the 38th floor gives guests a great view of either the harbour or the lush greenery on the mountains to the rear. Pros: The rooms and suites in the hotel (there are 117 in all) have been created with care and affection and each peice has been selected carefully. The massive bathrooms which are at least 300 square feet have either stunning views of the harbour or of the lush mountainside greenery. All in all the rooms and especially the suites are true masterpeices and starting at 700 square feet they are the largest hotel rooms in Hong Kong. Down, or in our case, up on the 49th floor there is the world class Cafe Gray Deluxe. You guessed right, world famous chef Gray Kunz is the main chef here at Cafe Gray which sports international cuisine with Asian fusions. But like the entire hotel the cafe Gray is intimate and discreet and rather than a huge buffet every morning there is a delicious menu bursting with delights from the mouth watering Danish pastries to the well presented eggs Florentine. The menu will leave you full and happy afterwards even if there isn't a buffet like you would expect. The restaurant also sports one of Hong Kong's longest bars and at 14 metres it very well could be. Every evening the bar is crowded with people enjoying liqouir from all over. Downstairs on the 7th floor just above the small entrance there is a nice lawn area with a comfortable patio on which are soft armchairs where functions can be held and guests can sip cocktails on bean bags in the evenings. Back at the rooms guests can reside after a long night out in super soft king sized beds with Egypten cotton quilts and soft duck feather pillows. But before sleeping there is a choice of either a deep soaking tub with a flat screen TV to watch or a rain forest shower both boasting stunning views out of the floor to ceiling windows. Then you can put on your super soft bathroab which I highly reccomend you try and watch movies (there are DVD players in all rooms) on the 40 inch flat screen TV's in every room. Cons: Like I mentioned earlier the hotel has few facilities but perhaps for some that is a bit too few. For a start there is no pool so guests have to walk to the JW Marriott in the same building accessed by the 7th floor and even though the pool is rather unattractive at the moment there are plans to renovate it. But if you are thinking, Ok I will try out the Spa then unfortunately there isn't one either. But for those who love fitness there is an excellent gym with stunning views which you will have to bring your kit for but it is well worth it. All in all though this hotel is one of a rare bread, a discreet and intimate designer hotel high above the noisy roads with the feeling of a true home away from home. I definately reccommend this for leisure travellors or perhaps people on buissness trips.", "Date": "October 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Value": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong", "Title": "\u201cA cut above the rest\u201d", "Author": "Iheartholidays38", "ReviewID": "UR45158640", "Content": "Exceptional staff.
