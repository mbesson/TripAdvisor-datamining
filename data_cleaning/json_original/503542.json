It's a cute \"palacete\" just beside the M-30, in a little residential street with no traffic at all, buildings are just on one side and the other is plenty of big trees, so the surroundings are perfect if you travel with children or want a quiet place. But if you walk just two minutes you are in a busy area with restaurants and anything you need. The staff were really kind, the room is very big and you can have a cot with no charge and also an extra bed at a reasonable price, so it's perfect when you travel with two kids, as many hotels in Madrid allow only one kid for room (a great nonsense I will never understand, what are you supposed to do? Hire two rooms and sleep appart from my husband? Give away one of my sons?...) We had the buffet breakfast at the very elegant restaurant downstairs (it was included in the offer) and again everything was a delight, the assortment, the staff, the coffee (an important thing for me is to have a good expresso in the mornings, I don't like at all those machines that make a powder-milk and watery coffee), you can ask for other things if they don't have them on show. Could I ask for more? The only negative tip is that they have so few rooms, so it's plenty for next october, when I was planning to come back.", "Date": "September 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGreat little hotel\u201d", "Author": "steveojones", "ReviewID": "UR133459344", "Content": "Stayed there one night for work.

Excelent service.\u201d", "Author": "Halvar40", "ReviewID": "UR56727655", "Content": "I was there with my partner in a summer sightseeing trip in Madrid. I found it easy to arrive there by car from the airport, no need to drive on the messy downtown. The hotel is a hidden surprise in northern Madrid, silent and quiet; it doesn't feel like being in the noisy capital of Spain. The cozy garden, the restaurant with the terrace by the garden, the discreet service....That makes a difference, and it paid for the distance to downtown (easy to reach anyway by Madrid's safe underground, or by taxi) We stayed in one of the bungalows (well, I wouldn't say those are bungalows, they were almost like semi-detached little houses!) at the back of the main house. That was perfect for a weekend trip like this. I strongly recommend this hotel if you don't mind too much about being far from downtown.", "Date": "February 22, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Quinta De Los Cedros", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187514-d503542-Reviews-Hotel_Quinta_De_Los_Cedros-Madrid.html", "Price": "$100 and up*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Calle Allendesalazar, 4</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">28043</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Madrid</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "503542", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/6d/e0/0a/hotel.jpg"}}
