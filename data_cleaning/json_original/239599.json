Comming with Teravision bus directly from Rome-Ciampino airport, it just 5 min walk from Termini Station. 2/The room was clean, but w/o air-condition (seemed to be broken) that made the stay more hot and hard to sleep, as it was about 30C outside; 3/We stayed in hotel for 5 days, at the beginning they put us in the room with 3 beds and the next day they excused us and said that we need to move to other room with 2 beds as it was agreed before. I found it quite inconvenient to move from one room to another and pack my things again. 4/Then during our stay for some time the electricity stoped to work in the night. That made the emergency lamp blink whole night in the room. 5/Breakfast not that good as I found in previous reviews, the hotel has agreement with near cafe-bar Roberto, where they served one drink (juice or coffee) and cruasan, thats it! But in general not too bad!:)", "Date": "July 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kuala Lumpur", "Title": "\u201cGood Choice Indeed!!\u201d", "Author": "Allenlee123", "ReviewID": "UR63033102", "Content": "my flight was scheduled to leave on the 29th from Rome back home and to be safe... i arrived Rome 1 day early. Arrived at Rome Termini around 9am and just decided to pop into one of the hotels nearby for one night... Robinson's Hotel is a little bit on the inside of a block of buildings..so it's a little bit off the main street and definitely quieter.... But worth the money to spend considering its like less than 5 minutes walk with two big luggage from the train station...and maybe i was lucky.... they let me check in immediately which was around 10am... so i got a few extra hours sleep in comfort... the room i got is a two single bed room on the ground floor.... just a few rooms from the reception... they have good internet coverage... but it was tricky to access at first since (for some reason) their modem could not recognize my laptop (which was using Windows 7)...but once connected... its free Wifi for the whole stay... :) room was a bit on the small size as i believe it was meant for a single bed but they crammed in two. What surprised me was the toilet... shower is just a small space in the corner with flimsy shower curtain that barely covers you(not that i need it anyway...hehehe)... otherwise.. the room is very clean... thick mattress...good ventilation...no noise.... i slept like a baby.. Foods are not a problem at all... there more than enough choices of food around the place and within walking distance... so it was a good choice for me. By the way.. i met 3 of their staff while staying there... superb service... they were so sweet and although two of them couldn't understand english... they tried their best to help me with my laptop...", "Date": "May 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat staff, okay hotel\u201d", "Author": "ClonedTwice", "ReviewID": "UR38164438", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel during our 5 day stay in Rome. We stayed in room 201. Here is a quick breakdown of pros and cons: Pros: -5 minute walk from Termini train station. There is a fruit market on the same street, along with a internet/laundry cafe in close proximity -friendly & helpful staff -there was a small bar fridge, but don't expect it to keep things ice cold. -front desk is avaiable 24 hours and they have security cameras cons: -renovations were taking place during our stay and we had to leave the room by 9:30am because we couldn't stand the constant drilling noises. Not a real issue if you plan your day early. -shower floor was levelled with the bathroom floor so water would get everywhere -there was a weird smell on the bed by the head board, smelled a lot like rubber and sweat -our bed was bascially two single beds pushed together -bed was too big for the room and I kept banging my leg everytime I tried to walk between the bed and table -there was no A/C, that was an extra cost. We tried opening the windows but not a real solution since the street can get noisy -you need to provide a $20 deposit in order to get a remote control for the tv, that was a bit weird since you are already paying for the room. -towels were really thin, similar to bed sheets, so keep that in mind if you book. They are in the process of renovating so maybe once that's done they will have better rooms. Overall I think I would try a different hotel if I do return to Rome.", "Date": "August 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sweden", "Title": "\u201cGreat place!\u201d", "Author": "Egus", "ReviewID": "UR27154309", "Content": "I loved Hotel Robinson.

The price was competitive and we knew that some of the places by Termini were a bit dodgy. However, we were pleasantly surprised by Hotel Robinson. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. The room was small, but well equiped and very clean. On arrival I realised that Amex had booked me a twin when we wanted a double.

The location was great-only few minutes from Termini station, which is the central station in Rome, and from which we could have all the kinds of transportation (bus, metro ,train). This area is also full of fast food restaurants, which was very convenient. The breakfast was very good and rich- bread, cheese, cakes, hot croissants, cookies, cereals, fruits, coffee and tea. The staff was also very(!) friendly- They helped us in every question, and recommended us nice places to go. The rooms were very basic- In the standard room, where we stayed for the last 3 nights, the toilet and the bath were in the middle of the room (there was no separated room for it), which was very unconvenient and definitely lacks the private feeling. We also stayed in the Delux room for 3 nights, which was very small and crowded. We couldn't leave our bags open, because there wasn't enough room for us and for the bags in the same time! I also have to mention that everyday the rooms were cleaned including new towels were added. This hotel is good for people who want to tour rome, not to stay in the hotel.

We arrived around 11.30 and we were told to wait because check-out time is normally around 11 and they had to clean the room. They offered us a coffee in their wonderful breakfast hall and gave us suggestions about important things to visit and to do in Rome. Ana (receptionist) was really nice and kind. The rooms are simple but very clean and the best thing is that you feel at home because the family who run the hotel is so kind and work overtime to make sure you enjoy yourselves. Great breakfast!

I read other people's reviews of this hotel, I did a lot of research and I put a lot of time into the planning of my trip to Italy so trust me when I say this hotel is HORRIBLE! The hotel is in the bad part of Rome, it is seedy, ugly and a little scary at night, especially if you're a young woman. The hallways smelled like pee, like a NY subway station (seriously). I stayed with my family, but the room was too small to accommodate 4 people even though it was a \"quad\" room. And now the best part: the bathroom is a small closet, it is not a separate room, it is basically a closet with screen doors that includes a toilet and a shower head opposite to it. (the sink is outside in the room, think prison cell) You have a curtain the separates the toliet bowl from getting wet when you shower. This \"bathroom\" closet is right next to one of the beds so you hear EVERYTHING, and I mean someone going #2. I have never written a review about anything before, good or bad. I was so disgusted by this place that I was motivated to do something about it and write a review so that I can prevent others from booking here. If you are tight on cash, there are other hotels that are 10x better than Hotel Robinson in this area by the train station that are cheaper, I heard the Aphrodite was decent.
