The first night we had room 3 which was quite tiny (as I had read it would be) but had no windows (other than a tiny one high up like a basement vent) but we were so tired we just went to bed. Breakfast of your choice (continental) is brought to your room so you really feel pampered in that department. The desk staff were super friendly and gladly gave us a different room upstairs for our next 2 nights. We had room 7 which had a gorgeous little view and was slightly more spacious. The beds are quite hard at this hotel but if you are worn out from sightseeing like we were, it wasn't much of a problem. We didnt need air con or heat as the weather was perfect. Shutters on window let us sleep in a nice dark room in the morning. Very quiet at night so you do get some peace... The bathrooms are quite tiny (a late addition to this several hundred year old building) but everything was so clean and spotless it didnt really matter. They also use these strange 'towels' which were more like bed sheets. But, the location truly does make up for all the little problems, as next to the hotel is one of the best restaurants we enjoyed, Trattoria Ponentina! I wanted to drink and dine there all day! I may stay at this hotel again, what really was a problem was the noise - around 6-7am the staff start bustling around and one staff member would repeatedly WHISTLE loudly while working/cleaning, and as they prepared the continental breakfast trays, we heard alot of dishes banging and clattering loudly.... the walls are paper thin and we could hear the lady next door snoring all night and her hacking cough - yet WE got a complaint for having our tv on quietly at 9pm! So that really put us off, and we desperately needed sleep each morning! But if you are an early riser, this won't be a problem for you! But once again this hotel is excellent overall as you can't have a better location - we looked for other hotels but this one is truly in a great spot, and we also heard it is the former house of singer Lucia Dalla, for those interested in this musician. It is also near Viale Trastevere so super easy for tram and buses into central Rome. Be sure to visit the nice man, Claudio, at Bar Piccolo on the Viale, he has a red nose like WC Fields and we had so much fun hanging out with him one evening!", "Date": "March 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cSingle Room\u201d", "Author": "Karin B", "ReviewID": "UR121897706", "Content": "This hotel is in a great location but I wouldn't call the single room value for money.

For some reason availability was low and after a few hours of looking for a place, I settled for Hotel Borgo Antico. What a nightmare! First, the room was dark and musty. There was a window but very little light passed through. The phone in my room didn't work. I spoke with the person at the reception every day to let them know that the phone wasn't working and nothing was done about it. They provide breakfast in your room. There is a paper at the front desk in the afternoon/evening so you can write down breakfast preferences. If you don't indicate or call them ahead of time, they give you a hard time about it. The last morning of my stay as I broke off a piece of my bread, an army of ants crawled all over my breakfast tray. When I returned the tray, they promised to give me another breakfast. After waiting 30 minutes, I had lost my appetite and told that I no longer wanted the breakfast. In the 3 nights that I spent there, I didn't not have one peaceful night of sleep. Between the noise of the pipes, toilet flushing and loud neighbors, I was up everyday at 4am. I mentioned this to the person at the reception and he was somewhat helpful.

Unfortunatley, the staff was neither helpful nor friendly about resolving this situation. In fact, we really didn't find that any of the staff members were friendly at all. They tell you that breakfast is included, but you either have to go to a nearby hotel, or have it served in your room. You also have to ask about breakfast, as they did not volunteer this information to us. Our first morning, I asked where the breakfast room was. The woman at the front desk told me that they could bring coffee or juice to our room, but that was all.

The location is excellent - steps from a tram that will take you across the Tiber, and walking distance (though a good walk) to the Forum, etc. It was clean, and there was air conditioning.

We could hear every telephone call that the clerk made, and every entrance and exit of hotel guests. Moreover, the hotel is next to a very loud pizza restaurant which operates well into the night. The room where the restaurant washes its dishes abuts the hotel, and makes it impossible to sleep. The bathroom in our initial room wasn't really a bathroom. There was a shower that opened directly into the room, and in a separate part of the room there was a toilet in a closet.

We were privy to the conversations of those people next door to us - in our original tiny, holed-wall room.
