The 'select' rooms are wonderful, really comfortable, spotlessly clean and at under $40 a night Including resort fee, is well worth the money. Cassandra Blackwell who is a hotel supervisor is wonderful. I have contacted her numerous times with questions and she always writes back to you quick, thanks for all your help Cassandra! Also at check in we were dealt with by Lisbertha, what a really nice person, thank you! We ate in Roxys and at the buffet in the hotel, really enjoyed both as usual !! Location is not an issue for us, after an evening down the really busy strip, people everywhere and getting pestered by people trying to force these cards in your hand we find it so relaxing to get out of that environment back to a nice relaxing atmosphere and comfortable hotel.

I can see the parking lot from our window but didn't bother to us much (atleast I can shout that's my car), same thing about not to have fridge in the room. There is a charge for the Internet as well but our phone was there to use internet so that works great.

The room on 8th floor - a newly refurbished select room - was comfortable, clean and spacious. The view from this floor is a blank beige wall which was disappointing, apart from sleeping we were not often in the room but a view of any kind would be nice. Everyone we dealt with were friendly and helpful. You can get the Deuce bus down to the main part fo the strip but it stops very frequently and it is only a 30 minute stroll down to the Mirage (half way to the other end of the strip) - taxi cost $10. Views from the tower are great and it was woth going up just to see the rides and people jumping. The meal at the revolving restaurant (Top of the World) was ok but overpriced on quality but it was a nice experience, although you can easily walk around the tower on the floor above. Nice to have access to the tower included in the cost of the hotel room. A big redeeming feature of the hotel is the cost - very cheap.

My other complaint would be the level of smoking in the hotel. I myself smoke but never indoors as I'm from a country with an extensive smoking ban. The air in the casino was almost impossible to breathe but this applies to pretty much all the casinos.

I got a horrible rash All OVER MY BODY!! I have stayed in Vegas before and never got a rash, I stayed in Cuba and never got a rash, i stayed in Freeport, Bahamas and never got a rash. They advertise unlimited to go to the tower. I guess i didn't read the fine print. I thought that meant unlimited rides up there. Of course they aren't included.

My husband told the bar tender the water is free. He said you HAVE TO BE AT THE SLOTS FOR IT TO BE FREE. WHILE WHY IS THAT NOW? HE HAD NO ANSWER AND so we went to put in a compliant. We went to the front desk.The manger of the front desk was really nice and GAVE US 2 WATER'S FOR FREE and sent the food manger to us. He was like YA, THEY CAN GET FIRED FOR GIVING YOU FREE WATER. YOU COULD BE A PERSON OFF THE STREET. WE HAD SHOWEN THE BARTENDER AND NOW THE MANGER OUR TICKET FROM GABLING AND ALSO WE HAD BEEN PLAYING ON THE SLOTS FOR HOURS AND NOT ONE WAITRESS HAD COME AROUND.

It's not the money, its the point either the water is free or not. I GUESS THE MANGER AT THE FRONT DESK SHOULD BE FIRED TOO CAUSE SHE GAVE US FREE WATER!! So, the next day i phone the manger of the hotel to tell him what went on with the water and the food manger laughing at us. I told him how i have this RASH ALL OVER.

Avid NASCAR fan, drove 15 hours from Washington to stay @ the Stratosphere. I booked my deal via Orbitz a month in advance. Two rooms, one deluxe & we paid $60 to upgrade one room to the new & improved \"Strat Select\" newly renovated? yea right!! Checking the record, their most recent renovation was in 2006! So right off the bat thats fraudulent advertising. Specifically noting that I wanted a King smoking room... I called two times just to confirm my king bed & smoking room. I was told not to worry, it was set in stone. I check in @ 3am, exhausted, only to get charged an additional \"resort fee\" of $40 and I get sent up to my room that had 2 queen beds opposed to the King I booked, no ashtrays, it was also a non smoking room. Keep in mind, I upgraded this room because I wanted a view, I got one all right! A view of the parking garage! I slept it off for the night and confronted the front desk the next morning, only to be told \" we don't reserve king beds\".ok, whatever, just give me a smoking room! I get the smoking room & it's equipped w a king bed, go figure, the original room I booked. I get to my new room, unload my belongings & set out to the parking garage to realize I left my phone in my previous room on the night stand. Frantically, both my boyfriend & I ran up there to try and get in to our old room. Housekeeping was cleaning the adjacent room at the time, barely speaking English she told me she could not open the door because I had to key, understandable, I run to the front desk, at this point I'm missing my race that I drive 15 hours to see, so I am far from happy! Front desk gives me a key, I go up to get my phone & it's not there! We spent 2 hours searching and tearing the room apart. Double checked all out things just to be certain before accusations were made. Taking this issue to security & being very firm, they sent a crew up to investigate before a claim could be filed. The lady who did the search found not only an un sat room, but a bra under our bed!!! Surely it was not mine! She ordered the room to be pulled due to lack of their health codes. Now my $600 iphone4s with all my photos from my stay was hot in the housekeepers hands & the room I just spent 2 nights in was deemed un healthy! Upon checkout, I spoke with their hotel lead and he assured me I would be reimbursed for those 2 nights... I guess we will see beings I just checked out today. As for the phone & my sentimental value... It's at Risk management level & after reading all these bad reviews, I'm concerned I will see no resolution. ={ Hate Stratosphere!!! New update; Sent a claim to the LAS VEGAS poilice dept. Risck management was a joke. They tell you they are here to help you and will do their best to resolve the issue, yet the wait for you to leave to tell you, their investigation was closed... I was informed that there is a Nevada state law protecting hotels & their employess from being held responsible for theft in your room. Housekeeping was seen on film going into my room IMMEDIATLY after I asked her to let me in, yet she cleaned nothing!!! riddle me that batman! Case is NOT closed on my behalf, I will find justice one way or another.

We are very simple people, as long as the room is clean, bed comfy, were good... your not in your room much anyway. Every hotel employee we came in contact with was polite, not rude at all... I was even impressed on how nice the gentleman was who emptied the ashtrays around the slots. The shoeshine guys even teased us... we liked the customer service there. I found an Iphone by the slot machines, and turned it in to the check in counter, and the lady thanked me, and was on the phone with security (to advise them) b4 i walked away. (i hope the owner got it back!).. I did however observe several rude and demanding guests, and wondered where some peoples manners are. Maybe i didnt have any problems because in my line of work, i know how to talk to people..??? Please and thank you can get you further, these people are working to provide for there families, there not ur slaves, so lighten up. One of the tvs in my room wasnt working right, so i advised the lady at the check in counter. We forgot to take the 'do not disturb' sign off our door (we clean our own room, just change out towels) so the tv didnt get fixed, which was no biggie, we had the other one.. it was our fault, not hotel, cuz they did leave messages. This isnt a 5star hotel, nor do they claim to be... it is older, but ive been in other casinos on the strip, and i had to make sure i got my own beverage b4 sitting down to gamble, because I NEVER got served anywhere!! The cocktail waitresses here were on top of it. Made a lil small talk with em, and they kept me hydrated with plenty of barley n hops..lol.. We actually had more fun in the Strato casino than anything!!..Im there to have sum beer and gamble (spend $$), n relax.. not a shopper, i can do that at home. So to us, it was fine. Im from the midwest, where the type of clothing you wear, or the car you drive, or how deep your pockets are, doesnt make your status of who you are, your in Vegas people.. if your not a celebrity, no 1 cares who u r.. LOL... How you treat people, is who you are. So if your expecting the Ritz-Carlton, dont go here... go pay big bucks down the street. The neighborhood isnt the greatest, but no1 bothers ya.. i had more beggars in the bigger casinos than here.. kinda shocked me. Dont get cabs, take the bus.. its cheaper. This time we did rent a car, used it a few times, besides the bus.. We like Freemont Street, so this was closer for the bus, and I dont drink n drive (I'll lose my job), so very convienent takin the 10min bus ride to Freemont. We even got a free bus ride to Freemont St, cuz the machine in the bus wasnt working to get us a bus pass!! We even joked with the bus drivers. Roxys Diner has a bfast special ($6.99) from 2a-8a, ham/eggs/hash browns/toast... very filling n good. The wait staff there was exceptional.. We didnt eat at the top of the world restaurant, not into food that cost an arm n a leg... i like good food at a decent price.. (Toby Keiths in Harrahs)...We ate at the buffet in Strato, it was ok... not bad. Mcds is in the Strato, so thats what was for bfast in the mornings..lol.. Nutn like a coke from there.. YUM! ... Brad from the bar near the entrance of the casino here was great. He was funny, and very attentative to us. (btw, $20 all happy hour 6-9p, martinis/margarita rocks/draft beer) We only came across one grumpy security guy who searched us b4 going up to the observation deck, we had to chuckle at the poor ole fella!! I believe he was irritated at the wana be princesses in front of us in line..lol!!! This is only from my experience here... I was concerned with all the bad reviews, but it really wasnt that bad.

The area around it is kind of economically depressed. Currently, they are in the process of remodeling all their rooms, so when I booked, I had to select \"Remodeled\" to ensure I got a room that had actually been remodeled, as opposed to one that had merely been \"refreshed\". I booked through Orbitz, but on the day of arrival, I realized my itinerary said that I booked a deluxe room. I spoke with a representative at Orbitz, and when we arrived, the front desk clerk was helpful in getting us into a remodeled room. She neglected to mention that it would no longer be a King bed, but 2 queens. The hotel was full up for a racing event, so we didn't even bother to try to change it. The A/C would only go down to 68. Most people sleep best at around 65 degrees. Although we had the fan set to blow continuously, we would wake up sweating in the middle of the night. Mind you, this is during a season she overnight temperatures drop into the 40s. Our relatives were in a refreshed room that had the old-style in-wall A/C, and said they were comfortable. Probably because those blow air into the room, whereas the new A/C had one vent blowing straight across the windows. We could hear everyone in the rooms around us. Even walking down the halls, we could hear snippets of conversations (and other things) going from the closed doors. The casino itself is very smoky in comparison to most uptown places, and forget about finding a server to bring you drinks! It was at least a half an hour to hour wait every time. Compare that to the Luxor, where the server came by every 10 minutes, and always had a refill without our having to ask! But, on the second night, we started hearing scrabbling in the walls, and the sounds of claws getting caught in the carpet. We were in the last room on the end, and it came from the wall opposite our neighbor, so, unless the ice maker was trying to make a run for it, there was at least one rodent in the walls. I would call this a dive after my experience there.

We booked and pre-paid to selected rooms and the lady at the front desk said \" we didn't have selected rooms available for tonight\". When I said that we don't have only a reservation but we had paid for the rooms and that we were tired (I was not friendly, honestly), they gave us two selected rooms. When we walked in, one of the two rooms was not clean! They forgot to remove from the room all traces of the last occupant and put it in order for us, with the bed freshly mad up with clean blankets, lines, etc. Then I need to came back to front desk and ask for a new selected room ! They had another selected room maid up ... but the lady at the check in said ... not selected room available for tonight... uhm?????? Management and staff at the front desk is unfriendly to any complaints. Anytime I called the front desk or go down, they didn't care about my complaints or try to resolve it. In the next days our complain was always the same \"please, don't forget to maid up the room\". Housekeeping need to understand how they need to work! They clean our room bery quickly and everyday we need to go to the front desk or call down to have extra clean, fresh towels and ... Also the carpet leading to the rooms was dirty all the week. One day I asked to the housekeeping manager to came to the room and I showd her that it was really dirty and I was not crazy! I suppose that the problem was that the comunication amongst the staff wasn't existant because my complain was the same all the time!!!!!!!!!! The buffet breakfast for dinner and breakfast was ok, at a reasonable price with a good choice of food. We used the hotel buffet only 2 times because we prefered to have dinner in other restaurants. The hotel is at the end of the strip and every time we used the car to go to the other Hotels and Casin\u00f2 (Parking is free in all Las Vegas Hotels) and this was not a problem because we rent a car for all week infact we drove to Death Valley and Grand Canyon. But if you decide to not rent a car, hotel location is not good because you need to spend a lot of money for cab! It is important to remark that in this hotel is possible to smoke everywhere and if you don't like ... stay away from this hotel! We stayed in a non smoking room but the smell of smoke in hallways and casin\u00f2 was terrible!

While we were waiting for our food, we heard a knock at the door. An EXTREMELY curt woman named Joanna informed us that we did not have a late check out, and that we needed to leave right then because they were waiting on the room.

By this time, we really did need to go, so we just stopped arguing and left. It's a shame that the trip was ruined at the last minute.

From experience (15 years ago & pre-bankruptcy) we thought that this hotel was a really nice place to stay! As avid travelers, we should have known better and were seriously disappointed with our choice! After paying extra for a so-called upgraded room it would be frightening to see what a standard room is like! We did however get a great view of Las Vegas mountains if we stood right in front of the window - but they may as well have been portholes on a cruise ship. About 3 feet wide (air conditioner width) it made NO SENSE someone would design a hotel with tiny windows when you have these awesome views beyond! The photos they use in all of their literature to sell you a room is NOT the room they give you. We joked that it's not even the same hotel as the windows are much bigger in the advertisements. The place smells old and funky and the bathroom is ridiculously small. You have less than the basics not even a coffee maker. We found the customer service fairly rude and exceptionally unhelpful from front desk and the lines for checking in and out are loooong, expect up to 40 minutes plus waiting in line ... oh, and then you have to pay a FEE for that experience as well!!! (read on) We heard EVERYTHING in the hallways and neighboring rooms ... the shower; the toilet 'operations', the tv; telephone conversations ... etc. The air conditioner was stuck (broken) on high, but it felt like 74 degrees the whole time. Well, at least our sheets were clean and the bed was comfortable. They have a budget rental car office on the second floor but if you don't speak Spanish, good luck renting from them. And FYI, the Starbucks in the casino charges exorbitantly. Like .95 cents for an extra caramel syrup in a caramel frappe! Welcome to Vegas, right? That said, upon check out, this is what our bill looked like : Room charge + room upgrade + 21% taxes + $9.99 mandatory cleaning fee + $2.75 check-in fee + $16 check-out fee + $23 resort fee ... per person + a $50 convenience fee <-- Huh?!! (We called and had that one removed as they couldn't tell us what the \"convenience fee\" exactly was - *cough* *shady* * cough*!) + $12/day for internet + $19 to go up into Stratosphere Tower ... and I am sure I am forgetting other fees, we were completely bewildered! Then, we also found out that a buffet for two was included in all these fees we did not know about but of course front desk refused to remove the charge they added and yet failed to mention telling us that \"we should have known what we were paying for when we bought the package\" ... unbelievable! We obviously had the worst of the worst experiences and maybe we just bummed out on everything, like the worst room in the worst location with the broken air conditioner and the tiniest bathroom and they forgot the coffee machine and the closet doors and to spray air freshner and clean the shower head and they ran out of normal sized windows 15+ years ago; but when we tried to change rooms it was obvious that the hotel management just REALLY didn't care.

This year we stayed for the first time at the Stratosphere from Dec. 5-8. It had a very good price of $59 per night. We had a great time and liked the hotel very much. We stayed in the premier rooms that had been recently updated. The room was nice and had a king bed, flat screen television, huge bathtub and was spacious. The hotel is not really on the strip anymore as most of the hotels are located further down the strip espcially since the Sarah is now closed. However, the hotel is pretty close to downtown--probably 45 minutes to walk and 10 minute bus ride. We did go downtown for one of our days there and took the bus from right in front of the hotel. Food--the buffet is very good for both dinner and breakfast. Breakfast has everything as well as eggs cooked to order. The price was not bad--about as much as the IHOP across the street once you factor in beverages (IHOP prices $4 for coffee.) Gambling--we played slots and found this hotel to pay off better than downtown as well as on the strip. We played one day downtown, one day on the strip and one day in our casino. Shows--We bought The Mentalist tickets through travelzoo.com and got a very good price. He has an amazing show. The last night we were at our hotel, the offered guests staying at the Stratosphere free tickets to Frankie Moreno in the main showroom. Tickets were completely free or you could opt for front row seating for $20 per couple. We did this. What a show, Frankie and his band are OUTSTANDING...He is like a young Jerry Lee Lewis. We had a great time. Also if you stay at the hotel, you get free unlimited trips up the tower. That was a cool freebie. Service--Casino bar service was pretty good. The waitstaff came around all hours of the day and offered drinks including water. Overall, I would say we had a nice time in Vegas.

From Salt Lake to Vegas, it's about a 6 or 7 hour drive. I took the scenic route through Tooele, on south through Delta, and met up with the I-15 freeway in Cedar City and on to Las Vegas. This particular route is perfect, because there is virtually no traffic out that way except for an occassional truck. I set the cruise control, turned on some tunes, sang to my heart's content, and enjoyed the open countryside. Now if you're traveling with kids and decide to take this particular route, be warned that there is absolutely NOTHING out that way! Trust me, they will be bored, because there will be miles and miles of NOTHING! But this is the ideal route if you hate traffic, and are not in any big hurry. About the time I got to St. George was when I started running into traffic, but it wasn't bad. It was pretty smooth sailing all the way to North Las Vegas, then it turned into bumper-to-bumper traffic. I got off the I-15 freeway at Charleston Blvd and turned left, heading over to Las Vegas Blvd. From there, it was only a few blocks until I reached the Stratosphere hotel. Go past the hotel and make a right turn at the traffic light. There will be a large parking garage on the right, which is free. I walked in and headed over to the front desk. The casino floor is enormous; but seemed fairly clean. While the place did smell a bit like a chimney, it wasn't overwhelming. (That came later, when I visited another hotel further down the strip!) There was a big line at the check-in counter, but the line moved quickly. THE ROOM: I had initially booked a \"Select\" room, after reading reviews that these rooms had supposedly been upgraded, and were much nicer than the non-select rooms. Ha! Well, I got to my room, and it was no big thing. In fact, it was VERY bare bones. About the only \"upgrade\" that was noticeable was the flatscreen tv. Everything else was very basic, hotel standard. The room didn't even have a coffee maker. The bed was comfortable, the decor was decent, but there was absolutely nothing about this room that stood out as \"WOW!\". The view was mehhhh. Couldn't really see much of the strip. It was decent, but nothing to write home about. On a few websites that described these \"select\" rooms, they mentioned that ALL of the select rooms had jetted tubs in the bathrooms. Turns out this is FALSE! They do NOT! I asked the folks at the front desk about this and they said that only the spa suites had those. They didn't have one of those rooms available for Friday, but they did move me (at an extra charge, of course) on Saturday. The spa room was SOOOOOO much nicer!!! This room had a small fridge, a counter with a sink (called a wet bar), a large sitting area, a dining room table, large walk-in closet with an enormous safe. In the bathroom was a glass-enclosed shower, and the large, coveted jetted tub. Now THAT'S more like it! Well worth the extra $$, I felt. This room was on the 20th floor. The view was better, but still nothing to write home about. Good view of the tower though, and I could see people doing the Sky Jump off the tower. (The sky jump is one of a few attractions at the top of the Stratosphere tower.) THE BUFFET: If you book this hotel, be sure and stop by the Players Club counter and get a Player's card, even if you don't gamble. Without this card, the buffet will run about $21 a person. With the card, it's about $16 a person. The buffet was decent enough, but I wouldn't call it great. While they had prime rib, mashed potatoes, etc, they were missing certain food items found at most buffets. For example, I didn't see any potato salad, no lasagna, and no assortments of vanilla or chocolate moose. The place was comfortable, not very crowded. There is a hostess who will stand around and stare at you while you eat. THE POOL: I asked the folks at the front desk if the pool was open. The clerk gave me a cheesy grin and said, \"Why yes! It sure is!\". I changed into my board shorts and headed to the 8th floor, where the pool was. There were maybe 5 or 6 people lounging around in chairs on the pool deck, and maybe 3 people in the jacuzzi, but nobody was in the pool. Hmmm. I soon found out WHY nobody was in the pool! I jumped in, and about FROZE! It was FREEZING!!!!! Of course everybody else just pointed and laughed! \"Cold, aint it??!!\" Niiiice! So much for trying to use the pool. FRANKIE MORENO: If you book this hotel, you'll definitely want to see and hear Frankie Moreno and his 10-piece band perform. They put on an AMAZING show! The guy sounds a lot like Elvis! Many of the songs he performs were actually written by his brother and himself. The sound system in that theater is top-notch. Not sure what happened during the last part of his performance, but there was a partial power-outtage, and the stage lights went out. The sound system did not, however, and he completed the remainder of the show in the dark. The casino still had power, so most guests were oblivious that there was a problem. My room had no power. (The lights finally came back on about 2 am, shortly after I had gone to bed. Terrific.) SURROUNDING AREA: The Stratosphere is one of the few large, mainstream hotels/casinos on the strip that is actually located within the Las Vegas city limits. (Did you know that most of the big places on the strip are in a town called Paradise, and not Las Vegas?) The Stratosphere is at the north end of the strip. The surrounding neighborhood is VERY GHETTO/SEEDY. This is definitely NOT the place to be walking around on the streets at night, by yourself! It's hard to imagine a city such as Vegas being on the verge of bankruptcy. The truth is, there are a lot of places in this area where old hotels/casinos had been torn down to make way for new, elaborate high-rise complexes, only to have construction halt midway through the project due to lack of money. This area looks like a war zone! To get to the main areas of the strip, it's best to drive, or take a bus. About 200 yards north of the hotel is a Denny's 24 hr diner. I thought I'd give it a try. Oh my goodness, what a scary place that was! The prices weren't much cheaper than what could be found at the hotel. My advice is to go to one of the fast food places on the \"R\" (Mall) level of the hotel, instead, if you're looking for a cheap meal. THE TOWER: Admission to the tower is free for hotel guests. There's a security checkpoint with a metal detector you must go through in oder to access the tower. From the ground, the observation area didn't appear to be that large, and I wondered just how many people they could comfortably cram into that place. When I got to the top of the tower, I was pleasantly surprised. It's actually quite a large place! There's a high-class restaurant, a large observation area, a bar, a few gift shops, and... a couple of thrill rides. It didn't seem crowded at all. And the view of the city from up there was incredible! THINGS TO DO: While in Vegas, I decided to catch the Icons Of Comedy show at the Starlight Theater at the Rivera Hotel. Hal Sparks was the featured performer. Now THAT place was an absolute DUMP! Hard to imagine that back in the day, the Riviera was considered a very high class establishment. What happened??!! Yikes! Walking into the place was like walking into a giant ashtray. The place wreaked. It was pretty disgusting. The show, however, was hilarious, and reasonably priced. I also decided to take a tour of the Hoover Dam, as I've never been there before. Excellent choice! It was an all-day thing, and included a 2-hour cruise on a large paddle boat on Lake Mead. This was a nice, relaxing alternative to the hustle and bustle of the strip, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I rode the double-decker bus up to Freemont Street. This is a must see, if you've never been to Vegas before. It's maybe a 15-minute bus ride from the hotel. Check-out was quick and easy, via the menu options on the tv in the hotel room.

Cons: * Paper-thin walls: despite we were on 21st floor, far from street noise, the sleep-destroyer was the noise coming from the hallway and neighboring rooms. We literally heard the discussion of two house-keeping maids in the neighboring room as they were standing in our room. * Smoke everywhere: it's obvious that Stratosphere management will NOT ban smoking from the hotel, but they also don't do much about arrogant, rude smokers smoking also in areas explicitly designated for non-smokers.

The room did not come with a fridge, microwave, or coffee machine. The room was decent but I didn't expect more for the price we paid. We basically used the hotel just for showering and sleeping. We did not eat inside the hotel. I would suggest that if you stayed at this hotel that you should do the same, besides for the tower I would go out to the strip to eat and enjoy your time. My biggest complaint would be that internet is not free so I didn't even bother taking my laptop, I just used my phone. The other biggest complaint is that it is all the way on the other end of the strip so it is a long walk to the middle and other end of the strip. I would not recommend to walk that far. Use public transportation or a tax or best of all rent a car. That is what we did, I rented a car for the whole time I was there and it made life and the trip so much better. Parking was free every where so this cut down on the walking for us. We saw a few shows, went to all the big hotels, casinos, and malls. Went to Hoover Dam, Red Rock Canyon, and Grand Canyon west rim. We had a great time and even though we did not spend much time at this hotel we would suggest it besides the few complaints we had. If you can find a better or similar hotel for the same price which is closer to the middle of the strip I would go with that... it would save you walking and transportation costs.", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth WA", "Title": "\u201cFor Aussies travelling to Las Vegas\u201d", "Author": "SerenaPerthWA", "ReviewID": "UR124935808", "Content": "We stayed here for the great price of $305US for 5 nights. It was cheaper booking with the hotel directly (on the internet) than with Expedia. The hotel room comes with flat screen TV, but you have to pay for internet and if you want a fridge in the room it was about $15 per night. The room I booked had two queen beds and there was no option to get a queen and two singles. We could get a roll away bed for and extra $20 per night. We didn't bother and made the kids share a bed. You can get ice from various locations on each floor. The Italian resturant at this hotel was reasonably priced and the meal sizes were big. If you try and go for the early morning breakfast meal (about $6) and share then they charge you an extra $2. (I thought this was a rip off so walked out and went to the breakfast deal at the little casino across the road). The view was fantastic and I recommend that you go up the viewing tower during the day and and night time as Las Vegas looks different when viewed at different times. Overall this hotel is a fair way up the strip to walk, but we had a car so it was no problem, we would drive down to another hotel/casino and park there, then drive back at the end of the day. You can also take the bus and it stops close to the hotel. The good thing about this hotel was that the you couldn't hear people in the room next to you. The bath was averaged size and the water was hot and had good pressure. I would recommend staying here if you don't mind walking, or if you are happy with public transport, or if you have a car.

I can bit a bit picky and I was very happy here! The big bonus was that we had free access (normally 16 dollars per person each time) to the Stratosphere Tower and Lounge Bar which was totally amazing!! The view from the 108th floor over Vegas, especially at dusk as the sun was going down, has to be seen to be believed - I have never seen such an amazing sight - stunning!!! We spent 3 out of the 6 nights we had, sitting drinking half price Martinis (4pm-7pm) watching the sun go down and eating the very good (and large)( and 50% off!) appetizers. The restaurant itself is at the same level and over a 2 hour period, the tables revolve a full 360 degrees around the tower so you can take in all of vegas whilst enjoying a fantastic meal. Restaurant was pricey (\u00a3300 for 4 inc champagne) but worth every dime for the sheep experience - one that will not be forgotten! Location - situated at the bottom end of the 'Strip' which put me off a little before we booked but I need not have worried at all. Location was good and the buses are great - only \u00a320 for a 3 day pass and they are clean and very frequent (from outside the hotel door). We also took the bus to 'downtown Vegas' and the Freemont Experience.... look it up... the largest outdoor cinema screen in the world - an amazing sight on the hour every evening and only about 15 mins on the bus from the hotel. Food - we had the dinner buffet in the hotel which was nice, but if you go to Vegas you must try the lunchtime buffet in the Bellagio Hotel (cheaper than you might think - we paid 15 dollars each) and also the burgers at Serendipity (next to Caesers Palace) - fantastic.!!

She responded so people don't smoke on the elevators! After searching, she offered us a room on the 8th floor, no view she said. In retrospect, we should have grabbed it. The rest of the stay was uneventful, except for people congregating at the elevator door to enjoy their smokes. Which seeped right under our door, right opposite the elevator doors.

The only bad thing is the flight times leaving Vegas but it is still well worth the value. For those of you concerned about the distance from the rest of the strip, believe me when I say it is not a big deal. There is a bus station literally right outside the front doors of the Strat. Take my advice, buy a 3 day bus pass and take the bus everywhere. This hotel is definitely worth the price. Also, the hotel is fairly close to Downtown and Freemont street which should definitely be on your list of places to visit while in Las Vegas. The buffett is good especially if you become a players club member (do this even if you don't gamble) you will get a discount on the buffett. The gambling at the Strat wasn't bad. I personally am not a huge gambler but there were some really fun dealers at the black jack tables and the Strat definitely has some of the cheapest tables on the strip. The tower is a great experience and the fact that you get in free as a guest of the hotel makes it even greater. The rides on top of the tower aren't free once you get up there but if you've got any inkling of a dare devil in you, you should definitley go on one of the rides! The diner in the Strat is a great little place that I ate at several times in the middle of the night. They have great food and great service. Overall the Strat is an amazing value, with great rooms, great staff, and a great atmosphere. The fact that it is at the end of the strip should not hinder you from staying here considering that the bus system is so easy to use in Las Vegas.", "Date": "January 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cOur favorite place to stay\u201d", "Author": "LAtoEverywhere", "ReviewID": "UR123473748", "Content": "We go to Vegas every few years and we always stay at the Stratosphere. We have a car always, being from LA, so it works for us. Their garage is easy to park in and there isn't a lot of traffic in and out. The prices are usually the best in Vegas. We get their emails and recently took advantage of a special rate offered, which was a bargain for a very nice room with a view of downtown. We went to the tower during the day and at night, which we enjoyed. We ate at the buffet, which was fine and you get 25% off by showing your slot club card. There is a Burger King just around the corner, and a Carls Junior, and an IHOP right outside. There is a McDonalds in the hotel. And of course, all the other restaurants there are nice and you get a discount with your club card. The Starbucks seemed to be a favorite of the other patrons. I am surprised that many other people had concerns about the Stratosphere. What I can say is that things can happen. It is a huge hotel and there are all kinds of patrons in an dout. Don't sweat it or take it personally if your room is not perfect. Don't let it frustrate you or ruin your vacation. If your room has a big problem, ask for another one. If your room has a little problem, ask that it be corrected. When we first got in, I noticed the sink didn't drain well. I didn't want to deal with it like that for five days, so I called Maintenance. They came in less than 5 minutes, plunged it, and said goodbye in just a few minutes. It was perfect for the rest of the time. Some people don't say anything and then complain. If it bothers you, ask that it be corrected. If it does not bother you, then don't complain later. The towels were very nice, the linens were nice, the carpet was clean, the shower had power, the drapes were DARK and what more can you ask for! It is a reasonable walk from the parking lot.

When we checked in they were not as I had expected at all. We had an early 1990's room with a not-quite-functioning bathtub, very thin walls and simply NOT what was in the picture. We stayed in this room 3 nights and could hear our neighbor snoring and our other neighbor's conversations talking at regular volume. We came back 3 days later after looking more closely at the room reservations and chose the \"delux\" room (they have a different name at the front desk) and I was tickled to find a room better than the one in the picture. Upgraded sink and counter, new tub and tile, new flooring, new curtians, new lamps and furniture. This night ended up being our least expensive night to boot (because the first few days were during a confrence they said.) I was impressed with their towels in both rooms, very soft and thick, only two but they'll bring you more if you ask. Roxy's diner is what they serve 24x7 for room service and everything we ate there was awesome especially the grilled cheese/turkey sandwitch (HUGE and they give you two), hamburgur, omlette (so good!). But avoid their coffee (yes, terrible) and coleslaw!!! Fries were just ok. Frank Murino's show was very fun but way too loud the night we went, I plugged my ears the whole time, so that was a real bummer. Avoid the \"Information desk\" when you first walk in (if you park your own car and come in from the garage), they are fake employees and want to sell you time shares. Reception is all the way through on the other side, gotta walk through all the slot machines. Had a blast playing penny slots, the waitresses were timely at bringing our free drinks and we were able to spend about $10 each night and have MANY free drinks in the process. Over all we had a ton of fun and would come back now that we know our way around and know what rooms to get (still about the cheapest in town). They are farther away from the main strip but if you rent a car like we did you can park free in all the casinos on the strip. Or walk over 2 or 3 blocks to the monirail to go downtown.

Of course, you can always take the Deuce, which can be slow, but it'll get you where you want to go. The hotel itself is less than glamorous, but of course we didn't pay top dollar so we didn't expect to be treated to the lap of luxury. However, the first room that we were assigned was pretty dreadful with mold on the shower curtain and a very heavy smell of smoke. We complained in the morning and the staff very courteously assigned us to a new room on a non-smoking floor which was a vast improvement. The smell of smoke was still present, but it was not nearly as strong and the room was much cleaner. We tried the buffet restaurant on our first night and the food was not extraordinary, but it was quite passable. Keeping that positive experience in mind, we tried the hotel's 50's diner for breakfast later in our stay and it was disappointing. The service was slow, elements were missing from our dishes, our eggs weren't cooked properly and we were never offered coffee refills. Our recommendation here is go for the buffet, skip Roxie's. One big complaint is that the hotel charges $12/day for wifi access. Considering that you can go into a McDonald's in many towns and get free wireless, it seems archaic that the Stratosphere is still holding to this practice.

The good thing is that the Deuce bus stop was right outside the hotel and the buses were extremely frequent running all day and all night.

The immediate area around the hotel is not as nice as the rest of the strip but don't be too put off by what some reviewers are saying about the area it is safe enough. It seems that Vegas is going through a bad time with some of the original hotels going out of business, the Sahara which is nearest hotel to the Strat is closed and their appears to be signs that the Riveria might be next. The hotel it self was great, we were staying in one of the select rooms which apparently were recently renovated compared to the rooms in the other parts of the hotel. There were plenty of places to eat within the hotel but the main restaurant that stood out was the top of the world restaurant which was right at the top of the hotel viewing tower. The casino itself was as impressive as the others we went to as it is not as big and did not have a great selection of tables and video gambling machines. Personally I thought the casinos at the Pallazo, Venetian and Baily's were great (probable because I won money in them)! The pool at the hotel was very busy and lively, the problem is there are only around 5 sun umbrellas so if you arrived late to the pool your more than likely to be staying in the sun all day which is not good when you there in the summer.

We were upgraded on arrival and very happy with our room which had 2 flat screen tv's and a sep living area complete with sofa and chair. Housekeeping cleaned room every day and replenished toilettries etc. Quite good restaurant choice and a couple of eateries open 24 hours a day. Big parking lot with lot's of free parking. Staff all very nice. We also enjoyed the rides at the top of the tower. The only let down is the location as this end of the strip is quite run down now especially with the closure of the Sahara acroos the street. It is also a good 30 - 40 minute walk to the mid strip for the main hotels that you would want to visit.", "Date": "January 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "eastky", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Time..

We booked the Strat because of the location and the tower. We spent the extra money to get a room with a view. But I have to say we were sorely dissappointed with our experience at the Strat. It began with checking in late on the 29th, were we were told we would be getting a room 'upgrade'. Great you would think. But after 18 hours of travelling I did not think to ask to see the room before we took it. What a mistake. Our room upgrade was on the 10th floor looking out on the air conditioning units that run 24 hours a day and the parking garage. We had paid extra for a room above the 14th floor. The air conditioning units run 24 hours a day and if you are a light sleeper you can hear them constantly. After two nights of not sleeping I went to the front desk to explain that I had booked a room on one of the higher floors. I was greeted by a man who's attitude was less than polite and he could only be less interested in our problem. He told me that because we had not booked directly with the hotel there was nothing he could do because we had already gotten a room 'upgrade'. He than was able to 'find' a room on a higher floor but could not move us because there was a block on moving rooms being new years and we would have to come back in 15 minutes to see the manager. We came back in 15 minutes and waited another 10 min and gave up and went for breakfast. Came back waited another 10 minutes to be told yes they could move us. But the room was occupied and that it would be after 2pm and to check back. We headed off for the day and came back at 4pm. This is when we got to meet Ashley Dion. She gives a new meaning to the word rude. We waited in line for about 10 minutes before we had the chance to meet Ashley. Upon meeting her I told her of our problem. Trying to be positive about everything. I had said that I did not consider the room an upgrade. She kept telling me it was an upgraded room. Were is it an upgrade if you pay extra for a view on a higher floor and then are put on a lower floor with the view of a parking garage considered an upgrade?? When I told her I wanted to see the room before we took it, is when her bad attitude got even worse! I felt as if I was doing the wrong thing to ask to see the room. When I came back down from seeing the room she was in the room behind the reception desk. I looked directly at her and made eye contact for about 3 seconds, she turned and went back into the back room where I stood and waited another 5 minutes for her to come out. When she came out she walked right past me and told me I would have to wait. When I called her attention that this had been going on all day and I just wanted our keys so we could get our luggage moved. It was slapped down on the counter like we were just getting in her way. Then it gets better. We packed up all our stuff and moved to the higher floor. Only to find out that the keys did not work! Back down to reception, where I told her the keys did not work. She looked at the key holder where she had written the wrong room number down. And said she had written the wrong number down, but I should have known it was the wrong number because I had been up to look at the room already. Keep in mind it is now after 5:30pm and we started this at 4pm! I had pointed this out to her and that I thought she had a very bad attitude. And this is my response I got from her. \"YOU ARE JUST LOOKING FOR FREE COMPS! If you have a problem with my attitude talk to my supervisor and he will get you free comps!\" At this point in time I just walked away because it was not free comps that I wanted. It was the room that I had paid extra for. When are hotels going to learn that their front of house staff is very important to how the guests feel about the hotel. All I can say is we did not let these very rude people ruin our holiday, but we made a choice not to gamble or spend anymore money in the hotel. We travel to Vegas every year or two for at least a week to ten days and we will not be spending our money at the Strat!!!!!!! I will be posting the view from our upgraded room shortly. We still have a few more days left here.

We picked this place for the second portion of our Vegas trip (we stayed near the Grand Canyon in between) mainly because I knew I wanted to ride some of the rides on top and I though it looked interesting. I was aware ahead of time that it was not really on the strip, so that wasn't a concern. Getting to check in from parking was a bit of a pain as we found we had to walk through the entire casino first. The line to check in was long, but we most likely happened to get there at a very popular check in time. We got our keys and were on our way to the North tower, 20th floor. It seems they only had a few elevators that run to the North tower and there had to be about 100 people waiting around for their turn to get on them (and that estimate is conservative). The elevators were very small and therefore, few people could fit inside one with their luggage. I think we managed 5 in the one we finally got into (and it was a tight fit). We got up to our floor and to the room and when we walked in, I have to say I was very disappointed. This was certainly NOT the picture of the room I booked. Everything was very old and very worn. The bathroom was dirty, the tub had a layer of dirt all over the bottom and the paint was chipping in the shower. I was upset but also very tired so I wasn't going to do anything. My boyfriend, knowing he would have to hear about my dislike for the room the entire trip, called down to the front desk to talk to them. After about 10 minutes on the phone they said they would move us (and I have to admit my boyfriend DID mention that we would be posting a review on TA), apologized, and sent someone to show us to our new room. The guy who came was very nice. He informed us that the North tower was the only part of the hotel that had not been renovated and that the people who worked there refer to it as \"the ghetto\". He was very nice and talkative and we enjoyed our conversation with him. He assured us that our new room would be much nice and it certainly was. He showed us how to work the t.v., the channel that shows the people doing the free fall from the tower (live) and grabbed a map to showed us various places in the hotel to go. He also gave us some free ceviche for one of the restaurants upstairs (which we did not end up using). We were very happy in our new room, and my boyfriend was happy that he wouldn't have to hear me complain about being afraid to use the shower. The hotel, although out of the way, is very nicely situated. Infact, there is no reason to really leave it as it has everything right there. So if you're okay with not leaving it, then this place is great. We ventured out to the strip but I really don't think it would be walkable. We did however, find ourselves missing Tropicana (which we stayed in on our first leg of the trip). I think I just liked the ambiance better I guess. I loved going on the rides upstairs and was surprised at how late they stayed open. The view from the tower is spectacular (and included in room price). Although I would not go back to the hotel myself, I wouldn't dissuade others from trying it out. It is nice, but some places just suit people better-so its more a personal preference type thing.

Alright, now to why I gave it a 3...it is a fair ways away from the strip but I knew that before staying here so we were well aware it was going to take a taxi ride to get to the strip...or even better the monorail was right behind the Sahara(within walking distance) and you could buy day or multi day passes for cheap. The room was cheap enough but as most traveler's, we had a late flight out of Vegas so we asked if we could get a later check out so we could still go see the sites but also come back to relax. They said late check out was 12, fair enough, but in order to stay longer, they required a fee($30) to stay until 3pm. A quick look online, I found another resort hotel, closer to the airport, and closer to the strip, for $16 a night. The entire night! So, off we went to the other hotel, which was much nicer, our own resort room, more square feet and an entire kitchen. Front desk at the Tuscanny gave us 2 for 1 dinner coupons and comp drinks.Smoke-free restaurants which is a huge PLUS for a non-smoker! A far better deal. Wish we had stayed here to begin with. ANd free interent in the lobby! The Stratosphere is ok, but there are better deals.", "Date": "December 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGood value\u201d", "Author": "Suzy B", "ReviewID": "UR121900640", "Content": "We were given newly renovated rooms that were great.

I can't comment on the food in the hotel as I did not end up eating there during my stay.

And for some reason the tub was extra high and you really had to make a hurdle move to get in and out! They do have newly renovated and upgraded rooms available.

We figured out the best way to get to our room without going thru the casino and all the smoke - I know, it's a casino but I just can't stand the smoke! You park on whatever level of the garge, but near the elevator and go to the skywalk or ground floor entrance, take the first set of elevators up to your floor and then walk the half mile hallway to your room! Staying at the Stratosphere gets you up the tower for no charge. Great views, fun bar and scary scary rides - those you have to pay for.

I wan't to go see some lights graveyard, I'm not sure of the name now and got a little lost.

One complaint about the pool is they take their time opening a few minutes after 9am in the morning but try to kick you out at 4:30pm when it says the pool hours are until 5pm clearly posted and confirmed by the front desk. If you want to close the pool at 4:30pm, then clearly change the hours instead of turning off the music every day at 4:30pm and walking up to people and telling them the pool is closed! The rooms were redone and my only complaint vs. last year is now the fridge in the room was missing and that was nice to have last year. Otherwise the redone rooms are nice. The rate is hard to beat for SEMA and it isn't even that far of a walk if you miss the mid-day lack of free shuttle service to/from SEMA and Stratosphere.

I was allowed to check-in very early to one room (11:40am) and was told the other one would be ready later. The check-in person asked me if I wanted to put a CC on file, she advised I did not have to being VIP and they would just turn off amenities ( I chose not too because I stayed there for a week a couple years before and they charged a hold of $50.00 a day to my card which was a pain and held up about 20% of our vacation budget).

When we got to our room it was next to the elevator and we litterally thought a helicopter was going by but it was the elevator. When the bellman brought our bags he told us we should get another room as most people don't stay in the room due to the noise. We could not understand why this room is rented without a disclaimer as you would need to be very hard of hearing to stay in this room. We called the desk and they indicated there were no more King Rooms left and we would need to pay an upgrade to a Jacuzzi King Room. We agreed to the $15 a day charge as we couldn't stay in the room. My husband had to go back down and make the switch and paid with a credit card they had us put on the room for any charges. When a different bellman came to do our room switch he also indicated he didn't understand why they rented that room. The new room was much quiter. We left for the evening and had a great dinner off site. Upon our return we went to the top of the tower to have a drink. We didn't realize to get a drink would require going through security and waiting about 20 minutes..but we understood. However when they wanted to take my picture to sell me afterwords I had to refuse. Once at the top we enjoyed the view and atmosphere, however the drink quality wasn't up to our standard. When we got back to our room we had a message from the bar that we didin't have a credit card on our room and they couldn't charge our drinks. I had to call the bar and then the front desk to straighten it out. This was better than their suggestion of me going back to the bar...through security to pay for the drinks. Then my husband found in the bathroom urine stains by the toilet that had not been cleaned, the TV remote batteries didn't work and there was a hole in the sheets.

I could not believe we had a room with a hole in the wall! I called the front desk to report is as I did not want them to think we had put the hole in the wall. They were unaware of the problem and noted on my account that I had reported it. The person who I spoke to thanked me for reporting it but that was it, no offer to change rooms or anything. It was not that big of a deal I guess, it's not like you could see through to the bathroom or anything. Other than that the room was great. Lots of space, nice view of the mountains, comfy bed, and great housekeeping service. We went to the pool and spent one day out there. I was lucky and got the use of an umbrella. The bartenders were super friendly and fun, great drinks! The only restaurant we ate at in the hotel was Roxy's Diner. No complaints. I also went to Starbucks a couple of times.

They didn't give us advance notice either. That was a pain! Plus, if you're not a smoker, the smell of smoke in the casino is much stronger than other hotel casinos I visited on the strip. There is a decent selection of restaurants at the hotel and a Starbucks. I ate in the diner one a couple times (good for soups, sandwiches, light meals), the buffet once (not bad for a buffet--lots of selection and not real expensive) and at the Italian restaurant once (a bit pricey, but the lobster pasta with asparagus was delicious!).

Room was clean, functional, nicely decorated, and aired out. The bed was fantastic - big cushy new mattress with high quality bedding and lots of pillows. And maybe I just got lucky, but the hotel seemed quiet for all four nights I was there - no amatuer young drinkers stumbling and \"woo-ing\" up and down the halls, and no objectionable noise to speak of from the street. Elevators were fast and kept spotless. The casino was a lot of fun, and seemed to have a wide variety of patrons (everything from Jersey Shore candidates to Midwestern types). I wouldn't say the slots were loose per se, but the money seemed to last a bit longer here than on other places on the Strip. Drink service was good - the drinks were weak as water, but they kept them coming quickly and were very friendly. Actually, all the staff I encountered, from the cleaning crew to the conscierge, were very friendly and efficient. And while I think the $8 per night or whatever they charge for a \"resort fee\" is lame, it does include unlimited passes to the tower observation deck, which provides a surreal view, night or day. As for the location... yes, it is kind of isolated. But if you plan well and are prepared to shell out a bit for the bus, monorail, or taxi, you'll be fine. It's probably too far to walk to the \"good\" stuff on the Strip, and I wouldn't advise walking to downtown under any circumstances, unless you're with a large posse of sober ninjas that could take on all the toothless and tweaking street people swarming that particular stretch. The Strat is somewhat of a self-contained city, anyway (with tons of onsite shops and conveniences), and you can probably take care of the majority of your wants and needs within the confines of the property. Roxy's Diner had great food, and the little Mexican place upstairs was pretty good, too. There's also a McDonald's and Starbucks onsite if you just need something fast. I can honestly only find one fault with the Stratosphere, and that's the bar soap they provide. The lotion, shampoo, shower gel and conditioner are fine, but that bar soap was useless and vile.

The trip from the airport via cab was just shy of 30 bucks including tip. The hotel is at the far North end of \"the Strip\". Freemont Street and \"Old Vegas\" is about a mile and a half North on Las Vegas Blvd so from a location standpoint, The Stratosphere is centrally located although you'll have to take a cab or transit bus to get around. The transit bus called \"The Deuce\" stops right beside the hotel and day passes can be purchased at the Kiosk next to the bus stop. The buses are typically standing room only, jammed packed, and hot. But for 7 bucks for 24 hours it's cheap. If you walk, be advised that as soon as you step off Stratosphere property there's a good chance you'll encounter people begging for money, drug dealers, and prostitutes. we certainly encountered all of the above. We did not feel safe on foot at night unless on the main Strip or in the heart of the Freemont street experience. Check in at the Hotel was pretty quick and uneventful. We were' surprised that in order to get a mini-fridge and microwave we had to pay an extra 10 dollars per night each. The standard room was okay. It was not quite as well appointed as the average Business traveler \"Express\" hotel's that I stay at but was okay for the money. The room's have a \"energy saving\" thermostat system that uses an infrared sensor that only cycles the AC when you're in the room. It also only allows you to turn it down to 68 degrees which I'm certain we never achieved. It was uncomfortably warm most of the time. The pool was nice although it closed at 7pm each night. It also has a permanent sign posted by the hot-tub that says the jets are temporarily inoperable. The view of the main Tower from the pool was very nice and there were several cabana's that could be rented for an extra charge. The European or topless pool on top of the 24th floor is closed for remodeling, Nobody knew when it would reopen when I inquired. The buffet was very good and by signing up for an ACE card for the casino you get a discount. The show \"BITE\" was a fun 1 1/2 hours. The cast was hot, topless, and the show put to a classic rock/vampire theme. Kinda strange, but fun. As far as Vegas shows go, it was less expensive as well. We paid extra for VIP seating in a booth and were surprised to be seated with another couple. I don't know if this is customary or not. Wifi is not free but can be purchased. The view from the top of the tower is awesome and the thrill rides are discounted for hotel guests. There's a nice restaurant with probably the best view in Vegas. There are multiple shops and places to eat on premises. All the food is a little pricey. There are cheap eats on the strip, you just have to hunt for them and there's a IHOP, Denny's and Carl Jr's within walking distance of the hotel. Room service as expected was expensive but the portion sizes were fairly generous and service was quick for a 2400 room Hotel. There is no coin op or self service laundry facility but there was a laundry bag and price list in the room. This extra service, you guessed it is very expensive. i.e. 4.50 for EACH pair of shorts, 1.75 for each pair socks, each underwear. Jeans, and formal/business items even more. The casino was expansive and comfortable. smoke was minimal compared to other properties. I played craps and the only tables I saw were \"Crapless Craps\". A variation of Craps that I don't much care for. All in all, the casino is very nice. In conclusion, the Stratosphere is a nice property in a not so great area of Las Vegas. It's location between the Strip and Freemont Street make it a decent \"home base\" for a budget minded traveler that doesn't mind riding a bus or taking a cab to reach other attractions.

To be fair, I do feel that the Stratosphere has recieved some unfair reviews. The Stratosphere is a nice choice when staying in Las Vegas. The casino/rooms were extremely clean, and I stress EXTREMELY clean. You never had to wait on an elevator...and their speed is second to none. We were greeted with smiles from the casino staff, housekeeping, as well as their customer service reps. And \"Jerald\" made our check-out speedy, as well as pleasant. He is truely an asset to the Stratosphere! So you must be wondering why I was disappointed during our stay? Well, our recent stay was to celebrate our Anniversary and my husband's Birthday. After many hours of searching the web, I secured the best deal available thru the Stratosphere website under the \"wallet friendly\" promo. At that time, they were offering the SAME PRICE for their recently remodeled select rooms as they were for a strip view rooms. Not being sure which one would be the better choice, I called the Stratosphere directly and spoke with a booking agent. She instructed me to book the remodeled select room as many of them were strip view. That way, I could secure the nicest room available with a strip view. Before making our final reservation, I called the resort a second time to verify that this was the best booking option for me. I was again instructed by a second booking agent, that my best option was to book the remodeled select. However, she added to be sure to put my strip view request in the comments area so I could secure the strip view room....so I did. At check-in, we were informed that this was not possible, nor the best booking option. Our Check-in rep. told us that: 1.) The remodeled select and the strip view rooms are two different selections. 2.) It would have been much WISER to have reserved the strip view room as there are actually less of them available. (we had to spend our first night in a non strip view as there were no longer any availabe) AND 3rd, THAT IT WOULD COST US EXTRA TO BE UPGRADED TO THE STRIP VIEW ROOM. Unbelievable! When it was all said and done, I paid an additional $50 for a room I could have gotten cheaper during the original booking process!!! I might be made to believe that I misunderstood the conversation with the booking agents had I not called them directly on TWO DIFFERENT occasions and was told the exact same thing by each agent. It seemed that we were constantly being asked to pay additional fees. If you wanted/needed to use their WiFi, there was a fee if $12 per day, PER DEVICE. We asked if there was an area where we could check-in online and print our boarding passes, AGAIN, there was an additional charge imposed for that. After paying all of these fees, we had LESS MONEY to spend in their casino, restaurants, and gift shops. Finally, I was asked when I secured our reservation if we would be celebrating any special occasions during our stay. Which we were. I am well aware that they service thousands of customers each day, however, not once did any customer service rep acknowledge that we had chosen them to celebrate our milestone occasions. We try to visit Las Vegas every October to celebrate these dates, and in the past, at other resorts, we have been made to feel very special, like they appreciated us and our business. Overall, l would say that we were very disapponinted that we were made to feel like we were being nickel and dimed to death. Seriously, why would anyone intentionally make a reservation that would ultimately cost an extra $50 at check in? As I said, this is a nice casino, however, their need to charge a fee for everything makes some of the other \"more expensive resorts\" not quite so expensive after all. As nice as the resort was, I don't believe we would choose it again. Money is hard to earn, so why not spend it where there are less fees to paid.

The girl at the desk, Eliza, was very cheerful and helpful when I checked in. I found my way across the casino and to the elevators. I was in a Deluxe Non Smoking Room with a King Bed and a Wide Screen TV (I think there are about 20 channels, but unless you have kids, who cares, it's Vegas!). The room was immaculate. Didn't find a spoof dirt/dust anywhere. The bed was very comfortable and had 5 soft pillows. The bathroom was small, but very clean. *The water did drain just a bit slow.* My window faced the North, so the view was eh. The one thing that did bother me is that there seemed to be very little sound isolation between the door and the hallway. And on my second night, a security officer was knocking on the doors next to my room at 3:30 in the morning. Room rating: 4/5. Guests are allowed to ride the elevator to the top of the tower for free. The view is spectacular day and night! You can see for miles! The rides at the top are pretty expensive, especially the Sky Jump ($109.99). But they look thrilling considering you are over 1000 feet off the ground. Tower rating: 5/5. The casino was average. Nothing special, but no complaints. It prrovides your typical slot machines, sports books, card tables. I wanted to play craps and found a table with a $5 minimum bet. I noticed some of the blackjack, roulette, and poker tables also had $5 minimums. *Play at any of the higher end casinos, such as the Bellagio, you won't find anything lower than $10 min.* I will say that if you register for the ACE Playing card, you get a 25% discount at the buffet and a 10% discount at Roxie's (they have good food btw). Casino rating: 4/5 The location isn't in the best part of the strip. The closest big name casino is Circus Circus (which looks like a dump). Other than that, it takes about 5 minutes each way to drive to the others. Location rating: 3.5/5 (If I didn't have my rental car, the location rating would be much lower).

Have listed below plus and minus points to keep it simple... Plus - Very clean and modern rooms, with exceptionally comfortable beds. Loads of storage room, massive beds, dozens of TV channels and excellent room service. Staff at reception seemed friendly and helpful, and cleaning staff did a top class job every day. - View from top of viewing tower is spectacular. Revolving restaurant up there is pricy, but very good. Rides at the top look like great fun if that's your thing. - The buffet is incredible!! So much choice, real quality too at a great price (about 15 bucks). They seem to change what's on offer every hour, so if you're there for any long amount of time, the choice will just grow and grow. Really impressive set up, fair play to them. - The pool isn't bad, a bit dated looking in parts, but does the job. Has a bar on site, so great for unwinding after a day's walking in prep for the night ahead. Minus - Absolutely miles away from the main section of the strip, you would not walk this if it's anyway hot - we tried the first day in 45 degrees, and felt like disheveled castaways by the time we reached the first of the 'big' casinos, so taxi's are a must! The money we spent on taxis for the 4/5 days, probably would have been better spent staying somewhere closer to the main part of the strip, but if you don't mind the bit of distance, the Stratosphere is exceptional value. - The Stratosphere's casino is just awful. It's a dingy, dark, smelly, 70's-feeling, dour kip!! Made 100 times worse when you experience the flashier, wealthier casino's further up the strip. The place always seems dead of atmosphere too, no craic or banter around whatsoever. The staff working at the tables were rude, dis-interested and had no personality. It's almost impossible to get a drink of the table servers - and again, when you experience the service and buzz available in the bigger, better casinos, there is simply NO reason to stay here and spend money. - Bar the buffet, there is an average choice of food options, and what there is (Roxy's 50's diner, Italian, sub-sandwich deli, etc.) is very greasy, cheap and sickening. Ate in Roxy's twice, and felt like I would vomit after eating both times, while doing unmentionable things to my stomach for days after. - DO NOT GET THE MONORAIL BACK FROM THE STRIP!!!! It's probably about two miles from the hotel, but is advertised as leaving you right beside. Even getting to the station from the strip is a con - you have to walk through an entire casino/hotel, and then some!! The it leaves you at a casino that is now closed down, so you have to take a back entrance that leads into the 'bum town' of Vegas, where all the brothels and 'massage parlors' are, felt very unsafe in this area. So in review, great value for a clean hotel that offers a super buffet. But be warned, the strip is miles away and the casino is probably the worst in Vegas. Depending on your budget, if you're looking to save a few quid, I'd recommend the Stratosphere (even though the taxi bill will add up!) but if you have the cash, book closer to the likes of New York New York, Planet Hollywood, MGM, Ceasers, etc.). If you've booked a package or a holiday deal with no choice in the matter, and you're reading this to see what's in store - relax, the hotel is generally great! Sure, it's quite far from the action and the casino is dire, but none of these points will stop you having a great time - it's not good enough to highly recommend, but it's certainly not bad enough to avoid! I'm probably being over harsh as I'm comparing most things to the bigger, more expensive hotels/casino's up the road, so enjoy your stay and take note of the few points above and you won't go wrong, Vegas is DEADLY!!!!", "Date": "October 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hickory, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cGreat view of the Strip\u201d", "Author": "Thea2", "ReviewID": "UR118981714", "Content": "My husband surprised me with a package to Las Vegas with 6 nights at this hotel.

We had room 22007 in the Select Tower with great views of the pool and quite a few of the hotels as well as that gorgeous mountain backdrop. This hotel is very reasonably priced, in fact it was a complete bargain in comparison with the giants on the main strip. It may not be situated in the best of areas as the north of the strip appears to be dying out but this hotel holds its own. Despite location, there are many ways to get around; taxis, the deuce, monorail, by foot etc. It's a five minute car ride to the north outlets and 10 minutes to Fremont so it has its perks. Also one good thing about this hotel is that although it is bustling with visitors, it is also quite quiet and peaceful so perfect for getting away from the fast paced scene. The new renovations have given Stratosphere a new lease of life; the rooms are immaculate and the casino floor looks great too. The staff in this hotel are so friendly and helpful. I never went by any members of staff without a pleasant 'good morning' or 'hello'. This may be minor to some people but it's nice to make an effort. My in-laws had joined us on this trip for their first stay and they were overwhelmed by the courteousness of the staff and even when a slip up was made in regards to their room, it was resolved very quickly and efficiently. This is what makes the Stratosphere stand out for me. The pool area is clean and tidy. One bonus of this pool is that it is never so busy that you cannot get a sunbed and the pool wasn't over populated either. The music was an ecclectic range or modern and historic songs that suited all ages. We used Roxy's diner, the Pizzeria and McDonalds during out stay and again were very happy with the service. I have previously eaten at the Italian restaurant and Top of the World as well, both i'd definately recommend. I do think the hotel would benefit from another eaterie; maybe something with healthier options or even some Asian foods. I would also like to say the buffet was fantastic. I had the most amazing breakfasts in there. I would definately recommend this hotel for all ages. The tower has amazing views but best of all, if you are a fan of rides they have some great ones there .... not that i'd be brave enough but it was really good fun watching people going on them. You can also witness the Sky Jumpers or take part if you fancy jumping from great heights. All in all, I cannot fault this hotel. We got so many discounts using our Ace Play cards and I had some comps for last minute gifts before leaving. I would just like to say that the location may put some off but it shouldn't as the benefits outweigh this. Thank you very much for another amazing trip Stratosphere, it was one of our favourites yet.", "Date": "September 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "florida", "Title": "\u201cGREAT STAY AT THIS HOTEL\u201d", "Author": "lovetravelingplaces", "ReviewID": "UR118704664", "Content": "traveled to Vegas in September really loved this hotel--rooms clean and comfy--great strip view,saw the bungie jumpers from the room window-was pretty neat we were able to get a fridge in our room brought in for a nominal charge check in staff were great--casino was very nice-- my advice for check in--from the parking garage don't take luggage in to check in since the garage and elevators to the rooms are close together and not by the check-in desk--maybe this is normal--but thought i would pass on the info overall experience was wonderful--was great to go to the top of the sphere and see the city and the revolving restaurant and the different rides they have up there transportation--the monrail goes about a block from the hotel--so there is no problem getting anywhere you want to go to and from this hotel and for a cheap price hope to be in the vegas area again next year and would stay here again", "Date": "September 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cLevel 107 Lounge Happy Hour Is a Must\u201d", "Author": "SHoslerFoodie4Me", "ReviewID": "UR118673096", "Content": "The Towers Level 107 happy hour was great we had a nice view for sunset, live entertainment, alright food and 2-for-1 martinis.

We knew this coming in, so my opinion on the location isn't really being reflected on in my review. The casino isn't very upscale like some of the others on the main part of the strip, but it is very large with tons of games. The shops and restaurants in the casino were ok, too. Not very boutique-y, if that's what you're looking for. There is a diner and a McDonald's - which came in handy for breakfast when we were in a hurry. The tower was fantastic. The view is truely amazing. You can see all of Vegas and the surrounding area. And it is nice that the trip to the top is free if you are a guest of the hotel. My only real complaint was our room. DO NOT assume that your room will have the updated appearance of the pictures on the website. Our room looked nothing like that. The lighting was dingy and the room just looked old. Even worse that the room was the bathroom. It was so sad. A big, tall, plastic bathtub, an old toilet and sad lighting, all the same sad tan color. It was more like you were in a bad dressing room at a mall (with a toilet and bathtub) than in a bathroom inside a supposedly luxury hotel in Vegas. Also, you only get one bar of soap. The sink is outside the room with the shower, so where to store the soap becomes a question. They do give shower gel, but as someone who prefers soap to shower gel, it wasn't enough. We only stayed 2 nights, but if we had stayed longer than that I probably would have been upset by the apparent fake-out it seemed we received. All in all, I'll say that I don't think I would stay here again. I would visit for the tower view - it's amazing.

I first chose this hotel because I did not plan on visiting the \"Strip\", i found very reasonable rates and there were no exorbitant holds for incidentals or resort fees for unnecessary amenities. We stayed Monday night (September 5th, 2011) in a SELECT ROOM. I booked through TripRes.com and got the room along with TWO UNLIMITED TOWER RIDE PASSES for $90. Unlimited Ride Passes are $34 each regularly so this was a great deal. The room itself was great especially for the price paid. It looked exactly as pictured and was clean. We were on the 9th floor, Room 022 and I did not request a view. The second night after getting married we stayed in the Oasis Suite. They allowed us to check in early around 11am. When I walked in I was floored. Let me throw in that it is suppose to be a non-smoking suite but it smelled like smoke upon entry. Other than that the room was all we wanted and more. There were so few pictures available for preview so I wasn't exactly sure what I was getting myself into but I was pleasantly shocked. It was a very romantic room. Comfortable King Bed that we did not want to get out of. Two flat screens, one in front of the bed and the other in front of the Sleeper Sofa. Small table for two to dine romantically. The Jacuzzi was accessible from the room as well as the bathroom and it was huge and very relaxing. The bathroom altogether was huge and elegant. I've included plenty of pictures so you can see for yourself. We did not utilize any of the restaurants but made frequent trips to McDonald's which is located on the 2nd floor. Regular McDonald rates, Dollar Menu included and they stay open all night. The morning in the Oasis Suite we ordered BREAKFAST IN BED FOR TWO which came to only $39 with all taxes, charges and gratuities included !!! Now I think that's great. The food was upstairs quickly and EVERYTHING was delicious. We ordered French Toast, Cheese Eggs, side of Fresh Strawberries and 2 Orange Juices. The previous morning we ate at Denny's which is less than a 5 minute walk from the Hotel. We had breakfast for two there for only $17. All in all for what we went for the Hotel was great. I will add that we had no problems getting to and from the airport as we paid for Round Trip Shuttle Transportation upon arrival in Las Vegas. We rode with Ritz Transportation however there are various shuttles all lined up at the Baggage claim for your choosing. It was $32 ROUND TRIP for the two of us to be transported to Stratosphere. On the morning of departure they were there on time and yes they do pick you up 3hours before your flight's departure as it is a shared ride and most airlines have a check in time limit. There is a store on the 2nd floor that sells alcohol at a reasonable price along with other snacks, beverages and inexpensive souvenirs. Also a 24 hour Gym on the 2nd floor as well. The only negatives that I will state about the Hotel is that we felt that the pool didn't stay open long enough. It closed at 8pm and we NEVER had the time to visit. There were no Microwaves in either room. The Oasis Suite had a refrigerator but a Microwave would have been nice. Lastly this hotel has no business center which presented a huge inconvenience for us because we had no way to print our TripRes.com itinerary in order to claim our ride passes. They have a couple of computers on site however there is a minimum of $5 charge and they also place a $25 hold on your credit card. I will add that the staff at the Ticketing counter was helpful in resolving this problem.

She claimed there was a Shuttle that wasn't part of the Hotel that will drive us to the Airport, but that we have to be 3 hours prior at some specific spots and that we were already late to take it. So, there wasn't anything else she could of help us with... She seemed very young to be a Concierge and we didn't feel she was willing to help us. At the end, we didn't want to spend another $30.00 for taxi again, so we used our GPS Iphone and look for directions. Thankfully, we ride for free to the Airport with a 24hrs pass we purchased the day before when touring the strip. It was a plus that we only had carry-on bags, so we were able to a walk couple of blocks from the hotel to the bus stop. It's amazing how much help you could get from an Smartphone and not from a human being. Regardless what happened, we liked our stay at The Stratosphere. But I'll be more interested to look for other good deals and closer hotels to the strip.

Bar & Starbucks in the main area. Nice Italian restaurant Fellini's, where staff were so goo, and food also.Not keen on Roxy's diner, continental breakfast was too $$ & not enough. So we didn't go back. Upstairs you have a number of shops. Some tacky, some not. A few places to eat, ie. Mexican, where the meals are huge. My Hubby & I shared chicken fajitas, and it was just fine. Our anniversary dinner was at The Top Of The World restaurant at the top of the tower. The tower is a must, even if not eating there. We booked a table at 7.30, but went up early while it was still light. The views out to the mountains and the sunset was amazing. But the best is when all the lights of Vegas start to come on. Makes for a very special place. Our meal with drinks for 4 people was approx USD100 per person. But well worth it. The room we had was a strip view room on the 23rd floor. Not exactly a strip view, but you could see a few hotels. We booked via Zuji, but found when we got to hotel there was only a standard room booked, even though I had it in black & white what we had paid for. Reception did there best to find us a nice room, but we had to pay an extra $22 per night for a renovated strip view room. We were happy to at the time as we got a real cheap deal on accommodation. ( taking it up with Zuji to get money back. Watch this space!) Hubby went on Insanity ride...the name says it all.

The sun was shining and the sky is blue this time of the year. Temperature 110F. Great for photography. The room bathroom smell like sewer in the night, it was a strong odor. There is no ironing board and everything inside was expensive. There is a Butger King at 100 meters form the hotel Going north. I eated at Roxys and ended paying $20.00 for a sandwich. I booked a \"remodeled\" room, and had no WIFI. TV channels are only news and they charge you for any movies. I asked to use a computer, they sent me to the Starbuck cafe at the Hotel, they wanted to charge me $5 for 5 minutes, rip off. I went outside, and in front of the Hotel going south, there is Aztec Casino, at the corner of the boulevard, and for $5 you have 20 minutes of internet and with printer where you can print boarding pasess, nice deal. AHHHH, and Coke or pepsi cans, .99 cents! Here are other tips. 1) At airport take the Shuttle, they are located just outside baggage claim area exit doors. Grayline, CLS etc. One way trip to Strip Hotels is $7.00, round trip $12.00. Downtown hotels are two or three dollars more. Pay only the one way trip Airport- Hotel. The Shuttle from hotel to airport always arrive late at airport and you can have problems with your flight. Why? The shuttle go to different hotels to pick up other people, while you are sitting inn the shuttle, thinking vabout your flight. Taxi Strip Hotels-Airport is only $12-14.00. I would pay it to arrive on time at airport. 2) Transportation at the Strip- Take the Deuce. Is a double decker bus, with A/C, and new, you pay $7.00 to the driver for 24 hours transportation within the Strip. YTou need to have exact change enterring the bus, in front of the driver there is a machine. You enter the dollars, the system give you a ticket you can use in any Deuce Bus for a 24 hours period. You only have to slip the ticket next time, and wala! you got the deal.! Is a very clean bus. 3) Study the place before going, see videos at internet, you tube, see pictures at tripadvisor, read reviews, the more you learn the more you will save. 4) Food- There is a burger king about 100 meters to the north. You will se the sign as soon as you walk a few steps. The Bellagio Fountains a show you must see. The show runs every half and hour. Also, try to go up the Eifell Tower at Paris Hotel, is $15.00 per person and the view is beautiful, by day or night. Fremont Street is another place to go. The light show is amazing. And is a very safe and clean place. I found this place to be very expensive with little services to offer to the travellers. The only good thing it have is the Tower, you have to pay $16.00 to go up. But if you stay in the hotel, show your room key, and you can go as many times as you want. SKY JUMPER- Insanity Rides. As i said, nothing is free or cheap at this hotel. Sky Jump is $110.00 per person. Insanity rides price range from $13 to $15.00. I do not recommend this hotel for a budget traveller. It does not offer alternatives to traveler within this economy crisis.

After 9+hours of travel time I still smiled and was polite, and Lo and behold we were upgraded to a room on the 20th floor looking over the city with a distant backdrop of the mountains; awesome view at anytime of the day or night. The room was clean and did not smell of smoke or anything unpleasant, had 2flat screen tv's one in the bedroom portion and the 2nd in the sitting area. The bed was very comfortable and wish I could've taken it home. The staff was very pleasant and everyone encountered would always smile and say hello, and ask how our day was going. I've read reviews about the staff being rude and I did not find this to be true at all, then again we are pretty self sufficient and didnt require being waited on too much. Luxury is not the name of this place, more like family friendly or for people who are easy going and relaxed. The buffet was good, breakfast was the meal we ate here although a bit small. I found it odd they had taco bar and MAC and cheese and other lunch items at breakfast at 9am and it seemed as if they were filling space. The 2nd time we ate here was more out of conveinance, if able to drive 15mins to the red rock hotel and casino; there breakfast buffet was 1/2 the price and twice as good with probably 3x the selection. We only played penny slots and not to much at that but I was real happy with the return payout, and the cocktail service is hit or miss depending on the time I guess. We had barely sat down one time and had a waitress over for a drink, she came back within 10mins at that! The second night we sat down real late in the night and sat for about 20-30mins and didn't get approached once. The only complaint I have is about the waitress at the buffet. Our second time eating, which was sat am, we had plates piling up and drinks empty while she talked to the table next to us. Now she wasn't giving advice or directions, but they appeared to be socially chatting. When she did come over to collect plated she didn't bother to ask if we wanted refills on our clearly empty drinks. I hate to complain but she was clearly more interested in chatting than working. When she did ask if we wanted a refill we were already getting up to leave. Last thing is that the location is far but if your booking this hotel you should already know that. We had a car rental and were glad of it. We also left the hotel walking at about 2am, and didn't have any safety concerns. I being a small female would have done this same walk if I was alone, but there are \"locals\" that you'll encounter. However, we also noticed about a cop on every corner. While people have complained about feeling unsafe you have to remember this is Vegas where how many tourists visit annually, and the last thing the city wants is a tourist having a bad experience.

But that's not the reason I picked it. The Stratosphere hotel is cheap, very cheap. I can only assume there is fierce competition between the cheaper hotels in Las Vegas, cheap rates in high volumes. For the price, I really cannot complain. The location is not prime, but it is on the strip. A short taxi to the main area of the strip, but we found the long walks hopping between casino's to be fun. The rooms are not plush, but they are decent quality. We chose the 'premier rooms' which have been updated more recently and are on slightly higher floors - the price difference is negligible, so definitely upgrade at least one step. One bonus of staying here is the free access to the tower. It is however, just a tower, so not overly exciting although it is nice extra to be able to go up there without having to pay. Downstairs there is of course the casino, and a small shopping mall with restaurants, eateries, and stores. On one of the higher floors there is an outdoor swimming pool and sunbathing area.

We enjoy the Stratosphere for this reason. This time when we checked in we got the connecting rooms, but we were on the same floor as the pool. That became a problem because of the noise. We asked to move, but nothing was available. We then had to deal with the noise of construction going on and asked to move again. The manager moved us to the \"Remodeled Rooms\" and let me tell you they are worth every penny. Stratosphere if you remodel every room like this you can compete with any 5 star Hotel on the strip. However, as difficult as it maybe you will need to improve the customer service as not everyone on the staff is friendly and they let you know that right off the bat. Again the management is great and helpful and responsive to the needs of the guest. We went to see a free show as well with the stars and the kids loved it. A real surprise, I also love the buffet.

At check-in, the girl asked us (three guys) whether we wanted an extra bed. Considering that it was free, we agreed to it. The room was towards the very back of the hotel, it was old and full of grunge. The window we had was tiny and the bathroom was claustrophobic. We decided to go out for the day and got back to the hotel at 2 am. Guess what: the extra bed still hadn't arrived! So, we called the front desk if they could send an extra bed. We had to wait an extra 20 minutes for that bed to arrive. But the best is still to come: the next morning, at 10 am, we receive a phone-call. My friend answered and after a few times of saying \"yes\" and \"aha\", he hangs up and tells us that a woman was calling from security. She told him that we were to go to the front-desk immediately because of safety issues. So, we got dressed and hurried to the elevator. At the bottom, police units and hotel security were keeping people from going up but nobody wanted to tell us what was going on. We went to the front desk and asked them why they woke us up. They didn't have a clue what we were talking about and suggested we ask at security. We went to security and there they only told us that they would offer us a free breakfast. So, during breakfast, the head of security showed up and explained us that there had been a shooting in the room under us. That's why they had to evacuate our floor. After breakfast we wanted to go back to our room, but there was a security guy in front of the elevator, telling us that our floor was still under investigation and that he didn't know when it would be ok to go back. So, we looked around and saw dozens of police cars outside. After an hour we asked again and the security officer said it was safe to go up again. While you may only pay 30 to 50 USD for the night, it soon becomes clear why this hotel is so cheap. It is located at the outer end of the Strip and after dark, there are some shady characters hanging out in front of it.

We stayed in the tower where the pool was located. This is the older tower so the rooms aren't as upgraded as those in the Select tower. Staying on the same level as the pool made up for the wait for a room! Our room was very spacious. BUT, our bathroom was not the best. The shower/tub and toilet were located behind a closed door (tight space) while the sink was outside. My wife didn't care for that setup very much. Things to do in the hotel Although my older son thought the hotel didn't have enough action, it was good to me. The hotel is at the far north end of the strip. It's a good walk to the main part of the strip. We had a car so was able to drive to where we wanted to go. I heard taxi rides were like $20 which seems very high to me. Roxy's restaurant was delicious at a good value for a large family. The buffet was a little overpriced so we didn't eat there. The tower gives one a good view of the city. We went up in the evening...free admission for hotel guests. I am not daring enough to ride the rides they have atop the tower. I don't gamble and I really hate that these casinos force families through the gambling areas. All the casinos we visited had smoke everywhere. The Bellagio seemed to have the cleanest, breathable air as we walked through the casino area to get to the shops and garden. Everywhere else is a second-hand smoke fest. Anyway, the Statosphere is pretty busy but not as busy as those hotels closer to the strip. I personally like the quieter places. Also, this hotel didn't require a marathon walk to any one part of the hotel. We walked through the MGM, Ceasars, and Bellagio and felt like we'd walked a marathon. The pool was nice as well. The pool is located on the 8th floor. It's not as big as the pool at other casinos (i.e., Excalibur, MGM Grand), but it worked for us. We don't sunbath...there weren't very many shady areas on the 8th floor. So, we just had to stay in the water until we were ready to go back to our room. I would definitely recommend this hotel. The value was unbeatable.

I booked an \"Oasis Suite\" for two nights while on my own (due to a mixed bag of travel plans between myself and my wife). The value for the room was excellent; I paid about what I would have paid for a standard room at many other mid-range hotels. The suite was huge, with a jacuzzi tub and aseperate shower in a bathroom that was close to the size of standard room on its own. A very comfortable experience for the price. The suite was clean, the bed comfortable, and it was well-appointed with two TVs, coffee maker, safe and refrigerator. The tower is hoot to visit and the view of Las Vegas from the top is stunning. I spent almost an hour at sunset mesmerized by the view. The best part is that you have free admission to the tower with your room. I dined both evenings at the Level 107 lounge in the tower, where 2 for 1 martinis and half priced appetizers were served (both the martinis and the appetizers were excellent as well). The Stratosphere staff was head and shoulders above the rest in Las Vegas. Most Las Vegas hotel staff I have dealt with provide indifferent service at best. I received OUTSTANDING, friendly, affable service, especially at the front desk (from \"Haunani\") and at the acePLAY desk (their slots card ID station, \"Les\" and \"Annie\" were both delightful people).

I did some research and learned A LOT about bed bugs, and EVERY hotel in Las Vegas has reports of having them. They are very destructive and hard to get rid of...needless to say I wanted to change our plans and stay with a friend in LV. However, my other friend had booked the hotel as a mystery deal and couldnt back out of it without forfeiting the entire sum of the room. SO, I went in VERY critical, expeciting to find a not so hott place. As we checked in, I was very blunt and told the check-in lady that I woud prefer a room without any reports of bed bugs, as I told her I know this hotel has had reports. She looked at us and took us very seriously, as I presumed to get out my list of rooms that have had reports.......She offered to upgrade us, but we declined. We took the initally offered room on the Central Floor, (10th) floor. The room was nice, simple, everything one needs. I completely took my bed apart all the way down the the frame.....and found a few dust bunnies, which is to be expected as im sure with 2000+ rooms they cant do a gut of the roms every day. Matressess appeared new, carpet was wore, but its Vegas who gives a crap...wear slippers...new flat screen TV. Our view was nice, over the foothills. All in all, I have no bites, and the room was clean! CASINO- Ive been to vegas once before to celebrate my 21st, and have done the partying, clubbing, walk-the-strip, etc, so this was a weekend to relax. I am a seasoned gambler. There are many machines to choose from. Lay out is easy and open. not cramped. Theres a great mix of machines with bets ranging from 10 cents to 20$+. There are old reels, and new video machines. I hit one prgressive during our two days on the Cleopatra for 330$, which helped. They werent tight, but not great, but they kept us playing, and my goodness, every time we turned there were great ladies offering us cocktails and drinks. Every day we earned our free buffett, so between food and drinks, we didnt come out so bad! All in all ok! Location: It is the last main hotel on the strip, with Riviera and Circus Circus being the closest. However, every one makes it seem that they are far far away...not really, i think the total walk is like a lil more than 4 miles to Mandalay Bay.....If your not afraid of walking, and if you get half way lucky and have great weather, I think the highest high was maybe 99, 100 with a great breeze, so it was comortable to walk! FOOD- They have like a little mall upstairs on the way to the tower with the rides, i think fat tuesdays, mickey D's, a hot dog place, Annies, and maybe a few more up there I cant remember. Downstairs they have Roxys, which is a 50s diner, which we never ate at beause we ate for free at the buffet. I believe \"Plate,\" was the buffet at the Strat. VERY VERY resonable and AWESOME food! Fresh, appealing, and filling and best of all if you had to buy it wasnt that expensive, the champagne brunch on the weekend i believe was 24.99, everything else was less. I thought it was amazing, GREAT CRAB LEGS as my friends would tell you! Overall I was very hard on this hotel, and they made the grade. They met AND exceeded my expectations. Way to go Stratosphere, I will be back with my husband, and cant WAIT!!!! Downer was the pool~ I LOVE LOVE swimming, and was looking forward to the pool. Its not horrible, just would have expected a little more. Very teeny bopper, service was good though, and the view from the strat pool, AMAZING, youll never beat it at another hotel....the foothills all around, and if your tall enough, you can look over the ledge at the city, so the view made up for it.

We ate at the Top of the World restaurant 1000 feet above the strip, & I proposed to my girlfriend. Robert the manager ensured we had a great experience, & our waitress Dana was fabulous. We never waited in long lines anywhere in the hotel/casino. The Bite show was very entertaining for the money, and Roxy's diner was good as well. It was obvious to me that the Stratosphere is making a great effort to compete with the newer extravagant casinos with better customer service and prices. Everywhere we went we were asked if we needed anything or if there was anything they could improve upon. I think this place is a great value for the money. The tower views are amazing, there are several retail shops, restaurants, rides, etc. There really is a lot to do right there at the Stratosphere. You cannot walk conveniently to the heart of the strip, but we simply took a $15 cab ride down there. The only negative thing I can think of is I lost $3 in the soda machine, & upon calling the front desk it was promptly credited back to me with no questions asked. We will for sure stay here again, & if we do stay somewhere else in the future it will simply be for a change of scenery/location. I think the Strat is on the way back up!

The check in queue was quite long, but we were seen to quickly and offered an upgrade of the room. The room itself was spacious, clean, had a view towards the strip (although you could not see much of the strip, but you could see down to the pool area). I thought that the hotel was definitely good value for money, although I've not stayed in Vegas before to comment on the other hotels available. Yes the hotel is at the end of the strip, but we found that we could walk along the strip with ease to the other hotels & attractions. If you're not very active it may be best to drive or get the bus though as you can cover quite a lot of miles in the warm weather. We ate at the hotel buffet once which was average. Not in a bad way, but there was nothing spectacular about the buffer that made it stand out compared to others.

For what we paid we thought the hotel was a great value. The front desk service was excellent, we checked in and they automatically upgraded us. We've both been to Las Vegas before and stayed in various hotels on the strip but none were as friendly or accommodating as the Stratosphere. I strongly recommend getting a select room, these are newly renovated rooms and they are really nice. Check the pictures out online, they truly look like the pictures. We also went up the tower on the 107 and 108 floors, which showcases a beautiful view of the strip and downtown. The drinks are a little spendy, but it's Vegas, you can't expect anything less on the strip. The hotel has a great dining selection, you can go to the buffet and with your ace card get 35% off, the buffet is certainly not the Wynn buffet but it still has a really good selection of food for a cheaper price. They also have a restaurant in the tower, we didn't go there but we met up with some people who really enjoyed their dining experience there. Finally, they have a pizzeria, McDonalds, Roxy's diner type food, and an Italian restaurant so you really can't go wrong. Most times we did eat out, I would strongly suggest the Eiffel Tower at the Paris Hotel, we had a great view of the water fountains at the Bellagio and the dining experience was superb. As for the Stratosphere, the hotel is a little out of the way from other strip hotels. The strip is only approximately 4 miles long but between the Stratosphere and the mid-strip areas it feels A LOT longer. However, the bus is only $7 a day (or $15 for three days) so you can just ride that. The buses are really nice coach buses so it's truly not a big deal. The only complaint I had about the hotel is the poker table and other gambling table staff were not very friendly or helpful. We went to a few other casinos and they were much more friendly and helpful. There also is no microwave or fridge in room, but as this wasn't a big deal to us we weren't worried.

Better idea is to dine out or use the fast food outlets for quick snacks. - Location at End of strip - Best option is to rent a car and travel around.

The croupiers and staff on the gaming tables are also friendly which I didn't find in every casino. The buffet has a huge selection of food although I only ever went there for breakfast (as there's a Denny's just behind the Strat). Get yourself a Stratosphere Players card (free) to get 25% off of the buffet price and make sure that you visit the tower (free with your room key), which is amazing at night; being able to see the lights on the strip. The only 2 reasons that I probably won't be back to stay at the Stratosphere are that a) I've stayed there 3 times now so would like to test out a different hotel and b) since the closure of the Sahara and the Stardust, the location of the Stratosphere feels a little out of the loop.

The hotel is an unreal value for Las Vegas! The select rooms are remodeled like new, clean and modern. Bedding is great, all rooms have LCD TV's, and has a modern decor. The location is convienient to the Convention Center and both the main strip and downtown Las Vegas (Freemont Street). Parking was easy and with the attached garage, only steps away from my room and the casino. Most hotels you have to walk a mile to your car. I especially liked this for when I was traveling on business...that plus the starbucks at the bottom of the elevators!! The dining at the Stratosphere is great, and a pretty good value! I at in my room, and was very impressed with the quality of the food! I also ate in the Italian Restaurant, it was pretty good for not being in New York or Chicago and very resonable prices. The pool deck was nice.. the pool bar was even better! I also could not believe the shops that were in the hotel,,,I would have never guessed as they are in the second level out of the way, but they are very convienient for people who stay at the hotel. I had an important meeting and used the spa for a haircut. The people at the spa were great!! Very helpful and did great work. The fitness center is in the retail area just off the elevators, and is perfect for someone trying to get a work out while away. Most of the time the LV hotel fitness centers are intimidating and difficult to find and use. This one simply use your key for access as you would any hotel, and then hit the treadmill. No pushhy or intimidating staff to deal with. The only negative to this resort is the crazy vegas nightlife is a cab ride away (5 blocks), as there is not a nightclub here. However if you are saving 50-100 dollars a night, you can deal with the cabride....During the day, as long as you dont mind a nice walk, all is within walking distance. Since the closing of the Sahara, the closest other resorts are the Riviara and Circus Circus to the south on LVB about 4 blocks away. Wynn's Encore then the Wynn then TI and Veneitan.......a few more blocks... To me, the savings is well worth it for what you get in return! Bottom line is when you look at the price and what you get for the money, nothing else can come close for the value during your Vegas Get Away.

NOT. I didn't find this stay very pleasant. Not one I would go back to. As a teen I came with both my parents and my 14 year old brother. To start with, check-in took a long time. We had to sit and wait for my mom to finish for what seemed like centuries.. (well maybe thats because we were so excited to be in Vegas). Nonetheless, we asked for a room with a great view so they gave us Level 23 .. little did we know this level would be a nightmare for us later on. Level 23 (second to last highest level) was undergoing \"Fire-Alarm Testing\". On the first day, this ANNOYING automated announcer on the intercom kept speaking literally every 5 seconds for a good ONE AND A HALF HOUR. She kept repeating \"THIS IS A FIRE ALARM TEST. WE APOLOGIZE FOR ANY INVCONVIENCE. THANKYOU\" every 5 seconds until our heads exploded. We couldn't even watch TV or talk on the phone because it was SO loud on the intercom speakers. Speaking of TV's, they have a flat-screen television, but from then on it SUCKS. I don't know whats wrong with the remote, it won't flip the channels/adjust volume unless you REALLY press hard. Also, when you turn on the TV it's automatically set to this HIGH volume so it wakes everybody up. It's not like you can adjust it from the start because the remote won't even work. They also have very limited channels, but that wasn't a problem for us because in Vegas you're doing alot of other things-- but I warn the TV lovers. The shower. OH the shower. I don't know what was worst, the walls of the shower looking like they were about to tear off, or the SHOWER HEAD that had no water coming out of it. It was the worst shower head i've ever used. IT doesn't even have holes in it, it's this ONE huge water hole and it spreads out as it hits your body but when it does, there is barely any water touching you. Sucks. And our bad luck for taking Level 23 doesn't stop there. Some of the elevators wouldn't even take us to that level. We had to literally go to Level 22, and then CLIMB THE STAIRS to go to our room. We had to do this same routine for our entire stay there. It doesn't help when it's the last day, and you have LUGGAGE'S to carry and you're running up dirty looking stairs to get to your room to grab last minute things. We were gonna call the front desk and ask to move to another level, but the days were just so hectic that really- it was never done. ALSO, whenever we got to our level to get to our room, the walls of the hallways were literally tearing off. LITERALLY, FALLING OFF. I don't know if they were undergoing RECONSTRUCTION as well as the Fire-Alarm Test, but walls were coming down and white powder was covering part of the floors (some being vacuumed, the others not). The room by itself is nothing special-- at all. Unless you get the upgraded room (we didn't) it looks really bland and un-comforting. You have two beds, none of them have any color on the blankets, it's just white sheets. One flat screen TV (which fools you when you're trying to use the remote) a small coffee table in the back corner with a chair and a huge window with the view of the city (the only NICE part about the room). The pool is fine, lots of beach balls to throw around and play with. Jacuzzi is not hot at all, but who really cares about that. Lots of sunbeds surrounding the pool area but the deck isn't anything special, just white cement. Oh, and I hope you don't mind walking a good 5 minutes to get to the pool area, because it's not at a location where your elevator takes you and it's right in-front of you. You have to pass through numerous hallways, passing rooms to even get there. Casino looks like all the other hotels we went to. I can't really comment on that because i'm a teen and of-course didn't spend my time there. The Buffet there was pretty good, it was HUGE but I was told Vegas is the place for Buffets so perhaps that's how they all are, idk? It was delicious, lots of desserts. I recommend going there for brunch/dinner if you end up staying. It's cheaper if you have an ACE card because you get 25% off on the total charge. The retail-mall was okay. I thought it was the greatest thing coming from quiet ol' Colorado, and then we went to the Venetian to see their shopping area and was like OH WOW. Overall, my trip to Vegas as far as all the sight-seeing was amazing. I really loved the city, but this hotel we stayed at was not-so-great. It's definitely not a place we will be returning to. If you're a family visiting or anyone who is knit-picky (like myself ;p) I would NOT recommend coming here. It was nothing special, PLUS the disaster we had on Level 23 made matters way worse. I was going to say if you go, don't stay on Level 23 but a lady in the elevator said she was there last month and they had the SAME Fire-Alarm Testing on Level 8, and it was the second time this happened to her. So beware which level they put you on, so you don't get caught in the midst of the chaos.

Bed wasn't heavenly but it was soft enough to sleep comfortably. The tub in the bathtub was deep which was great to soak after an 8 mile run a few days out of the weekend. The casino was great. I won a decent amount of money, signed up for the ACE card and even got some perks. The buffet was ok nothing to write home about but good enough to satisfy your hunger without making you run to the bathroom. The towers and all of the shops are cool. Make sure you stop at Fat Tuesdays and get a huge drink. Getting to the hotel wasn't bad. I actually took the bus directly from the airport which stops right up the block from the hotel. Getting to the strip is fairly easy with 3 options (well four if you dont mind walking): 1. Walk down to the Golden Nugget and catch the Monorail (Most expensive): The monorail is fast but drops you off at certain points OFF the strip so unless you're going to MGM Grand or Harrah's its not exactly convenient and it costs the most. 2. Purchase a bus ticket and catch the Deuce down the strip (you can also use the regular bus pass). The only drawback is that the Deuce stops at every stop from the Stratosphere all the way down the strip (stops are like every .25 to .5 mile) and the trip take virtually forever. 3. Purchase the bus pass with the SDX (Express) option. The express bus only stops at certain stops and cuts down GREATLY on the trip time from the Strat. Note that the Gold line doesn't pick up on Las Vegas Blvd. adjacent to the Stratosphere. You have to cross the street and catch it on St. Louis St. (which is right around the corner). The Strat is great for the price and a cool place. If you dont mind being away from the lights and glory, I'd definitely stay there again.

There were no additional charges once we arrived at the hotel. The casino is smaller than some of the other hotels but it was also cheaper with $5 blackjack tables (most in Las Vegas are $10 - 20 minimum). This hotel is about one hour walk from the other hotels on the strip but there is a good bus service. It is closer to the 'Downtown' area which is the old Las Vegas. We actually liked being away from the big casinos as it was a lot cheaper (ie food, diners, casinos, general shopping etc). We also liked being away from the main tourist area as it was a bit less manic. The Stratosphere is the tallest building in Las Vegas and has a viewing platform up top as well as roller coasters. Being scared of heights this didn't interest me but it seemed a popular thing to do. There is a great pool at Stratosphere as well. Overall I loved this hotel.

The rooms aren't large, but they're very new-age looking (as are the hallways leading to them), they come with flat screen TVs, a nice desk and a comfortable bed. There is a chair and a small table, and that's about it. On my most recent stay though, the toilet did drip which was a minor annoyance. (4/5) Cleanliness: The rooms tend to be very clean here. Nothing to complain about. (5/5) Extras: Soap, shampoo, conditioner. There's a safe in the room. Very basic. (4/5) Service: Check-in is generally quick and efficient, even right at 3pm which is check-in. Check-out tends to be a longer process because there is less staffing and the people who check-out at the desk rather than through their TV (or by just leaving) tend to have issues that take longer than checking in. (4/5) Value: You can get rooms at the Stratosphere for around $20-$30 during the week and slightly more on the weekends. If you're staying here though, rent a car.

We arrived late afternoon having travelled from the UK. The que at reception was quite long however it did move quickly. We had a mix up at reception with our room request however it was soon sorted out and we were given a newly refurbished room in the tower. Although we'd paid for a strip view which was not available we did still have a good view as it was looking onto the tower so we could see the bungee jumpers all day which was fun. The location of this hotel is not the best however we knew this when booking. The area feels safe during the day however I would recommend a taxi on the evening if you are going up the strip. We ate in the hotel restaurants on 4 occasions and unfortunately we were dissapointed with some of the restaurants. Roxy's Diner none of our party enjoyed. The waitress serving us had very bad manners and at one point slamed a drink on the table, the food was ok. The buffet restaurant again was ok, I personally enjoyed the breakfast more than the evening buffet however this may have been because we ate at the buffet quite late around 8ish. Felini's we all enjoyed the food very much however again were disapointed by the service. The menu states that a service charge will be added for parties over 6 - there were 4 people in our party however the service charge at 18% was added to the bill. When I queried this with the waiter I was told there was an error on the menu. I explained that because the menu states parties over 6 then they should honour what is advertised to the customers until the menu is amended. The waiter went on to explain that he and the other staff were on minimum wage and needed the service charge to get by. I was starting to get annoyed at this point - we always tip generously when we receive a good service anyway so this excuse was not on. I asked to see the manager and was told he was not there. I asked when he would be back and I was told not until the next day. Once I said I would come back when the manager was present the waiter told me he would remove the service charge. I found it suspicious that the waiter could just remove the service charge like that once I'd said I'd come back to speak with the manager. We still left a generous tip as we did enjoy the food however if you are a party under 6 beware of this and check your bill. We also used some of the snack bars such as mcdonalds and tower pizza which were both lovely and good value for money. The pool area is lovely and the waitresses around the pool are very polite and attentive. It's nice to go up to the pool to relax however please note you can't take any drinks to the pool area. We did experience problems with the guests on our floor half way through out stay who quite frankly were rude and ignorant. The most vile people I have met in my life. There were 3 ladies in there party and the noise they made during the night was unreal. Now I know it's vegas and everyone is there to have a good time however singing along the corridor, shouting along the corridor, slamming doors and playing music up until 7am is not on! My mam noticed them one day in the corridor and asked if they'd keep the noise down and they replied \"no they would not as they were on vacation and they didn't give a F...\". To be honest these so called ladies looked like they'd just jumped off a Jeremy Springer show. We sometimes came in at 3am or 4am but we always respected other guests on our floor therefore were as quiet as possible. Overall it was a good stay in the hotel which has some very good facilities. The hotel is clean and spacious and the pool area is lovely and relaxing.

I booked this hotel due to a great deal I found on their website. Initially, my first choice was the Luxor but I decided against it. Unfortunately, I regret my decision as the Stratoshere did not meet my expectations. First of all, location is not the best. We rented a car so this was not a huge problem, however I would have preferred to stay in walking distance from the main attractions. In addition, there are not many restaurants and shopping facilities nearby and the area looks shabby and unsafe. Especially if walking north of the hotel, there are lots of homeless and suspicious characters, some of them even spend their time in the casino. I was quite astonished that homeless people can enter the hotel premises without being noticed by security staff. Furthermore, front desk and casino area look worn if not even dirty and there is cigarette smoke everywhere. The pool is average, nothing special but not bad either. Nevertheless, I felt disturbed by the loud music which made it impossible to relax. This seems to be a problem in all hotels in Las Vegas, though. Apart from the tower which offers only mediocre views, there is nothing to do in the hotel. Restaurants and shops did not seem to be appealing to me, especially compared to the unique experience of Venetians\u2019s Canal Grande or others. As a positive aspect I have to mention the room which was double the size of what I am used from Europe. Mattresses and beds are great and I could not hear a single sound from outside. Air condition worked well what was very important to me as windows cannot be opened. Also no bad criticism on staff, everyone I talked to was friendly and helpful.

There r 4 rides up there which r extra. if you are looking to do the new sky jump when up there, then dig deep in to those pockets cause its a $100. that dosnt include a photo thats extra.sorry stratasphere in my opinion this is not reasonably priced, $50 yes $100 NO there is a show called bite that is on most nights discounts available from the discount booths up and down the strip. 6TH GAMBLING pretty much what you would expect from a casino loads of tables and machines 7TH OVERALL this hotel in my opinion gives excellant value for money. yes it is a bit away from the centre of the strip, but the cost of a room out weighs this. you may read some bad reviews but when a hotel has thousands of rooms, there r going to be the odd problem. you only have to read the reviews of some of the more expensive hotels which all come with there own set of problems. so i would highly recommend this hotel. if anybody would like anymore info you can contact me through tripadviser if a member of stratasphere reads this i would like to make a couple of comments to you but cannot find an email address", "Date": "May 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBest value stay in vegas!!\u201d", "Author": "phippo99", "ReviewID": "UR108852620", "Content": "this was our 2nd trip to vegas and we werent disappointed.

BUT in this case it was a good walk cause we saw how we we're treated, they gave us a TOTALLY different hotel, this \"central\" area it's like the hotel we were waiting for, nice hallways, clean and renovated rooms, I felt like I was in another hotel, we felt they mistreated us because we booked travelocity, they gave us the old, stinky stratosphere. and the LOCATION is the worst possible if you are trying to enjoy the Vegas Strip, it's the very first hotel at the north of the strip and the surroundings are not pleasant, to say the least, you have to walk about 1 hour to reach the heart of the strip, if it wasn't for the bus, it would be terrible. We mostly only had contact with the front desk staff and the tower staff, including a nice gentleman at the elevator, and they were all TOP NOTCH, it's not their fault that we got such an old and stinky hotel, we're definitely not staying there anymore. We should have gone to the Luxor, or even Circus Circus.

We paid a little extra for one of the upgraded rooms, and although we don't know what the old rooms were like, we were reasonably happy with it. Though quite small, it was nicely renovated and mostly comfortable. Like most of the hotels we stayed in in the USA the beds were really high and that was kind of awkward; they're really just a little to high to comfortably sit on them to put your shoes on! The most frustrating part was the pillows, though; they were extremely thin, and the filling split as soon as I put my head on it, so I may as well have not had one at all. I did ring housekeeping to ask for a better one, and they said that they only have thin pillows, so I should use two (really, having the filling from two pillows up beside my head is no better than having the filling from one there, so I gave up pretty quick and used spare clothes to prop my head up). The other frustration was the constant noise from some enormous fans (airconditioning units? coolrooms?) just below our window. Not particularly loud, but after the noise of the casinos the last thing you want is more noise, so it was rather frustrating. The lack of a fridge in the room didn't help either. The shopping level of this hotel is in decline, with quite a few empty shops and a rather tired look to the place. The Mexican restaurant, though, is fantastic and well worth a stop. The hotel isn't a long way from the strip, but after a night of wandering the casinos on the Strip you will probably want to take a taxi back. The public transport options in Vegas are extremely expensive, and we found that a taxi from the Strip to the Stratosphere was only a couple of dollars more than the bus or monorail, so we didn't use the bus at all. One advantage of being at the Stratosphere though was being able to drive to it and away from it with a minimum of fuss. We didn't at at the Stratosphere's buffet, mainly because I found the advertising a little deceptive. They promote a 10% off arrangement, but it turned out that it was only for one member of the party, and it was still quite expensive, so we went elsewhere. Circus Circus had a great buffet at a much better price, and there's a Denny's right next door. Overall, I'd say Stratosphere is a great option if you're on a tight budget AND get a good deal.

We had an incredible view of a PARKING GARAGE. I dont stay in the stratosphere to check out a parking garage all week. 3) The carpet in the rooms was disgusting and the rooms were just a tiny level above your common Howard Johnson 4) Not once while I gambled was I offered a drink. This is just common casino courtesy. This was a big issue with me. If I am spending money in your casino and staying there, at least offer me a drink while I gamble. 5) I was woken up every day at around 9am by the sound of jet engine vaccum cleaners. THIS IS VEGAS people. We stay out till 4 and sleep until noon. This alone would keep me from ever coming back. 6) The food options go from expensive to unreal pricey here. You figure being so far from the main strip of hotel you would offer something to entice people in. A cheap buffet, a gamblers special, cheap drinks. But none of those was available at all. Way better and cheaper drink and food options in the REAL strip. 7) There was no coffee maker in the room 8) The \"air conditioner\" in our room barely put out air. It was steaming in our room all weekend 9) The INFO desk people were no help ever and almost as rude as the casino bar bartenders 10) The pool was cool though. Even though drinks are $11 a piece, at least the pool was nice and clean and enjoyable 11) Needs much better ventilation in the casino. It smells like pee and cigarettes in there. Compared to stratosphere the bellagio was purified air. 12) Get ready to spend $15 each way on a cab,because this place is FAR away from the main hotels. Beyond walking distance. About 3 miles from Bellagio. If you want to have fun in a cool casino it will cost you $30 round trip on cabs. 14) The casino bar is a huge miss. They really need to clean it up and do something cool with it, replace the bartenders, offer more specials and they will have people meeting there and partying there hardcore. If these things had been like that when we were there we would have stayed at the hotel and spent all our money on drinks there. But it was a miserable experience even being at the bar, so we left. 15) Overall the hotel was sub par and the service was horrible. I was counting the minutes until I could leave the stratosphere.

One elevator was out of service the entire stay and since one elevator was reserved for the top floor, that left 3 elevators to serve all rooms.

I was a bit apprehensive when booking this, but decided to go with an open mind and see what I thought. I am really glad I did. I was very pleasantly suprised with the Stratosphere. To start with, check-in was very quick and the woman at the front desk even upgraded us to a room with a fridge, which was much appreciated. Our room was set up like a little mini suite, had a nice view of the mountains, and was very clean. We decided to check out the buffet the next day and were very happy with that as well. Not only did we get 25% off for joining/being a member of the players club, but the variety and quality of food was great! We also ordered room service several times and were happy with that, as well.

The hotel was nice but not great, it felt very outdated in some parts. The room was nice and spacious but our view was of a Carl's Junior restaurant and worn down apartments, the only entertaining thing about the view was we could see the bungee jumpers falling past our window every so often which was funny. I was disappointed by the pool hours (only open till 6pm) and the house cleaning only came once during our 5 day stay so everyday we had to call for towels. Room service was disappointing because they don't bill to the room you have to pay in cash which I have never had to do before and I thought that was odd. For those of us that need internet, its about 12 dollars per day and if you used your debit card when you check in (which I did) they take $150 from it and hold it until you check out but if you use a credit card they will only charge you by the day, which again is something I have not experienced at any other hotel before. Although we booked our flight and hotel together online we still had to pay a $7.50 per day resort fee even if you have no plans on using the pool, fitness room etc but it does get you free access to the tower observation deck which is normally $16 per person. The mall was fun to walk around in although I will say STAY AWAY FROM THE HENNA TATTOO BOOTH, I asked the woman working how much a small tattoo on my wrist would cost and she drew it on me with the henna ink and tried to charge me $60, STAY AWAY FROM THAT PLACE they will try to rip you off! I would suggest if you do stay here, since its so far away from the strip pay for the all day bus pass,the bus is called The Deuce and its $7 per person and is good for 24 hours, the bus stop is right in front of the hotel and it will take you up and down the strip all night (and its air conditioned!) Other than the few things I mentioned the stay was good, it was quiet at night so we were able to get sleep and the beds weren't to uncomfortable, so if your looking for somewhere cheap to stay and off the strip this might be a good place to stay!", "Date": "April 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201croom was clean, but hotel itself was horrible....like inside the very cheap mall\u201d", "Author": "irchar", "ReviewID": "UR103650513", "Content": "stay at the updated room only!!!..... room was simple but clean and nice, we didn't have th ebest view but 24th floor view just can't be bad once you can see mountains :)..... however hotel it self is far from the main strip ride on the bus can be anywhere from 20 to---90min...depending on the trafic and the driver.... very simple dinner th eonly place that open late to eat, it is ok to smoke in the hotel casino, people smoke everywhere but once you step into the lobby it simply stinks...

Neither of us had ever been to Vegas (or even the West Coast!), so we really had no idea what to expect. Before we left, we told all of our friends and family that we were staying at the Stratosphere. Several of them told us the same thing: get a car. Now, I normally do rent cars on vacation, as does my mother. But we decided not to on this trip because everything we wanted to see was all on the strip. And boy, I am SO glad that we didn't rent that car! First off, although the Stratosphere is close to the Downtown line, it's still on the strip (and an alright part, I may add!). We used the bus while we were there, and talk about a good deal! Unlimited trips for around $7 a day, and it ran 24 hours- even during off-season! Another good thing about the bus is that it was all tourists, so I felt safe (even during the midnight rides). The only time I encountered locals on the bus is when I had to go off-strip to go see a doctor, but there still wasn't anything that bad about it. Also, the bus stop is right in front of the hotel (across from a Carl's Jr., which is cool, because we had never seen one before!) But anyways, back to the hotel. The check-in line was a bit long, but it went by fairly quick. Now there was one HUGE problem that happened right after we checked in. When my mother and I took the elevator up to our floor, we walked in the direction where the arrows on the sign were pointing towards our room number. We walked, and walked, and walked. Finally, a young Australian lady told us that the sign arrows were pointing in the wrong direction! Now, this was obviously a printed mistake. But since my mother and I had just experienced a long flight, and we were having to carry our own non-rollable baggage, we took it as more of a sick joke. 2 words, Stratosphere: NOT FUNNY. Anyways, we got to our room, and that was fine. You could tell it had been re-done, as had all of the other rooms in the hotel. And I just want to point out that I did alot of researching online before I booked this hotel, and all of the other strip hotels within the same price range did NOT have remodeled rooms. In fact, they looked rather tasteless, plain, and shabby. *COUGH*excalibur*COUGHCOUGH* Sahara, Circus Circus. But the fact that it was remodeled made the room a good deal all by itself. Now, the tv was flat screen, but it was nowhere near as crisp and clear as my tv's at home (and one of them is 9 years old, and not even flat!) On the other hand, it wasn't THAT bad, and who has time to watch tv when they're in Vegas? And when it came to the bathroom, it was small, but it was okay. Again, who has time to potty when they're in Vegas? Hahaha. But anyways, we didn't take in any shows at the hotel, but we did gamble a little. One good thing about the casino is that they had very cheap minimums on most of their blackjack tables. Also, they had plenty of penny and nickle slots. I didn't consider the casino to be bad in the looks department, but it wasn't really all that spectacular, either. One thing that we did take advantage of was the mall area right above it. It was really cool to be able to wake up at God knows what time and eat a cinnamon pretzel from the Auntie Anne's. But my favorite thing about the mall was the fact that they had a Mcdonald's RIGHT next to a Fat Tuesday's mixed drink booth!! There's nothing better than getting drunk while eating a 4-piece Mcnugget at the same time. Now, the tower was OK. The line wasn't too bad. Be careful, though: they try to scam you into getting your picture taken right before they send you on the elevator. Of course, the view from the top ended up being amazing, both day and night (I suggest you go up there both times). The only thrill ride I took advantage of was that coaster thing that tips off the side of the building, on account of the fact that the wind was blowing too hard for me to ride that awesome round-and-round ride. Also, the one negative thing about the tower (and the hotel in general) is that there is no real nightclub. They did have a bar with a DJ right outside of the viewing area, but it wasn't a nightclub. It was more of a place to get overpriced drinks, and drunkenly dance around. There was like, no space at all for that. Aside from everything previously mentioned, we didn't do much else at the hotel. We partied at Tao at the Venetian and Lavo at the Palazzo. We saw a show at the Monte Carlo. We took in the Miracle Mile Shops, Madame Tussauds, the Forum at Caesars ( a MUST), and of course Margaritaville. Another thing we did was look at a lot of the other casinos and hotels just because we were curious. Oh, and we went downtown. It was an OK place to visit for a bit, but due to the vast amounts of schizophrenic homeless people, filthy casinos, and shadiness in general, I don't think we're going to take it in on our next trip. Fair warning about those Vegas homeless people: most of them really are psychotic. Literally. I think mental illness combined with substance abuse has gotten the best of them. And they ALL ask you for money, not just some of them. And they shake like a leaf. On top of that, some of them were missing eyeballs and limbs. =/ (I'm just warning you, that's all). Anyhow, we did have a good time in Vegas. Would I stay at the Strastosphere again?? If I was on a budget, absolutely. But if I had more cash to throw around for a room?? Probably not. Still, though, it's great for the money, and that cheap bus takes you anywhere in little time. But there's 1 more thing I want to mention, and that's that I did have to deal with the Stratosphere for a bit after I got home on account of the fact that I lost a personal check and a sweatshirt. The guy on the phone was very rude and sarcastic, and you could tell that he absolutely hated his job and his life. So if you do stay there, try to keep track of your stuff so you don't have to talk to this jerk.", "Date": "April 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Guayaquil", "Title": "\u201cOK if on a tight budget.\u201d", "Author": "BERNIE2009", "ReviewID": "UR103480469", "Content": "The Stratosphere at Las Vegas is at the northern part of the Strip but very far from the heart of it.

The only time I heard noises was when the people would free fall from the 108th floor of the tower. There were adequate places to eat around the hotel both outside and in. I did the all day buffet on one day for $29 plus tax and had three very good meals. I especially liked that beverages were included with the buffet, something that is rare in Florida. There are about 20 or so shops in the Tower Shops, including a few eateries such as McDonald's & Krispy Kreme. The pool area was nice, clean and relaxing.

Check-in was fast and the girl at the desk was very nice, smiling all the time. Our room was pretty big, with everything you need, and bed were super comfortable. During our stay, we tried some restaurants in the hotel, which is very handy (Roxy's is quite good, Tower Pizza is ok, Starbucks is ok too), the casino is nice (not crowded, which I liked!) and the Tower is just amazing. Plus, the enter is free anytime you want as a hotel customer. There is a resort fee of 7$ per day, which was fine by me, as every hotel as a resort fee and most of them are a lot higher than 7 dollars. The pool, tower and fitness centers are free with this resort fee, which is great. The first days we didn't have a car, so we walked all the way to the Strip. It is not very far (if you like walking) and it is a safe area, we did it in the morning and at night. There are builings in constructon around the area, so it is not pretty, but it is safe. However, if you do not want to walk, the Deuce bus stops right in front of the hotel, which is great. Also, we took bus 108 from the airport, it stops right there too. The rest of the days we had a car and we parked it in the hotel parking. Parking is free in all hotels. I liked ours because it is easy to get it/out and really close to the hotel (about 1 minute walking!). You can see that some hotel parkings are very far from the hotels, but not this one. Also, it was safe at night. Now, what we didn't like: Our room was clean, however the shower curtains need to be changed... they were mouldy at some places! There were some hairs in the shower and walls, we do not know where did they come from, we do not want to know... we just decided to ignore them... Also, our room was in the left area of the \"world II\" building, which is near to some kind of big engines of the hotel... and they were noisy. They work 24/7! Electricity and sockets didn't work properly... sometimes we got into the room and the alarm clock won't work anymore... Not very nice if you want an alarm! Also about our room, even if we asked for a non-smoking room, ours smelled pretty bad... I understand you can smoke at the casino and some hotel floors, so I guess your non-smoking room can't be 100% clean... However, smell was pretty bad and we had to turn the air conditionned on at night to breathe. 2 or 3 days we came to the room and found the air conditionned on and all the lights on... we just don't know why. For about 3 days, one of the elevators didn't work and wasn't repaired. It is no big deal, but with 24 floors, we waited quite too much to get into an elevator... So, anyway, I liked this hotel, I think it is cheap and fine, people are friendly, all services are good and I really liked its location: not far from the action, well connected to everywhere by bus (downtown, strip, airport), and thanks to its location we didn't get stuck in the Strip traffic. It has all you need for a pleasant stay, and sure, you can find better, but for the price, this hotel is great.", "Date": "March 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Antakya, Turkey", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel boring room\u201d", "Author": "ekalcin", "ReviewID": "UR100996928", "Content": "Maybe boring room would made you spend more time in the casino.

What a horrible experience with this hotel! I dont even know where to start. I booked the Strip View Star Suite at this hotel way back in early Jan 2011. I made sure that it was a strip view and smoking. I was very excited because this room seemed nice and roomy. Fast foward to March 8, 2011. We check in around 5pm. Mayra Childs the front desk 'supervisor\" is helping us. She tells me that they DO NOT have that suite available. I say \"how do you not have it available? I booked this room about 3 months ago and you dont have it?\" She tells me no they dont they are all booked and that they have the Grand Suite for xxx.xx more. I ask her if we can get that suite..she also tells me they dont have it avalable. She tells me i have a choose either the star suite with no strip view, or the romance suite. I asked for the star suite because i never wanted the romance suite. too small. She says ok and tells me i have to put down a $150 security deposit. Im like \"wait, what?...no one ever mentioned this! I had the impression my room was already paid for\" I didnt have enough on my card and neither did my husband so he had to go find a bank to deposit they money. I stood there till he got back and we were helped by some other man. We asked him is the room was at LEAST smoking. Nope. They couldnt even give us that. We asked if the rooms had a refrigerator and microwave because that is what we saw online. He says \"yes there should be\" . About 2 hours after we tried to 'check in\", we get to our 'downgraded suite\" and it was the ROMANCE SUITE! what i specifically said i did not want. I call the front desk and Mayra Childs picks up. I told her \"I thought you gave us the Star Suite. You told me i had to pick the Romance Suite or Star Suite\" She RUDELY tells me \"Well, we dont have the other one available so I made it clear that now we only have the romance suite\". I know what the romance suite and all the other suites look like, she didnt fool me. We look around and we realize there was not microwave. My husbands calls the front desk and asks them. They tell him to call housekeeping. He does and they tell him they do not have microwaves. So I call the 1800 number and ask a live person if their suites have microwaves. They tell me they do. Literally a minute later, the room phone rings. I pick it up and its Mayra Childs. she tells me \"Hi its Mayra Childs from the Front Desk, im calling to let you know that im trying to make you understand that we DO NOT have microwaves!\" Im trying to tell her \"I called the number AND another man from front desk both said theyre would be\" Im not sure if she heard me because she sounded really pissed off and just kept going on about the microwaves. She is still talking and going off how she 'explained to me that they do not have microwaves and she made it clear to me so why do i not understand that\" She was seriously talking to me like i was a child! \"You keep calling the front desk and asking all these questions about things we do not have avaible! im just trying to make you feel satisfied!\" That was seriously the last straw. I let her know what i was ABSOLUTELY NOT HAPPY that I pay for a suite that wasnt available, i got downgraded and still had to pay the same. I couldnt even get a smoking room. Different people tell us different things. Took us over 4 hours to get everything settled. I told her some other things and asked her to leave us alone and stop calling us. I hung up the phone. Our first night there was horrible. The only good thing about the Stratosphere was that we had unlimited trips to the top of the tower. amazing view. Took like 30 mins to get up there since one elevator was available and there was a long line. We only got to go to the inside observation deck because the outside was \"closed\". Level 107 bar isnt all that great. We had to stay in a certain \"area' of the bar. what the hell? Seriously, I have never had such a HORRIBLE experience! Circus Circus and Sahara have 1000 times better customer service! NEVER AGAIN WILL I STEP FOOT IN THIS HORRENDOUS PLACE! Watch out for Mayra Childs.

If you\u2019re expecting fancy landscaping, marble floors, and fountains, this is not the hotel for you. If you are deathly afraid of heights, look elsewhere. But if you want a comfortable room at a reasonable price, a laid-back atmosphere, and incomparable views of the Strip, and if you are a crazy adrenaline junky like myself who lives to dangle off an 1100 foot tower at the mercy of a machine, then the Strat is for you. Our room, though perfectly adequate for our needs as we didn\u2019t spend much time in it, was nothing spectacular. Besides some dust around the AC vent and behind the night stand, our room was reasonably clean. It had a pleasant odor and was free of any smoke smell, as it should be. Our room was cleaned and the towels were changed daily. The furniture was on the newer side, and the beds were extremely comfortable yet firm. The linens were of a good quality and free of stains. (I could have lived without the throw pillows. The beds look inviting enough without them. If anyone in management is reading this, PLEASE get rid of them!) We had a new, flat-screen TV, although the remote was a bit temperamental. The window had some strange scratches on it that were beyond explanation. Maybe some previous guest brought a suicidal cat with them?? The bathroom was TINY; the tub was oversized and took up about 2/3 of it. It had very high sides, which helped keep the bathroom dry, just watch your step getting in and out! The toilet paper would only flush if you placed it directly in the center of the bowl (everything else did). This was the most annoying thing about the room, but on the day we were leaving I noticed a plumber on our floor, so hopefully this issue is being resolved. The Strat\u2019s pool area is very clean and inviting, has plenty of loungers, and because it\u2019s on the 8th floor offers great views of the Strip and the tower itself; you can see all the action going on at the top, as well as the Sky Jump victims falling. When I was there it wasn\u2019t crowded, and had just opened for the season (it was barely warm enough for the water to look appealing). I imagine it can get super-crazy in the summer! The casino floor is nothing fancy, but is a good size and pleasant. The slots were loose enough to keep me interested, and I had no trouble finding a cocktail waitress most nights, even at the lower limit slots. The shopping here isn\u2019t great, but it\u2019s on the inexpensive side, and the souvenirs are good quality (no knockoffs) and reasonably priced. There are plenty of dining options, most of them inexpensive as well. The buffet is quite decent, but if you go for brunch, avoid the pre-made egg dishes and head for the omelet station, you\u2019ll be glad you did. I also highly recommend Roxy\u2019s. Top of the World is the priciest option, but the food is superb and it\u2019s a once in a lifetime experience (lunch is far more reasonable than dinner). The one big drawback to the Strat that is brought up time and time again is its location, that it is too far from all the action, and that the north end of the Strip is a sketchy place. It\u2019s true that the north end is not having a great time right now, but there\u2019s no reason to go exploring it, and the area immediately outside the Strat\u2019s front entrance is perfectly fine; the security guards are never far away in any case. I honestly did not find the location to be a problem; it is fairly quiet and the Strat tends to draw a laid-back crowd, which is a good thing, as center Strip is anything but. Also, ignore any horror stories you\u2019ve heard about the Deuce; there\u2019s a stop literally right outside the door. It\u2019s clean, cheap ($7/ day, make sure you have exact change), runs frequently 24 hours a day and stops at every major casino/attraction on the Strip (even if you were staying in a more central location you would want to use it to go exploring places more than a 15-20 minute walk away, am I right?). The longest I ever had to wait for it was 15 minutes, and usually I didn\u2019t have to wait more than 5. Finding a seat wasn\u2019t a problem 90% of the time, and within 10-15 minutes tops we were in the middle of all the action. A couple of times there were a few \u201ccharacters\u201d on board, but the drivers/security guards dealt with them no problem. The Strat compensates for its location by its value and the fact that it has the most unique attraction of any casino in Vegas: the Tower. Guests get unlimited free access to the observation decks (it\u2019s $10 each time if you\u2019re not staying here) and I took advantage of this. I went up just about every day/night, and never had to wait more than 15 minutes. The view of the Strip from the top is breathtaking (another advantage of its location). The tower was never crowded, and I felt free to just chill there for as long as I wanted. The Air Bar on the 108th floor has a great lounge and serves up tasty cocktails, but I never felt obligated to order them when I didn\u2019t want them. The rides obviously are a must. Guests also receive 2 for 1 unlimited one day ride passes, and if you can do Xscream and Insanity, no other ride anywhere else on Earth will phase you, as this is not your typical amusement park. Overall the property is maintained pretty well, which tells me that it\u2019s doing good financially and will be around for some time to come, and though it\u2019s not the fanciest, most glamorous place on the Strip it is far from the worst (I knew I\u2019d made a good decision in booking the Strat when I saw some of the other properties, namely Excalibur and Circus Circus). The interactions I had with the employees were always positive; from the bartenders to the elevator operators to the waiters at Roxy\u2019s, everyone was friendly and wanted to make sure the guests were having a good time, and that\u2019s one reason why I would want to return. So would I stay here again? Probably, especially if some of the minor issues mentioned above are rectified (unless I find a killer deal at Caesar\u2019s Palace, which I doubt.)

OK, first the good: Reasonably priced for a hotel on the strip, and you can go to the top of the tower as many times as you want during your stay. Now, here are the varying degrees of what isn't so great: In the room, the sink isn't inside the bathroom. So if someone needs to use the restroom during the night, they will have to turn on the faucet outside of the bathroom to wash their hands (presuming hygiene is part of their lifestyle), probably waking up their sleeping partner. There is only one casual restaurant in the entire hotel, Roxys Diner, unless you want to go to the top of the tower to eat pizza. Roxys is fairly priced for dinner, but if you want to eat breakfast there, expect to pay $6.99 for two pancakes (with absolutely nothing else included) and $3.00 for a cup of coffee. I would be lying though if I didn't say that the Extreme Grilled Cheese sandwich, which comes with fries, was what brought me back to the hotel for the second time. It's that good, and only $8.99, for the biggest grilled sandwich you will ever have eaten. The staff is very customer service oriented. Back to the not so good: the hotel is located at the far North end of the strip, pretty far from the action. Wi-fi is an extra $15 a day. That's just a plain ripoff. Did I mention that there is a dearth of places to eat in the hotel?

I'd recommend the hotel, newly refurbished rooms, an average casion (although i'm not an expert) and free reign of the tower as we were paying guests. If you can't afford the helicopted flight over the strip this is a good alternative. In hindsight we may have chosen a more central location but for the price it wasn't bad! don't forget a trip to the Diner with singing and dancing by the waitresses - a nice novel idea although other than that and the expensive top of the world restaurant there's not a huge amount here and you cerrtainly wouldn't want to start walking around this end of the stip by yourself at a night....

I'm starting off with the negatives and will finish with the positives. Negatives Bring extra toilet paper, because you have to ration what you get. There is no extra provided in the room. I had to ask for a refill. There was no Kleenex in my room either upon my arrival (which with two kids having a cold might explain why we had to use more tp). C'mon, even the cheapest of hotels provide an extra roll in the room. Ridiculous $7.50 per night resort fee, for a hotel that is definitely NOT a resort. They claim the resort fee covers the fitness center, swimming pool, 2 for 1 show tickets and the observation deck. Hmm, both pools are outside and when I asked if they were heated, the guy responded with \"Well, sometimes,\" and then laughed it off. Needless to say it was too cold for us to use. Fitness centers are part of the hotel everywhere else and don't cost extra. No one wants to see the lame show, which is why the ticket price is so low. So, we basically paid $22.50 to go up to the tower once for 5 minutes. Soooo not worth it. Want to use the internet? $11.95 a day. My daughter got sick while I was there and we had to go to urgent care. They provided her with some antibiotics, which needed to be refrigerated. So, I called and asked about a fridge, another $10 a night fee. Want a smoke free room? Well, you'll get a smoke free room but you have to walk through smoke filled halls to get there. In their newly refinished area one would think that it wouldn't be too difficult to keep the smoking and non-smoking floors separate. All the reviews of the restaurants were horrible so the only thing we tried was McDonalds. DON'T use their spa facility, unless you like filthy floors and paying way to much for what you get. $100 for a full set of nails. $50 or $60 for a manicure. Again, ridiculous for what the quality and type of service you receive. The surrounding area is not the greatest. You are at the tail end of the strip and surrounded by very old and worn down buidlings and lame wedding chapel motels. Positives: It was cheap, but you get what you pay for. The security was awesome and we felt very safe in the parking structure. The parking structure is also easy to get in an out of. It is a few blocks walking distance from the monorail, which is convenient. We stayed in the newly refinished section. It was modern and basic and the bath was oversized, which was a bonus. The bed was also really comfortable. The furniture is cheap though and they didn't even provide a stand to put your suitcase on. C'mon guys, we are talking the basics here!!! The rooms were clean. Overall, I was really disappointed. Granted, we didn't pay much for the room, but I just felt that we would be charged for every last thing.

Worst off, our towels weren't replaced and neither were the linens. That's a big no no. I guess the only thing that was nice was view from the top of the Tower.

Our non-smoking room was clean and did not smell of smoke (unlike everywhere else in the entire city). The remodel/refreshing of the room was good and everything was acceptable. We really appreciated being able to go up into the Stratosphere Tower at our leisure, which we did on 3 occasions - for rides, for dinner, and for happy hour at the Level 107 Lounge and Air Bar. We also used our tickets for the 2-for-1 rides. One of the best things (if not THE best) of the tower is there is NO SMOKING in the tower in the restaurant, bar, lounge, or observation deck, except for one small designated area on the EXTERIOR viewing deck, which we VERY MUCH appreciated. After being surrounded by smoke everywhere we went, it was GREAT to be able to relax in the tower and enjoy ourselves without breathing other people's smoke. A BIG KUDOS to the management for keeping it such. It is very difficult to get away from smoke inside any building in Las Vegas. We walked to and from the Hotel, except for the last day, for which we rented a car at the 2nd floor area (R Level - kind of hard to get to, but worth the visit) and we returned our car to the airport, which was pretty handy. Other than being a slightly long walk from the other areas of the strip, it was no big deal. We could have taken a taxi. My only note of irritation was the \"greeter\" when we entered the hotel from the bus shuttle was not anyone associated with the hotel - they were pushy time-share presenters for Diamond Resorts (Polo Towers in Las Vegas). Pretty annoying to have them be my first person I am greeted by in the hotel/casino. Wasted plenty of time with them, but my fault for not blowing through them instead of being polite. By the way, after being suckered in for the presentation with their \"gifts\" (some of which were Stratosphere Tower tickets - worthless since we got to go up the tower anyway), their presentation was terrible and I thought the Polo Towers sucked, too.

The cheapest location on the strip was the Stratosphere, which I had visisted many years ago when it was relatively new. After having been there two days, these are my impressions. The room is relatively large,very clean, with a comfortable bed, There is a large Flat screen TV. The only drawback is that the TV only gets about 20 channels. Two in Spanish, a Chicago station ?,,PBS, couple local channels and that's it. Not much to watch when you're trying to sleep off the worst hangover in about seven years.There is no cofee maker/microwave/fridge which is an irritation. At least, they could have a coffee maker! I understand they're trying to make money in these poor times but this is ridiculous. Another minor irritant is the Internet service. The Hotel wants $12/day for all day Internet service. Best thing to do is go to the Starbucks that's located behind Carl's Jr. (you have to walk a few blocks) and use their free Wifi and put your $12 to good use. As far as the hotel restaurants, the buffet is decent with a good selection, they have a Macdonalds/Starbucks on the premises, and several nice looking places which I haven't tried yet. The Starbucks on the hotel premise is expensive and has unfriendly help. Best go to the Other Starbucks, if you can help it. On the outside,within walking distance of the Strat, there is a Chinese Thai greasy spoon called Ochas [?] which serves up cheap good filling food. There is also a Mcdonalds/Star bucks/Dennys/IHOP near by.

If you want to be away from all the noise and closer to the... less friendly looking part of town then sure, go for it. I'm not saying that this is a terrible hotel, it's just the location. I think it's at least half a mile from The Bellagio and all the other main hotels, which is a shame really, but I suppose this is why it's such good value. The hotel was spotless. Despite being a little out of date and in need of maybe a little refurbishment, the rooms we stayed in were clean and quite spacious. We were at the back of the hotel so our room was facing the freeway (which is miles away so don't worry about that) and had stunning views of mountains in what must have been the Mojave(?) Either way, the view was very nice. The beds were comfy, the bathroom was clean and I think the maids came every other day. The breakfast buffet was quite nice and the fresh omelettes were always a great way to start the morning. There are quite a few different restaurants dotted around the ground floor and they are all good quality with reasonable prices and even the fussy eaters among us were able to find something they enjoyed. I didn't bother with room service because it seemed a bit pricey but it was there! Going to the top of the tower is a must! We didn't go on the roller-coaster as the terrified faces of many put us off, ever so slightly. But, if you're into being hung 1000ft above the ground then you'll enjoy it. Either way, there is plenty to do up there and I'm sure the whole family will find something they enjoy. So, in my opinion, The Stratosphere is a nice hotel with features that other hotels do not have. It's great if you're on a bit of a budget and don't mind a walk or a taxi to the heart of The Strip.

I arrived at the hotel at around 7:00 pm and the lady at the check in said that I would not be able to get any rooms. I would have to upgrade or take smoking rooms. I explained to her that I was allergic to smoke so I could not take smoking rooms and that we were all college students with a tight budget so we could not afford an upgrade. I said that we could wait and asked her how many hours it would take for the rooms to be ready. She refused saying it could take a very very long time and she would not be able to even get us any rooms at all then. She refused to call housekeeping and find out how soon they could get some rooms ready. I then asked her to give us one smoking room and we would put our bags in there and told her we would wait for the other non smoking room since I am allergic to smoke. There were just 4 of us anyways and she could easily have arranged that. She againg refused. We also could not afford an upgrade. She refused and said it was hotel policy and that I could check on my itinerary where it would be stated that the room bookings are just requests and the hotel reserves the right to ask to upgrade. Nothing like that was written on the itinerary. She said that she would be able to do nothing for us at all and I was forced to pay for an upgrade. The towels in the rooms also smelled of cigarette smoke. Due to my smoke allergy, I had to go and buy a towel from outside. I am extremely upset that my stay in Las Vegas was spoiled on the first day itself and I was forced to pay more just because the hotel could not give us our rooms. It was 7:00 in the evening when we checked in and I would think their rooms should be ready considering that I never saw any housekeepers on my floor after 4:00 - 5:00 p.m. My family owns a motel in Texas and I do know a lot about hotel business so I do know when I am being made a fool of.

We were \"upgraded\" to the new tower. If that tower was new, I would hate to see what the \"old\" tower looks like! The rugs & throw pillows had many stains, the handles of the dresser drawers were loose and spun around every time you tried to open a drawer, the shower head had green mildew all over it, and the rubber baseboard around the bathroom was warped and falling off. Thankfully we checked both keys before heading off to the conference, since my husband's didn't work. That took another 30 minutes in line to fix. When it deactivated again the next day, we just didn't bother fixing it. Upon arriving at our room, we found tons of little scrap pieces of paper/tissue all over the rug. I have no idea when they last vacuumed. In addition, they didn't even come to clean our room one day and another we had to call for service. On the last day, when we were checking out and didn't need to be anywhere, they decided to start banging on our door at 9am & drilling something in the room next door. The icing on the cake was the final night when we decided to get our free admission to the tower. We ordered a drink at their super cheesy bar (half the crowd is in sweatshirts and the other half is dressed like hookers).

I actually did stay there a few days later -- again a stop over as I had an early flight out. This was after Christmas and so the hotel was sold out. I ended up in a room that had a door to an adjoining room -- so when a large family took that room I could hear EVERYTHING. I complained to the hotel and they explained that they were sold out and could not move me. A polite chat with the friendly family made for good relations. The lesson in all of this is that when you get cheap rates on rooms, it's \"caveat emptor.\" Check the room out thoruoghly when you get it and if necessary, make a request to change.

The room was spotless, large (I had to get a room with two beds, both of which were big, clean, and well made), had a big screen TV, and a seperate clean bathroom. I've seen some of the other cheaper hotels in Vegas (like Circus Circus) but this one definitely is a step ahead. The walls are somewhat thin, but thankfully the night I was there my neighbors were all quiet. The front desk is located in the casino, so you have to walk through the casino just to check in and out. The night I was there the casino was suprisingly active. They had quite a few roulette tables, two of which were packed, and they have a seperate poker room in addition to a few other poker tables scattered in the casino. There's a retail area above the casino that has a lot of different stores and a few restaurants (McDonalds, Krispy Kreme, Ruby's, and a Mexican place). Nothing high class, but I don't think anyone would expect that considering the price you pay to stay here. There was also a theater that had shows (adult oriented after 11:30 PM), a free fall attraction (108 story drop), and a rotating restaurant that is supposedly pretty good. You can call for room service (which comes from the Ruby's restaurant) but they take cash only. I asked them if they could charge it to my room, but since I reserved my room online my credit card was closed and would have required a $50 deposit (refundable, I assume?) to re-open.

Now, having just returned from a 6-day break, this hotel certainly deserves praise for the well thought-out refurb work undertaken. Having read some of the reviews before I set out, I was slightly wary beforehand - but from check in until departure, I found all the staff to be welcoming and friendly. My newly refurbished Premier room on the 21st floor was very pleasing; this fresh and tastefully decorated accom was maintained by the housekeeping staff who did a great job daily. The buffet (with 25% discount for room guests) was true value! Although located at the end of the Strip, the frequent buses stopping directly outside (with a ticket machine to purchase a 24hr valid ride ticket for $7) negated the need to jump in a taxi. Also conveniently, the Downtown bus stop was located directly opposite.

The consistently high level of service we got from the staff was really appreciated and not expected at the price which we paid. I think in all areas this hotel exceeded expectations and I would be happy to stay here again. Location: Yes, it is not very close to other strip hotels. Not a big deal, we cab it almost everywhere we go in Vegas anyway so instead of a $10 cab ride it is $15. And if you are cheap the bus does run down here. Rooms: Had a room on the 23rd floor of the World I tower. Good view of the strip but the window was dirty. Views don't matter too much here though, just go up in the tower which surpasses anything from the rooms by far. A little larger and nicer than my friends room in World II tower (16th floor, no strip view). Clean, comfortable. Very quiet as well - could hear the jumpers scream on their way down from the tower but was not a concern when I tried to sleep. As far as I can tell the different towers are really just different names for elevator banks as they seemed to be all connected as one building? Casino: Clean and very little smoke. Staff here again was good. Similar to any other strip casino of this caliber. There is party pit way in the back of the casino...seems like it is in the back so there is less chance it will offend the mid western sensibilities of their average guest? Guests were of all types - less of the typically annoying bachelor / bachelorette parties but still a few younger singles around. Restaurants/Shopping - Nothing spectacular here that I tried, but we did not eat at Top of the World. We did eat at Fellini's which was ok for the price. Tower: The tower is worth a visit. Especially at night or during sunset. Maybe not the best view of the strip but very good. And included if you are a guest at the hotel. Not a guest? I would see if you can find a guest to take you up - each guest gets 4 swipes of their room key (per day I think). The tower is not cheap if you are not a guest, $15 I think. Service: This is really what sets this hotel apart. For this price, I expect a clean basic room with very minimal service. However, from check in to check out I thought the staff was amazing.

The only downside was that there was a lot of work going on in the casino and that we weren't there to see the finished job but it means we will need to take another trip back to see what it looks like. The renovation work had no impact on our holiday and you couldn't hear a thing from the room, which is a plus.

When we arrived we checked in after about a 20 minute wait, the check in staff were polite and helpfull, and we paid to upgrade to one of the select rooms, i know not everyone has to pay to get this though. The room was on the 22nd floor, great view! It was tidy, clean and had everything we needed, except a fridge, but ice machines are just down the corridor. The safe was easy to use. The shops and amusements in the hotel are good fun, but pricey when it comes to buying snacks and bottles of coke etc, i reccommend using the little gas station just past the IHOP outside the hotel, it was $3 for 2 2litre bottles of sprite, whereas its almost $3 for a little bottle on its own in the hotel, the starbucks there has an inflated price also, obviously on account of how handy it is etc. We were both first timers to Vegas, and found the gambling abit daunting, yet the casino table workers were really nice, explained rules to you, and were really friendly, and the girls supplying free drink if your gambling couldnt be any nicer! It was good fun in the hotel, relaxed and really just abotu enjoying yourself, and of course the view from the top is spectacular, there is even little sofas for you to sit around in and just take it all in! The Stratosphere is a fair walk from the strip, but not an impossibility we did it a couple of times, in doing so you can get to see what nearby you, and rest of times we used the deauce bus, it was so convienient just to hop on and hop off with a $7 ticket whcih covers you for 24 hrs. The bus stop to go to the outlet mall is at Denny's which it a 4 min walk out the back of the casino, and i HIGHLY reccommend shopping here, the bargains are unbelieveable, we actually did it over 2 days as there was so many shops and choice, and the italian in the food court is awesome! I personally wouldnt reccommend Roxy's diner, my food was cold and to be honest not the best, i felt nauseaous after eating there, portions are HUGE! But as with the rest of the hotel, staff couldnt be nicer, they really do pretty much anything to keep you happy!Theres nothin a tip wont get you! It was a dissappointment the pool was closed as it was hot first few days there, but the weather soon changed! windy and cold! Overall the hotel is comfortable and has everything you require on your doorstep, even if its a little bit more expensive than venturing further a field for it, but i cannot complain about our stay, we were made very welcome, comfortable, and request was met with a smile, and if i was to return to Vegas i would have no qualms what so ever about staying here.... i would rather pay $7 to get around than pay over $100+ per night in a hotel further down the strip which i believe would provide an equal service! The area isnt too bad at all either, i was worried from reading reviews here, but its all common sence really, who would wander round an unfamilliar neighbourhood at night?! We actually went 3 miles north into the \"Old Town\" and visited a wallmart and various little shops along the way, it gave us a view of what its like to live in Nevada as aposed to the Vegas Strip!

We are normal people, not rich not poor but the not the kind of people who like disigner clothes we are the average joe couple and i have to say Vagas as a whole was dissapointing the best thing about it was coming back to the Stratosphere each night. The shops in every Hotel/Casino were all the same Prada, D&G disigners coming out your our ears and many had 3 of the exact same one in the same place!! rediculas. The Strat was the only one with real affordable shops, my husband bought a Lakers Coat for $79.99 + tax the same coat was $140 +tax every where els. The food in the start was amazing. we stayed 7 nights and we ate breakfast and dinner their 5 times. in the buffett what a choice!! we were amazed. The room was cleaned each day and fresh towels given. Gambling wise we stuck to the strat and to the machines we didn't win anything but we didn't lose either so it was all fun. The only bad things about the hotel were that their was some work going on, small areas at a time but you havd to find other ways to get around with no diverted walk way signs when we were in a hurry to catch our flight carting our suit cases behind us and trying to get to the check out desk it was not easy. Also the alarm clock did not work which is the reason we nearly missed our flight, the laundry service is well over priced. 5 pairs of knickers, 5 pairs of socks, 1 pair of leggings and a shirt, 1 pair of jeans and 2 t shirts cost us $50 (thats including the tip) The other thing was the fire alarm going off at 7.30am the morning after we arrived. but other than that it was great. Advice for people staying here, the best way to get around is the duece bus, it's very cheap $7 for 24 hours and stops at all the hotels. Also for decent priced clothes shops try Ross's (it's on the strip not far from the strat) and also Primm Valley. The shows are over priced in vegas, the best value one was deffinately American Superstars, as a guest of the strat you get 2 for 1 tickets and it was quite good. the others we went to see we paid a lot for and shows in Vegas are rushed and over in an hour! I have to say having seen both the vegas Motown Revoe and the Blackpool one and the Vegas legends and The Blackpool one Blackpool wins both hands down i'm affraid..and no1 is more shocked than me!! I went for the shows after all!! Finaly the Tower, we never had a meal up their but wish we had, the view from the deck is amazing, unfortunately it was too cold and windy to go on the rides but they looked great! I deffinately recommend that if you are not a snob and you visit Vegas stay at The Stratosphere, it's the best hotel for normal down to earth people. the staff are so friendly, it's clean and the food is good. Vegas was an experiance, we probably wont visit again as once you have seen it, youve seen it, the buildings are great i got my pictures but once inside them they are all the same.

The AC would kick on about every 15 mins and only stay on for a minute or so and definetly not enough to cool the room down. Secondly, the walls here are paper thin.

We were in town for a conference and also for fun. We booked one of the newly remodeled rooms. The room was very nice and we had a view of the tower, so we got to see people doing the \"free fall\" from the top. Very cool. My only problem with the room was that they didn't have any kleenexes and left only 1 bar of soap. I prefer to have one for the sink and one for the tub. They also replaced them every day, which I don't think is necessary. I only noticed noise being a bit of an issue in the morning, but it was always after I got up. The parking garage was very close to the tower we stayed in, which was great. The area surrounding the hotel is not so great, but we had a car, so we drove everywhere. All of the staff we encountered were very pleasant. We ate at Roxy's one night and found the food to be good and not terribly expensive. Yes, it was a bummer that the pool was closed. HOWEVER, it is an OUTDOOR seasonal pool, not indoors. I don't know where one of the previous reviewers got the idea that it was indoors. They had planned on having it open, but then started remodeling the 8th floor and that is where the pool is located. We prefer to stay at the center of the strip, but would stay here again. Also, I don't know why people get so up in arms about not be able to get rooms together. It is not an instance specific to this hotel. Every hotel will tell you they cannot guarantee rooms next to each other because they don't know if someone is going to extend their stay, or what. They can only offer it to you if it is available in the room type you booked on the day you arrive. They cannot save it over several days. The only way I've found to guarantee rooms next to each other is if the hotel offers some kind of family suite, which is basically 2 rooms that are connecting. Not many hotels offer that though. Make sure to check out the lounge on the top of the tower. Awesome views of Vegas and live music on some nights. Tower admission is free if you are a hotel guest, but we skipped that and just went to the lounge. This is a clean, basic, inexpensive hotel. If that is what you are looking for, your good.

The bus stops just across the road from the Stratosphere. My only complaint - (and maybe this is a Vegas or even USA wide thing), is the amount of cigarette smoking in INDOOR public areas. I was really taken aback that in this day and age, the USA has not caught up with the rest of us and outlawed smoking in public places ESPECIALLY inside. We had a room on a non-smoking floor, but people smoked IN the elevators, in the lobby, on the casino floor - EVERYWHERE.

We arrived early at 7 am. We tried to check in and was told that there were no rooms available. This was Friday early morning. So that meant they were fully booked on a Thursday? Anyways, they said to try back at 9. We ate thier breakfast buffet, which was ok, nothing special. Finally, at 9 we went back to check in and they said that they didn't have anything, and that housekeeping doesn't come in till 10:00. WHAT?! Why didn't they tell me that to begin with?! So I asked if I could pay for an upgrade, with 2 little kids needing to get settled in, they said no, that if they gave us a room (at 9:00am) they would have to charge us yesterdays rate. So this told me that they DID have a room, but they didn't want to give it to me unless I paid a whole night's rate for it. Seriously? Where's the customer service. So I was *reminded* that check in is actually at 3:00 pm. When we finally checked in, no apologies, no free breakfast coupons, no complimentary upgrade for making us wait, nothing. Out of all the hotels in Vegas, you would think that they would want you to return to them, but I guess they don't care, so my advice is... if you want a cheap place to stay and don't mind walking a whole lot or poor customer service, then stay here. If you are looking for a hotel that actually cares what you think should you have an issue, that is actually on the strip and closer to everything, then try Mandalay Bay or Bellagio, those are my personal recommendations because i've been upgraded with out there being any problem that they had to make up for. I would have stayed there, but we had to stay at the stratosphere for a wedding, not by choice. I do have to say that the girl in the elevator in the tower was very nice. She asked if we were staying with them, and I rolled my eyes and said a very unenthusiastic yes.... she told me that this was strange because they are trained to give the best customer service, all they preach about is customer service. But that isn't what we experienced. Oh and the lobby is in the middle somewhere, again, lots of walking. It isn't conveniently located at any of the entrances.

We have stayed at other hotels along the strip and had visited Stratosphere for the American Superstars show but would not have selected this property had it not been for the convenience to our event. When we arrived, the bell desk was very friendly and greeted us, checked our bags and told us it would not be a problem to check into our rooms early. We had reserved three rooms and requested adjoining/adjacent rooms. However, the front desk clerk told us check in was at 3 but she wasn't sure when our rooms would be ready. She wouldn't allow us to go any further in the check-in process even though it was after 2 pm. We thought this odd but resolved to take a cab to tour the strip and come back later in the afternoon. Another friend arrived and a different clerk helped him and gave him keys and immediate access to his room. Although we had a special request since we had requested three rooms in close proximity, we thought it odd we couldn't even register and pick up our keys later. At this point, we inquired with the desk clerk who helped our friend and we were able to check in immediately and he agreed to call us on our cell when the rooms were ready to check in and told us to pick up our keys at that time.. Needless to say, we were not pleased with the first desk clerk but very happy to have at least been able to check in. This did however give us a cautious feeling about this property. Once we were given keys (and were notified by the second clerk via cell phone), we were pleasantly surprised at the rooms. The tower we stayed in was recently renovated and our rooms were quite spacious. We had asked for a king sized bed but this orientation was not available in the selection of rooms we were given. If we had wanted to separate from our family we probably would have been accommodated but it was more important for us to be close to family. All of our rooms had two double beds. We were close to the elevator yet there was little noise in the halls. The rooms seemed to be well insulated and we had a peaceful night's sleep each evening. The decor in the rooms was average, but freshly painted and carpeted. The counter in our bath was not granite but still clean and nice. Some perks that are nice - to two for one access to the shows, free access to the observation tower with room key, discounts on buffet with sign up to player's club. Roxy's Diner features singing wait staff which is a nice surprise. Food is just ok. Buffet is decent. Good food and nice variety. We didn't have time to try the other eateries but there were also some quick food options in the food court. Would recommend this property for those who are not looking for elegance or extravagance. It is a good choice and great for the price. We paid approx. $30 per night and the value can't be beat. One negative - no free wireless. Internet is charged on average $10/day. One other negative would be the location. We were warned by our cab driver to not venture out the back door, or even the front due to the neighborhood. This frightened us at first but once we settled in there were no problems in the interior of the property and you wouldn't necessarily want to venture out back because it only consists of a garage which they said was safe and beyond was empty lots and a declining neighborhood. We did venture out the front door since that was where our event was held and we did not encounter any problems. All in all, a good choice for those on a budget and who isn't these days?

Said that it was cheap and cheerful and it was. Recently renovated so it is very comfortable. The rooms are clean, clean sheets everyday, however the cleaners do not make the bed if anything on the bed, ie PJ's. They also do not clean up any litter if it is not in the bin. The casino is very cheesy - but they are in all the casino's, even the Bellagio! Also you can smoke in the casinos so they often smell of smoke and for a non smoker from the UK where it is banned it can be quite a shock and off putting. The casinos are also very big and can be difficult to find the other attractions. The hotel has a lot of eateries, such as a buffet, Roxy's diner, McDonalds, an Italian, pizza stand and Mexican stand. Caution, the food portions are huge in all of the places, and the rest of Vegas. The breakfast buffet also served lunch at the same time so dont be suprised to see people with pot roast next to their omlette. A great selection - but no cereal and fruit selection very limited to only melon. Fruit and veg very hard to come by anywhere in Vegas. The shop is a little over priced, but still cheaper than the rest of the shops in Vegas so buy your novelty gift in the Strat rather than any of the hotels on the strip. The pool is a good size and the jacuzzi is great as the pool can be quite cool. It is great watching the skyjump from the poolside. The pool snacks are of good value (ave $8)and normal American food...massive nachos, massive burger and chips, massive ceasar wraps...a good idea to share. A great choice of frozen cocktails. ($9) When checking in, ask for a room above the 8th floor or you will be looking onto the roof and generators, which can give off a little noise and looks grim. The hotel has a few bars where there is happy hour, $20 all you can drink at certain hours, other than that alcohol is expensive, that is said for most places. The bars up the tower are great for views and a better atmosphere, again having happy hours. There are a number of rides at the top of the tower, not quite Alton towers but still exciting with the great views. The towe has unlimited access for hotel guests, views much better at night as you can see the whole Las Vegas Valley! The TV is not the best if you like to have it on whilst getting ready, with TV ads on every 2 mins. Quite a lot of channels in chinese or spanish. There is an option to pay for the latest films in the cinema and adult movies. Location wise it is ok, at the top of the strip, you can walk to Circus Circus in about 15 mins and 5 mins onto the Wynn. We walked to the bottom of the strip in about 2 hours making all the stops to watch the TI pirate show and Bellagio Fountains which are spectacular and a must see. Taxi's are reasonable, ave $15 to anywhere on the strip and ask to go the quickest way down the highway rather than the strip as it is always bust and a lot of traffic. Or the bus is $7 return, but can take a while as it makes a lot of stops and is packed.

Check in was slow, but when we finally arrived at our 20th floor room, we found it dirty, with bits of trash on the floor under the table and an egg-shaped container of M&M\u2019s leftover from Easter behind the nightstand. The room was unimpressive despite having been remodeled within the last 7 months. There was no coffee maker, no microwave, nor mini-fridge. Calling the front desk to request another room, we were informed that a mini fridge was available for $15.00 a night. I could almost buy one for the price I would have paid for the six nights of our stay. The next room, on the 21st floor, was as lackluster as the first.

I was pissed at this - not because it's a $2 twinkie that can be replaced - but the fact that it wasn't even theirs to take! There was also a dirty rag on the tap in the shower. At that point I had it! I went to the desk, and after explaining my story, they offered to refund the one night upgrade fee. I guess it was an expensive twinkie, but what didn't make me feel any btter is that they said - \"we've heard weird stories in the past about our maids\" We primarily got the room for the safe, and boy after seeing that - we're SO GLAD we did. We also purchased locks before leaving for our luggage. We didn't use them for the flight cuz TSA would've broken them off, but we used them every day in the hotel room.

As our daughter was rolling we chose to upgrade to a newly renovated room, thinking the carpets would be cleaner. It was well worth the extra $15 a night. The room was beautiful! We asked for a high room and ended up on the top floor (24) with a view of downtown (Freemont Street). The king sized bed was great and we slept well. Some Vegas hotels can be noisy at night. We liked that there was McDonalds and Starbucks in the hotel as it made for a nice and easy breakfast. We enjoyed the pool, no complaints there! We took our daughter to her first buffet while at the Stratosphere and quite enjoyed it. Kids under 5 are free at the buffet so that's nice. The food was decent and there was a good selection. One neat thing we found is you can watch people jumping off the tower on your hotel room TV. I think it was channel 31. While baby slept one evening my husband and I spent some time watching people leap off the tower. The one thing we didn't like is that although the tower ride was free we had to wait in a long line with everyone else. The baby was tired and fussy so we didn't end up going. Too bad. Although we didn't eat at the tower restaurant this trip, we did 3 years ago and quite liked it. A reservation at the restaurant gets you up the tower for free and you don't have to stand in line. If you're thinking of paying to go up the tower I'd use that money towards a meal instead and then get up the tower for 'free'.

We arrived to the hotel after 10pm and had to wait almost 25 minutes to check in since their was only 2 people at the front desk.

We found black gross stuff in all the air vents and jets in the tub. I alerted the front desk who seemed to care less. The next day I left the service please on the door with a note asking them to thoroughly clean the tub. However when we arrived back to our room at 7pm that night it still had not been cleaned! We left and came back to the room after seeing the hotels show Bite (which is not worth the $49.95) to find that our room still had not been cleaned. So I called the front desk again and they offered to send someone up to clean it right away, but at this point it was 1:30 am and I was ready for bed. The next day they did clean the room but neglected to even touch the tub. So I basically upgraded the room for nothing since I couldn't even use the jacuzzi tub.

Originally from Brooklyn, NY, I know good Italian food. A bit skeptical I ate at Fellini's Restaurannt...the Seafood dish was great!. Like a Zuppa de Pesce. The nickel video poker is a joy next to the Seccurity Desk. This was the second time I hit for a Royal Flush for $200 {4,000 nickels!}. Cocktail service is good and the beers are ice cold! Just give the beautiful cocktails waitresses a $1 tip, and they keep coming back every 5 or 6 minutes!. The pool...aahh my favorite...why? NO SHADE! I hate shade. From 10AM until 6:30PM pure sun and the pool is super clean and the water is crisp (not ice cold!). The Pool at the Stratosphere is better than The Flamingo!! I stayed at The Flamingo. Their pool is too winding...like for kids....too many palm treess....too much shade and the lounge chairs are right next to each other....yuk!

And I play the nickel and quarter video poker machines. Maybe gambled (and lost) $1,100 for 15 days. But where you can go on vacation for 15 days for $130 + $1,100 = $1,230? NO WHERE! And where the weather is clear skies for all 15 days except for 15 minutes on day 3 where it poured cats and dogs! Otherwise the weather is second to none!! I love the hot weather,,,I'm in the pool from around 10:30AM straight to 5:00PM the hotter the better....no suntan lotion,,,I get nice and bronzed by day three. No sunburn, no lotion of any kind except for a dab or two of 99 cent moistruizing cream from Walgreens on my face at the end of the day. I love Vegas....just got back the other day!

We had an easy VIP check-in with our Stratosphere Select room. Joy checked us in and was so pleasant to work with! Great staff! We arrived at the hotel by 10 AM and were able to go right up to our room (it was a Thursday and a little quiet). Every day got a little busier as the weekend approached. The room was near the elevators on the 23rd floor, which was fine until the last night when the drunks next door stayed up a little late and got locked out of their room and banged on the doors at 5am. (-; Not a big deal for us though, as we both fall back to sleep easily. The view from the 23rd floor was awesome! It isn't a strip view and it is above the parking garage, but you are up so high, the mountains are the main focus. The night view is also very cool! The room itself was updated with granite bathroom countertops, nice size tub, flat screen tv, the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on in a hotel, and trendy decor. There is a turndown service and chocolates on the pillow. Also bathrobes if you would like them. I loved the Select Room! The pool was a blast! Again, nice mountain view over the wall. Drinks were a little high- $6 beer, $10 for a fruity concocotion, but there was good music, lots of people, and it was a lot of fun! The casino didn't love us, but that's ok- that's why they call it gambling, right? I was up about $200 at one time, but gave it all back by the end of the weekend. We played a lot though. The buffet was good. Not great, but not bad. Pretty average. Loved the Bananas Foster! Potstickers were good too! If you show your Player's Club Card, you get 25% off. Saturday was a Champagne Brunch with chilled crab legs. Nice. Loved the Mimosas! We ate at Roxy's Diner late one night. It was decent, but plan on spending at least $30 without alcoholic beverages. Sandwiches are about $10. During the day, they sing to the patrons. Some of our group had a fun waitress named Aretha. They said she could sing like the great lady herself. We saw the American Superstars show. Elvis, Rod Stewart, and Michael Jackson were all very good. We got a 2-1 deal for staying at the property. $60 for a VIP booth. Very good seat and good show. I was a little disappointed because I was looking forward to the Britney Spears and Tim McGraw impersonators, but neither were there that night. )-: Check out Sunday morning was also easy. There weren't many people up and about at 8am on Sunday. (See previous \"drunks\" comment!) We walked to the Venetian (a very do-able 2 miles or so) and taxied back for about $10. Taxi to downtown was also about $10 one way. I don't see the location as a problem at all. The hotel was so reasonably priced that it is worth budgeting in the taxis. I should have paid more attention to the Players Club. I had about 1800 points on my card and was going to cash it out for $3 when we left. I had forgotten to do it earlier. There has to be at least $4 on your card for cash back, but I had $9 in comps I didn't know about! I'll have to go back within a year and use it! I went up to the tower and rode the Insanity. Awesome!!! One of our group also jumped off the tower. He said he has never been so terrified in his entire life. It was a great time and we can't wait to go back! I don't know why anyone would give this place such a bad review. I didn't see anymore shady characters than anywhere else I've been.

A rate of about $52 including the resort fee got us a double queen on the 23rd floor (\"select\" room), which had clearly been recently updated. Everything was immaculate...even the hallway carpet outside was spotless. Views from the room were excellent toward Sahara and the strip...lights were awesome. Also had a view of several \"jumpers\" bungee jumping from the tower throughout the evening...to each his own:) The staff were all very friendly and went out of their way to accommodate our needs...from the desk to the valet to the bell services....no complaints at all. The buffet was pretty good for the price ($19 or so per person, but the ACE card knocks it down to $14...well worth stopping by the desk to get the card). Just your basic buffet by vegas standards, but not bad at all. Hotel guests get into the observation deck free any time, which is a tremendous deal. If you have 3 or 4 people in the group who like to frequent the tower, it basically pays for your stay considering the usual $12-$15/person charge. There is a nice mall area attached, which included a McDonald's if you just want something quick. The lobby and casino areas all looked nice and clean (although yes, there is some smoke...it's a casino:). There was a wide selection of games and minimums. My only complaints were: Internet access is $12/day, so it's essentially \"emergency only\"...and the 8th floor pool closes at 8:00, which is ridiculous. But otherwise, everything was great. The main complaint folks seem to have about stratosphere is its location. I wouldn't say the place is in a bad neighborhood, but it is at the end of the strip on the edge of the main stream. If you want to walk everywhere...it's just not for you...plain and simple. But, if riding the deuce bus or walking over to the monorail at Sahara (less than 2 blocks away) makes sense for your stay $$-wise, you can get a lot of bang for your buck here. They appeared to be remodeling in areas and some of the lower floor rooms may be getting a facelift now as well.

The location was no big problem as we were aware of where the hotel was however taxis could vary in price a lot so I\u2019d recommend always taking extra money with you just in case.

Taxis line up outside the hotel so there was never any waiting involved. The hotel itself was faultless, the staff were very helpful and polite and check in was very quick. The rooms were always cleaned and the air con was on when we arrived which was very appreciated. The air con unit could be switched on and off as required. Our room was on the 5th floor and we never ever had any problems with noise during our stay. The casino is pretty much the same as any casino in Vegas. We didn\u2019t eat at any of the restaurants as we wanted to try some of the trendy places to eat on the strip- which were around the same price range really. Drinks were slightly cheaper here than in the heart of the strip. There are a good range of shops upstairs and a MacDonald\u2019s which was always open late and very handy. Be prepared to be searched (like in the airport) on your way up to the tower. The views are fantastic! There were some dodgy looking characters in the streets surrounding the hotel although we were never bothered by anyone and to be honest there are dodgy characters throughout the strip anyway. The only thing that has made me book elsewhere for our trip next year is that we did underestimate the walk somewhat. I had bad blisters and very sore feet two days in although when you are walking there is so much to see and do that you don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s a long walk.

I was even with a woman with a cane and severe mobility issues and they made her wait for me to go through the line before they would let us up the elevator. Seriously? Oh, and the insidious picture taking was just inconvenient. O.K.: Casino--on the small side with a very varied crowd. Too smoky though. Did win some money on blackjack, despite playing with some bad gamblers. Other restaurants weren't very appealing. Not so great: Location.

For example, we needed to extend our trip for one extra night, a Wednesday, and the rate we received was only $38.

If you stay at the hotel, you receive comlimentary admission to ride up to the top of the tower. Once you arrive there, they offer (for a price), a multitude of adrenaline pumping rides for those who are not scared of heights. You can take the \"Big Shot\" (shoots you upwards above the tower), a motion ride that holds you over the edge of the tower, or the newest attraction - a freefall over the side assisted by multiple cords and harnessess. The hotel itself also offers a beautiful pool, we only visited it one day on Tuesday, but they have a DJ and poolside party from Thursday through Sunday.

The Deuce literally stops at every hotel, so even though it's only a mile or so down the road, it took ages in traffic! Recommend waiting for the Ace instead. It only stops at the main hotels so you can skip a load in the middle and go straight to the bottom of the strip. Like all of the other Vegas hotels, there are lots of shops and restaurants inside the hotel itself. McDs etc etc. Of course if you want any extras (Wifi) you have to pay bucks. Nothing is free. But we didn't try it. Also a gym but we never tried it. Overall this hotel is great for the price! We paid \u00a3100 for 3 nights which is brilliant. If you can get a similar price then go there!

The price was right for our 7 night stay, so despite some of the more negative reviews, I decided to take my chances with the Stratosphere hotel. Yes, I was worried, but went with an open mind. We arrived late (10 PM) on a Monday night and yes, the lines to check in were long. But it moved, and check in was a breeze once we got to the front. I appreciated the check in staff member's advice to not (as I was planning) put our room deposit on my pay as you go credit card but on my other card to avoid delays in it being credited back. We were pleasantly surprised with the news that since we had booked on the \"Perfect package\" through the website, the Resort Fee would be waived making our weekday nights only $27 a night! We were given a room on the 14th floor and was a little worried when we were directed to the World II elevators. I needn't have worried. Our room was spacious and spotlessly clean and I was surprised by the nice huge flat screen tv (recent reviews have stated old tv's but we were told that almost all of the rooms now have the newer tv's). I've read complaints about the sink being outside of the bathroom being a problem for some, but I've stayed in other hotels with this design, and it doesn't bother me. In fact, it makes things easier when, for example, one person showers and another one needs to put on makeup or brush teeth, etc.. Water drained well, and shower water pressure was fabulous. Housekeeping was great. There was one day that the 2 teenagers spent a lot of time in the room (and put the do not disturb sign on the door) and our room didn't get made up, but we were left a message from housekeeping to go ahead and call them when we wanted the room done. I thought that was nice. I did leave a small tip every day for housekeeping ($2-5) which I think goes a long way to ensure good service. Every other day our room was done to perfection and sometimes we were left extra supplies. We enjoyed the pool immensely and had no trouble getting loungers. One nice touch....I was leaving my room one day and a security guard was knocking on doors that weren't closed all the way warning them that leaving the door like that could be a problem. I thought that was great. Valet service was awesome. The guys were always friendly and offering help with directions which was great. We used the bell desk a couple times too and those guys were unbelievably friendly and helpful too. All in all, for the whole 7 days we were there, we were treated with the utmost respect by all staff and would definitely stay at the Stratosphere again.

I haven't ever written a review online before - but felt so upset about the stay I thought I should at least share with others thinking of staying at the Strat. We were first of all placed on the '5th' floor which we soon found out was actually the 1st floor - and had a view of a brick wall and air con units. This was fine for us as it was only a base. However only a few days into our trip we were rudely awoken by a security guard doing checks at 7am causing the shutters across the lifts to clank and crash several times. Eventually this was resolved but was too late to get more sleep. Then a few days later we were then awoken at 5am but banging and drilling noises and after several calls down to front desk the noise just continued. Each time we were told that the issue will be dealt with and that 'the manager would be told', however the noise continued. We then discovered that building work had started on the casino floor - the noise we could hear was a pneumatic drill breaking up tiles and the banging was the replacement tiles. We asked the builders how long the job will be - and said 5 days!! basically mon to fri so that weekend guests aren't affected presumably. They were again noisy the next morning and we were ignored by requests for them to start later. Presumably, building work is cheaper if they can start early rather than a reasonable time in the morning that would be suitable for paying guests stayinga t a hotel. We were also not notified by the hotel at all about this building work. We were so appalled. We were then given a letter the following day to say that the hot water would be off for the entire day until late afternoon. We then decided to move room - this was something we wanted to avoid given that all our belongings were unpacked already for a 2 week break. As we couldn't bear another early waking, we asked to be moved and to be fair the lady we spoke to did this without any hesitation or the need for us to be assertive with the request. She however placed us in a disabled room in the premier block on 12th which was dated and unclean and lacked the facitilities we were using in the other room. All in all we were very disappointed in our stay at the hotel and would certainly not stay there again. If anyone is thinking of staying, i do think it comes cheap with a package flight deal which is great. having free access to the tower is cool and being halfway between downtown and the main strip is good in order to see both sides. I would either recommend staying elsewhere - perhaps closer to the main places on the strip to save on taxis, or I would defiantely ask for a high floor room to avoid any interruption. I was disappointed they didn't respect their guests - i mean, why place guests staying for 2 weeks on the 1st floor when they knew building work was due to start for half that time. We didn't stick around a use many of the other amenities there. However we did try the buffet whcih was pretty grim. The plates had old food stuck to them and the plastic glasses were all chipped. Contrast this with the bellagio buffet and you'll see the strat have a cheek with what they are offering. Other things about staying in LV - use the deuce bus, only $7 per 24 hour hop on and off. Don't use the starbucks internet terminal - go across the road to the locals cafe where internet is much cheaper for longer. Also try to book tours and trips online before you go, or even while you're there - don't rely on the tour operators vying for your business.

I had reservations about staying here from the jump, but my brother insisted that everyone be located at the same hotel. He had gotten group rates and the rooms were rather cheap. First of all it's located at the very north end of the strip in what I would call the \"ghetto\" part of the strip. It is out of walking distance from the central/north part of the strip. So if you plan on walking the strip don't choose the Stratosphere. We arrived and the only room that was left that day in the group reservation was a double queen. Not all of our family had even arrived yet, so we were like...ok. So we asked for an upgrade to a King room on the 20th floor (original rooms were on 12th floor. We also asked for a good \"view\". So we paid the extra $15 per night for this room upgrade and went to our room and I've stayed in some normal chain hotels better than this room (Fairfield Inn, Country Inn Suites, Holiday Inn Express...etc.). First off, there is no such thing as a good view from any room in the Stratosphere. The only good view we had was one of crazy people sky jumping from the top of the tower! Other than that it was a view of the run down end of the strip. The room didn't have a microwave or fridge. The upgrade was a flat screen TV, that wasn't even HD. My wife pulled the sheets back on the bed and there were stains and hair on them, so we had to call housekeeping for a new set. The bath only had two drying towels and one small washcloth. The air vents in the bathroom were covered in dust. As we settled in the room, we heard this loud vibrating noise, so we went out in the hallway to see where it was coming from. The sound was coming through the AC blower unit in the hall. We went downstairs and asked the folks at the front desk about it and they said \"Oh yeah, we are doing some remodeling above your floor and they are jack-hammering up there from 8am - 7pm daily!\" Are you serious??!!!Needless to say, it wasn't a good experience hotel wise for us....If you're not on a budget or at the expense of someone else's request, don't waste your time on the Stratosphere.", "Date": "July 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cEntrance to observation tower\u201d", "Author": "lillymom", "ReviewID": "UR70767176", "Content": "The hotel does NOT make it clear that if you are staying at the Stratosphere, entrance to the observation tower is free with your room key - also, you must go thru a metal detector.

We had just come from San Francisco where you had to pay $20 for valet so I did not think it to be an unreasonable question to enquire about the parking. The valet told me that either I could park the vehicle in the multi storey car park or that they had valet. I asked whether you had to pay for the valet? He replied \"no\" and told me to park the car at then end. As I drove away, I heard the valet's poking fun at me and saying \"Do you have to pay?\" in a fake, posh English accent. So, I decided to reverse and tell them that due to their rudeness, I would park the car myself and that they had just lost themselves a tip. We parked the car in the multi storey car park and checked in. We went to our room and it was very nice and comfortable although our view was of the carpark! The bathroom was big and clean and the beds were really comfortable. The hotel has a great pool on the roof with lots of sunloungers. Although I did go into the bar area and request a diet coke and was told that they couldn't serve me as I didn't have any ID on me. For a diet coke! This was ridiculous and I had to keep going to the waitress desk and buying my drinks! So make sure you bring your ID with you to the pool if you want a drink (whether it be alcoholic or not). We ordered food from the pool area and it wasn't very nice. The American diner is good for breakfast and the Italian restaurant was lovely and the staff were very nice.

We normally enjoy walking but you do enough walking-even if your hotel is in the center of everything you will do tons of walking. There is so much to do that it's not worth being far, the time you spend walking to get to the strip is wasted time. The location is just not convenient.

You have to walk about 15 minutes (we walk fast) before you get to where the action actually begins. I'd recommend staying in the middle of the strip- even if one block over- there are actually small resorts back there that i wish we had known about.

But we did not want that, we wanted to have the room changed, since this guy would only be checking out the day before us. It took AGES to have everything sorted, finally we were in a different room by 5am. 2.

We called the front desk to ask what the hell was going on, the woman kept making excuses, saying its not their fault, that it must've been my parents that not getting something right! Which was just crazy! In the end, she said the reason why they rejected the calls were because the letter 'Z' was not pronounced right. I just could not believe what she just said, I mean how we say Z is different from how the americans say it, but i cannot believe for that different accent reason, they rejected my parents call 4 times!!! which they were not sincere about it in the slightest!!! 3.

Stratosphere has by far the best value. We were really amazed by about our room luxury and view. The atmosphere I liked less, when I go to vegas I like it to be old skool dirty vegas. Cheap buffets, girls dancing on the game tables and beer for $1! So if that's what you're looking for I you will not find that here... I read some people's reviews here writing it's a bad neighbourhood. I guess that totally depends on where you come from.

We booked a 'Strip View Premier - 1 King Bed' over the internet direct with the hotel about 6 months beforehand and paid a total of just under $600. If you book this way you can cancel up to a day before the first night of your stay and you don't pay the full amount until check out, unlike booking with expedia or similar. We arrived at about 7pm local time on a Wednesday evening, check in took about 15 minutes. The room we had booked six months before wasn't available (\"we don't guarantee room availability sir.\") but we were given a 'Strip View Premier - 2 Queen Bed' and a promise that we could upgrade the next day. The room was big enough that we didn't bother changing. We were in room 31460, meaning the 14th floor. The room was clean, well appointed and had good air conditioning. There was a limited view of the strip and of the pool. The bathroom was clean with a good shower. There was no noise from the elevators and the room was cleaned regularly and thoroughly. The pool area on the 8th floor is large and vibrant, there is single deck 'bikini blackjack' at the weekends with some very friendly dealers. The pool bar is lively and relaxing. It gets very windy around the pool, but you're in a desert and even in May it was hot enough to lay by the pool most days. Taxis in Vegas are a nightmare. Everything's on one street but every taxi journey seemed to include a freeway. There is a bus stop right outside the hotel, the Deuce is cheap but stops everywhere, the Ace is better with fewer stops, and there is a bus goes to the airport in about 25 minutes and costs 2 dollars. The best way to get around is to walk over to the Sahara (5-10mins) and get the monorail. The monorail takes just 14 minutes to travel to the other end of the line and it stops everywhere you'd want to go. The casino was ok, generally the same as all the others. They have single deck blackjack in the evenings by the back bar and outside by the pool. The dealers are attractive young ladies who don't wear much and are very friendly. I highly recommend it. The food at the Top of The World is good, but expect to pay about $100 dollars a head. The view is worth it though as the room revolves once every hour or so, and the service is excellent. The buffet is a good deal too, they provide a massive range and everything is good. Roxy's Diner is basic but adequate and cheap. Register for an ACE card when you check in. It's absolutely free and gets you 25% off the buffet as well as other things. The area was safe day and night. There were a few homeless people but it was far better than New York or San Francisco. I was quite happy to walk places any time day or night. In all I found the Stratosphere to be so much more comfortable that the Bellagio and the MGM and I would choose this hotel again, especially as we paid less than $90 a night (about 57 GBP).", "Date": "May 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "new zealand", "Title": "\u201cWay better than we expected\u201d", "Author": "jmannz", "ReviewID": "UR65672378", "Content": "Looking to do vegas on a budget then this place is for you.

We know before going that it was at the far North end of the strip, but I was looking for a good deal, and this was it! We didn't arrive until about 9pm on Friday night, and waited in line for about 20mins to check in. We had only paid for the most basic room with a King bed, and didn't bother asking for an upgrade since we weren't planning to spend much time in the room. We were given a room on the 20th floor of the World 1 tower. Had one small window, but no view of the strip. The washroom is small but the tub/shower is a good size. Bed was comfy and we slept well. Definitely take advantage of the Ace Play card; that gets you discounts at most of the restaurants and shops in the hotel. it's free to get, so very worth the money you'll save. We went to the buffet for breakfast on two mornings, and we thought it was really good. They put out quite the spread, so you won't go hungry! We ate at Roxy's Diner once for dinner; good for a quick, cheap meal. On our last night we splurged and had dinner at Top of the World; what a view! The food was excellent - best lobster bisque I've ever had! We each ordered an appy and entree, and half a bottle of wine. With a generous tip, we spent $180. If you go to Tix4Tonight, they also have coupons you can buy for different restaurants, so for $3 each, we both got 25% off of our entree. The restaurant is revolving, so you'll enjoy a 360 view of the strip, so definitely go for dinner as opposed to lunch. We also tried 107 lounge for a quick bite the night we arrived; too expensive for what you get, in our opinion. We only spent about an hour at the 8th floor pool on one day, as we wanted to see the sights and it was my first time in Vegas. The drinks were good, but pool was cold! We weren't bothered by the music even though we were right under a speaker (it wasn't live, though). Casino was quite large and although I didn't do much gambling, my fiance seemed to enjoy it. Be aware that if you take the Deuce bus, it will take about an hour to get from the Strat to the opposite end of the strip. We had to be at Luxor at 9 for our show one night, and we left our hotel before 8pm, and just made it there on time. So regardless of what mode of transportation you choose, leave lots of time if you need to be somewhere at a certain time. You cannot be in a rush in Vegas!

Housekeeping service was good. Bathroom was TINY! That was the major negative for the hotel. Sink was outside in dressing area. It was difficult to close the door while standing in the bathroom and no, I am not huge. The 8th floor pool was very loud the first afternoon we went there so we never went back. Obnoxious \"house beats\" by a DJ and some guys banging on bongos, etc. There was nowhere on the deck to escape the racket. The 25th floor pool is \"optional topless\" for the ladies so we did not attend. Not a bad place, but they need to shoose their market. I recommend making this one more family oriented and leave the \"pool club\" scene to those who do it well.

This was my first trip to Las Vegas but I have stayed in a number hotels around the world, also visited many others on the strip. Location - Overall the hotel is good value for money but location could be a lot better. It is at the very end of the strip and you can walk (at least 30 mins to main part) or get the bus, monorail or a taxi. We walked and got taxis the first two days then got to grips with the bus. Bus is cheap, $7 for a 24 hr pass and you can hop on and off the Deuce and Ace buses. Make sure you always have the correct change! Change bills at Bill Breaker machines in casino (no charge). Taxi approx $10 one way to strip but make sure the taxi driver doesn't rip you off by taking a longer route, especially at night. Also hotel location in rough area of town, we saw two police arrests, homeless people etc. Hotel - Hotel is no frills with a large casino and some good facilities, free admission up the tower if you are a hotel guest. Sign up for the Ace membership card as soon as you arrive, its free and gets you 25% off the buffet as well as a cheap meal offer in the American Diner. Rooms - We were lucky with our room, having requested a king bed when booking we ended up with a disabled access room so it was large with a wet room (no bath). Also requested a high floor room so great view. King bed was enormous and very comfortable. Upgrades not worth it unless you go for a suite (our friends had the premier room, next grade up, and it was small and quite dark, only differences a flat screen tv and dark wooden furniture). Our room had basic toiletries (take your own!) but maids came to clean it every day. Floor of bathroom stained but room was clean. Room had iron and board, large tv, wardrobe. No fridge but ice machines in hallway. We bought a 20 pack of bottled water from the K mart petrol station and kept in room! Also there is a McDonalds in the tower shops, 2nd floor of hotel, for cheap soft drinks etc. Amenities - free gym, restaurants, bars, Tower shops good value but on the cheap and nasty side. Free pool although very loud music played non stop. Drinks by pool v expensive and they confiscate your drinks if you take your own (outrageous!). Food and Drink - tried the American diner and Italian, both very good and substantial portions. Not so impressed with the buffet, surprisingly little choice and I didn't like the decor of the restaurant. McDonalds and authentic mexican in the Tower Shops section. C bar in the casino had a good atmosphere and divine raspberry mojitos. Drink offer of all you can drink between 4-8pm for $20 on cocktails and beer. Within walking distance there is an IHOP and Dennys for inexpensive breakfasts. Liked best - value of room rate, american diner and italian restaurant, views, staff helpful and friendly Liked least - poor location, noisy pool area, high prices of drinks, dated decor Attractions and activities - Really recommend visiting all the top strip hotels and the attractions. Loved the dolphin habitat at the Mirage, well worth the $15 entry fee. Eiffel tower ride brilliant and we caught the free Bellagio fountain show at the top! Go see the lions at the MGM for free, the Bellagio conservatory, the gardens at the Flamingo and the shopping streets in the Paris hotel and New York New York. Also Coca Cola world and the M&M factory and the free circus acts in Circus Circus. Shopping amazing, I've never seen so many designer stores and malls. Avoid - the New York New York rollercoaster, really painful bumpy ride and not worth $15 fee. The rides in Circus Circus, outdated and 3 rides broken when we went. Our trips - we splashed out on two things and they were worth every penny, a helicopter landing tour to the Grand Canyon and a show, Le Reve at the Wynn. Both incredible! We booked the helicopter tour with Papillon before we went on their website and then got the show tickets when we were there. You can get discount show tickets at the special booths on the strip, offers released at 9.30am every day and people queue, but they don't have every show. Le Reve was an acrobatic water show at the 5 star Wynn Resort, we went for the lowest price splash zone seats (1st two rows) but we literally only got the tiniest drop of water on us and for front row seats it was fab! Restaurant recommendations: Joes steak and crab in Caesar's Forum Shopping Mall (expensive but great Stone Crab and wonderful service), Le Mon Ami Gabi located outside Paris (french, great steak for only $20, lovely wine and service, views of Bellagio fountains), Hussong's Cantina, Mandalay Bay shopping mall (best Mexican and margheritas to die for!). Conclusion - I would recommend the Stratosphere hotel for cheap accommodation and if you are prepared to get public transport up the strip. Watch the food and drink prices, a beer by the pool was $7 and you pay less in the Bellagio! If you can afford more, there are beautiful hotels on the strip, Paris, Bellagio, Mirage, Wynn were some of our favourites.", "Date": "May 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "mumbai", "Title": "\u201cValue for money hotel\u201d", "Author": "devonsb", "ReviewID": "UR64704310", "Content": "the hotel is at the end of the las vegas strip and hence is a little out of the actions spots.

We didn't ride the rides but they were awesome. We stayed a total of 4 nights. The restaurants we went to were great. I recommend Roxy's it is a nice place, it\u2019s affordable and has a great atmosphere. If you have a rental car traveling between the main part of the strip and the hotel is simple and painless. I cannot rate the bussing system; but it would be about a mile on foot. I would recommend the Stratosphere Hotel and we are already booking our next visit in Aug.

The flight was cheap, the room was even cheaper. We got upgraded when we arrived, so were on the 18th floor in a suite. Rooms - were very clean, everything was in order, flatscreen was nice. As has been noted before, there is very little selection of TV channels. The bed was very comfortable. It's a bit of a stretch to call these rooms a suite, as there is really only a nook with a chair and the cabinet that has a fridge in it, but for the price we paid, we weren't complaining. Windows aren't large, but the view was nice. Service - the Bell desk was not very helpful when we asked for directions, they were very brusque and did not explain the directions very well. Our room was looked after satisfactorily every day. Drink service in the casino area was ok as well. We are not big spenders, so maybe you don't get as good of service if you aren't dropping the dough. Shows - We went to the American Superstars show. It was OK, not very much energy and passable impersonations. You can tell when someone is just going through the motions and not putting all their energy into it. But hey, I'd probably get pretty bored doing the exact same thing every night too. Restaurants - Starbucks - just like any other Starbucks, just more expensive. You pay more for your caffeine here then say, the Starbucks down at the Fashion Show mall. Buffet - pretty good, we thought. Good selection and quality. For all the places in the Stratosphere we tried, this was probably our favorite. Roxy's Diner - Horrible. Poor service and poorer food. We showed up and there was no lineup to get in, yet the two employees at the door were more engaged in their own conversation than seating us. Finally acknowledged us and seated us. The wait staff was slow and inattentive. And our food was horrible. We wanted a nice sit down meal of real food. The food was greasy, overcooked and had no flavor. The ambience may be nice, but it doesn't make up for the rest of it. McDonalds - what you would expect from McDonald's, dependable cheap junk food. Good for that late night snack, or cheap breakfast option. One thing, if you have the Players card, you get 10% off at any Stratosphere owned restaurant, but make sure you show them your card and then make sure you check your receipt that you actually got your 10% off. At the McDonalds we showed our card, then they proceeded to charge us full price and we had to ask for our discount amount back. At Roxy's Diner, they did not ask us for the card, we had to mention it, then remind them again when the bill came. Supposedly the Starbucks is owned by the Stratosphere, yet they declined our card. It's not that big of a deal, but made us want to spend our money elsewhere on our food and drinks. If you are going to use Transit to get around, use the new ACE Line Express. This thing is great. Just like the Deuce, but less stops, and it goes out to the Premium Outlets. We used this extensively to get around the strip.

The pool is okay, nothing spectactular, but the music is really loud, you just can't listen to your MP3 at all. It makes it hard to read a book unless you really concentrate. Forget sleeping around the pool. There is no escape, the speakers are everywhere. The pool on floor 24 is privately owned and charges $10 per day for gents and nothing for women, even if your a hotel guest. The gym is good. The casino is okay, $5 Blackjack, $60 dollars to enter the poker tournaments, and the usual slots. But its a very smoky enviroment, as are all the casinos we went to. The Restaurents are good, Fellinis is very good and reasonably priced, Roxys does your breakfast and Burgers, they have a McDonalds in the shopping court and a Pizzeria, which does superb sandwiches. The Top of the World restaurent is good but expensive, $110 for 3 courses and a glass of wine. The view from the Tower is superb and worth a couple of visits. The location is at the far end of the Strip, it takes 20 minutes to walk to Circus Circus at a pace. The bus is good, catch the Ace outside Carl Jr, it comes up to the strip just before the Wynn.

There is a gas station nearby with convenience store, area is a bit rough especially at night, a lot of homeless, although they dont bother you it did make uncomfortable walking back one night,The bus stops right outside the hotel going both ways, Freemont street is 10 mins on bus and is cheaper to gamble and eat on then the strip. However we did have brunch in the Bellagio, They have lovely restaurant called 'cafe Bellagio' which wasn't expensive 14dollars -club sambo 15 dollars -pasta and it was lovely..well worth it.

Cons: Bland rooms, a little dirty (I found some other hairs on some towels and on the first night found what I believe to be part of a rat claw - just one digit - IN MY BED, disgusting TV remote).

Also, there is some low income/section 8 housing right across the street, so it's not like you would even WANT to walk around there in the dark (unless you are insane). The Stratosphere casino is smokier and more disgusting than most - and there is NO WAY you can avoid it as you must get through it in order to get to the hotel lobby or to the self-parking. The other clientele in the hotel reminds you as to how cheap the rates are - ANYONE can afford to stay there.

A few fast food restaurants(Carl's Junior across the road) and iHOP nearby so there is no problem with finding late night supper and breakfast. Cons: Location. Do not by deceived by the description \"located at the north end of the Strip\". Yes it IS located at the North End of the Strip but the walk to the real \"glitzy,glammy ,bling bling\" action of the Strip beginning from Wynn to Luxor, is a 30-45min walk away. We can see Mirage hotel from Stratosphere, but it is literally a mirage in the desert(how appropriately named) which seems so near but yet so far. The Deuce which services the Strip is useless too, as it can take nearly 30 minute for the bus to travel that short distance from Stratosphere to Caesar's Palace due to jams and visitors taking a long time to buy tickets on the bus. The bus can take 10-15min just to pick up passengers at each bus stop. The frequency of the Deuce bus is very bad as well. Service. This is the worst part of the hotel and the main reason why i rate this hotel as a 1 star hotel. I know that Vegas was 'built-on-20 dollar tips\" but i did not expect to pay for every single advice and assistance! Check-in staff were unfriendly and concierge was useless. She hardly answered any of our questions and the only expression she has on her face is a stoned one. Asking the casino and hotel staff simple questions like 'where can i purchase the American Superstar tickets' are more often replied with a 'expressionless-no eye contact' point to a certain direction. But the WORST part is yet to come. During 1 of the night when we return to our room, we couldn't open the door with our card. When we went to the check-in counter, we approached 2 check-in ladies who were chatting for assistance. They brushed us off and told us to approach another lady instead because 'they were busy'. So we approach the lady whom the 2 ladies pointed us to for assistance. She was counting some cash and look flustered when we asked her for assistance. Unsurprisingly she told us to approach the first 2 ladies whio were chatting instead!! Super pissed by now and when i told the 3 ladies off only did another guy came to help us. Please note that it was 12am and there were NO OTHER guests checking in or out. Well as the guy checked our reservation records, he had a puzzled look on his face and it took him quite a while to recode the access card and return it to us. Apparently we had overstayed our bookings and this information was not told to us by the hotel staff. We only discovered our mistake on the next night and this mistake cost us to miss our flight for 1 entire day!! I admit that it was my mistake but the hotel staff should have kindly let us know about it, or at least ask if we would like to stay another night instead of just recode the card after checking our bookings! The lady who handled our check-out the next day also had a puzzled look on her face and even had to consult her manager during the checking out. I am sure that they are aware of our overstay and yet NONE of them bother to inform us. The check-out staff could have mentioned that we are charged an extra night but didn't.

It would be nice if there was a coffee maker in the room to avoid the Starbucks abrasive staff early in the morning. The pool area is super, only thing the weather was windy and cool. First day the pool was closed due to the weather. Second day it was open but pool is not heat ed and was too cold to swim in. The jacuzzi was very popular! Hotel guests were friendly while warming up in it. Beautiful views. No problems with location since I had a car and it was easy to get around to the other casinos but still bring good pair of walking shoes to walk through hotels/casinos. Dont buy show tix at the hotel, better prices and selection at the half price tix stand by the Peppermill on LV Blvd. Saw Penn and Teller show at Rio and it was fun. Check out the bass player of the jazz duo that plays b4 their show! Also they sign autographs and take photos with the audience after ther show. Really nice guys! Penn even spoke to my son on my cell phone. As far as food goes, I dont recommend Felleni's at Stratosphere. Have eaten there b4, but this time I got sick about 3hrs after eating their bruscetta and fagoli soup. I was sick most of my 2nd day. Decided not to eat anywhere at the hotel after that. Save your food $$ and eat at the Venitian instead, prices are almost exact. Had the buffet at Paris and was disappointed after waiting nearly an hr in line. Temps of food was lukewarm to cool. Good selection of grilled vegetables but it is no where near as good as it used to be. Pork loin and Duck were dry. Beef Borgonion had a sheen of oil on top. Deserts were so-so and no choco mousse. Seafood was overcooked. Skip Stage Door Deli at Luxor. Nothing like the one in NY. Pretty so-so. Great gelato at Venitian in St. Marks Sq and expresso at the Expressomente by the waterfall. Check out the conservatory at the Bellagio. Fantastic along with the dancing fountains. There are great rates throughout LV right now, my rate was $24.00 per nt. Less expensive than camping.

The front desk people were all very nice and helpful. I stayed in a premium suite. They quickly moved me to a room with a better view when I requested it. The room was huge, very clean and the bed was really comfortable. I was solo, so I would have liked the TV to be a little better. Maybe a silly complaint in Vegas, but not really many channels, the TV was old and the remote was 50/50 on working. Kind of annoying when you just want to unwind for an hour. The tower was cool, I didn't really think the view was mind blowing or anything, but definitely worth a look, especially since it's included. While I was happy they offered $5 blackjack, the tables were disgusting. Not just stained, but crusty. Seriously, they need to be replaced. Nobody made any attempt to move all the empty glasses and dirty ashtrays in front of me when I sat down at the table. Even the goofy pit boss kept making small talk with me while I was sitting there with all that stuff in front of me. I noticed this as a trend not just one time. I stopped playing there after about a half hour because it was just so gross. There are a million places that all offer the same games, why would I give my business to one that is filthy and doesn't even care. So give the housekeeping and desk service a raise and fix up that casino. It is seriously lacking in hospitality and cleanliness. Just depressing. Everything around there is cheap, there's a liquor store right down the street so that's handy since I don't like to pay bar prices in Vegas. But the neighborhood, my God! I'm from New Jersey, so it's not like I can't handle myself or I haven't seen the hood before. But believe everything you hear about how bad this hood is. When I first got there I walked down the street to the 7-11 to buy water. I could tell I was in a bad area, but it was close, mid-day and I needed some water. The next morning on the news I saw that a clerk had gotten held up there the night before. The first night I was there I definitely caught more than one drug deal go down and also saw a prostitute and her pimp having an argument as she was staggering away from him on any number of drugs. Probably averaged getting asked for change 3 times per block. Then there are just your general mixed bag of shady characters hanging around. When I went across the street to the Subway the second day there was a guy with a swastika tattoo having a shoving match with his girlfriend in the parking lot. I started taking cabs and the monorail after that. I could go on, but that should give you an idea. Based on that, I can't really recommend it to anyone who wants to walk around comfortably. It's especially nerve racking in Vegas when you have more cash on you than you normally would. It's far away from everything so cab fare kills any bargain you might get on the hotel. Your best bet is to walk to the Sahara monorail, but again walking around in this neighborhood with money in your pocket could be the biggest gamble you take in Vegas! The only way I could really recommend it is if you just want a big clean room at a good price and a good night's sleep.

But after a slightly brusque check-in process, I was incedibly impressed. ROOM: The Premier Room on the 14th floor was equal to most other Vegas rooms I'd stayed in, with all the amenities I'd expect (full range of towels/cloths; tissues; potions and lotions; comfortable kingsize bed (with plenty of pillows); small closet and desk; phone and clock-radio). I might have liked more channels on the TV than the fairly basic line-up (no Weather Channel; no Lifetime, for example) but hey, I wasn't intending to spend that much time in the room. Maid service was polite and efficient (I never came back to a non made-up room, something I've experienced in other, dearer hotels). POOL: The main hotel pool area was large and not exactly lush (but look carefully and you'd identify some plants here and there) and the music was trendy and VERY LOUD (it would drown-out even a personal stereo), but really quite OK once you got used to it, and the beverage service was frequent and efficient. There were planty of loungers, which were actually quite comfortable! Overall very relaxed and not nearly as uptight as some other Vegas pools. The water, in March, was pretty cold, but at least that meant it kept the pool from becoming crowded! TOWER: Hotel residence gets the bonus of free access to the Tower - it also means you can experience the tower when the lines are short (and keep coming back if they're a bit too long). I actually only went up the tower once during my stay, but still felt the free pass was a real boon - great to know I could've gone on up anytime I liked (and I imagine it would be a really good extra attraction for families). EATING: I ate only in the Diner, where the food was good and the staff friendly. Across the street from the Stratosphere are a Dennys and an iHop - nice to have those options so close (and fairly unusual in Vegas). CASINO: I'm not interested in gambling, but the casino seemed fairly busy, but by no means not crowded - kind of intimate and small enough to rule out getting lost (which is sometimes a problem in others) LOCATION/AREA: I had a rental car so found the location convenient for getting anywhere in Vegas (and the self-parking was easy to find and convenient for the Premier Room elevators, less so I guess for the other rooms). Others have commented on the seediness of the area around the Stratosphere, but I found this not an issue at all - it was in fact nice to feel you were actually in America rather than in some sort of fantasy park packed with fellow tourists, which is often the case when you're limited to the main strip area. Having a car meant I could easily visit the other Casinos via the back roads that provide access to their car parks (Industrial Road on the West side and Kovak Lane on the East) and this meant I can confidently say that the Stratosphere has one of the better self-parking garages! Traffic in Vegas is pretty bad at most times, with long waits at many of the hundreds of traffic light junctions, but you get this if you use taxis too, so a rental car is worth considering when you're staying at the Stratophere because it is, admittedly, a bit out of the way. And it does mean you get the freedom to visit \"real\" shops, restaurants and other attractions at your leisure, rather than limit yourself to the theme-based casinos, wonderful as they are.", "Date": "March 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Buenos Aires", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, great price!\u201d", "Author": "maiafridman", "ReviewID": "UR59646832", "Content": "The Stratosphere was everything we expected!

The C bar in the middle offers unlimited drinks between 4 and 8 everyday for 20 bucks possibly the best deal you'll find in vegas.

Many say its to far from the strip well a taxi to ceasars costs less than 10 dollars and when you divide by 4 or 5 is nothing. Onto the drinking in other places. if you have time to do freemont street GO. its 2 bucks a beer and 3 bucks for shots everywhere. if your looking for a serious night out go to the VooDoo lounge in Rio's. go early and get a stamp so you don't need to queue or pay to get in this will save you about an hour in queue and 30-50bucks on the door. it varies on how hot you are. this place is off the chain you're partying 52 stories up on a roof terrace packed out with talent and a view that will blow your mind. watch out though, the price of drinks will get you. especially if you start nailing jager bombs. it would rate in my top 3 nights out ever. good luck to anyone that is going soon.", "Date": "March 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay for the Money you Pay..\u201d", "Author": "CaliDreaminn", "ReviewID": "UR59444059", "Content": "We arrived at 10pm(bell trans airport shuttle $15 roundtrip was worth it; better and cheaper than a cab would be) and waitied less than 5 minutes to check in.

The Stratosphere is an average hotel, nothing better or worse. Here's the skinny: Room: Basic room, no frills but clean and quiet. We had an awesome view of the mountains and \"Old Downtown\" from our 16th floor room. Food: We ate at Roxy's Diner, Felinis, and the buffet. All were decent and not hugely overpriced except for maybe the buffet. Casino: I'm not much of a gambler but they appeared to have all of the standard table games and machines. I won $4.90 playing video poker, big spender right? Shows: We saw \"Bite\" it was OK. Attractions: Stratosphere has amusement rides on the top of the 1000ft tower. If you have a strong stomach or an adrenelin junkie these are for you. Tips: If you are in Vegas you MUST rent a car for one day and go to Red Rock Canyon. It's 20 mins out of town, costs $5 to get in and is absolutely amazing!!!! On your way out of town make sure to eat at Jamms restaraunt on South Rainbow, very very good. Get a players card. They're free and it will get you 25% off the buffett, plus comps if you're into playing the machines. The hotel also offers 2 for 1 show tickets for guests and unlimited trips to the top of the tower. Invest in a good pair of shoes. As far as I'm concerned walking is the best way to get around. You can take the monorail from Sahara to MGM for $5 a ride or you can take the \"Deuce\" bus, but the bus is slooooooow and CROWDED, it took us 2 hrs to get half way up the strip and we stood for most of it. Get off the strip. Everything is more exspensive on the strip. The days of cheap food and drinks are gone. Downtown is cheaper and just as good.

We got a very good price at the Strat from Bookit.com, I would say one of the nicest hotels for the money. Don't stay at Circus Circus if your looking for cheap, you get what you pay for there. ( my parents stayed there) The only thing that sucked about the hotel was that it was at the end of the strip, but that was fixed once we discovered that the monorail was only a 5 minute walk to the next casino! Don't take taxi's if you stay in vegas, take the monorail. You can drink on the monorail, just like every where else in vegas. It is like 5 dollars for the whole day or like 10 dollars for 3 ... don't quote me on the prices tho. For cheap drinks go to the monte carlo, its 1 or 2 dollars for mixed drinks !! Something that we had no idea about until we came home but go to OLD VEGAS apparently it is really neat, we never got a chance to see it as we didn't know it existed My parents rented golf carts that look like farm animals over there and drove it around the city, haha. The only glitch at the Strat was that we wanted to rent a car from the car rental place in the casino to see the grand canyon. No body told us that we had to be 25 to rent one there, they told us other places on the strip would rent to us, but because we were not 25 they couldn't enter us in the computer, they didn't tell us about anyother rental places either, so we wasted half a day looking for a car rental place, and by that time there was no point as it is a 6 hour drive !!!!( something else we didn't know) The pool was very nice to relax at, we couldn't stay outside for longer then 30 min due to extreme heats tho. ( I think just because it was August it was EXTREME heat) The show BITE was very.... exotic is the right word... my boyfriend forced me to go... I would suggest to do the players club $25.00 Buffet. as for $25.00 you get breakfast, Lunch and Dinner buffet all for 25.00 per person for one day!! real money saver. Happy Hour is lots of fun too ... its at the bar in the casino, the serve beer and hard martinis and margaritas... thats its... so prepare to get drunk , one flat price of 20.00 per person from 5-8 gets you unlimited alcohol. And NO we were too chicken to go on the rides.... but if you are a dare devil I would suggest it as it would be a once in a lifetime kind of ride...

I went for my wedding in mid-December. The room was clean, on the 21st floor, did not have a view of the strip but was kept really well. Unfortunately in December the pool is closed at night and I was there during their room service blackout, so at least on night one I couldn't benefit from that service. Lucky's was closed, and the Starbuck's plays music extra loud to discourage loiterers. If you are stuck at night, the double decker bus does pull up across the street and there are always enough other tourists at any hour to ensure some safety. Also, the Sahara is only two blocks away, and it is the nearest access to the train that takes you down the strip - it's a bit of a hit, but the speed, convenience, cleanliness and safety often make it a better bet than taking the bus. The spa connected to the Stratosphere is just a glorified hair salon with spa-like services. It is even the size and shape of a mall shop, and despite a \"spa menu\" in the hotel room that says you can charge services to your room, you can NOT charge services to your room, or at least we could not. I also found it to be the single most stressful \"spa\" experience of my life. Loud music, horrendous fluff television and a really mean-spirited and gossipy atmosphere among the employees left me feeling more instead of less tense after my massage and facial. You assume that your manicurist is judging you, but mine didn't even try to hide it. The truly alarming and hateful discussion about women's bodies reminded me that yes, I was in Vegas, but left me wondering if the employees had any genuine concern for their clients at all. Combine this with salon-typical high pressure sales and I was mostly relieved to get out of there. Chapel in the Clouds was efficient and lovely, and our photographer was a great guy. I'm not sure who does their photo editing service, but they operate way too much on assumption about names (asking clients relevant questions always increases sales, yo.) Also, the cover they tried to sell me on had me making an unfortunate weasel face. I'm assuming that they got me mixed up with the actual bridezilla that I saw the photographer actually running away from several hours after my own wedding. Also, for adults, see Bite. It's a hoot.

I don't really like being bothered all the time by employees unless I want their help. The employees were helpful and pleasant at checkin and if I needed to call them for something. Coctail waitresses are prompt and friendly. We booked throught the stratosphere website, which I recommend over any travel or discount websites because the strat will give you the best deal or match the best deal you can find. Then you know you are all set. They gave us the option to upgrade for an additional $5 per nt from a high floor premier strip view room to a studio deluxe room. Frankly the room was lame. The pics on their website are way too nice, much nicer than the room I had and I was quite disappointed. The bed was very comfortable, but the decor and furnishings were very bland and not as I pictured. I'm not sure what I would have had a view of in the original room, but in the room we ended up in I had a view of one of the legs of the tower. A big cement block right outside my window. great! haha All in all the room was clean and nice, but not as I had expected and we didn't spend that much time in there anyway. However, QUIET ... we were right off the elevators, never heard them and only once did we hear a roudy group in the hallway. It was silent there! IT was awesome that when I wanted some piece and quiet I could get it in my room! so for the price ... you couldn't beat it. we paid an average rate of about $70/ nt. Frankly I was pissed that they were charging $12.99 per day for internet access! I can go to a McDonalds at home if I want to and have FREE wifi!!!! This made me VERY upset and I complained and got a comped mini fridge brought to my room, which I was supposed to have in the \"studio\" anyway, but whatever. We bought cereal and milk and had breakfasts in the room instead of spending the money out so that was a great idea. With your room you get unlimited admission to the tower, which is about $15 per person per trip up ... we went up there every chance we got. It more than made up for the crap view from our room. It is gorgeous up there!!! There are a variety of things to do up there, we didn't go on the rides, but they looked fun. They are building a new one right now- a bungee jump off the tower. There is a restraunt that is VERY pricey so we just had drinks there. There is a bar, an artist who does fabulous characahers etc. It's a relaxing spot to grab one of the leather sofas and just look out and chat. BITE - the stratosphere's show. Good show, fanominal dancers, great music. DO NOT pay extra money for the VIP section seats. all the tables in the place are round tables that fit 10 ppl and they are simple padded aluminum chairs. They will tell you when you buy the tickets that they cannot tell you what seats are left in general admission and that if you buy these tix the computer will auto pick your seats. Otherwise if you want to pay xtra then you can pick your seats in the VIP sections which are some booths or tables that are up close. THere is not a bad seat in the house, I would not recommend wasting the money on VIP anything at this show ... the coctail waitress never even came to the 'vip' table we were at HAHA Some VIP ... Other than that- GREAT show. The location is NOT THAT BAD! Every one says It's in the ghetto .. blah blah blah. IT's really NOT that bad. It IS in fact quite far from the center of the strip - we never walked down there. Buy a Deuce bus pass for 24 hrs for $7 pp or 3 days for $15 ... TOTALLY worth it! There is a stop going north and south right outside the hotel. The longest we waited was for 20 mins on sat night around 6pm. otherwise we never waited more than 5 mins for the bus. this was great so we didn't have to spend a ton of money on cabs. There is a dennys and an Ihop right outside the hotel and across the street either way. You can walk to the Sahara for $1 blackjack in about 5 minutes. Honestly, on our 1st trip to Vegas we were not reallly that into the main strip. It's cool to go see it all and take pictures, but every hotel is basicly the same things and it is SO FAR to walk the whole thing. We LOVED the freemont street experience. LOVED IT! It's closed off so you can get to both sides of the street easily, there is a dome covering the street with a light show that is so neat and you are outdoors with the airy feel, but it feels very intimate. The Four Queens Comedy Club was AWESOME! $15 pp to see Butch Bradley was the best money we spent in Vegas. It was GREAT!!! We prefered Freemont St (aka old las vegas) to the strip anyway. Football on Sunday was in the theatre in the stratosphere was great! 7 projection screens with the game and a variety of snacks nachos, hot dog, baked potato, wings etc for just $2 each was wonderful! All in All ... Vegas is a fun place and the Stratosphere was good.

I was glad we did. The tub was huge! And the bathroom was bigger too. Otherwise, I think you pretty much get the same. The rooms are simple and have really no amenities and are NOT very sound proof. The neighbors next door were fighting all night long and you could hear every word! No in-room coffee. I brought my own little 4-cup pot and made my coffee each am. There is a Starbuck's right in the casino but a basic small cup of coffee is $3. There is good shopping and very good restaurants right in the hotel. For daily goods you can walk to the Circle K store. There is also a liquor store right across the street. The neighborhood, once off the Stratosphere property is a little undesirable until you get down more towards center strip, but nobody ever bothered us and we had no problems walking around. We used the airport shuttle to get to and from the hotel for arrival and departure. $12 pp round trip. A cab would have cost quite a bit more since it's north strip and further from the airport. We walked quite a bit but would use cabs to get back to the hotel at the end of the night. We rented a car (Budget located in hotel) and went to the Hoover Dam and Lake Mead one day. It was awesome! We really enjoyed it. The lake is beautiful too. Drive down to it and go for a walk on the beach or have lunch in the cafe at the marina. Go early though...head out to the dam right away in the morning. The traffic later in the day is unbelievable. But we were there on a Sunday so perhaps it's worse then. Watch the Belagio water show, it's spectacular and also the Treasure Island pirate show. Both free, outdoors and entertaining. This was our first trip to Vegas. Would we go back? Not sure.

We immediately called reception and they asked us to wait for a guy that would come and check it.

Great, one would think. The next day when I went up our room, the room key did not work. The room was registered on my friend's name. He had left the hotel and when I asked for a new room key, they said my name was not registered in the hotel! I said I could perfectly describe what was in the room and that my ID and other stuff could confirm me also staying in that room. They let the manager come and he sent me to some kind of guard. Had to wait over 10 minutes and when I explained him the situation, this guard refused in an impolite way to come along and check my room. I had to call my friend who had to come back from shopping so we could get new room keys (his also did not work) and so I could get registered. Finally everything worked out? Not so: the day after our room keys refused to work again so... back to reception... And ine more thing: I wanted to go swimming one day and there had been a very small storm before noon. In the afternoon weather got better so I went up to the swimming pool. Closed. Because of the stormy weather. Too dangerous. You must know sun was shining at that moment.

Being from the UK, where most hotels are overpriced, and you can't even rely on the big expensive chain hotels to have clean, fully equipped rooms, my expectations might be lower than others!!!! This was the second time I'd stayed at the Strat, so I already knew what to expect in terms of rooms, service etc. The rooms are spacious and clean. We were given a room with an interconnecting door to the next room, which I was wary of as it can sometimes mean that your neighbours sound like they are actually in your room. I was right to be wary, as that night my husband and I were kept awake by what sounded like 2 hillbillies in the next room arguing about where they wanted to go on the strip. That, coupled with suspicious loud rodeo-style 'yeehas' and 'yeah babys' from across the hall prompted me to call the front desk and ask to move rooms. This was done quickly and efficiently. One of our favourite places to eat in Vegas is Roxy's Diner in the Strat. The portions are huge, the staff are friendly, and the 50's kitsch style of the place makes it a fab place to visit. I recommend the huge hotdogs! There are several other eateries in the hotel/casino including Lucky's cafe which is good for breakfast. There is a small shopping centre in the Strat which has a range of shops - good for gifts and the odd souveneir. In terms of a base to explore Vegas and the rest of the strip, you either need to be prepared to take cabs or public transport, or wear extremely comfortable shoes! I'm not a fan of public transport (translate - I'm lazy), so we got a lot of cabs. I noticed it was quite a bit more expensive than the previous time I'd visited, eg $10 to the Fashion Show mall. All in all, I enjoyed staying at the Stratosphere, rooms are of a better standard than most UK hotels and there are plenty of cafes, restaurants and shops to keep you entertained. We paid a bargainous \u00a317 per night to stay here, so it's hardly suprising, but some of the guests (most notably those staying in the room next door to ours and across the hall) are...well, 'different' to the type of guests you'd find in some of the better, mid-strip hotels. We are returning to Vegas in a few weeks and this time will be staying at Caesars to avoid paying for loads of cabs.

We live in SoCal, so Vegas is kind of a regular trip for us. Usually, we stay on the Strip at the Bellagio or MGM. This time, with a specific reason for the trip, we chose the Stratosphere based on price and proximity to our jeweler. Neither of us had ever been to the Stratosphere, let alone stayed there. This was our first experience. On arrival, the self-parking was so easy and accessible. We checked in for our 3 night stay at about 11pm on a Wednesday night. We were upgraded from a standard room to a room on a higher level with a clear view of the Strip for about $20 more. Our room on the the 23rd Floor was nothing special, but the beds were comfy and the view was excellent. No mini-bar or fridge. Very old-school, tube TV with limited channels. But we weren't there for TV-watching. We gambled at the Stratosphere on the VERY LOOSE $1 slots and came away with more than $1000.00. Also, across the street and down a block, we played $1 blackjack at the Sahara and also won a good deal of money there as well. It's nice to NOT have to bet at least $25 a hand, even though we did that at a $1 table. We stayed at that table for no less than 6 hours on the first day and 8 the next. We walked back to the Stratosphere with more money in our pockets than we started with. The only bad thing about the Stratosphere was that there was no room service available during the time we stayed. That's a definite downer.

We arrived late (around 10pm) but even then had to wait half an hour to check in. When we finally got to a receptionist she advised that we had been upgraded. Having reserved a room with a king bed or 2 queens we werent quite sure what to expect. However, when we got to our room we discovered we had been allocated a dreadful room. It had a really odd layout; the lounge area was bigger than the sleeping area and the two were separated with a wall which blocked out most of the light from the one small window. To add insult to injury the bed was a standard double and they had left a pull out bed in the lounge area. We asked for the pull out to be moved immediately as it took up so much space and it was still there an hour later - when we called down to again we were told it would be in the next hour - this was at 11.35pm so we told them the next five minutes or not to bother - we were just on the point of moving it into the corridor ourselves some 20 minutes later when someone finally came to take it away. To top it all off we were right next to the lift shaft and, being Vegas, we could hear the lifts all night. We had gone straight downstairs to complain when we were first shown the room but received a none to helpful or friendly response - the long & short of it being they were full so we could put up and shut up and try again the next morning to see if we could be moved. When we asked what was \"upgrade\" about that particular room we were told it was the view. Our view from our less than big window was the car park. The following morning we went downstairs at 10pm to see if there was another room available (on the way we could see just how awful our room was compared to others which were much more spacious, had king or 2 queen beds and big picture windows) and were told this would be possible but that they could not give us the room number until 12 noon. We were only in Vegas for 4 days and frankly did not want to spend half a day waiting around in the hotel but seemingly had little choice so we went to the pool area. The staff there were just as indifferent to their guests and made no show of hiding their boredom. There was nothing attractive about the pool area - all flat hard concrete with nothing to soften the edges (no planting nothing, just sunbeds and the pool and very little shade with only a few umbrellas). On top of this they had R & B blaring from the speakers situated all around the pool - this was so loud that it drowned out my ipod. It was the straw that broke the camel's back and after 15 minutes i went down to research alternative accommodation on the internet. When we went to check out 1/2 an hour later the reception made it clear that they really couldnt have cared less. I've since written to the hotel to complain and not even received a response. The only plus point? The door staff - they were totally charming and polite - a complete contrast to the reception staff who really couldnt give a damn - they could certainly learn a few lessons from them.

The pool area is great, the choice of food places is great and you'll find that the prices are slightly cheaper than that of other hotels. This time I took my friend and to be honest we didn't mind the walk to the main part of the strip, as it allowed us to view other parts of the strip that you may not bother to go to when you have everything to hand with the hotels that are located centrally. There are shops close by and an internet cafe across the road. Taxis are cheap and not too far from this hotel there is a large shopping outlet, which you will need a taxi to get to. Since 2005 they have created a mono-rail, so if you don't want to take taxis and plan to do several stops on the strip this is a great way to travel. With the exchange rate falling, things are becoming slightly expensive, however still cheaper then the UK. A dinner buffet in most hotels will cost you aboout $22 p/p, however the Stratosphere does a meal deal where you can have a buffett breakfast, lunch and dinner for a set price and if you are a quest you do get a discount on the buffett prices. We spent a lot of time at the pool area during the day and the barman certainly kept us amused. The bar offers snack food which is great if you want a quick bite.

If you hang the do not disturb sign on your door they will call you that morning at about 1000 hrs to ask you when they can clean your room. YES, they will call between 10 o'clock and 11 o'clock to wake you up to ask when they can clean. There seems to be no designated cleaning time as they show up sometimes as late as 2 o'clock in the afternoon.

They never call under normal circumstances only if they check and realize they forgot something you asked for.

You can assume the cocktail waitresses and the bellmen have been burned numerous times before by the hood element/low roller contingent that permeates this hotel as they treat you like a suspect not a guest until you tip them.

We knew that it was at the far end of the strip and hadn't planned to walk around, but we were still a bit taken aback by the area. It looks like lot of construction was planned, started and then stopped. Some locals mentioned that we shouldn't walk around at night because it is on the edge of the \"bad part of time\". (I still don't know what that means !) I imagine that since there aren't a lot of people walking around, the area might be a bit deserted and therefore provide opportunities for street crime. In any case, the room rate included complimentary tower admission. It was an outstanding view, but pretty scary. Then, we went to watch the rides on the roof. I don't ride roller coasters and the thought of dangling over the edge on two of the rides was not something that was remotely interesting. It was actually sort of frightening and entertaining at the same time, in a sick kind of way. But, several people seemed to be enjoying themselves, so I guess that's all that matters ! From all of my research, I have come to the conclusion that most of the name casinos have cheap rates for really bad rooms. To try to avoid that, we paid an extra $5 to get a deluxe room. The Stratosphere has taken to adding a $7.50 resort fee, probably so that they can low-ball the room rate for comparison purposes and then make it up in the resort fee. At least they stated it in the reservation, so I expected it. In any case, we pai $28 plus the resort fee and tax, so my expectations were at the motel 6 level. And, that's exactly what we got ! The room had been recarpeted, repainted and the furniture updated. Therefore, it was clean and neat enough. There was a small table and two chairs; the table was rickety and I was afraid it would break apart, but it didn't, The bathroom was dated - the tiles were lie Home Depot construction grade, some sort of cultured marble vanity top and old fixtures. The towels were thin and coarse. Overall, we knew about the poor location relative to the Strip, had low expectations and paid a little more to at least be able to sleep in a decent room.

The bedding was very clean and extremly comfortable. Water pressure was a little low but it was in the morning. I gained 10 punds in 4 days. Great buffet. Great all you can eat tacos(real mexican tacos in the sports bar.) After checking in I did not leave the hotel/casino for 27 hours. It is right in the middle between the strip and downtown. Easy to get to both by bus or taxi. I took taxis. $8 to get to Ceasars if you take Industry road instead of the strip. Then get a Taxi at Imperial Palace to get back for next to nothing if they take the back street. A cabbie taught me this. The Casino was brightly lite and clean. The pool was open and great. There was a free full Gym but I did not get to use it. I would add some $3 dollar tables. I went downtown for that. Sometimes you just want to play for fun and not think about the bets. The property and parking structure had security on bikes with bright yellow shirts patrolling all day and night. I felt very safe walking around and leaving my car. I would keep Starbucks open 24 hours. They open at 5 am. Because of the time change I was up at 430 am. I asked Brain Jacobs where I could get a great cup of coffee.

My husband and I hit Vegas up every 6 months. This past July, we drove to Vegas from the east coast. We stopped over in Phoenix to see family, but our BIG destination was VEGAS! Everytime we come to Vegas, we always try to stay at the Stratosphere...(there's been 2 occasions we stayed elsewhere because PH was just a few bucks more per night...we do our gambling at Strat though!) We always stay in the premier tower and NEVER have any problems...we had adjoining rooms for 3 days with our teenagers and the window in their room was big enough to stand up in, not to mention the amazing view at night! I don't have a single complaint about this place. Housekeeping came by every day. Yeah, it's further down the strip..take the money you saved on the room and get rental car, take the duece or a cab...we chose to walk some days! Who wants to stay in a room when there's soooo much to see in Vegas?!? As far as safety is concerned, our vehicle stayed parked at the property the entire time. We went out to get things all hours of the night, and never felt threathened. There was almost always security patrolling the grounds..even on bicycles. No theft or damage to our vehicle or belongings. No need to feel unsafe :o) My teenagers loved the big shot and the observation deck. It was the very first thing they wanted to do when we checked in..they went up a second time at night before we left..what an amazing view!! The pool was nice..big towels were provided. We ate at Roxy's, Lucky's and a few breakfasts at McDonalds. We planned to eat at the Courtyard Buffett for one day, but the $20 all day deal is for players club members only. We called down before we went and they told us our kids could eat for the $20 per day as well..but that was untrue. They broke the too-good-to-be-true news to us when we went down there. My teenagers are so little, they wouldn't eat $20 worth of food in 2 days..so that wasn't too big a deal! Some of the shops were closed the past few times I was at the Strat. The casino has been one of the better ones to us. My hubby enjoys blackjack, while I'm a slot monkey. We always have a good time and there is never a shortage of cocktails if you TIP your waitress! All in all, the Stratosphere is middle of the road. It's not Planet Hollywood (Prostitute Hub) but it is safe, clean, comfortable and very affordable!

It's based in an extremely seedy area and there is a constant sense of danger. We counted 3 crime locations (based on the police tape) within 100 yards of the hotel entrance! It is also a 3 mile walk to the heart of the strip (The Bellagio, Caesars Palace etc.). Secondly, the smell is vile. As soon as we entred the casino/hotel lobby we both looked at each other as if to say \"do you get that smell too?\". When the elevator doors opened on our room floor, we both gagged at the smell that hit us. It's quite difficult to describe, but the best I can do is to say it smelt old and dingey.

It's by no means the biggest most expansive bad boy pool in Vegas, but if you are there to lay out in the sun and get wet every once in awhile, it's perfect.

I said to my fiance, \"I wonder if you could get married up here!\" There it started....the planning process! We decided we wanted to get married at the Top of the Stratosphere in Las Vegas! So we did...23 family and friends ended up joining us on May 26th, 2009 and I wouldn't have changed it for anything it was just as I had pictured it =D The view was incredible-we LOVED IT! and our guests definately had not only a wedding they would never forget, but also a trip they would remember for the rest of their lives =) I will now break down my review of the Stratosphere...it is kind of complicated..overall I give it 5 stars-I almost don't want to give it an average rating at all, because at times they went above and beyond for me. For example we had 23 guests and their small chapel only seats 20 people-they upgraded us to the larger chapel for FREE...which I thank them from the bottom of my heart for..I just can't imagine 3 of our guests having to stand after flying from Michigan to Las Vegas to attend our wedding-so that was sooooooo nice of the Stratosphere to do for us!!! When we first started the planning process it was all through email, when you live in another state and you are getting married in Las Vegas....you have to do EVERYTHING through email...you kind of hope for a speedy response..sometime I would get a response the next day, sometimes it would take a week or more! Sometimes if I really needed an answer I would go over my wedding coordinator, who wasn't getting back to me, and send an email to person in charge of Chapel in the Clouds, because she ALWAYS got back to me either the same day or the next day =D Sooooo emails were kind of a pain, but once I figured out that contacting the person in charge (Adel) worked quicker...I contacted her with most of my questions =) Our Minister, Richard was the NICEST guy EVER!!!! We couldn't have picked a better Minister if we tried-the minute we met him, I just loved him! He was great and calmed any nervous feelings we had. He performed a beautiful ceremony and even posed with my grandma and her Elvis shades (I'm a big Elvis fan so all my relatives put on Elvis sunglasses/sideburns at the end of the ceremony to surprise me haha) Richard was a complete sweetheart and I can't thank him enough for making our ceremony so perfect! I wish I would have remembered to give him a big hug at the end of the ceremony. Our Stratosphere Photographer-she had a chip on her shoulder from go, not sure if she just didn't want to be there for the whole whopping 30 minutes she was paid to be there or what, but she was rude and not very pleasant to work with. (I'm not saying it was necessary, but I mean how hard is it to be nice for 30 minutes on people's wedding day!) She wouldn't let any of our relatives take any pictures with flashes on, therefore nobody who took pictures besides her pictures really turned out in the chapel. We were then rushed out of the Chapel and up to the Stratosphere Observation Deck, which is fine cause we were going up there anyways and she took some more pictures, however she managed to get the \"No Smoking\" sign in most of our pictures. However, I will say any attitude she had didn't bring us down one bit...Richard (the minister) the gorgeous chapel, and THE VIEW of Las Vegas...completely made up for her =D The next day we went to view our pictures and pick the ones for our package (we were to get (1) 8x10 and (3) 4x6's with our package) each additional picture was priced ridiculously high for example (1) 4x6 was $10 each! YIKES...we bought 9 more...so it was $96 and some cents with tax! Anyways our 8x10 was a beautiful picture of us on the observation deck overlooking the strip...with the \"No Smoking\" sign next to us and I asked if they could please crop out the \"No Smoking\" sign because I can't see that hanging on our wall with the sign you know...LOL and the woman told me that she wasn't sure...WHAT?! I could crop that out easy with Photo shop myself! Give me a break..anyways she told me she thought they could after a few minutes of looking at it, but that it would have to be shipped to us and that would be an additional $15 for shipping and handeling! I asked when she thought that would get to us and she said probably within 4 to 6 WEEKS! I was stunned...since the picture was supposed to come with our package that we were being charged an EXTRA $15 and it would take 4-6 weeks to get it! Geesh....anything to make a buck I guess... I'm REALLY glad we did the Las Vegas Strip Photo Tour with Toner Photography though for our wedding pictures...we would have only had a couple professional pictures if we went with Stratosphere pictures alone.

If you want coffee while getting ready in the morning, you will need to bring your own. The hotels don't provide a coffee maker and if you want a small refigerator, it will cost you $10.00 a day. Had we known how far the hotel was from everything, we would have bought a 3-day Monorail pass. Would have been cheaper. You can take the Deuce (bus) up and down the strip, plus downtown, but it stops frequently. There is an Ihop between the Stratosphere and the Sahara if you want a cheaper breakfast. The Grand Lux Cafe in the Palazzo is a sister cafe to the Cheesecake Factory. There are a couple of good restaurants for lunch, in the Flamingo Hotel that are reasonable. Don't miss the Titanic Exhibit in the Luxor. It will be there for 9 more years. You will see artifacts that were brought up from the ocean floor. Saw the Beatles Love show at the Mirage, The Jersey Boys at the Palazzo and Lance Burton at the Montel Carlo. The Jersey Boys is the number one rated show and it was the best show I think I have ever seen. If you see anymore shows, save this one for the last because no other show will come close to being so good.

But like everyone else we were pleasently surprised. We arrived 2 hours late (thanks Virgin) mid afternoon no queue at rception so checked in straight away needless to say it then took us 10mins just to find the right elevators (un beknown to me we'd booked a premium tower room) which had seperate lifts. Our room 04-11-18 (dont ask bout the way the room numbers work cos i still dont know!) was big with a huge king size bed which I must say was the comfiest ive ever slept on. Bathroom was also nice and big with a long vanity shelf for all my slap! Large window which even tho we didn get a great view was stil nice to get some las vegas sunshine. Room cleaned daily some days it wasnt cleaned til mid afternoon but at least it was still cleaned. Used both the pool on floor 8 and also the 'european' pool on floor 24 both pools fine tho the euro pool on floor 24 was quite difficult to find and once we were there it was free for women but my fiance had to pay 10%, dont think he was too chuffed! bewarned if ur going to the pool to relaxe quietly then sunbathe elsewhere once it hits midday the music by the pool is pretty loud but u get used to it. People are right the casino was a bit grubby and it did smell a bit but then smokings not been banned there yet so think thats the only reason I noticed the smell. Didnt really eat in the hotel except for the buffett breakfast which was awesome an quite reasonable ($13 all u can eat) Mcdonalds and Starbucks in hotel too. The main bar in the middle of casino did all u can drink cocktails daily between 4pm-8pm for $20 which we thought was quite good until one of the bar staff got our drinks wrong an we had to fight just to get it changed- they were the only staff that wernt so helpfull everyone else were amazing. Had one night of luxury eating at the Top of the World restaurant (which revolves) at the top of the tower. This restaurant is very pricey but well worth it (we spent about $200 for 2 courses) the view and food is phenomenal (we ordered gigantic 14oz steak). if ur going make a reservation the first day u get there as its very popular. we requested a table by the window which even tho we were told it wasnt guaranteed we managed to get one which really made the night. As for the location which seems to cause some concern for many people, it is at the end of the strip and it is in a slightly run down area but there was never a time I felt unsafe or uneasy whilst walking to or from the strat hotel. As for homeless people or beggars i dont actually remember seeing that many of them and even the ones we did see didnt bother us at all. The monorail is about a block away its jus round the coner from the Sahara, the only thing I would say is that if ur going to use it go thru the sahara to get to it rather than round the back entrance i felt more uneasy there than i did newhere near the strat. however i found that even just walking to the monorail was tough work (it was 107degrees when we were away) so if id had to walk further down the strip i prob would have passed out so i suppose i can kinda c why the location bothers some. we found it easier jus to get the Duece bus which stops just round the corner from the strat an wa sonly $7 for 24hours and it stops at every hotel along the strip. Some days it does take longer to get down the strip depending on day of the week/ volume of pasengers but it was jus too hot for us to walk a great distance! I would definatly recommend the stratosphere hotel to people looking for doing Vegas on the cheap, this was our first time in Vegas and i think if we'd stayed in a more central hotel it would have been too overwhelming.it definatly broke us in gently lol. However saying that i think next time we'll stay in a more central/luxurious hotel (ive got my eye on the MGM Grand) but would definatly go back to the Stratosphere if we were going to be Las Vegas regulars! ha ha. If uv booked and are worried then please dont cos the strat's fine for what u need it for, its clean with easy access to the strip. I love vegas so much that even tho weve booked to go to the Maldives for our honeymoon next year im trying to persuade my H2B to book vegas instead! ;) Definatly do the Top of the World restauant its pricey but worth it Dont try an walk from the strat hotel unless ur going in the winter", "Date": "October 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "chicago,il", "Title": "\u201cwould stay there again\u201d", "Author": "hayden23911", "ReviewID": "UR46583594", "Content": "The hotel itself was clean and had good service.

My friend and his wife recently booked a 10 night stay at the Stratosphere based on my recommendation and, after doing so, were somewhat perturbed by some of the reviews on the Trip Advisor Website. The number of negative reviews represents a fractional proportion of the vast number of guests who have stayed at this hotel and have had a very positive experience which includes my wife and myself on two separate visits and latterly a third visit with extended family. These visits were in March, 2007 (4 nights), June, 2007 (7 nights) and October, 2008 (8 nights). The hotel represents great value for money. The rooms were spacious, clean and comfortable. There is a choice of restaurants/diners within the hotel and in particular The Courtyard Buffet which caters for breakfast, lunch and dinner and offers a wide choice of dishes to suit every taste and is very reasonably priced. The Champagne Brunch on a Sunday is not to be missed. You have immediate access to the Stratosphere Tower with its panoramic views of Las Vegas and The Strip in addition to the three \"white knuckle\" rides at the top of the tower - not for the faint-hearted. The location of the hotel is at the North end of The Strip but did not present any problem at all. The \"Deuce\" bus stops immediately outside the hotel and will take you up The Strip or alternatively to Downtown Las Vegas and Fremont Street. The light show at Fremont Street is not to be missed. You can buy two types of ticket on the bus - a one way ticket or a 24 hour pass. During our visit the one way ticket was $2 and the 24 hour pass was $5 although this will possibly have increased now. If you are moving up and down The Strip or to Fremont Street, the 24 hour pass is the one to buy. A big plus as regards the location of The Stratosphere is that you will not have a problem boarding the bus outside the hotel. As the run up The Strip progesses the bus gets busier and busier and if you were staying in a hotel in the centre of The Strip, boarding the bus is not so easy. The hotel has an open swimming pool which was fine but we only used this for an hour on one of our visits. If it is your intention to sit around at a swimmimg pool then Las Vegas is not the place for you. There is so much to see and do. Sitting around at a pool seems to defeat the purpose of coming to Las Vegas.

The service staff were wonderful. Everyone was friendly, helpful and courtious......from the staff at the check-in desk, to the bell hop, to the waitstaff, to the guy who gets your taxi......we have no complaints. They spent the time to explain the layout of the hotel, where we could find everything, what promotions were available, how to use the rewards card, etc. The room was very nice. Nothing elaborate, but clean and fresh. The bathrooms were very roomy with a lot of counter space (ladies!!) and the shower was wonderful. The buffet was reasonable, a nice selection of dishes, and the wait staff were always available. We didn't get to the italian restaurant but heard that it was very nice. The pool was a nice size and not overly crowded. There were always chairs available. There is no shade, however, unless you're lucky enough to get loungers with an umbrella, but who wants shade at a pool anyhow?! The casino floor was easy to navigate, and there was a nice selection of slot machines, tables for black jack, rouellette, etc. We went up to the top of the tower at night and the view was great! It 's free if you're staying there at the stratosphere. We went downtown one night, it only cost about $8 by taxi, and it was a lot of fun. The stratosphere is a bit out of the way being at the north end of the strip but if you're not looking for all that hustle and bustle everyday, it's worth it to stay there and spend a bit of money for monorail ride or the bus or even a taxi to take you to the strip if you want to go.

Our room was on the 16th floor, bedroom plus lounge and fridge, with 2 windows overlooking the mountains, and that cost us an extra $200 for 9 nights, which I thought was very good, room very clean and maid came every day, we could not have been more pleased. We opted for the $19.99 all day buffet most days at hotel, and I must say the choice was endless, breakfast excellent, mid-day excellent, evening meal excellent and had an excellent carvery, with different cuts of roast beef, and turkey, what more could you ask for the money. The hotel is away from the main strip, but we opted for the Deuce bus, though a bit slow, for $7, you get 24 hour pass to ride on or off as many times as you like. And the bus stop is just outside the hotel. I would say the only down side to the hotel is the location, it is not in the best of areas, ok during the day, but be careful at night, there are some undesirables about. But it is nice to get away from the main strip, from all the crowds, and that is what you get staying at the Stratosphere for the money you pay it is could value, we know its not a five star hotel but its better than the hotels near by, Sahara and the Circus.

When we asked her what the difference between the two rooms were she told us the romance comes with an open tub to the living area and the star suite did not. We were in Vegas for our one year wedding anniversary so the open jacuzzi tub was our selling point on booking this suite. After explaining this to the lady, she went to speak with her manager and about ten minutes later comes back and tells us we are going to get a romance suite after all. GOOD. We were charged a $7.50 resort fee daily during our stay here, yet this place is nothing spectacular. We stayed on the 12th floor and had a view of the rooftop of the 11th floor. The carpeting in the hallways is old, and all bunched up in areas. The windows in the rooms do not open so you can not get any fresh air into your room. Our room was a large size but nothing spectacular. This is the only suite I have ever stayed in that came with plastic wrapped plastic cups! No glasses at all. The tub is seperated from the shower which was expected, but what was not expected was the mold inside and on the sides of both. Absolutely disgusting. My husband and I didn't even use the tub the entire stay because if there is mold all over it, it couldn't be very clean. The wall connected to the shower had been molding and rotting away to where there was a hole forming on side where the wall paper and dry wall were missing. The only good thing about this place was the room service. It was quick and not very expensive but my food arrived to my room nice and hot and tasted good. The location of this place is horrible as well. They fail to mention you are about a 2 mile hike to the general fun parts of the strip, be prepared to drive or catch the deuce if you plan on staying here and seeing the strip. It is across the street from Fun City Motel. Very classy! I've stayed at suites all over in Las Vegas and would recommend any of them compared to this Craposphere. For the $400 you will pay for a weekend here at the Stratosphere, you can book a nicer, cleaner, more conveniently located suite at either Palms Place, or The Signature Suites at the MGM.

The price is very good as well. The restaurants / food options at this hotel are better and cheaper than Treasure Island I've stayed at. There are couple of things everyone should be aware of: 1) Location: it is a little bit far from the strip. If you don't mind taking the deuce, it should not be too costly to get to the strip. 2) Booking surcharge: when I checked in, they told me that there is an additional $7 daily surcharge for using the gym and the swimming pool. I know that Treasure Island also charge a surcharge to use these facilities. However, Treasure Island DID NOT force people to pay this, whereas the surcharge at Stratosphere is obligatory. On the other hand, there is a very nice outdoor swimming pool that is available at the hotel. Overall, I might not stay at Stratosphere again.

Our room was comfy and clean. Our view was of the parking lot (which we could hear clearly car alarms going off). We were on the 14th floor. Again for the price, not too bad. We did not gamble in the Casino, but it was never smokey or loud. We didn't have to walk all the way through the casino to get to the elevator, which was nice. The bathroom was sort of remodeled. The tile around the tub looked new, but the faucet was original. The counter was Corian and plenty of space, but the flooring was original. We got body lotion, shower gel, hand soap, shampoo and conditioner, all of which smelled great. The parking was adequate and free. No problem finding a spot near the parking elevator. Check in was fast and service friendly. Elevators plenty and quick. Good signage throughout. There were cute shops and eating establishments (McDonalds) on the 2nd floor.

The check in this time was much quicker then any of our previous visits (which is a good improvement as we have waited up to 45 minutes before). We booked an NWA world vacations room with our airfare (worked out to about $25 per night + the resort fee charged for the two night stay of $7.50 per night). Cheap accomodations. We were give some sort of an upgrade as we ended up in a mini suite with a separate sitting area in a regular size hotel room - divider wall - was a nice room, clean with two tv's and a fridge. It was clean and comfortable as we have come to expect here. Great value The pool area is now much nicer then the adequate pool area from last visit. They have spent some money on new surroundings and chairs and it shows. Enjoyable simple pool area. As my title suggests though - the rest of the resort - from the casino to public areas is slipping a bit and showing signs of age. The casino itself is much less fun then before wtih many of our favourite games missing - it is much more sparsely filled with video poker / slots then last visit - although we did like new 'video blackjack' game where 6 or 7 people sit around big screen to play real rules blackjack. Washrooms, tower area, common areas are all starting to age and less clean (especially washrooms) then last visit. Fortunately we found cocktail service to be as good as before (one reason we come here) - way better then other strip hotels and almost as good as outlying hotels and downtown hotels. Good visit - recommend for cheap, comfortable accomodations. TIP: If you are gambling at the stratosphere - use your points / comps at Arizona Charlies - owned by same group but the comps go a lot further at other locations - free breakfast most days from gambling the night before on our way out to see the town - decatur or boulder depending on which direction you are going.

I unfortunately had one that took over 3 hrs and my clothes were still damp even after being on the hottest setting. The other thing I felt the hotel lacked was shade at the pool.

We chose a TOWER PREMIER room, which was situated on the 21st floor with a view of the Strip. We were more than pleased by the room itself : it was very clean, well decorated, with a big bathroom... We paid a little price for our stay at this hotel and the room was over our expectations. The SERVICE was the major positive point of this hotel : everyone is smiling, caring, and making sure that you are satisfied. The room was cleaned perfectly and different personnal touches were left in the room every day (extra towels, extra lotions or shampoos, extra pillows...). The concierge desk is useful, with competent employees that will help you no matter what you're looking for. We also ordered room service a couple times and the food was always excellent, the service amazing and quick, and they even called 15 minutes after the delivery to make sure our order was OK. The menu is available 24hours and there is plenty of choice, from sandwiches to more elaborate meals like Dijon salmon in pecan crust or a 12 oz T-Bone. If you feel like having a cozy and relax evening in your room, trust the room service for your meal, you won't regret it. The VALET PARKING is just the best thing. Every hotel in Vegas offers free valet parking. But at the Strat, we were served by nice and competent employees, ready to give us information about the city or directions. It is well worth the tip. The casino is less crowded than at the other resorts, it is not smoky at all and big enough to please anyone. It is not as glamourous as the Bellagio's casino, but hey : at least you're not walking on the feet of a bunch of tourist that only came to your resort to visit it. As in many casinos, the drinks are free, as long as you're playing... We went to the Top Of The World restaurant and enjoyed a nice dinner with a splandid view of the Strip. It is a bit pricy but you expect that from a classy restaurant. Try the Duck Ravioli with the Foie Gras : it's EXCELLENT ! We also accessed to the Tower's observation deck and did the rides (BigShot and X Scream). There was no waiting for the rides and they are a thrill of a lifetime ; don't miss that. Some people say that the Strat is far from everything : that's not true. It is at the north end of the Strip, so yes, if you don't have a car you will walk a lot to get to the south end. But we kind of enjoyed being a couple blocks away from the noisy, crowded, traffic jammed mid-Strip at night time. We rented a car so it was not a problem. And even if you don't have a car, there are a couple of monorails (some free, some expensive), there is plenty of taxis and also buses... You're never out of options. In other words, is we ever go back to Vegas (which is almost certain), it is sure that we won't hesitate to book at the Stratosphere. We visited the Bellagio, the Wynn, the Mandalay Bay... They are gorgeous, but you have to manage yourself through the lobby surrounded by hundreds of tourists in their flip-flops taking pictures at every step... I wouldn't pay that much money for a luxury resort in Las Vegas. They are just TOO crowded and you won't enjoy the things you paid for.

Make sure you take using your room key to the best advantage because you can get to the top of the tower to watch the rides for free, others have to pay a fee and also the gym is pretty neat. The only downfall to this hotel is where it is based for some people, you have to walk a little to get on the strip. Not that i mind this, but my feet did at the end of my trip with all of their blisters. The monorail is very good in Vegas but it's a shame that it only go's so far, if it done the full route of the duece my feet would not have suffered so bad.

To start with the hotel: you can't avoid crossing the (enormous) casino floor to get to the restaurants, the tower, the shops etc. It's smoky and seedy (grim-faced loners playing the machines with all their luggage next to them....) If the kids so much as stopped for a second to look at the roulette table as we crossed the floor to have breakfast, we were pounced on by the security guards and told to keep moving. The 'family' pool area has practically no shade, in temps over 95, and again, when we went within 10 yards of the bar to order food, we were barked at by the barman. The major Strip hotels (Forum, Circus Circus, Bellagio etc) are amazing to see. But overall, I found the extravagance depressing, and the atmosphere totally un-family friendly.

The hotel was great for what you paid. The rooms were large, and very clean and very comfortable beds. I guess they remodelled the rooms in 2005 and 2006. The staff was quite accomodating. I booked a deluxe room and got two queen beds. The difference between the deluxe (I was on the 8th floor) and the premier room is that the premier room is on the higher floors with a view of the mountains and the strip. But if you have unlimited access to the Tower why do you need a view from your room then? The only drawback may be that you have to walk about five minutes to the monorail (which is in the Sahara Hotel). I highly recommend you take the monorail if you stay at the Stratosphere. I purchased a three day pass for $30.00 The neighbourhood itself is not that great and there are some broken beer bottles on the street and some homeless people that may or may not harass you. Although I felt a bit uneasy taking the monorail back on my own and the thought of having to walk back yourself, I did not have a single problem as a solo traveller during my stay at there.

If they wanted a 5* Hotel in the middle of the strip...that\u2019s what they should have booked! We saved a substantial amount of money over the fortnight compared to the prices of the central strip hotels. It was our first time in Vegas so we had nothing to compare it to, but we couldn't fault the hotel...it is what it is...a 3 star hotel, not trying to be anything its not. From check in to check out, every staff member we spoke to was friendly, attentive and nothing was too much for them. I'm sure the tipping made a difference but you all know how it works in the hospitality industry! Our room was very clean, housekeeping were always present around the hotel throughout the day and if you left a DND sign on the door in the morning, they would leave a voicemail for you to call them when you were ready for the room to be serviced. The pool area was great, complimentary towels and always plenty of sunloungers no matter what time you went out. Fair enough there weren't any designated swimming lanes BUT...your on holiday not practising for the Olympics!! The staff were great around the pool and the food was really good. They have a great choice of restaurants, we ate in Fellini's, the food and service was perfect. We also had food in the Top of the Tower restaurant, we had lunch instead of dinner because it was half the price, the food was nice but still expensive. It's worth going there though for the experience of being in a revolving restaurant 800 feet high. We didn't have chance to eat in Roxy's because the queues were always too long..which speaks for itself! Very popular. The observation deck is free and unlimited for hotel residents, definately the best view of Vegas. The rides are not free; they are $15 for each ride. When we checked in we were given $5 free slot play each which was a nice touch and from that we won $23 between us. We watched 'American Superstars' in the hotel which is half price for hotel residents. The show was a lot of fun and great value for money at only $19.99 each. The hotel is a fair walk from the strip but its definately worth doing it at least once to take everything in. We didn't use the Monorail, just the Deuce bus service which has a stop right outside the Casino side entrance. At $7 for a 24hr access pass it is definately worth the money and we used it almost every day. We never waited longer than 15 minutes for a bus and the drivers are very entertaining to! The Fremont Experience is close to the hotel and you can get the Deuce there aswell. Only advice is to avoid the Deuce if your in a rush to get somewhere. We decided to get a cab to and from the airport so we didn't have to make any stops or changes, it cost us $40 the day we arrived because of roadworks but only $20 on the journey back to the airport. The only negative comment I can make is that we were approached a few times for spare change when we walked to the general store. As long as you\u2019re polite and stern, they just thank you for acknowledging them and leave you alone. However, this is no reflection on the hotel just the area it is in. We hope this review helps you if your planning to stay at the Stratosphere, you can still go and see all the other more expensive hotels, you just know when you put your head down after a long day...your still in Vegas and paying a lot less than everyone else for the same experience! To put the money we saved into perspective, we were able to watch David Copperfield, Jay Z, American Superstars, KA Cirque Du Soleil and go to the Grand Canyon!!!...not a bad sacrifice for staying in a 'supposedly budget' hotel ;)", "Date": "August 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newcastle NSW", "Title": "\u201cTop Of The World - Top of the Strip\u201d", "Author": "biggles81", "ReviewID": "UR37349888", "Content": "Stratosphere is located at old end of town closer to Downtown, and the old end of Vegas.

We have both been to Vegas numerous times so the location was not an issue for us. We got an incredible deal through Allegiant Air which we couldn't pass up, so decided to go for it and take a chance. We arrived at the hotel at around 1:00 in the afternoon, check-in went smooth and there was not a long wait. The check-in clerk was very nice, took extra time to go over the different rooms they had available. Hubby and I decided to upgrade to a Player's Club Room which only cost us an extra $15 per day. It had a brand new mattress, new bedding, updated decor and fridge. Our room was exceptionally clean (my only real \"must have\" in a hotel). Granted the room was not overly fancy by any means, but it was spacious, comfortable and clean (can you tell I like clean rooms?) In fact the entire hotel was incredibly clean. I was always seeing staff sweeping, dusting or vacuuming. Overall the hotel itself is modern and I did not get the sense of it being run down in anyway. Of course there was some wear & tear here and there but with the amount of people in and out of these mega hotels there surely would be! After getting settled we took a tour around the casino/hotel area in order to get familiar with our surroundings. It has four restaurants (Back Alley Bar and Grill, Fellini's, Roxy's Diner and Lucky's Cafe) a Starbucks and the buffet on the casino level and a McDonalds, Mexican restaurant, Ben & Jerry's, Fat Tuesdays, a Weitzel's Pretzel place and Chicago Style hot dog restaurant on the upper level. Also, there is the Top of the World restaurant high up in the tower. We ate at Roxy's Diner which had excellent food, great service and decent prices. The waiters and waitresses sing 50's & 60's songs which was a lot of fun! My husband acquired a new crush on Gidget, one of the waitresses at the diner. She sat next to him and sang a bit of a song while we ate! Too cute! We also ate at Lucky's Cafe which was also very good, great portion sizes, the prices weren't too bad and the food was great. We also tried the buffet one day and did the $19.99 All You Can Eat-All Day Long deal. It is a great deal that is for sure but we found that we over ate the entire day and didn't want to come home with an extra 10 pounds to lose! Overall, it was an okay buffet. The food was just so-so, however, they did have a great selection of different dishes so there is something there for everyone. We also ate at the Mexican restaurant upstairs. It was good as well, not the best mexican I have had but the prices were also decent and we received huge portions. Our main goal was to relax by the pool during the day and work on our tans. The main pool is on the 8th floor and has awesome views of the surrounding mountain ranges. We were always able to find a lounger, they have a vast amount of them surrounding the pool area. There is not a lot of shade to be found and there are only a handful of umbrellas for people to use for shade, so my advice would be to get there by 9:00 am if you want to secure an umbrella for the day. The pool area also have cabana's for rent as well. Monday-Thursday an all day rental is $50 and Friday-Sunday is $125. The cabanas were basic but they did have a mini fridge stocked with bottle water, a flat screen tv, two loungers, and free rental of the pool loungers. We did not rent a cabana because we were always able to find a quiet corner of the deck and an umbrella to use. The adult only pool is on the 25th floor. You must be 21 or older to go into that pool area because it is a European style pool (topless sunbathing). We decided to go check it out one day and we both just loved it. It became our hang out of choice! It was much quieter and had a more mature vibe to it. We especially liked it because there were no screaming kids! Pure bliss! The view from the 25th floor was amazing as well. The service was excellent as the bar tender got to know everyone at the pool because there were not very many of us. Great service by the pool attendant as well. When you arrive he asks you where you would like to sit, he takes the towels over to your seats, sets everything up for you and makes sure you are comfortable. Nice touch! The location of the hotel itself has some good points and bad points. If you are going to Vegas for your first or even second time, I would not stay here. I say this because it is at the very end of the strip and getting to the strip takes a long time. If you have the money in your budget to take a cab to and from the strip then it would be okay but if you are on a budget and will be taking The Deuce or are wanting to walk, think again. Hubby and I didn't mind it at all, grabbing The Deuce and just watching the sights as we made our way down to the strip was just fine. We have seen all the hotels and been to the majority of the attractions, so we were in no rush to be anywhere at any given time. The good thing about being at that end of the strip is you are sort of half way between the strip and Fremont Street, so catching the bus to either area was really easy and convenient. You are also over half way to one of the outlet malls as well, which was a very short bus ride from the hotel itself. One other thing we noticed was that because we were way off the strip, we could walk out of our hotel and walk down to the convenience store to grab munchies and alcohol without being stuck in massive crowds walking up/down the strip. It was a quiet area and everything we needed was right there - internet cafe, convenience stores, bus stops, Denny's, IHOP etc...very handy!! In the end, we both had a great time and achieved what we wanted from the vacation. We would not hesitate to stay at The Stratosphere again.

Stay away from this side of the strip, very bad vibes, very shady people everywhere... Do not let money fall out of your pocket, you will get ROBBED!!!

Check In was easy and room is always clean and well furnished. The rooms are not large but your average hotel room. Casino has a large variety of games and slots. Including my favorite Elvis .25cent (PLAY ELVIS). Casino is know for having loose slots. I would say that in general my luck here is better than most on the strip. Casino has a nice food court as well as a few restaurants. I have only tried JJ Rockets but thats a good time as the wait staff sings to you. The TOWER is definetely worth a trip. You can spend as much time as you want on the observation deck and there is The Tallest Starbucks in the world on top. Not to mention the three rides on top which are all fun. Drink service is pretty good usually dont have to wait long for a drink in the casino. Only complaint would be the PLAYERS CLUB personel. They are like zombies with absolutely NO PERSONALITY. Also dont get swayed into believing therir coupon book is worth 150 dollars in comps as a reason to stay here. They are filled with junk for the most part. If you can get past the rude players club people then your stay should be pleasant. LOCATION. Im not bothered by the location here because last time I was attending a tradeshow at the convention center and Stratosphere is pretty close to that. Not to mention between downtown and main part of strip. Better rent a car if you stay here though coz TAXI's will be expensive.

Having read the reviews we were worried especially after we had just done a cruise for a week. (we are on a round the world trip at the end) so we feel we are quite the experts when it comes to reviewing hotels!!! The room we had was lovely.21st floor. Huge, 2 queen beds clean and well maintained every day with fresh towels etc etc. No smoke smells and it was spotless. Only small window but great view of the mountains. No complaints at all and far better than we had read on trip advisor. The pool on the 8th floor is excellant and has a huge sunbathing area with loads of sunbeds. We love the sun so this was perfect for us. It doesnt get too busy (it was too hot!) the service is good from the bar staff. Our biggest complaint is the loud music played everyday and repeated everyday too. We dont mind music but not the same songs day in day out and blasting in your ear all day. Perhaps they could have a quiet 3 hours in the afternoon so it pleases everyone!?? This seems to be a regular complaint by all on trip advisor. Come on Stratosphere time to act on your guests feedback!!!! There is also an adults only pool on the 25th floor but we didnt use that it looked too crowded in for us. The restaurant buffet that is $19.99 all day is excellant in our opinion. There was a huge variety everyday and if you cant find something you like there is something wrong!! Considering the prices to eat on the strip this was a bargain and offered healthy food instead of burgers and fries. They do have that too tho in Roxy's diner! The casino was huge and not smokey in our opinion as reported. We dont smoke and didnt notice any problems with this. We went up the tower several times as it was free. Best views up there and to top it all when you get your tickets to go up the tower you get some good vouchers to use for e.g 2 for 1 on cocktails at C bar in the casino. Or buy one draft beer get one free in back alley bar. They all add up to saving money. Plus the voucher booklet they give you on check in is good too. Dont ignore it! The rides had to be seen to be believed! There is an adequate gym in the shopping area. I gather it has been moved from the pool area. Well airconditioned and has towels and water. Yes the hotel is at the end of the strip but that is well highlighted by the reviews and website so it shouldnt be a shock to anyone booking this hotel! it just means a short walk to the Sahara to catch the monroail or the bus runs up and down the strip for 3 dollars each. The monorail is 5 dollars one way so can work out quite expensive. We walked the strip more often than not as you see more. We saw the hotel show American Superstars and Michael Jackson was fantastic. Very strange to see him and then meet him. Excellant double moves and looks wise. The area next to the hotel is a little dodgy but that is no different to anywhere in the world and as always you need to stay on your guard and be observant. There are lots of homeless asking you for money but all the ones we encountered were very polite. The launderette on the 6th floor is great and good that it is free but gets busy and in all honesty for the size of the hotel there should be 2 or 3 of them. Especially when washers break down, although mainetenance were very good and got the company in to sort them out. Internet is $11.99 for 24 hours which is steep in my opinion but we needed it. The hotel does get busier at weekends and there are more queues everywhere but that is to be expected. Talking of queues we had no problems checking in at all. There were 8 staff checking in and they were excellant and helpful. All in all we have had a fantastic time here as it was our first visit to vegas and the Stratosphere was everything we wanted. Dont be put off by the other reviews just book the hotel and keep an open mind. We did and we are very pleased with outcome.

Many complain about the location but I personally thought it was a great location. Although it's the Northern most hotel on the Strip, it is only a 5 minute walk to the Sahara where you can catch the monorail to the main part of the Strip. And then when you fancy going downtown to Fremont Street (a must) it is only a short taxi or bus journey. Overall the service was ok, it varied from place to place within the hotel. The check in staff were nice and polite and helpful. Room service were quick and also polite. The staff in the gift shops were very helpful and always had a smile for you. The only two minor irks were a couple of waitresses in Lucky's were rather rude and the drinks ladies that come and bring you drinks when you're gambling were few and far between. The beds were made most days and clean towels were provided. We were in Tower 2 and had great views of the mountains, especially beautiful when the sun was going down. Most of our time during the day was spent lazing by the huge pool on the 8th floor. There were plenty of beds and a bar for when thirsty. During the evenings we ate at one of the restaurants in the hotel. Lucky's was nice, great selection of food, but as I said before, the service wasn't always up to scratch. Also, if you are in a party of more than 8 they automatically add 18% tip to the final bill, which is fine if you receive good service, which in some cases we did not! So we tended to split into groups of 6 and tip according to the service recieved as it was hit and miss. We also ate in the 50s style Roxy's Diner. It was always very busy as the service was excellent, the entertainment was good fun and the food was great. There was also the shops on the retail floor where you could pick up McDonalds, pizza, Mexican and all other kinds of take away. We never went hungry! The casino was ok, plenty of machines and tables to choose from. Played every day and never really won much but never really lost much either. The C-bar was nice to chill out in away from the machines if you just fancy a drink. The tower was brilliant. Amazing views. Plus it's free to go up there if you are staying in the hotel. I recommend going up there during the early evening and watching the sun gradually slip behind the mountains and at night when the Strip and downtown are lit up. Beautiful! We also went to see the American Superstars show, half price as we were staying at the hotel. It was good, Rod Stewart and Christina Aguilera had pulled out the night we went so a couple of the performers we didn't really know but Michael Jackson and Elvis more than made up for it. The rides at the top of the tower are fun, although I just watched, was too chicken to actually go on them! But you can go out onto the observation deck and stand in a lovely warm breeze while everyone else gets scared half to death. I would definitely go back to the Stratosphere.

I find a shuttle that is going to the Stratosphere, hire it to take me and my girlfriend and they take the luggage load it up, and once we get to the hotel the bell hop takes over.

We had a rental car and parking was easy. I definately recommend the Premier Tower rooms-access to the garage is quick, Starbucks is right at the elevators, and also access to the shopping level is easy.

And the parking was great... very convenient and only a short walk to the inside of the hotel. The price was quite good, but with the price, we got what we paid for too.

I arrived just before midnight so check-in was very quick. Parking was easy in the self park and not as far away as some other casinos. I arrived and drove straight down to catch the last Fremont St Experience show of the night, this was good - a very laid back vibe (the bar at Golden Nugget looked like fun). As it was quite late I found food options limited (true of everywhere in Vegas though) and ended up getting McDonalds. I stayed in a standard room (didn't pay extra for the premium tower), and I thought room was very good. 2 queen beds which were very comfortable. Room was on the far side of casino and seviced by seperate elevators, just FYI as this wasn't a problem for me. Everything was clean and worked, bathroom also (hairdryer provided). I breifly went to the pool (adults only) on level 25, not particualrly fancy but good for some sunshine and relaxation. They did play rather loud music though which, at 10am, was a little much. This pool is optional topless (men have to pay an entry fee), there is another pool on level 8 for families. Stratosphere is located right at the North end of The Strip, if you're aware of this you can plan accordingly - I stayed one night here, and spent it at Fremont St - then spent 2 nights in the centre of the Strip.

Just before that I had read a review on this webpage about an armed robbery at the Circus Circus Annex (motel-style buildings behind the CC towers). I had to cancel my existing reservation at the CC Annex. The Stratosphere is a really nice place; our room on the 11th floor in the Premier tower was clean and elegant. The 2 beds were set up higher than normal (a plus for us taller people) and the comfort level for sleeping on these beds was top-notch. The pool on the 8th floor was clean and refreshingly cool. We were there at 8 AM, quiet and not crowded, but the sun was already high and intense...over 100 degrees. Hotel check-in and check-out was a breeze, the staff there were pleasant and helpful. We enjoyed several buffet meals there, at 25% off for adult hotel guests. You can have the all-day buffet special at $20. Now I read the recent review stating the $5.99 breakfast special at Lucky's (?) Restaurant - wish I had known that earlier. At any rate the buffet had a good selection of all kinds of food items. The only letdown was that the pineapple chunks in the fruitbowl tasted not the freshest. The northbound bus stop along the Strip is easily visible from the hotel entrance, but the southbound bus stop is kinda hidden, you need to walk north about 200 feet to get to it. Not a big issue. It is advised to get the RTC bus system pass. We each had the 3-day pass at $15 each. (otherwise, one trip on the Strip bus will cost $3 for adult) Stratosphere hotel guests have unlimited access to the 2 levels (one is open air) of the Tower observation deck at 108 & 109th floors. Access until 1 AM. Shops on the 2nd floor were interesting...the area had a Parisian/Eiffel Tower atmosphere.

We enjoyed our stay and would have stayed with them for the full 10 days that we were in Vegas, but unfortunately we found the pool area far too noisy, I agree that Vegas is a 24 hour city, but flying from London UK (13 hours in total) sometimes you just want to rest by the pool!

We arrived mid May for several week tour of the west by rental car, and this was the first leg of our journey. At the end of our several week trip, we stayed here again before flying home. The first room we had was ok, nice, clean, comfy, but the a/c in the room was this tiny 12 inch by 12 inch vent or smaller......in the wall that took forever to try to cool you down, and it only goes down to 68 degrees (and trust me it never reached that low whatsoever). I didn't sleep well that night, it was hot and stuffy in the room and having allergies/sinus just made it even worse. In playing the slots, we had lost our money quickly as the slots are definitely not loose like they were when we stayed here last summer. They were just eating up the money in a heartbeat!! So we opted to do other things in town and enjoy the Strip by bus. The staff here at the hotel is really super, they really go out of their way and are genuinely friendly kind people. They always are! Our room was nice, although the second room we had, which we used our points from our players club card to upgrade to a nicer room (and the air did work much better I must say!) the room was a little in need of some room cleaning tlc with some mold in the bathroom in several places including the tub/shower. We ate at the diner inside the hotel just outside of the casino area, the service was slow and the food was ok, nothing fancy. It was the diner that's styled like the 50's, I can't think of the name of it right now. Locally we caught the Deuce bus (24 hr. pass is only $7 per person!) right outside the hotel, down away a bit from the cab area at the posted bus stop sign. It was a long ride uptown at night, but worth the savings. If you're in a hurry take a cab, the bus stops at every other hotel it seems and if you don't have the time or patience, this is not for you! We had great service from all the bell personnel we met, from check in (FAST!!!) to checkout!!! Great people to greet you and take care of your luggage, and they were fast bringing it up even when they were really busy the second time we visited.

Even the smoker in our group was put off by the smell. It was one of our group's first time to Vegas and I was so embarassed having been the one who picked the hotel.

After seeing the other hotels accomodation, we most definatlly got the better choice. stayed in a premium king room and had an excellent view of the mountains from our room. the bed was very big and very comfortable, air conditioning worked a treat, and bathroom was huge. rooms are cleaned daily and toiletries included, also replaced daily. The pool on the 8th floor is large and spotlessly clean. plenty of sun loungers to be had, and even the drinks from pool bar are affordable. There is music played all day at the poolside, and is great if you are VERY into R&B, and dont mind listening to the same CD being played constantly for a week!! The strat has a happy hour in the C bar from 4pm-8pm daily, (whoever, this only includes beer, martini and marguerita), but for a cost of $19.99 per person, its a bargain, as alcohol prices are extortionate along the whole strip ( average cost of a beer is $8.00), then add tip!!. We found the hotels buffet to be a good option for meals. an all day ticket costs $19.00, and the range of food is excellent. The strat is at the very end of the strip, which means a VERY LONG WALK to see the other attractions, or an all day bus pass costing $7.00, lasts for 24hrs, but has much needed air conditioning. Be warned tho, it takes a good hour to get the full length of the strip, due to traffic and red lights. A must is a visit to freemantle street in downtown las vegas, prepare to be amazed!. A taxi from the strat costs about $10.00. one last tip (as this whole resort is 1 huge tipping culture) , BEWARE OF AIRPORT TAXI DRIVERS.. an airport run should cost $20. on arrival to las vegas, we were charged $35 as the driver went the long way round onto strip (there is a direct route as we later found out).

Was a really great deal! Like most people state, the hotel is on the far end of the strip, but that did not prove to be a problem. We rode the monorail and the deuce bus to get around. The hotel is really close to the Fremont Street Experience, only a 2 miles away. When we first arrived, it was about noon, and check in is not supposed to be until 3 pm. They allowed us to check in early, no problem, and there was only a couple of people in line to check in when we arrived. I requested a room on the highest floor available, and they accomodated me on that, was on the top floor. The room was clean, we had a great view of the mountains. I didn't pay the extra $$ to get a view of the strip. Immediately the housekeeper made us feel welcome, very friendly lady. The room size is pretty normal compared to other hotels I've stayed in, and the decor was really nice. Beds were really confortable. There's is plenty to do in the hotel itself. There's plenty of restaurants to choose from, and even a McDonald's for a cheap or late night snack. A Starbucks in the casino. We went and saw the 2 shows they have available at the hotel, American Superstars and Bite. Loved both shows, the impersonators were absolutely amazing. I especially enjoyed Michael Jackson. And the other show, Bite, awesome show. The coreography, the music, loved it. And after each show, you have the opportunity to take pictures with the cast. And the best part is that by staying at the hotel, you get tickets for these shows at half price, which is buy one get one free, so it is a really great deal, 20 bucks per person, you can't beat that. As far as location goes, this hotel is not on the main part of the strip, but that's not to say that's a bad thing. There is easy access to transportation right by the hotel, whether it be the monorail, the deuce bus, or if you prefer, there are plenty of cabs waiting in front of the hotel. Right nearby within walking distance is a Denny's and an IHOP for those of you who like breakfast anytime of the day. I felt pretty comfortable with the location of the hotel. I would advise any of you who do decide to take the monorail, access it through the Sahara Hotel, there's a connection there. Rather than going the back streets which does seem a little unsafe, especially at night. I did not have the guts to get on the rides, but we did get to go up to the tower observation deck, which has a breathtaking view of the city, and at the same time you can see the daring people above you on the rides. Upon checkout, the hotel also offers late checkout at 3pm if you need it, for an additional $20 bucks, which is a great idea if you have a later flight. We utilized this feature, and was great since checkout is at 11, and our shuttle wasn't picking us up until 2:30pm. Checkout was pretty quick, the TV checkout was unavailable, but just a quick call from our room down to the reservation desk to let them know we were checking out was all it took. And just as a last note, I was not charged that $7 daily resort fee that everyone speaks of. I don't know if that was an oversight on the hotel's part, but I have my itemized statement and nothing like that is showing up. The only bad thing I did see is the fact that the hotel charges $12 per day for wifi access. A bit excessive, but I guess for the price of the hotel, you really can't complain too much. I would highly recommend this hotel to anybody, especially if you're on a budget. I had a very good experience here, and would definetly stay here again.

All the staff that we encountered were nice & helpful,however, steer clear of the Tahiti Village people. My husband got sucked into the it and signed up, forked over the $40 thinking that we would just go back the next day and get a free meal & show tickets. I read the fine print later and it said that we had to sit thru a 2.5 hr time share presentation which they never told him. We decided not to do it and lost the $40 but we would have lost it gambling anyway I'm sure. The pool was nice- it was during the spring break time so there were quite a few 'kids' there which was fine. The drinks at the pool bar were great and not watered down. Roxy's diner was really good- especially the shakes (and the staff sings too). We went to the top of the tower and my husband did the Big Shot ride and he LOVED it (and he's scared of heights too). Also, if your a guest there you get up to the tower free. The shops & eateries on the upper level were'nt that great. There are two Travelocity.com consierge desks. We went to the one on the upper level to rent a car the day we were leaving so we could go see the Hoover Dam (a must!) and there was a big line and the people infront of us said they had been there 45min and apparently the car rental agency within the hotel ran out of cars and they were trying to shuffle some around & shuffle people to other locations for them! It was a mess. So I went to the one downstairs by the chek in and the girl there was super helpful and got us another rental from an agency off the stip and they picked us up and droped us off free of charge! After eating at they buffet at Excalibur (its HUGE & GOOD) we decided one morning to eat at the Strat buffet. It was really not that good or big- I'd go else where! We also ate at Fellini's which was pretty good, but if your going to spend the money on an Italian dinner go to The Hole In The Wall. We didn't find out about it until after and everyone said it was the best.The Stratosphere Hotel & Casino is at the north end of the strip. by taxi it doesn't take long (a few minutes) to get down to the center. I walked from the Strat to the MGM and it took all afternoon. Also, the tram is super cheap - I think $5 for 1 trip and $13 for an all day pass. It stops at the Sahara which is right down the steet and it runs every 6 mins- the signs for it are all well and clearly marked in the hotels. We never saw any shady people, hookers, or felt unsafe.

Very Motel 6 like. No coffee makers and no cable TV. Got 8 channels. Asked about the coffee makers and was told only the sites have them. Bathtub was dirty as we found hair in it.

The lady wasn\u00b4t really interested in our wishes and just gave us a smoking room? After we went to our room (we booked a Deluxe King with a jacuzzi)... it smelled horribly. Yup, it was a SMOKING room. We went down again (with all our belongings and asked for a NON smoking room. But unfortunately, there were no more rooms left for non smokers. We had to down-grade to a normal queen room for a night, without even an apology or something free. The lady even claimed we specially asked for a smoking room ??? HELLO, we are not stupid. So we had to go down again in the morning and had to be in the hotel by 6pm to change into our King with Jacuzzi. That was the rocky part... In the end we were on the 20th floor with strip view, which was nice. The remodeled upper-floor section of the hotel does look nice and it is definitely an excellent deal.

It was at least $100 cheaper than any other strip hotel. I have been to Vegas several times, so I knew we could use the Duece bus or the Tram system to get around. Our room was wonderful. The view was great and and both my daughter and I said that the bed was the most comfortable we had ever slept in. We wanted a nice pool, so this was one thing that sold us on the Stratosphere being an option. The pool was huge, but I wouldn't say it was heated. The service by the pool was great. The casino was small and old compared to the other places I have stayed; Mirage, Mandalay Bay, Treasure Island, Planet Hollywood etc. I have gambled at pretty much all the casinos on the strip including the Rio. It didn't have the newer slots, but at least they were all the voucher system. Because it was small, it got a little boring. I did win though, so I can't complain too much. Casino service - I was a little mad at the bartender. I was gambling at the bar for at least two hours and getting my drinks free. I had just ran out of credits and ordered a drink, and he charged me $9. The most irritating thing was my players card would stop working, and it always happened after the Rewards Club was closed, so I couldn't get a new card. So if you are going to use the slots, insist on two cards, in case one stops working. They blamed it on being near other cards or my cell phone. I had all my players cards in the same place, and none of the other ones stopped working, or have I had this happen to me before. I have cards that are 3 or 4 years old from the other casinos. For people that said the area was unsafe and had hookers and drug deals going on. I have no idea what they were talking about, because I saw none of this. In fact, they didn't have any of those annoying people handing out stripper cards in the area, which was very nice not to have to deal with that. I never felt unsafe. We took the tram one night and used the duece bus the rest of the three days. The bus gets a little old, but it can be very intertaining if you ride it with the right attitude. You meet some very interesting people on the bus. They have a McDonalds, Ben & Jerrys and a pizza place on the second floor, which was nice if you wanted something quick and cheaper. We spluged one night and ate at the Top of the World. It's expensive, but the food was good and the service was excellent. The view was awesome at night.

The room was your average hotel room and had just the basics. But more importantly it was clean and QUIET! We slept great every night and the beds / pillows were soo comfy! Some of the nicest I've had. We rented a car so that fact that it is a at the northern end of the strip was not a problem for us. The strip was very easy to navigate and within a day we were cruising around, parking at all the resorts (free parking! Love it!) and didn't have to spend a dime on any public transportation. The only thing we did use that I hadn't read about was that they have a shuttle every night starting at 6:40pm which stops at the stratosphere, miracle mile and one other stop...but it's free and runs til midnight during the week and til 2am on weekends. nice if you plan to out late and don't have to worry about a designated diver. The driver of the shuttle was very nice, gave us lots of tips to avoid and other \"must-sees\". As for the rest of the hotel, we don't gamble so I can't give any information about the casino.

I am a traveler with experience staying up and down the strip and found myself at the Stratosphere in March 2009 for a family wedding. Prior to arriving the prices on the website looked reasonable and the room photos appeared stylish and inviting. But the pushy yet confused reception I received when booking my room by phone should have been the tip-off that something was not right. The average room \u2013 while clean enough \u2013 was well short on d\u00e9cor, space, and for most of my relatives, a view of anything other than a wall or dumpster. My bedroom shared a wall with an elevator that made it sound as though I was sleeping next to a train. I was not warned of this prior to checking in, and the staff didn\u2019t seem to think it was a big deal. The staff at the Stratosphere is the least helpful, friendly and knowledgeable you will find anywhere, never mind in comparison to high standards I\u2019ve experience elsewhere throughout Las Vegas. The uninterested room service staff finally provided two wine glasses after numerous requests \u2013 for a fee of $6. The staff in the tower complained about management throughout my ride up and down. Apparently the Stratosphere is not a great place to work. The casino itself is average and in typical Las Vegas style is impossible to ignore. This would not be an issue, if security staff stopped me no less than two times walking from the reception area through to the elevators because I was carrying my toddler (there is no way to get to your room without crossing the gaming floor). Because the Stratosphere is slightly off strip, you may be willing to sacrifice proximity to the downtown to save a couple bucks. Don\u2019t. Any cab ride to the heart of the strip or the airport is at least $20. So unless you plan on staying in the hotel your whole trip (trust me, you won\u2019t) this adds another layer of expense. Perhaps the worst aspect of the Stratosphere was its second rate selection of overpriced restaurants. I could go into detail about the lack of selection and the clich\u00e9d menu options that are priced the same as far superior venues up the strip, but hopefully you\u2019re convinced the Stratosphere should be avoided by now. There isn\u2019t much this hotel gets right. Even it\u2019s free fitness facility \u2013 a plus in today\u2019s pay-as-you-go market \u2013 shares a wall with a pungent McDonald\u2019s restaurant. There are no indoor pools \u2013 meaning any swim off summer heat is out of the question. Whether due to the economy or the competition between the numerous hotels that dot the Las Vegas strip, the quality of accommodations, restaurants and customer service in Vegas are far too competitive for you to tolerate the Stratosphere.

My most recent trip was 4 nites in Mid-March. I booked a Spa King because I love the jacuzzi tubs here. Some people are bothered that they are located in the bathroom, as opposed to the bedroom with a view. For $41 a nite, ($7.50 per nite resort fee included), it is an AWESOME room. I spent approx 14 hours in the tub. Newer, more comfortable beds and slightly different color schemes are the main renovations (November 2008), but the beds are definitely an improvement. Besides the tub, everything else is standard for any 2/3-star hotel. The casino has tightened up on everything from table games, to slots....especially slots. I don't play them much, but always pay attention to see if a casino seems to be paying at least an average amount back to the customers. In four days, I did not see a single win on any slots totalling more than $25-75....that is max bets on machines of every denomination. You will lose $50-100 instantly by playing these machines and not have an ounce of fun. As for the tables, drink service is good, but the dealers (for the most part) are completely inarticulate. Every table I was at had players asking dealers to speak clearer, repeat things, slow down, etc. The pit bosses are surly, and their interaction with their own dealers is awkward to say the least. Dealers are constantly being reminded to do simple things like burn cards, and cut decks. I did play with an extremely friendly dealer though, who was enough to make me look for her again specifically, but I will not be gaming at their casino for a while, and I advise others to avoid it as well. Better gaming on Fremont, or play around on the strip. The rewards progarm is also not great here, which is another reason to game elsewhere. Restaurants: Buffet - closed; Asian restaurant - closed; Roxy's 50's diner - open 2 of 4 days; Lucky's diner - open 24 hours, all 4 days; McDonald's - open 24 hours, all 4 days. The service at Lucky's is always sub-par, but the food is actually pretty good, if you dont mind waiting 20-35 minutes. I have never, and will never eat at Roxy's. Servers sing 50's songs with the style and voice of your average American Idol reject while you try to eat. Seems more annoying than campy fun. Everything else was closed the whole time essentially, which was another downside. The shows are a joke, and the clubs are non-existent as of now I believe....we couldnt find one. Location is not great, but definitely as safe, or safer than other casinos on the strip, (i.e. Sahara, Circus Circus, Imperial Palace). There is a good number of security patrolling things. I walked to IHOP and 711 alone (both 1 block away) during the day, but still wouldnt want to walk alone at nite. Deuce bus is close for cheap, strip travel, and Fremont is close. So stay at the Stratosphere for a quality, clean, cheap room, with friendly service....and thats IT.

I find that 3 stars in Vegas is more like a 4 star hotel in Canada. Las Vegas hotels seem to be held to a tuffer standard. For example....... a Marriott hotel Alberta might be 4 stars, but a 4 star hotel in Las Vegas is twice as nice........ how does that work? Stratosphere is located at the very north end of the new Las Vegas strip. A short walk across the street to the Sahara hotel where the Monorail starts, and you can take the train to dozens of other resorts on the strip. Stratoshere seems like the best deal if youre on a budget, the shopping, restraunts, nightclub and hotel room rates are some of the best on the strip. Even the \"Top of the World\" restraunt is good value for what you get, as it is high quality food in an incredable setting high above Las Vegas in the tower, for a price that is better then comparable Las Vegas restraunts of this type. Another restraunt I woudl recomend is the 50's Diner on the main level. The food is wonderful, prices are very competative, and the 50's theme is amazing! The swimming pool is my fav because its got so much space for tanning and so many chairs that you never feel like its too full, theres always a place to lay back on a chair, and a spot in the pool, unlike comparable top las vegas pools. There is even an Adult pool seperate from the main pool area, the adult pool encourages women to go topless. I was there around noon and all I saw were out of shape old women going topless, but it was still fun! Ive been to the Stratosphere 3 times for several days at a time, and i have always found the staff really nice there. Since the hotel changed owners about a year ago, and the new management came in, I have found that the staff are even nicer, some of the most friendly front desk service ive experienced in Las Vegas. The Casino is great, lots of fun games, and a lot of the newer games that are popular, The resort has style and there is a mix of people about 60% chic-style tourists dressed to impress and 40% tourists that dress like slobs. -The only bad things i can say about the stratosphere are that the Hair Salon is a huge rip off, about 5 times as much money to get your hair trimed and styled as comparable salons off the strip and about 3 times as much as the salon across the street at the Sahara Resort. Also, due to the design of the hotel, some rooms have a view of air exchange and conditioning equiptment or views of cement walls 30 feet away.", "Date": "March 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin,Ireland", "Title": "\u201cYes and No!!\u201d", "Author": "mrandmrs09", "ReviewID": "UR26521044", "Content": "I stayed here for 10 nights with my partner and therer were some things I was happy with and some things I wasn't.

The area around the hotel is a bit rough because its at the cheaper end of the strip, down where the motels begin and the beggers become a bit more aggresive, this is why the bus comes in handy!! The price compared to the main body of strip may cause you accept this, it did for me, but when a tour driver told me that the housing estate beside the hotel has a number of stabbings/shootings a week i though differently, but I didn't see anything like that.

The bathroom was tiny you literally could not move, but on a positive note the shower was very good and there was always a good supply of hot water. My biggest dissapointment was that there was no in-room safe which i think is must in any hotel these days. We ate at the courtyard buffet once for breakfast and then at evening i do have to say the buffet really isn't anything special to be honest we ate much better meals at Dennys nextdoor to the hotel where the food and the service were both excellent.

View was south toward the strip - the tower and the large Stratosphere front hotel sign obscure the view but you still see a large part of the city which is great. The room was clean, bed ( very good ) & bedding is quite new, tv picture was a bit fuzzy and had limited channels. All in all the room was great especially for the price.

The hotel gives you a coupon book for properties within the Stratosphere which is nice - mostly 10% off coupons which can add up. Casino is acceptable although can be a bit 'smoky' and has an older smell to it. Check in / out was simple. Parking is excellent if you have a car. I rented from Advantage which I had never heard of. Great rates. Booked right at the airport. $170 US plus gas for 4 full days. Dodge Nitro SUV which was perfect. Shuttle bus takes you from the airport to the car rental place which is about a 10 minute trip. Very efficient. This was my first time to Vegas. Renting a car is great.

I never was able to wake up early enough for it but I heard there are teaching sessions at 8.30am to teach beginner gamblers some games like crabs and such. The only negatives about the Stratosphere was that it was located a bit far from the central part of the Strip, so if you want to get around I suggest first thing is to buy a Deduce ticket. I bought a 3 day ticket for about $15 and bus took me up and down the Strip as well as Downtown. Other notable places it stops are Town Square (a cute little shopping area - although noisy because it's close proxmity to the airport) and Las Vegas Outlets. There is another Premium outlet you can visit but you would need to take another bus for that and it's very close from the Stratosphere, the Deduce bus ticket should cover the CAT bus fare as well. ... Sorry I got distracted with the outlet discussion The other negative was that my room was situated right next to the lifts. I know people really don't come to sleep in Vegas, but it does get distracting and noisy. I can pretty much sleep through anything so it didn't bother me but it doesn't help with relaxation if that is what you are after. So probably a room in Tower 2 room 22 is a no no for you.

The room was clean as well and we always had fresh towels. The hotel was quite a distance from the main areas on the strip but there was a bus stop outside the hotel and the services were frequent.

The place is situated at the end of the Strip, the last major on-the-Strip hotel until you reach downtown Vegas (off the Strip). The hotel itself is pretty much as expected. We stayed in the standard queen\u2019s suite, with a good sized, simple room. The room appears to be a very clean room, until my husband started complaining about itchiness from carpet lice bites (I notice some itching too - initially I thought it was the harsh desert weather causing skin irritations, but the itch disappeared once we left Vegas\u2026). The hotel is a bargain at $24 per night during the weekdays, so we are not complaining too much. But for that price you must book on the internet \u2013 it will be $59 for walk-in customers. Staff members were friendly and helpful \u2013 the Concierge was particularly patient with my endless enquiries. For transport and amenities, as the hotel is on the main Strip, so it has the convenience of the Deuce bus at the front of the hotel. For the bargain shoppers, there is the famous Premium Outlet situated quite close to the hotel \u2013 it is walkable distance (give at least a 30 minutes walk), but you can also take the bus or taxi there as well \u2013 about 10 minutes on a taxi, according to the Concierge. For cheap, fast food, McDonalds and Starbucks, plus a few others (including a very nice Mexican place on the first floor) are in the building. Outside, there is the fantastic Carls Jr. chain opposite the hotel, and a 24-hr breakfast chain restaurant within 1 minute walk. For Asian food there is a Thai restaurant opposite the Sahara about 5-10 minutes walk away. Circle K at the gas station next to the hotel is also a good place to pick up some essentials. For budget travellers returning home, there is a bus every 20 minutes on the corner opposite the hotel, next to Carl\u2019s Jr. that takes you to the airport for $1.25! With frequent stops, do give an hour to get to the airport. Otherwise you may wish to opt for an airport shuttle for $8-$9 or a taxi ride.

We met up with other family members after checking out, did the whole strip thing for New Years Eve until the early morning hours on January 1 then drove for home. Upon return home, we discovered that our credit card had been charged for a room on New Years Eve. Immediately calling the casino to request an explanation, we were met with the most unprofesssional behavior from hotel employees that I have ever had the misfortune to experience in my life. Apparently after we checked out, someone from the room either called the front desk or told security personnel-- (we were told different versions of how this security breach happened depending on which Stratosphere staffer we talked to)-- and claimed they were my boyfriend. This person said that \"we\" were too sick to leave and that \"we had checked out accidently from the room television while ordering a movie.\" That alone should have alerted security to go check for identification from the room. It is inconceivable to me that the hotel did not check into this fairy tale a little further. Anyone with any kind of security experience should have been suspicious, especially since the hotel's own records showed that we had already checked out. The hotel did not check the room and ask for identification, they simply accepted the word of the person who was in the room and charged our credit card. I know I made sure that room was locked when I shut the door so I have my own suspicions. Regardless, the hotel should have asked for some kind of proof of who they were talking to on the phone. The hotel, simply stated, is now calling us liars. They are telling us that we have to PROVE that we stayed in another hotel on New Years Eve. This is absolutely ludicrous and an obvious case of identity theft and credit card fraud. The hotel has now now made their failures our problem. We ( and another family member who was also in Vegas) tried to speak with Michael Branch, Hotel Operations, and explain that the Stratosphere had a case of credit card fraud and identity theft that needed to be investigated. We requested that they check their security tapes that would show us leaving with my mother's car, with Colorado plates and handicapped placards. Mr. Branch stubbornly refuses to listen and states that the hotel tapes are erased after 24 hours. We explained to him that we had left the hotel, met up with other family members who were at Sam's Town and had gone to the strip to celebrate New Years. Mr. Branch said that he \"personally spoken\" with my boyfriend over the phone in the room and was told that we \"too sick to leave the room.\" We told him that it was absolutely impossible because we were at the Venetian at the time that he spoke to someone in the room. We have no idea who they spoke to in the room, nor should we have to \"prove\" that we were at another hotel. Although we did not owe him any explanations, we offered the information of where we were for the next twelve hours, location by location and hour by hour. We also offered to give him the names of family members from Colorado and Nevada, who could give him an accounting of our whereabouts to no avail. Mr. Branch will not budge with his accusations. Mr. Branch obviously made a judgment error by not checking the room personally and asking for identification, especially in light of the fact that we had already checked out. The tall tale coming from the person who was in the room should have been suspect to anyone in the hotel business. Whoever was in the room was committing a crime which is the hotel's responsibility to handle. The Stratosphere is refusing to do so and stand by their judment that we are liars. Unbelievable. It all the years of traveling with my family, I have never experienced such unprofessional and rude behavior. I have never been accused of anything, nor have I had my integrity questioned by a hotel. In light of the fact that Vegas is having trouble filling hotel rooms, I would think that accusing guests would be frowned upon. We have no idea what happened in that hotel after we left, but Stratosphere employees need to be retrained in security procedures and hotel professionalism. They have an obvious scam going on in the hotel that needs to be investigated and not accuse hotel guests of being liars who have to prove their whereabouts upon leaving the hotel. If you do not like your integrity and honesty questioned, do not stay at the Stratosphere. If you do not want to have to prove your whereabouts to a casino after you check out, do not stay at the Stratosphere. If you do not like the idea that a hotel erases security tapes after 24 hours, do not stay at the Stratosphere. If you do not want to have to go through the whole identity theft and credit card fraud nightmare with financial institutions and law enforcement, do not stay at the Stratosphere.

We got 'got' at the baggage carousel by a limo man at the airport, who we knew was spinning us a line with the whole 'my client hasn't turned up so I can drive you for the same price as a taxi' but we decided to go ahead and agreed to pay him $51 excl tip. We'd been warned by friends beforehand that this would be the approx price anyway, so in the end we got a nice ride after 24hrs travelling. Our hotel room was on the 22nd floor close to the elevators. The room we got was clean, had 2 huge queen beds (very comfortable) and a big window looking towards the west of the city and hills beyond. The hotel is a bit out of the way of the main strip but I guess that's reflected in the pricing but $2 on the Deuce bus gets you anywhere from Downtown to the Airport ie anywhere along the Strip and $5 all day was the best deal to be had. We ate in the mexican cantina and Lucky's restaurant in the hotel and they were reasonably priced. It was a shame Roxy's was shut we would have liked to try that out. As staying guests you get free access to the observation deck of the Tower between 10 and 2 for great views. Best breakfast/lunch buffet we found was at NYNY hotel called ChinChin - a mixture of American and Chinese foods and great selection of fruits. Hiring a car and driving was easy to do but be warned that you need to factor in the insurance and tax costs are the killer. Having a car meant that we could explore the surrounding natural environment of deserts and Lake Mead recreation area. A real plus point as you get to see 'real' parts of the country. Definitely recommended. Just take care at intersections and know who to give way to! And don't get lost coming back from Lake Mead or else you'll end up in dodgy north-east neighbourhoods which we found quite intimidating to say the least! Red Rock Canyon was awesome and is only 30mins west much better than Death Valley in a lot of respects. Joshua Tree Highway too was beautiful. Take care not to underestimate the length of your car journeys though and be prepared to stop every few miles for all those great photos you will want to take. All in all, a fabulous trip and good experience of all that the Strip has to offer as well as balancing the artificialness of Las Vegas with its many surrounding natural beauties. Read up driving tips before you go though. Last caution about the Stratosphere or any other hotel is that you always get some hassle from the timeshare people - just be firm and polite. We also had a couple of nights where there was a lot of noise from people down the hall - partying big time in their rooms - to be expected I guess.

For the business traveler, I give you 1 warning: if you have have much work to do in the room, you will be uncomfortable. There is a desk, but the large TV screen is permanently attached to it.

There were a couple of things wrong with the room which I would have asked to be fixed if I had been staying longer (flickering light, smell from the sink) but I thought the room was OK other than that. The sink was located outside the bathroom which was a bit annoying as you could wake the other person at night. The size of the room was good and I didn\u2019t hear any noise at night.

We were allocated room 31191 on the eleventh floor at the back of the hotel. Overlooking downtown and with a good view to the mountains which looked wonderful in the sunrise every morning. I would ask for this room again as it was located just around the corner from the lift, most convenient and not at all noisy which was one concern I had when we first saw the location. The hotel is at the downtown end of the strip but the Deuce bus stops right outside and for five dollars for twenty four hours you have unlimited travel. One tip, do not use the stop right outside but walk over the crosswalk(outside Dennys) and use the stop there, hardly anyone else does and you avoid the queue, (if you use the exit at the top end of The Courtyard buffet you are almost there). The great advantage of this hotel if you want to go south down the strip is because it is the first hotel out of downtown, the buses are usually not too crowded. The Courtyard buffet is good and reasonably priced. A good selection of 'in house' shops, bars and eateries. We were given as part of our package free unlimited access day and night to the tower. A saving of fourteen dollars each time per person, we thought this was a great offer. If you only do it once go at night, the view is spectacular.

You can store your luggage at their bell desk your last day if your plane leaves late for the price of only gratuity. I have no idea if they plan to remodel any rooms in this hotel, but it would be nice to have a flat screen LCD tv such as sister hotel Aquarius in Laughlin or the Riviera (two casino hotels of similar size and price range) do instead of the awkward conventional TV with poor reception quality and a curved screen. The bed itself, the down blanket, and pillows were nice and comfortable. There wasn't a lamp in the immediate vicinity of the work desk area, which puzzled me. They charge a $1 access fee per call (including for local and 800 numbers), so bring and use your cell phone exclusively. They also have wireless internet for $11.99 for 24 hours. My view was of the parking structure, but since I hadn't specifically paid extra for a specific view of something more desirable, I didn't really mind (although my reservation did state I was to have a premium view, which it was not). I was disappointed in the bathroom. The floor was dirty and it was something you'd expect to see in a YMCA or high school gym locker room. There was no bathtub, just a shower (no glass enclosure either) with a drain at the bottom. No tile in the bathroom, just a concrete floor. I certainly didn't expect great things in a 3 star hotel, but I didn't expect a bathroom of such poor quality. Toiletries given were deodorant soap and shampoo. The maid also leaves an envelope specifically for tips. The buffet is better than others I have tasted throughout Las Vegas and Laughlin. There was a great selection of meat, salad, and dessert, among other food items. They have McDonalds and a selection of shops on their 2nd floor. Guests are allowed to access the Tower for free from 10am-2pm. Outside of those hours, it costs $10 for hotel guests/Nevada residents and $13.95 for non-hotel guests to access the tower, not including the price of rides. The Stratosphere is at the northern end of the Strip near the Sahara. It's relatively far from the hustle and bustle of mid-Strip, so if location matters to you, I would suggest you try a hotel in a similar price range in that area. The Deuce (double decker bus) is notoriously slow in traveling through the crowded Strip, so plan ahead and be at the bus stop at least 1 hour before any event or show you plan to attend. I probably wouldn't stay here again, but then again, I was always the kind of person to try a different hotel and experience every single time I came to a certain city.

The tv had a good selection of channels and the shower was great. I ate at the hotel twice, the buffet for breakfast one morning which was super and I'd recommend it. And the Italian Fellini's one evening, the food here again was good and quite reasonable. All the hotel staff I spoke to were friendly and helpful. The shops on the 2nd floor of the hotel are good for picking up little bits and bobs - one of the gift shop type shops also sells beer and soft drinks that are handy for taking to your room and they were only a few cents more than 7 11 or CVS. And Mcdonalds was handy on my first night when I just wanted a quick meal. I was a little concerned about the location after reading several reviews before I travelled but I thought it was great! I used the deuce bus loads and brought a day ticket for $5. Outside the hotel is a 24hr Denny's, an IHop, Burger King, Bonanza gift shop (the largest in the world!), several tattoo shops and a wedding chapel! The Sahara is just a few moments walk and Circus Circus was about 15/20mins walk. I travelled on my own and never felt unsafe even at night. There were always lots of taxi's outside the hotel even at 4 am when I needed a cab to the airport. I did walk from the Stratosphere to New York New York one day stopping in at different casinos along the way, though it took awhile it is possible and quite easy to walk the strip. I like the fact that the hotel is inbetween the strip and Freemont Street so it is easy to get to either of them. Even if you stay in the middle of the strip your more than likely going to use the bus or taxis to get around anyway as it is that big. Also the other hotels that are the same sort of price didnt seem half as nice - I nearly stayed at the Imperial Palace (as suggested on the TA Forum) but was so pleased I didnt when I went in to their casino.

The hotel itself is a decent, if not fancy, hotel. It doesn't have (or claim to have) the perks of a Bellagio. At the same time, you can get incredible deals for rooms. I have been in a \"regular\" room, which is decent sized and nice enough. I have also been in a two room suite, which was really nice--as nice as others I have seen on the strip. There is fairly easy access to the Monorail if you want to visit other major hotel/casinos on the strip. Just don't expect to walk to the busier part of the strip.

We were mildly concerned about the reviews and the fact the local travel agency more or less refused to book us there. All worries were erased upon arrival. We'd booked through Allegiant Air, and check in was quick, painless, and the clerk was quite friendly. We checked in about 8PM local time, and had no wait whatsoever. The room was basic, but quite clean and the beds were brand new and very comfortable. We had no misgivings about the location, because we knew where it was located before ever booking the room, something other people obviously don't bother to research (not the hotel's fault!!!!). Transportation was easily had, as cabs were availble out front 24/7, the monrail station was a short walk away at the Sahara, and the bus stops right in front of the hoetel, and will take you anywhere on the strip, as well as downtown, all for 5 dollars for a 24 hour pass! We found the bus to be much quicker than many people reported, but we didn't use it during \"peak\" hours. We'd hit the strip early anmd come home late, and never had trouble getting a seat or getting to our destination at a reasonable time. We'd been warned by the local travel agent the hotel was in an unsavory part of town. I guess everyone has different standards, but I walked the areas around our hotel all hours of the day and night without once feeling the least bit threatened. In all seriousness, I grew up in a town of less than 500, and would have more misgivings walking though parts of it than I would walking in this neighborhood. i was told by a cabbie that 3 blocks west would put me in a bad neighborhood, but that I'd be safe anywhere on the strip. Like anywhere, you've got to be aware of your surroundings, but that should be a given. After reading many reviews, some even in the same time period we were there, I can't believe we stayed at the same hotel. No, its not Planet Hollywood or the Bellagio, but were you seriously expecting that at these prices?!?!?!? If you want a cheap, clean room with comfortable beds,and are awre of its location, have no fear....the Stratosphere EXCEEDED my expectations in nearly every way! As an added bonus, due to the \"new member signup promotion\" I got a t-shirt, show tickets, free slot play, gift shop credits, etc all comped to me for what I'd consider a low to medium amount of play in 24 hours. The casino was what I'd expect, and the slots and VP machines paid out seemingly better than they did in other places. I guess I'm just not as picky as some people, or maybe I'm the only one who bothered to throughly check out the place enough to know what to expect, but I loved the Strat, and would never have issues recommending it or staying there again myself. Its not uber-fancy like much of Vegas, but again, for the money spent, was an incredible value.

I can only comment on the poor service at check-in. In July I visited the Strat website and booked a king bed smoking room for 3 nights commencing Sept 11/08. This trip was planned well in advance from Canada, for an Anaheim, Las Vegas, Reno road trip. We spent 5 days at the HoJo in Anaheim.. lovely! For our first 3 days in Vegas we enjoyed a wonderful stay at the Excalibur. The staff at the Excalibur went out of their way to please us and by the time the comps were calculated, our stay was free. After checking out of the Excalibur we tried to check into the Stratosphere. We arrived at 3:30pm (check-in time is posted at 3:00pm). The first thing the clerk said was that she could upgrade us for an additional $15/night. I said I wasn't interested in the upgrade and just to give us the king smoking room we had booked. She then stated we had booked a non-smoking room, and that she had no smoking rooms available. I told her that I absolutely booked a smoking room but she didn't want to hear that. She said to come back in about 45 minutes and maybe she would have a smoking room available. We returned about 90 minutes later, but evidently they still had no room for us. The clerk said that the upgrade room she offered us happened to be a smoking room. She also stated it had an extra seating area and a fridge. We weren't interested in extra seating room, but a fridge would have been nice and because we didn't want to wait any longer we decided to take it. We went up to a dingy upgrade room that did not have a fridge! Back down to the clerk... Just give me a regular smoking room! Sorry... none available, come back in a couple of hours. My husband nearly went through the roof! After voicing our concerns to the manager, our first night deposit was credited back to my credit card and we drove straight back to the Excalibur where were spent the next 3 days being treated very well, and again our comps covered the room! Amazing what good customer service can do. We will never step foot in the Strat again. Upon our return home, I located the email from the Strat confirming my reservation. It clearly stated smoking room, so not only did they screw up the reservation, but the clerk had the gaul to insinuate that it was MY mistake, and then try to push a more expensive room on us with the promise of an amenity that it didn't have, all after making us wait forever for it!!!!

The room was spacious and very clean (with an exception, I will explain) and seemed comparable to an average Fairfield Inn or similar property: two queen beds, desk, dresser and television. Our room had a view of the mountains. It was good, basic accommodations. Our only issue with the room itself was that the sink area and hand towels had not been cleaned. The housekeeping supervisor arrived quickly after I called. She was apologetic and immediately sent someone to address the issue. The casino at The Stratosphere was not overly crowded and had surprisingly clear air. There are a number of restaurants to choose from in the hotel. The Stratosphere is further down the strip than I had remembered. The only other casino within walking distance (in 103 degree heat) was the Sahara. So, if you want to visit other casinos, be prepared to take a cab or walk to the Sahara and catch the monorail.

The hotel is at the downtown end of the strip which as we discovered is about a 6mile walk from the opposite end, but there is so much to see and do from one end to the other you can walk it without noticing. If you dont fancy the walk there is a 24 bus that runs up and down every 15mins or so or of course you can get one of the many taxis that waits outside to anywhere for around $10-$20 depending on how far you travel.

Standard rooms are a gamble I don't want to deal with. Gaming: It pretty much has everything I need highlighted by friendly dealers and a well-ventilated gaming area. Food: The fast food is nice and all, but there other good cheap eats in the area. The buffet is about as boring as it gets. Fellini's was a nice surprise with their courtesy and meals. Crazy Armadillo is a nice place for margaritas and practicing flair work. Lucky's Cafe is a fine place for breakfast. Naga could just leave for all I care.

Noted on previous postings that the 8th floor were the pool is was very busy and noisy, walking from the lifts to the pool thias definately appeared to be the case. Our room had views over the premium outlet mall, great for my wife! and views of the mountains, better for me! Went shopping to the outlet malls the one closet to the hotel is by far the best, had been to the one at Primm before so did not go back there. Picked up some great bargains. The hotel itself appears much older than it 10 years. Free use of the tower between 10-2pm, great views. Room was OK , bed comfortable, toiletries were ordinary, bathroom big with good size room. Most of the staff were friendly enough but some were downright rude and very poor representatives of the hotel, not that anyone really cared though. They closed the pool off to hotel guests one afternoon as it was a private party for people who had apparently spent large amounts at the casino...........boo hoo if you didnt spend thousands and again when we politely enquired about this it was dismissed and we were told to use the \"adult pool\", no thanks, free to ladies guys pay $10.00, nice little earner that is! The buffet was OK, ate there twice, Friday night was seafood, it was an OK selection nothing fancy, also ate at Roxys again nothing special very basic. They have a floor of shops on the second floor with McDonalds and some souviner places. We went to the american superstars show, had a buy one get one free deal, try get a free one and have a free one. Fair Dinkum this was ordinary, Elvis forgot his words, Rod Stewart dropped the microphone and infact probably played the part really well as he looked completely out of it and the show was billed for 90 minutes it was over in just over an hour, thank god! There are better shows on the Strip, pay a little more and see something like KA at MGM, now that's a great show! Had a storm the last day we were there and closed off the pool mid afternoon, fair enough but 2 hours after the weather alert was lifted the pool was still closed and noone you spoke too knew what was going on. Checkout was easy, completed via the TV. The guys at the Taxi stand did a great job by the way! Word of advice be careful walking at night time up the strip towards the Sahara when you exit the Hotel stay on the same side as the sahara, just past the IHOP on the other side it gets a little rough, we along with others were hassled by some drunks and made sure not to make that mistake again.

As most families we were on a budget and wanted something on the strip within our price range. The strat is great for 'breathing' away from the hussle and bussle of the strip, and we found once we had done the strip a couple of times, we were happy to be away from the crowds! We didnt order room service as it was too expensive even for basic food orders, so we were delighted to find a McDonalds on the 1st floor of the hotel where we had our breakfast and coffee every morning! I would suggest that if your buying fizzy drinks that you go to Maccy's as you can have free refill's and it saves on the pennies! On check in we were automatically up graded to a premium room from a standard. The room was really spacious and very clean. Our room was cleaned daily with fresh towels, soap, shampoo etc. There are vending machines on each floor which have snack food, and a complimantary ice vending machine which is great for cooling drinks (even sunburned skin!). We found the entertainment in the hotel fab, live bands every night so we didnt always feel the need to leave. You must take advantage of the free viewing of the observation deck between 10-2pm, we saw crowds of people from other hotels who had to pay $18 to go to the top and its free for people staying at the strat. All the shows in the hotel are buy one get one free, (residents of the hotel only) which saves you loads as each show is $42 per person. The pool is on the 8th floor and there are plenty of sun loungers, I didnt think many people would be sunbathing in vegas...how wrong was i!!! We were in the pool ever day, they have a great little snack bar which serves food from 10am, I loved the chicken fingers which you get with fries for $8, very filling. The gym equipment is by the pool too which you can just walk over and use. They have a little jaccuzi pool too which is by the gym machines which we didnt discover till half way through the week. Im going to write prices below which we payed for things as I hope this will help other families who need to plan there budget. Just a little tip, when using taxi cabs, get them to take you via the 'freeway' as it cuts out all the traffic, although it takes you around the strip it cuts out the traffic and the meter goes up and up even when your stationary in traffic jams! Taxi from the airport to our hotel: $27 Taxi from hotel to Fremont Street $13 Taxi from Hotel to Belagio fountains $17 Meal for 2 in Roxy's Diner $42 ($50 with tip) Big Mac Meal $6 Rides at top of the tower varied $11-15 they has a pass which cost $33 which allowed you to go on all 3. We had a fantastic time at the strat and I would reccomend this hotel 100%. I read reviews saying that it was too far up the strip blah blah blah, it isnt. The taxi's are cheap if you want to go to mandalay bay bellagio etc. Believe me, when you have done the strip a couple of times, you just want to be away from the crowds!! The location of the strat is ideal for the strip, fremont street and those getting married as its right by the wedding chapel district.

It's on the 8th floor, good sized, and there are rows of chairs to choose from. I never went without a chair. There are cheezy little cabanas you can rent for $40 a day that include shade, a window-type air conditioner, pop and water on ice, and 2 nice pool floaties. There's a snack bar and a bar-bar at the pool, as well as a little c-store. The water was cold but bearable, and there was a volleyball net as well.

The bathroom is a split design, with the sink in the room and the toilet and shower in a tiny cubbyhole of their own. Shower was okay. There was no closet, only a rack at the end of the room. Speaking of the room, ours had a smallish window, and it looked out on a trash-strewn roof with another building some 20 feet away. So there was a view, and it was disgusting. We found two parts of the Stratosphere experience to be very positive. The trip up the tower is impressive, and comes free between 10 and 2 for hotel guests. It's worth doing, even if you do not want to go on the three insane rides they have hanging off the very top. People who are afraid of heights may have a problem with the tower, but I have some of that and the thing is so big and stable that I did not feel queasy. The second is tghe buffet, which on Fridays and Saturdays has seafood, which means all you can eat crab legs.

I didn't see any long queues throughout our stay, however while walking through the Venetian we did witness a queue which was honestly about 2 hours long, which I think shows no matter where you stay there is a chance of queuing mainly due to the large volume of people staying in Vegas. There were long queues for the breakfast buffet, so we had breakfast at the next door Sahara which was really nice. The only restaurant within the hotel we ate at was the Chinese restaurant, which was nice, and also reasonably priced. We saw the American Superstars show which is held in the hotel, which was excellent, and tickets are 2 for 1 for residents, however the show was quite short which was a little disappointing. The hotel is right at the bottom of the strip, but the Deuce bus stops right outside, and there is a Monorail stop within the Sahara next door.

Not the case when I checked in, apparently my room had been taken and all I was offered was a room with 2 double beds. When I had explained this was supposed to be a very important trip, my husband and I were there celebrating our 5 yr wedding anniversary. She seemed like she didn't care. She advised me to call the next day to see if they had a room with a king sized bed available. No offer to upgrade, no free dinner, no show tickets, nothing! (FYI: Having grown up in Vegas, I know that they can offer all those things and more!) After hours of driving, this would've made the mistake easier to deal with. Anyways, this isn't the end of this, the next day when I called to switch to our original king sized bed room, they sent us to a room with a terrible smell of cigarettes. When I called down to the front desk to tell them I needed a Nonsmoking room, due to my husbands medical condition, \"Tiffany\" said she was busy and would call me back to the room phone in a 'few minutes'. When 30 MINUTES passed, I was done waiting and decided to call myself, she happened to answer, when I reminded her I was waiting for a return call, she said \"Oh, I forgot\", Then she said they would switch me to another room (Yes, THREE rooms now, neither upgraded or still, no comps or anything). I could not believe how HORRIBLE we were treated during our special trip. I talked to the front desk manager when we checked out and told her the experience, she offered a discounted room-rate, but at this point, it was not enough.

For $20 more, we were upgraded from a standard room to a honeymoon suite which was gorgeous. It included living room with sofa, 2 t.v sets, spacious bathroom, huge bed and most importantly, a jacuzzi in the middle of the room. The hotel has great looking pools and outdoor jacuzzi in the 8th floor along with both an inside and outside gym available to customers. I also highly recommend a perfect Italian restaurant in the hotel itself called Fellini's. Of course, no Vegas vacation is complete without touring the entire strip but if you wish to just lounge in the hotel, Stratosphere has everything you can want in regards to gambling and other fun activities. The only drawback I would mention about the hotel would be the location itself. It's located at the end of the strip but that was easily resolved for us by taking a bus ride referred to as The Deuce. $2 for one way ride or $5 for an all day pass. I would also recommend renting a car, which we did and on nights that we stayed out late, we parked in the free garages in other hotels and then walked around the strip.", "Date": "May 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cScary rides at the top of Las Vegas\u201d", "Author": "Froggggie", "ReviewID": "UR15997208", "Content": "Stayed 1 night on a special deal (\u00a322) available via expedia.

I was a little worried after reading some reviews, but they should be taken with a grain of salt. First of all, the biggest complaint I have read on here, is the distance. No it's not center strip, but neither is Mandalay Bay, way on the other end. It's Vegas, if you don't like waking I wouldn't suggest going in the first place. The Deuce bus runs right outside of the Stratosphere, or you can walk a few blocks to the Sahara and take the monorail. We walked around ALL day, so whether we were coming from one end of the strip, or the center of the strip, either way our legs would be getting a work out all day. Another complaint I have heard is that it's a \"horrible area\" I wonder what kind of white picket fence neighborhood people are living in if they think THAT is a bad area. I would have felt completely safe walking to the hotel at night by myself in that area.. It's really not that bad, people are constantly walking around all areas, not just center strip. At least on that end I didn't have to deal with the constant cards being given out for hookers. If you live in a city you probably see A LOT worse. Thirdly, yes the hotel itself is quite outdated.. But for as cheap as you can get it, it's not that bad. Our room, and the others we were with had perfectly clean rooms. If you are like me and only really plan to shower and sleep (or barely sleep) in, then that should be good enough! Our bathroom even had a big soaker tub. Overall, if you want to save your money for fun things in Vegas, and if you really aren't one to spend all of your time in your room, this hotel has amazing deals, and it was well worth it. I'm not saying it wouldn't be nice to stay in a really beautiful hotel on the main part of the strip, but if you want to save some money, and if you think there are more important things to spend money on, then this place gets that job done!", "Date": "May 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "British Columbia", "Title": "\u201cOK for the price....\u201d", "Author": "laribee", "ReviewID": "UR15976548", "Content": "We stayed for one night in December, a $50 special, and we were spoiled after having stayed at South Point.

We were very disappointed to find that all rooms in the Premier Tower with nonsmoking king beds were full. This is what we requested when we booked through the hotel website. The only thing they could offer us was a handicapped room with a king bed. We didn't like it. It was a small room, had a view of the buildings air conditioners and the bathroom was AWFUL. The floor was painted concrete. No fan. No real sink counter. It was a walk-in shower with no tub. If you take a shower the water gets all over the bathroom floor. You can not walk in there with your socks on - your feet will get wet. No spot to set your shampoo or soap. And in the room the TV is located off to the left of the bed instead of directly in front. So we called the front desk and said we wanted a better room. We paid an extra $80 a night to switch rooms to the Executive Suite (12th fl.) and it was SOOOO WORTH IT! The entry and bathroom are all marble. The room is huge - 775 sq. feet. Crown molding, table, chairs, sofa, TV, fridge, microwave, 3 sinks, mirrored closet doors, HUGE jacuzzi tub, huge walk-in shower, separate toilet room...decent view of the Saharah Hotel. We were thrilled. One tip for people who like to drink: have your taxi driver stop at a store that isn't near the strip and pick up affordable bottles of alchohol and soda. Then put them in your room fridge and make your own affordable drinks. We stayed at the Stratosphere for 3 nights and took taxi's everywhere. Average price to the strip, the Palms and Fremont Street is $8 - $15 a trip. We hated the bus - it is slow and always packed with sweaty smelly people. We took advantage of the free entry to the top of the Stratosphere from 10am - 2pm if you book the package through the hotel website. It was one of the high points of our trip. No lines, friendly elevator service, no crowds, fantastic views inside (huge clear windows) and out (walk up the stairs to get outside). It will take your breath away! There is even a Starbucks at the top. Great place to relax for a few hours and enjoy the views. Bring your camera and video camera for sure. 360 views of the entire city. We also spent two days at the pool. We weren't impressed. Water was freezing cold. You can't relax in the water because someone is always splashing around with the basketballs or volleyballs. Umbrellas are hard to get if you come later in the day but there is some shade under a canopy far from the pool. The view of the mountains is nice and we enjoyed the hot tub. Plenty of chairs to sit on. There was just too much concrete and not enough greenery, plants and trees. They should revamp it with more greens and a warmer pool and then the place would be a hit. Drinks were expensive as usual for Vegas. It also costs $10 to visit the \"private, tops optional\" pool. There is a little mall inside the Stratosphere with a McDonalds. We went there every morning but the service was terrible. Very slow and unfriendly. Too bad. One of our taxi drivers said the locals call it the Shitosphere but we didn't think it was that bad. It was a decent, clean hotel if you get the right room such as the Executive Suite.

The \"regular\" rooms online were 39.95/night ( I stayed Monday-Thursday) for 49.95, I was able to upgrade to the Premiere Tower which was a bit larger than the regular rooms and had a much larger bathroom. If you're looking for something extravagant, this is not the place to say. The rooms are very average..nothing more than a Super 8. Upon arrival at 10pm check-in worked like a fine oiled machine. They directed you were to go..it did take a while to get checked in--maybe 30 minutes, but once checked in, it was very easy to find our room. For 39.95/night we got the room, buy one get one free show at Statoshphere, 2 free tower passes, a coupon book worth $150.00. check out was 11am, but for an additional $30 Sun-Thurs you can choose to stay until 3pm. Worth it if your plane leaves later in the day. Stratosphere has some $5 tables which you cannot find at the higher end hotels. I didn't get much of a payout at the tables but I did hit pretty well at the bar poker machines. All you have to do is put $10 in there and play 2 credits to get all the free alcohol you want. The bartenders were awesome!! If I was to do it all over again, I would have chosen the Stratoshpere. The only downfall I found to Stratosphere, is that it's at the far north end of the strip. I will probably stay at a hotel further south on the strip next time, but the overall experience was very good. We ate every morning at the Courtyard Buffet..lots of choices, but nothing special. Worth the cost..we would eat once mid morning and then eat supper. We ate at Roxy's Diner one night. 50's motiff and great entertainment.

I booked three Executive Suites, one Grand Suite, and one Premier Room. Check in was a breeze, quick and efficient. Staff was very friendly. Below is a detailed description of all the rooms. Two of the rooms were on the 22nd floor, which were the best. I personally stayed in the Executive suite, and had my children in the connecting Premier Room. The suites can be both smoking and non-smoking, but luckily mine did not smell this time of cigarettes. Both rooms were very clean, and the beds are comfortable. While I have read complaints about the quality of the beds, I really have none. I think the beds and pillows are more than adequate. The Premier Room was the one with two queen beds, and the room is kind of small. It does not have a closet, but an armoire, which is quite small as well. The bathroom is large enough, and kept clean. The Executive Suites have a king bed and a sofa bed, along with refrigerator, sink, and microwave. It also has a small dining room table with four chairs. The room is considered a mini-suite, and it's very spacious. It has a mirrored-door closet with a safe, and a marble entrance to the room. There are two large picture windows that offer great views to the strip (depending on which floor you're on). The best part is the bathroom! It has a double sink vanity, with a separate area for the toilet (with a privacy door). There is a glass enclosed shower, with a separate spa tub big enough for two persons. Of all the mini-suites, this is my favorite one. The other two Executive suites we had were located on the 11th and 8th floor. The one on the 11th floor had good views, but the one on the 8th floor did not. It looked out onto the machinery located above the casino roof (at least I think it's the casino roof). The last room we had booked was another mini-suite, the Grand Suite. It's a little bigger than the Executive suite, since it has a separe living room/dining room and bedroom. The living room has a sofa bed, and the bedroom a king bed. It also has a sink, refrigerator and microwave. There is a TV in both the living room and the bedroom. Inside the bathroom you will find an open closet and safe. There is a double sink vanity, but it is much smaller than the one in the Executive Suite. It has a spa tub, but it's for one person (think of your regular house bathtub, but with jets). The toilet is separated from the bathtub, but only by a small wall partition (no privacy door). It is also an excellent room, but for my personal preferences, I will take the Executive Suite any day. The Grand Suite was on the 7th floor (all Grand Suites are located on the World Tower) and it overlooked the parking garage. Not the best view in the world, unless you want to check in on your car every now and then. All rooms were very clean. Staff was very friendly and efficient. Check out was even faster than check in. This is the third time I stay at the Stratosphere, and although it's the furthest hotel on the strip, you get much better room rates. The rates we paid for the mini-suites were less expensive than the cheapest room rates on the middle of the strip, and we had much better rooms.

I had specifically asked for a non-smoking room, but they did not have any, and offered to spray the room with room freshner, which I refused.

Although the hotel is on the very north end of the strip (it's the last hotel on the strip before you get to the seedy area between the strip and Freemont St.), I actually like the location.

I am by no means a high roller, but the hotel will do a lot to bring people into the casinos during the slower summer months. The pool was rather straight-forward.

The main pool is free to everyone. There is an \"adult\" pool (read topless) where women are free and men are $10, you have to be over 21 to go there.

She had just been laid off and we were traveling on a budget. We stayed in three hotels all together over 4 nights that we were there. The first night we stayed at Binion's in Downtown Vegas, but the Fremont St Experience, the next two nights we stayed at the Strat, and our last night we stayed at Imperial Palace. We didn't pay more than $55 for any of the nights we stayed, and we only paid $39 for the Strat. In comparison with the other two cheap hotels we stayed at, the Strat was by far the BEST. From the inside of the hotel and hotel room, it may as well have been the MGM, NYNY, or TI. The rooms are completely comparable to those three higher priced hotels. The service was fantastic, we really only used them for check in and holding our bags, but they were completely friendly and we had no problems. Express check out made leaving to get to the final hotel super easy. The line for check in was a little long when we arrived, but nothing compared to what we saw of the line the next day. When you enter the main casino doors, the check in area is all the way to the right at the back wall of the casino, the day after we checked in, the check in line was just reaching those main doors! (Thank God we weren't waiting in that!) The rooms were really great. I couldn't believe we had only paid $39 a night for them. There was nothing shoddy about them (whereas our room at Imperial was slightly dingy, and we knew we had only paid about $50 for the room.) I didn't notice anything broken, no stains on the carpets (as one might expect in a $39 a night hotel), nothing was amiss. The major drawback to staying at the Stratosphere is OF COURSE the distance to the rest of the strip. (I wouldn't recommend trying to walk that far, especially in August!) It's great that getting a cab is so easy in Vegas though, otherwise there may have been a real problem.

I of course objected, but they assured me they would put us in a king room as soon as 1 became available, for sure by noon tomorrow. I went down and stood in the line again at noon and guess what, no kings, but 1 will surely be available by three. Then it was 6, then it was 9.

I had prepaid through Expedia. The Scabosphere wouldn't refund what we had paid for the 3rd night that we had already checked out. They said it was up to Expedia to do that. I called Expedia when I got back home, and they said they have to ask the hotel if they will refund the unused night. I'm still waiting for a refund that will never come.

Along with Michael Jackson who is hilarious, and Christine Aguelara and Elvis. They put on a great show. Had a phone-call the day of check-out and the guy said we still owed money. That was a huge problem, and If its still not resolved we wont stay there again. We made reservations thru the hotel, paid our deposit was given the total amount including all taxes and fees. When we went down to check-out the guy there had NO authority whatsover to do anything, it was up to the book-keeper and of course he wasn't there.

If you dont rent a car there are shuttle buses at the airport that will take you to the Stratosphere for $11 round trip. We arrived at the check-in desk about 3:00pm. There was a line but it moved quickly. From the time I got in line til I had my room key was about 30 minutes or less. The lady checking me in was welcoming and efficient. Check-in charges were as expected. There is a $5 resort fee charged at check-in per night. This is for use of the awesome pool, laundry, free tower admission between 10am and 2 pm. Expect a line here also at these times. Our wait was again 30 minutes or less. My package included free tickets for the rides on top the tower. If you like amusement park rides you must do the 3 on the tower. Very cool!! I must admit, the 2 that hung over the edge at 1000+ feet were a little scary but what a rush!! At check-in you will also get a few coupons for the buffet, Cbar, etc. The buffet was reasonably priced and the food good. Huge desert area. Soft drink, juice, tea, etc. included in price. We stayed in a spa suite the first 2 nights. It was a regular size hotel room, very clean I thought. View of the strip was cool. Spa tub was jetted and plenty big for 2 people. Our last night was in the Executive suite. This is a super cool room at a reasonable price Sunday thru Thursday. It has a king size bed, sitting area with a couch and chair, coffee table, tv, kitchen area with a fridge, microwave and sink. Batroom was huge with a jetted tub for 2, glass enclosed shower, 2 sinks, huge mirror. Table and 4 chairs under one of the 2 windows overlooking the strip. Again, I found both rooms to be very clean. They did require a $50 deposit for the Executive suite. Casino was as good as the rest. Again, it was clean. In fact it was much cleaner than the ones downtown on Fremont street, and cleaner than a few I was in on the middle of the strip. Cocktail waitresses came around to offer drinks. Although not fast enough in my opinion. Maybe a $2 or 3 tip instead of the $1 I gave will get them to check on you more often. Bottles of beer at the bar are $6 and 7 if you dont sit and play. This is the price I found at all the strip casinos. One block south of the hotel is a Circle K store. Single beers are $1.50 here. Stop and pick up a few on your way to the main part of the strip. I have read a few reviews about how \"scary\" the area is. This is not the case at all. It's Las Vegas. It's a city. The area is well lighted as you can imagine. Lots of people around. No need to wonder about the area. The Deuce bus stops out front every 15 minutes to take passengers downtown or up the strip. $2 each way or $5 for 24 hours on and off as much as you like. I could go on and on but better stop here. I do recommend the Stratosphere. It is clean, and very nice for the price. Staff was pleasant. I will go back!! Soon I hope.

We knew the Stratosphere is not on the strip so be prepared to have some extra expense in taxi's to go to the middle of the strip (Mirage). The hotel rooms were very nice. The lobby was nice and staff friendly and helpful. We arrived early in the morning (8:30 a.m.) and did not expect to get a room until 2:00 or 3:00 but they got us in a room at noon so we just left our bags with the bellhop and played some slots in the meantime. Our favorite machines are the Elvis and Wheel of Fortune quarters and they had both at the casino. We liked the room. Very tastefully decorated and had a great view of downtown. The only drawback was the air conditioning. We are hot natured and put it as low as we could get it (68) but it never got very cold and kind of froze up. Luckily it was March and not very hot, so we were OK but I think I'd be complaning if it were summer so hopefully it was just our room and not all of them. There is a McDonalds on the 2nd floor along with MANY MANY shops and there is a Denny's a block one way from the hotel and an IHop one block down the other way, so you can save a little money by eating there.

What we liked best- - This place was cheap, we booked about a week ahead of time. - It was clean and we never had any issues with anything in the room. - The pool was pretty nice and has a bar area, we spent most of our time here. It's shallow but has a waterfall and hot tub. - The buffet was surprisingly good! It was much better than the Sahara and I'm sorry we didn't go until the last day. What we liked least! - It took us almost two hours to check in (in this was at midnight). I think they had one or two people there. Everyone in line was extrememly upset and agravated and I was pretty sure a fight would break out sooner or later. The only thing that made it tolerable was it was fun to see everyone else freak out when they finally got to check in. - No fridge in room. But they'll \"rent\" a mini-fridge to you for 5 or ten bucks a day. - No wireless internet - They put 1/2 off coupons for the club in the lobby restroom, yet won't accept them! The manager would end up waving everyone through. Club still sucked... - You can only use your \"free\" admission to the tower during certain hours, AND it's a somewhat lengthy process. - AND MOST OF ALL- When it's busy it can take well over an hour to get down to the main part of the strip on the bus. We took the bus almost everywhere , because you can ride it all day for five bucks. A taxi might cost ten to fifteen one way. I think we spen four hours or so on the bus one day... Not a good way to spend your vacation... If you don't want to go down to the strip that much it's an ok option, but for this reason alone I think we'll spring for someplace closer to the action next time. -", "Date": "March 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cMy favorite place!!!\u201d", "Author": "crb_girl", "ReviewID": "UR14045774", "Content": "We traveled to Las Vegas for our Honeymoon 11-17-07.

This was after an hour and a half in a queue trying to check in! Ended up sleeping on the floor of another persons room! Next day insisted on speaking to the manager who eventually gave us another room after an hour of calling expedia who were as useful as an ashtray on a motor bike. Their response for requests to sort it out was to tell us there was nothing they could do. Will be taking legal action on this one. The hotel is tired and expensive with not much to do. Service was slow and i didn't get a free drink until the third day! Location is bad as it is half way between the nice hotels, Luxor etc. and downtown, which was one and a half miles away. Don't walk it though as the area is very dodgy with plenty of massage parlors and tags sprayed on walls. Note while we were there Vagas had five separate school shooting incidents according to local news reports. Not a place for families. Don't wander the streets at night and don't walk down any side streets. Stay on the main street if you want to be safe. Treat yourself and stay in New York if you can. Watch out for the hookers who pounce on you if you are wandering round the hotel when you can't sleep There pimps usually sit in the elevator lobby's.

The room was clean, and very affordable, but, it was very, very plain. We stayed on the 20th floor, and, fortunately, the elevators were very fast. Of course, you don't stay in your room much in Vegas, anyway. So, the hotel and room were fine, especially for those on a tight budget. There were plenty of slot machines $.01-$1) and tables (starting at $5) downstairs for those who are there to gamble, and the 2nd floor had plenty of shops and restaurants. This particular hotel, as most of them, allowed smoking inside everywhere, which was a bit annoying. The hotel was located at the older, less updated end of the strip, which is fine, because you can walk (remember the strip is 3 miles), or take a bus for $5.00 a day. Personally, I'd like to stay at a nicer and more modern hotel next time I visit ... one that allowed smoking in designated areas only, and on the nicer end of the strip, where you can visit the beautiful hotels and shows. Don't get trapped by the people trying to sell timeshares at resorts that hang around Circus Circus or other such hotels. They offer shows or money for slots, etc ($100) in exchange to hear the sales pitch for \"2 hours\" ... believe me, they take at least 4 hours!!! And, they're not fun. Been there, done that this time. We did get the $100 worth of food and slot money, but it came to $10/hr for the 2 of us, and took 4 hours out of our vacation. Then, the bus driver/ride that brought us back was like something out of a horror film.

Both will get you where you want to go very quickly.

The pool area was nice and clean, and although it isn't heated at this time of year, the heated jacuzzi tub was open. There were lots of lounges/towels available for suntanning. The temps were around 65F, but the area was protected by high walls, which keeps alot of the wind out. We ate at both Lucky's cafe and the Garden buffet, which are both ok. (We always rent a car, so we usually drive to South Point for their inexpensive but great buffets.) The casino wasn't as smoky as most, although it wasn't letting us win much on the slots. We find this casino a bit more relaxed and laid back compared to the busier casinos on the strip. As in all the casinos, bottled water is expensive. Note the store on the 2nd level sells water for 95cents a bottle! For some reason they were only using 1 elevator to get up to the top of the tower, so the wait was probably 20minutes. The view was great, and to see the faces of the people on the rides, was priceless!! We stayed at the Strat mostly so we wouldn't have to drive after dancing at their niteclub, Polly Esthers. We got in free before 11pm, because we were hotel guests. Wednesday nite it was almost empty, literally..Only 6 couples there, and by midnite, there was 1 couple left when we left.

The hotel was booked, but they were able to accommodate our request without hesitation. Our room was located on the 14th floor and faced \"Old Vegas\". Our room was fairly plain, but very clean and the mountain view was lovely. We had problems with our air conditioner and they immediately offered to move us, but since we wanted to remain close to our friends room, we asked if they could try and service the air conditioner first. If they couldn't fit it, then we'd move. We went out for a few hours and came back to have a note in our room say \"good to go\". Everything was fixed and we didn't have to move. The service was awesome!! The hotel was fabulous - not too big (unlike the MGM or New York New Yokr) and we could always find our friends carrousing in the casino. The restaurants were very good and portions were generous. Las Vegas has changed over the years and eating is not as cheap as it used to be. Be prepared to spend $10.00 on lunch and $15.00 on dinner. We ate breakfast at IHOP (1/2 block from the hotel). Our favorite place to eat within the hotel was \"Roxy's Dinner\". It's a 50's style eatery with your servers singing, dancing and getting the patrons involved with the act. At one time, I think I had a feather boa between my legs while doing a gogo dance - this is before I took a sip of my marguarita!! The live entertaining in the casino was fabulous: For starters, the free nightly show in the casino was always entertaining and you could enjoy it while playing the slots or card tables. American Superstars, which is a great impersonation show of popular singers was also amazing. I had \"Elvis\" sitting next to me forcing me to rub his thigh; then he took my hand and wiped the sweat of his face (grrrrossss, but it was all apart of the show). We had a good laugh!! The \"Top of the Tower\" facility is breathtaking (by day or night). You must do both to get a full appreciation of the magnitude of Vegas. While we didn't have time to go on the 3 rides which are available at the top, they looked like they would be a ton of fun. The shopping on the 2nd floor of the Strat was very good. From large souvenire shops, oxygen bars (yes, you can actually pay for a burst of oxygen to give yourself more energy), jewerly stores, even a McDonalds (for the thrifty eater) and everything in between. You can get great deals in the mall. The Strat. is also fairly close to the Premier Outlet Mall ( cha ching cha ching...get your credit card ready - you can get A LOT of stuff at unbelievalbe prices!!!) RECOMMENDATIONS: - Try to get a room 10 floors or higher for the view - Tip the cleaning staff - they work REALLY hard - Tip to the waitresses (while playing slots/cards) - they come around more frequent and the drinks are free, so what's a $1 or two? - Buy souvenire pictures - they're great memories and reasonable priced - if you're into rides, you must try the rides at the top of the tower - Use the monorail (at the Sahara - 1 block away from the Strat.): You can get to all the major hotels on this \"quickly\" - definitely worth the $9.00 for a 24 hr. pass) - Visit the Premier Outlet Mall - take a cab for $8.00 I'm leaving this comment for the end because it's the only negative thing about the Stratosphere: LOCATION. A crackhouse community is behind the Strat. and you really don't want to be wandering the streets after dark. This is a drawback as Vegas is a place where the night lights are fantastic. Take a short walk to the Sahara and jump on the monorail and get yourself into a better area before you walk around.

He found that the Stratosphere had all the amenities and the price we wanted, so we booked 2 nights there. The bed was clean although the sheets were threadbare in spots. The room had a very small bathroom that was not very clean at all. At least they had the individually wrapped plastic cups rather than glassware. It took quite a while for the heater to warm the room, and it was extremely noisy while running. On the plus side, the shower was excellent in comparison to most I had used while on this trip. Because the hotel/casino is on the Strip, they charge as much as most of the bigger casinos for food and amenities. So while the room was a reasonable price, everything else was very expensive. The shopping leaves a bit to be desired as well; most of the shops carry tourist items and souvenirs. The staff was polite and very helpful, with the exception of the valets. When we arrived to check in, the valet said we could not stop at the place where the hotel's signs had directed us to go. At no time did he inform us that the hotel was going to charge us a $5 per day fee for things such as tower access and VALET PARKING. If he had told us that, we would have taken advantage of the valet service! As it was, my partner had to go park the car and walk back through the cold while I checked in to the hotel. He was quite sick at the time and was unnecessarily exposed to further illness by that young man's inability to communicate clearly with us.

We rented a car and used Industrial Road (one block over) and Frank Sinatra Drive (intersects with Industrial) to bypass the Strip and use the back entranceways to all the Strip hotels. This saved at least 30 minutes every time we drove! The hotel itself isn't the most glamorous, but for the price, and the amenities, it's worth it. Plenty of casino action, very loose slots (won $150 with pennies), great sports book and good food choices. Speaking of food, do NOT eat at Roxy's Diner, as it is disgusting. You MUST eat at Fellini's in the hotel. It is a first class, but casual, Italian Restaurant and is THE BEST Italian food in Vegas! The rides atop the hotel are pretty good for a thrill (my 13 year old liked them, although not as thrilling as he would have liked) so check them out. Best view in Vegas. Caught American Superstars in the theater and it was a hoot. Very entertaining! If you stay at the Strat, make sure you ask for World 1 at the front desk. Parking is easy too. Other points of interest close by: Red Rock Canyon, and 2 blocks up is Tiffiny's Diner, a FABULOUS little throwback diner with the best omelettes and burgers in town. Just be careful if you go at night. All in all, a good hotel in a good location for a great price. If you rent a car, just make sure you have the back streets figured out before you go.

I slipped her a twenty and asked about the possibility of an upgrade to a room possibly with a whirlpool tub. Well, this girl was pretty green (as we say here in Canada) because after a whole bunch of searching, bringing over a more experienced staff member, taking at least ten minutes and finally getting me a room with a whirlpool which I think was at just the regular price, the two young women (whom I had a twenty each for) looked at me as if in a daze and said \"what's this for\" I guess not a lot of young people tip because they thought the money was for the casino to help pay for the upgrade. I found the whole ordeal quite amusing. The room was very average in everyway and had just a regular tub with a few jets. hah. hah. I hope those girls had fun with their twenty's. The free trip up the tower was great. What a view. My legs were shaky for a few minutes. We watched the rides for a few minutes and even thirty year old tough looking men were shrieking on them. I liked the feel of the casino. It was not at all packed in around the machines and I felt like I could relax without having several people within a few feet of me.

Hats off to a young man named Romal Bell--after the second day he remembered our name and was very kind --when we told him we waited over 30 minutes for our car at the Wynn he couldn't believe it. we ate at the luckys cafe at 3 in the morning and got great breakfast special for like 4 $$-i left a bag with shopping goodies in it and the next day we were able to get it back--nice to see some honest people around. all things considered --we had a good stay at the Strat!! i don't know if we would ever stay there again --as there are sooo many choices--but if you need to go on a budget--and you have a car - i highly recomend the Stratoshere!!", "Date": "December 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cNot bad for the price you pay\u201d", "Author": "JasonFSydney", "ReviewID": "UR11591476", "Content": "Stayed there for 10 days towards the end of November.

This was exactly the same this time and for a budget hotel we would have been quite happy to recommend this hotel until........on our 5th day we returned from a night out to find that a large number of clothes were missing from our room. We immediately reported this to the reception desk and were told that the maid had probably taken them for cleaning but that we should check with them again in the morning. The following morning we were advised by reception that nothing had been sent for cleaning and that we should report our loss to security. We did this and were told that the hotel may do video surveillance checks on the camera immediately outside our room but that was all they could do. We then asked them to contact the police so that we could make a report for our insurance company and were told by the security staff that they wouldn't contact the police but we could do so if we wished!! The following day we contacted the hotel risk manager who was supposed to have reviewed the video footage but to our surprise he had been to busy and as we were leaving town that day they would have to e-mail us with the results. We have since received an e-mail stating that we left the door open and so it was not the hotels problem but we know that the door was locked when we left as earlier in the week our friends had had a security issue with their room and so we always checked the door before leaving.

They were cleaning our room in the middle of the night and told us to wait out in the hall for 5 minutes.

Aside from these issues the room is okay the bed is okay (nowhere near as comfortable as beds at the Hilton or Marriott properties though). I would say the room itself is probably equal to what you find at a Quality Inn, or Best Western.The pool area is actually pretty good and one of the hotel's better features, but the pool is only open until 6pm. I did not gamble, see any shows or dine in the casino so I can't comment on those areas. The giftshop is extremely expensive as are all the shops in the Stratosphere. 2 ice creams at Ben & Jerry's was somewhere around $10. What normally costs me about $4 at my local Starbucks was $7 here.

We were both going through MAJOR stress in our lives and decided that it was a time for a change. We turned around went into the airport, and bought 2 RT tickets to Las Vegas. This is my 100th time in Las Vegas, however its my friends first trip to sin city. Since our plane wasn't leaving till 8:00 a.m. we had a lot of time to contact our families, jobs, and arrange for a hotel. Our hubby's weren't too pleased, and luckily we had vacation time. We reserved our room at the Stratosphere, through Hotels.com. 59.00 a night. Time to board the plane. Flight was on Midwest, and I can never say anything bad about there rides. There are smooth, service is friendly and I love the cookies. We landed around 10:30a. m. in Las Vegas. We are staying in sin city for a whole week. We needed a car and some clothes. Check in isn't till 3;00 p.m. we have plenty of time. We rented a PT cruiser Convertible through Payless car rental. CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP. It cost 250.00 for the whole week. Including all fee's, and taxes. We are off to get some clothes. We ended up at the 3 Goodwill clothing stores in Las Vegas and bought our wardrobe. Cheap Cheap. We spent less then 100.00 for a whole weeks wardrobe. For the record under garments were NOT purchased at the goodwill\u2019s. We arrived at Stratosphere around noon. Check in was not too long. Once at the desk we were pressured BIG time to upgrade to suite for a extra 50.00 a night. Tired of listening to this man we decided to upgrade. Room was ready. Yippee. We went to the room to unwind and take nap (we have been up now for at least 24 hours). The room was awesome. Very large, clean and well decorated. The room had a separate living area from the bedroom. The bedroom had a king size bed, large closets, and adjoining bathroom. The only bathroom. So if you have use it while someone is sleeping in the bed you WILL disturb them. We called laundry and had them pick up our clothes for cleaning and pressing. This was a bit pricey, but hell we needed something to wear. Plus they did a awesome job, and had to clothes back in our room, the same day, by dinnertime. After our nap we are off to gamble and party. Our first stop was the bar at the Stratosphere. What a waste of money. We ended up spending about 150.00 for Jack and Cokes and never caught a buzz. The Gambling sucked too. Being that we don\u2019t drink and drive our first night we stayed at the Stratosphere and partied between the 3 lounges. We did ended up switching to bottles of wine in order for us to get drunk. Which we successfully did. This is pretty much how our week went in Las Vegas. We had a BLAST that neither of us will ever forget in our lifetime. Oh yeah we left some secrets there too. Yes we both were in HUGE trouble with our spouses. In fact I am heading back out there in Feb with my hubby. I am paying for the entire trip. A little peace offering. I would recommend the Stratospere to someone. Keep in mind a couple things. Dont buy into the upgrade. It really isn't worth it. Drink from bottles if you wanna catch a buzz. Also if you are NOT renting a car. Please please becareful of the areas that surround this hotel. They are pretty rough at night. There is no coffee pot in the room, so buy a cheap one. It will save money then paying for a cup at starbucks. The rooms were clean, and service was good. The food at the buffet was good, and the cafe had awesome breakfast. The food court and shopping area was good too. I would recommend the spa as well. The spa is small.

We have all been to Vegas several times and stayed on the other end of the strip most of those vacations. We were just looking for an affordable place to stay and weren't too concerned with the location. We found a great deal through Southwest airlines. We didn't go in with any high expectations and we were really pleased considering how little we paid. When we checked in on Saturday they were really busy. The staff worked very quickly and were very helpful. They were able to get us rooms right across the hall from each other even with how busy it was. The rooms were older (kind of reminded me of a Motel 6 or something), but clean. My only complaint would be the pillows. That's an easy fix though. I'll be sure to bring my own next time. Our views were good too, especially at night. We could see the pool and the lights of the Sahara, Circus Circus, and many more. We really enjoyed the pool. Us girls only used the hottub, but the boys had fun playing basketball in the pool. There was also a volleyball net set up. I really wished it had been warmer because it would have been a lot of fun. The restaraunts were great too. We went to Roxy's which was a diner with live entertainment from the wait staff singing. It was fun. Don't order the long island ice teas though. They came in plastic bottles and they were like syrup! We had to keep adding water to them just to be able to drink them! We also went to Fellini's. They had great service and amazing food! Definitely reccommend it for a nice dinner. We also ventured up to the top. There is an awesome view of the city from up there. Two of us did the rides and they were serious adrenaline rushes. We did the Big shot (free fall) and the X Scream (hangs you off the edge of the Stratosphere). I am definitely glad I did it even though it was extremely scary! As far as the location, it was a bit more of a walk than we expected to get down towards Sahara, Circus Circus, Riviera, etc. It really wasn't too bad, but we were thinking they were a bit closer.

I had stayed twice in the past at the Orleans and liked it. However, I was traveling with a friend who had wanted to stay at the Stratosphere since our last trip to Vegas four years ago. Two years ago, I stayed at the Orleans with my wife and son. Check in was very late, about midnight. There was a fairly long line, but it moved fast and the service was efficient, courteous and friendly. We had booked a Premier Tower room and were given a room on the fifthteenth floor. The best views are to the West and down the strip. Our view was of the Stratosphere tower and toward the east. There are no bad views, unless you are on a low floor. We had great sunrises and the large window was designed to take advantage of the lovely mountain views and the cityscape. We very much enjoyed the view and left the curtains open. The room was extremely quiet without exception. The room was very clean and of adequate size, although I'd liked to have had a sitting area that might have required a few extra feet in room length plus comfortable chairs. We had a desk with two chairs where we had cocktails in the evening. There was a clock, iron and ironing board, adequate closet space and drawer space and adequate hangers. The queen beds were very comfortable and the linen superior. The TV and channel selection and reception were okay. The bathroom was plain but of generous size. This was a simple bathroom, perhaps below average in that the floor was vinyl and the counter only an attractive formica. The tub-shower was of a fiberglass or plastic that looked like white china and tile, but wasn't. Nevertheless, this was an absolutely terrific bathroom. It was very clean. The shower was great and the tub was very comfortable. It even had built-in arm rests. Hot water was almost instant and easy to adjust. A lotion, an all in one shampoo-conditioner, and an all purpose soap were provided. Nothing fancy, but okay, especially for guys. The Gerber toilet was pressurized and used 1.6 gallons per flush. It was the best toilet I have ever had in a hotel room. My son lives in Japan with a Toto toilet with heated seat and bidet functions and on and on, which I like, but I've never seen a toilet flush better than this one. The maid service was friendly and top-noich. The hotel charges a $5 a day resort charge for which you get free tower access 10 to 2 and discount coupons and the swimming pool and fitness center. The fitness center is very modest compared to that at the Orleans, but the Orleans costs $10 per person per day after your one free day of use. The swimming pool is free form but quite long. I swam laps every morning, usually going out about 6:30 AM. This week of Nov 4-Nov 9 was quite warm for November, setting a couple of records. The hot spa by the pool has heated waterfalls coming down. It is a great social place and sitting in the flow of the larger waterfall itself is a delight. All and all the other guests we met were very nice people. There is a pool bar, whcih got very swinging a couple of times while I was out there. The pool area is situated to take advatage of the fabulous western mountain view, looking out over the green swath of Summerlin. In the clear morning air, the red stone in the mountains is breathtaking. I doubt any Vegas hotel pool area has a superior view. We ate at the buffet once. Nothing special, but okay. We went up the tower once. We'd done the rides before, but we did the big shot ride again. About 4 gees of excelleration followed by a negative gee fall. Quite exciting, but also quite a short, intense ride for the money. This tower visit is a must see in Las Vegas. We had bargain prime rib dinners in Lucky's Cafe three times, plus one breatfast there. It is a good cafe but not exceptional by Vegas standards. The service is good and very friendly. We have absolutely no complaints, only praise for this hotel and its service. There are lots of places to eat at the Stratosphere. There are two Starbucks. Good variety. The McDonalds is very good with normal McDonald prices. On their dollar menu, they even had a Sausage McMuffin with Egg. The shopping area is surprisingly large. I had bought a clock in the Venetian shops a few years ago. The same clock was much cheaper in the Stratosphere mall. I would suggest people shopping in Vegas visit this mall before making purchases in the beautiful shops down the strip. I did buy a Seiko Kinetic watch in a Stratosphere shop for $187.50. It was something I'd wanted for a long time and had priced many places. Dick and I took excursions in our rented car to St. George, Utah, a town with magnificent mesa landscapes. To get there, you pass through spectacular the Virgin River Gorge in the polygamous Arizona strip. Another day we drove up 95 to the Lee Canyon Road and took it up to the pine forests, reaching nearly 8500 feet. We then took the connector route south through the fabulous mountains to the Kyle Canyon road, visiting the visitor center and the lodge at the end of the road at about 7700 feet, where we had a late breakfast by a fireplace with unreal panoramic views. We could have eaten on the outside patio, and it was just warm enough to do so. There were people eating on the patio. From this lodge, set among the soaring cliffs of the nearly 12,000 foot Mt. Charleston and the vast forests with its magnificent Ponderosa Pines, back to Las Vegas city limits takes only 25 minutes by car. Now, Las Vegas sprawls over a gigantic area, so reaching the city limits still leaves you a long way to go back on 95 to I-15 and downtown. We could not believe how few people were out that day - last Wednesday - to take advantage of the wildness and the beauty. Our last day, we did the Laughlin trip, even dipping into California for a couple of minutes. We had lunch in Bull Head City, Arizona, looking out at the swift flowing Colorado River. During our stay, I walked the stip from the Stratosphere. It is true that the location of this hotel at the far north end of the strip in not ideal, but lots of construction is bringing new hotels and time shares and condos up the stip to the doorstep of this hotel. During our stay we saw The Phantom at the Venetian, A Holiday Celebration on Ice at the Orleans (which will be shown on NBC on Christmas Day), Mama Mia at the Mandalay Bay, Ka at the MGM Grand, and Spamalot at the Wynn. Mama Mia was our favorite. The performance, music, cast -- all terrific. I lusted in my old heart after Vicki Van Tassel, who played Tanya. I hope to see her on stage again. Dick admitted to me that her beauty intimated him and it reminded him of a teacher he loved and was awed by in fourth grade. But, we are old men. It made me think about a song from \"New Faces of 1952,\" about being in love with one's teacher.", "Date": "November 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lancaster, PA", "Title": "\u201cGood Hotel for the Price in Vegas\u201d", "Author": "draftingbatman", "ReviewID": "UR10692059", "Content": "We stayed at the hotel on a Monday night.

Watch out for the room upgrade, we were offered one for $20 a night extra and took it, Players room on the 23rd of 24 floors overlooking the strip. Agreed, tipped the clerk $50 then told to come back as the room wasn't ready (3.00pm). When we did so at 8.00pm the clerk was off duty, we were given a completely different room on the 11th floor, overlooking the car park and big ventilation system, smelling of smoke. We changed back to our original room. $50 down already... 2. The rooms are OK, the higher up the better. Maid service is good, 9-5pm. If you're at the back of the hotel you'll be woken by the train horn at all hours, and it's LOUD. Pool is good, gym is OK, music by the pool is good but far too loud... 3. Take some walking shoes as it's 2 miles to downtown and 6 miles to the Mandalay Bay at the end of the strip, altough you can get the train from the Sahara down the street. A cab is around $10+ tip. 4. If you do walk down the strip it's a bit like a building site at the moment with all the construction going on. Lots of touts and shameless Mexicans touting for whores, giving out calling cards - time the city cleaned this up... 5. If you walk to downtown, don't do it after dark as you're passing all kinds of dodgy bars, clubs and 'rent by the hour' motels - lots of pimps, pushers, hookers, panhandlers, bums etc hanging around. Called in 7-11 one evening for some gas and when I paid and got back to the car my partner was surrounded by them, like something out of that zombie movie 'Night of the Living Dead'. 6. The drinks in the hotel are pretty pricey, around $5 for a bottle of beer and they aren't as loose with the freebies as they used to be when it was Bob Stupak's Vegas World. 7. The Legends show is OK if you get the 2 for 1 tickets, ($42 pair) but the lounge acts are dire. 8. The Courtyard buffet is good, $11 a head from 7am-11am, all you can eat - even cheaper if you have a coupon. Never tried Roxys diner, the waitresses do karaoke as you eat, too expensive and too greasy. Luckys diner was good after 12.00 midnight, steak, eggs, hash browns and toast for $7.00 - excellent. 9. Use the coupons they give you when you check in to save money - $10 craps freeplay, $25 blackjack, food, gifts etc. 10. Watch out for the timeshare touts inside offering you a free dinner and show for attending a 90 minute 'presentation' of selected properties. Watch out if you go fly/drive as they'll try to sting you at the airport for an upgrade/insurance ($400+ extra!) Book a Mustang convertible online from one of the search engines before you go, around \u00a3180 all in, although you don't really need a car unless you're off to the Hoover Dam / Grand Canyon, as traffic is a nightmare on the strip and it's quicker to walk. All kinds of stuff to rent on the strip from Scooters to Harleys, Vipers to Ferraris, 57 Bel Airs and 68 GTO's - You can even rent a Lamborghini Gallardo for 5 hours, $1200 plus insurance, but you're only allowed 75 miles...

I'll start with the good - the pool area was great and had ample space for guests (well in october anyway, don't know about peak season) and a nice pool bar which wasn't too expensive. The water in the pool was a bit too col to get in but the hot tub was reat and the music played around the pool area was varied and bearable. The breakast buffet was quite good - the omellette station i found was completely addictive and generally good - however, some things would have been a bit better if they were cooked to order rather than left to congeal or go stale. The Top of The World restaurant was exquisite (sp?) and i cannot fault the 3 courses we had one bit - I can however, say that we felt really rushed out by the waiting staff who brought out our main course and dessert immediately after the course before. Because we had only just finished chewing our amazing fillet of beef, we had to leave our dessert - we needed maybe 15 minutes rest time instead of 1. Then when we had 'finished' our dessert our waiter said he wouldn't 'tell' of we sneaked out with our rinks to the upstairs observation level - just felt really rushed out of the place which is a shame when paid $200 for the pleasure of being there for just over an hour. Now, the not so good - our room had a bad smell to it the whole time we were there which we pin-pointed to the sink. Our sheets may/may not have been changed during our stay. The casino itself smelled musty and was really, really smokey at times. Dinner at the twice zagat rated Fellinis Italian restaurant would have been better if my carbonnara hadn't have had dried 'baco-bits' in rather than ham or real bacon - come on, how hard is it guys? Also, even though the breakfast bufet was good food, the choice never varies but on a friday and saturday you get charged more for exactly the same. And on sunday it goes up to something like $32 for 2 because they have a champagne breakfast - now, i'm no tee-total but what if i was? Sorry, but champagne isn't my regular morning tipple. Nothing else was different on the buffet - $10 extra to say 'no' to a glass of champage and stick to my regular apple juice and omellete. Booking our late check-out wasn't as easy as we had hoped - the lady at the counter, pleasant though she was, forgot to give us our late check out key which we were unaware we needed. Half an hour latere whilst we were in bed, our phone rings to let us know we need to pick it up. When we go down for it the next day (and it wasn't just dwn the corridor let me tell you!!) the unhelpful guy demanded to see our ID even though we'd given him our name and room number. We'd left our passports in the room so we had to go up and then back down again to get the key we'd already paid $30 for. The 'new members bonus club' promotion was not explained to us in the slightest, even when we asked it to be, we were met with a semi-vacant face who seemed to not understand that WE did not understand the system - therefor our '$200 in slot and comp went wasted. Having said all this, we didn't have a bad view from our room as long as you didn't look down onto the carpark and we won $40 on a 1 cent slot machine. I'd go back to the straosphere if i had to but to be perfectly honest, it's location and the above mentioned points would probably tempt me elsewhere - i'd rather pay a bit more money for better strip location and generally better service - although whether it's pool area can be beaten remains to be seen...", "Date": "October 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bay Area", "Title": "\u201cGetting Worse......\u201d", "Author": "BayAreaVegasbaby", "ReviewID": "UR10389401", "Content": "Been to the Strat every year since they opened. This last trip I had was not pleasant at all. The rooms were musty. Bed sheets may have been changed but not thoroughly dried and had that \"wet towel\" smell to it. The bathroom had hair on the floor and a dirty towel hanging on the shower curtain. My worse problem was with the valet. I brought my rental to the valet in excellent condition. When I picked it up the next morning, it had noticeable damage to it. The cameras at the valet can easily prove that it was dropped off in undamaged condition. Of course Statosphere is not obligated to release their tapes, especially if they are at fault and it would incriminate themselves! So they told me that I dropped off the car damaged! Now, it is a big dragging mess between the Strat, rental company, and my insurance. Yes, I should have purchased the insurance, but the price of the insurance was more than the rental itself and I didn't think about it at the time....Anyway, I can only hope this casino will change for the better. After the sale of the Strat at the end of the year, hopefully, they will clean up their act. The rooms are too small and dirty and the buffet is not spectacular.

It is on the far north end of the strip, a little far for most people to walk to the more densely populated parts of the strip, but also more convenient to get to downtown Las Vegas, which has a little more reasonably priced shopping and (so I'm told, we're not gamblers) looser slots and better odds, in an attempt to attract people away from the strip. We spent a couple ($10?) on quarter slots on the strip and more than made it back downtown, but we're not gamblers. And it is actually a very pleasant walk under the sunscreen vaults. Check-in was the worst part. Check in is 3:00, but I'm told they'll let you at 1:00 if you press (we didn't). Checkout at 11:00, but you can pay $20 or $30 to check out at 6:00 PM. If you check in during the afternoon, expect at least a half-hour to an hour wait. When I checked in I told them that the room absolutely needed to be clean with absolutely no smoke smell. They shifted me to a higher floor than they originally offered, and it was as requested. Expect a $5 resort fee per night stay. The linens seemed very clean, even the thermal blanket looked brand new. A/C worked well. The faucet had a small leak when turned on high that dribbled onto the lavatory countertop. The whole room looked freshly painted, with relatively new tile in the shower. All the parts of the hotel we saw (although we didn't do much there) were very clean and in good shape. Buffet was very substandard. There are some thrill rides high atop the tower, not for those with high axiety. Tower access is free for guests, rides are not. Stratosphere's shows sounded well below average quality to us (we didn't go to them). Hotel staff was polite, but not very helpful. In general, they were far more congenial than your average Las Vegan though!!! I have never witnessed so many painfully impatient and dismissive people in my life as we endured in Las Vegas. Not the vacationers though! Almost all of the people on vacation that we met were great. We only met two Las Vegans who were remotely friendly in the course of their jobs, and most will give you made-up information just to not have to talk to you anymore. From our experience, do NOT trust that you were given the correct info. on times, events, or locations of ANYTHING unless it is specifically that person's job to give out information about, or sell tickets for, the specific activity that you are looking for!!! You may end up missing or not finding it, and half the \"regular\" activities, even ones advertised in the events magazines, were not actually open while we were there. Contrary to what we had heard, we didn't need to book shows in advance. Nothing was sold out while we were there, and you can get tickets 25%-50% off in the ticket stores to be found along the strip. If you absolutely have to have tickets to a certain, popular event, then get them ahead of time. They also sell vouchers for restaurants that can save money if you know where you want to eat ahead of time. (Typically not available for restaurants that do really booming business though.) You WILL be approached in practically every building and on the sidewalks of the strip to participate in high-pressure sales pitches (tours) for time-share properties. Ignore them, and they'll leave you alone. Or, if you don't mind giving up about 3 hours of your vacation time, you can get a cheap (sometimes free) show for enduring the standard schpiel. The \"free gambling money\" they offer is about worthless though, as it is credits for \"promotional\" slot machines that have about as much chance of paying out anything as winning a powerball lottery. Expect lots of construction. We felt very safe in the heavily populated areas of the strip, and at all the major resorts. But you don't have to go far from Stratosphere, Sahara, or Circus Circus to get to places you may not want to be walking at night. A lot of hype about the Treasure Island pirate show, is about that. A few neat fireworks, but it's about worth about what it costs (free). If you've not seen a Cirque Du Soleil show, they're pretty neat acrobatics, but typically very weird and with no plot (but, hey, it's French, so what do you expect?)

Our flight was actually delayed, so by the time we got to the Stratosphere Hotel it was actually early in the morning of the 18th. Vegas is the city that never sleeps so that was no big deal! Now we are not picky people at all, but we had problems the moment we arrived at the hotel. First we had to find parking, which was pretty full at that time being that we arrived so late. Then we had to find our way to the lobby to check in. I'm not sure if I'm the only one, but I found the hotel layout to be quite confusing. Our major dilemma of the trip occurred next. The hotel checkin staff informed us that they were very busy and that we were being upgraded for one night only because they didn't have any standard rooms available. So we were quite excited thinking that this was our lucky day, and then we went to our room. We opened the door and here this male voice \"get out of here\" and this lady comes out of the bedroom in a bathrobe!!! So back down we go to the lobby and get reassigned to a new room. This time it's a standard room so I'm not sure what all the song and dance was about not having any available. The hotel did give us free breakfast at the buffet restaurant (approx. $24 value) for our inconvenience. The buffet was good, I would eat there again if I go back. So we finally got checked in and settled into our room and we were starving, so we decided to get something to eat. We went to the IHOP just down the street and discovered exactly what kind of neighbourhood we were in. Not exactly the nicest part of town!! Our room in the Stratosphere was decent. It was also clean. The first night I did not sleep well because the roller coaster at the Sahara (hotel across the street) kept me awake. Other than that we had no problems with the room itself. The location of the Stratosphere (far end of the strip) was not really a problem for us. We walked the whole strip then took the Las Vegas Tram back to the hotel at the end of the day (mostly because I had blisters from so much walking, otherwise we would have walked!) I also enjoyed the slot machines at the Stratosphere, as that is where I won some $$ (on penny slots!!) And the view from the top of the tower is amazing. I was going to pay to go up at night, but we ran out of time. 3 nights is too short especially if you arrive later than expected on the first night.

We made our reservations directly with Stratosphere because they had the cheapest rates compared to other websites. First off, I would like to state the problems we had with this hotel. When we called Stratosphere to make our reservations, we made them for the Premiere Tower because it was only a few extra dollars and more recently renovated than the World Towers. Check in was easy and fast and after being in our room for about 5 minutes, my husband realized we weren't put in the Premiere Tower. We called down to the front desk and they told us this is the room we booked. After letting them go, we realized it wasn't right that we paid the extra money to be put in a more renovated room so we called again and they did eventually put is in the right tower. We felt like they were trying to rip us off. We were meeting friends from Canada that also booked the Premier Tower and were placed in World Tower instead (not a problem for them, I guess) The next day, we felt like we were trying to get ripped off again. We were at the front desk and noticed all the signs all over stating that you could get a late check out and during the week, you can stay till 6:00 pm for only 20 extra dollars. Since our flight wasn't leaving till after 6:00, we talked to the lady about getting a late check-out. She told us the price was $30.00 even though signs were posted all over saying $20.00. Needless to say, we decided not to do the late checkout at that time and waiting closer to our departure date. They did wind up charging us the $20.00, instead of $30.00 but we couldn't help but feel like they were trying to scam us out of money. But anyway, other than those two problems, we thought the hotel was pretty descent. We enjoyed the fact that it wasn't in the heart of the strip. It was nice to spend the day on the busy strip and come back to a hotel that was just far enough away from the hustle and bustle. Our room(s)...World Tower and Premier Tower were average rooms. Nothing fancy, nothing nasty, just okay...but that is what we were going for anyways. We had two double beds cause that was what was available. The beds were comfy and the room served its purpose, as we barely spent any time in it anyways. The casino at the Stratosphere is actually very nice. I was expecting something old and dingy from reading past reviews, but this was nice. Drinks came around quite and bit and we even won on some machines. The ate at Roxy's Diner and Lucky's which are both on site. Lucky's was nice cause it's open 24/7 and they're food is pretty good. Roxy's Diner was a blast and we thought it was so cute. All the workers sing and dance and it's just neat to watch. You could tell staff at Roxy's enjoy they're job and it makes dining there very enjoyable. Definitly check that out...oh, and they're food is great! We both had a BBQ Pork sandwich and it was the best we ever had! Simple pleasures, I guess! We didn't see any shows here but we did get the pass to ride the rides at the top of the Stratosphere Tower. The view up there is excellent! The rides are fun and super scary! I love amusement park rides but a couple of these scared me enough to only go on them once! So much fun though! There are plenty of gift shops on site and some have excellent prices too. There are other places to eat right in the building too so that was kinda nice. Checkout was easy and there are plenty of cabs and shuttles waiting out front to take you to the airport.

They put in some sort of \"ozone\" cleaner for an hour or so, but that had no apparent effect. I had to go out and buy a room deodorizer which helped a little.

So we went to Valet Parling and asked where to go as a hotel guest and I guess they just didn't like that we weren't arriving in a Ferrari so they send us away to self parking which is REALLY far away from the actual occasion. We just took our handbaggage to go to the reception and thank god. We had to cross the whole casino which is about 10 minutes to walk to reach the reception desk. We felt like we were disturbing and then they told us they have no more non-smoking rooms (in a hotel with about 10.000 rooms ?!?) but they would give us \"...a little nicer room. A mini suite with no extra charge.\" The mini suite was a terrible (but clean) smoking room with no window to open to let fresh air inside but it had 2 square meters more than the other rooms with a chair and a small table. There's no breakfast service (they were almost laughing when we asked for it, but it doesn't say anything about it when you book the room on their website. You might not bother when you're American but as a European I'm used to having a breakfast in the morning. Also: Do not book the rooms through their website. You can only choose a preferred room type so you never know in which kind of room they will put you in the end). Pool access from 7AM to 7PM. Nice pool. \"Free Tower Access\" only from 10AM to 2PM. So - for Vegas it's still cheap. If you stay there and you arrive: Take the Valet Parking Lane and ask for their baggage service. They'll park your car (for free) and tag your baggage with a number. When you get to your room you call them, say the number and they bring it up (it's for free too).

This hotel provided the three main things we look for in a hotel-it was clean, the plumbing worked and the beds were comfortable. Being budget conscious we stayed in a World Tower room and the room was a good size and was cleaned and the towels changed everyday. We spent very little time in the room anyway as for us it's just a place to sleep, stow our luggage and have a shower. We don't understand previous comments about the staff being rude and unhelpful-everyone we spoke to (receptionists, restaurant staff, bar staff, casino staff etc etc) were friendly and helpful. My one gripe is some staff need to know more about the place they are working in-we needed to catch a tour coach from the West Lobby of the hotel, 2 seperate staff members told us it was the main entrance which is wrong and we missed it! Yes, you will have to wait in a queue to check in but it's a big hotel and there are always lots of guests arriving and departing and the receptionists work as fast as they can-deal with it! We ate at the Coutyard Restaurant several times for breakfast and dinner. It is the biggest buffet I have ever seen and the food is good. We also ate at Roxys Diner-friendly staff, a great atmosphere and good food. The hotel is at the northern end of the Strip. The airport shuttle will charge you as for a downtown hotel to get here but its still cheap ($8 per person). All the hotels look closer than they are because they are big but they aren't-be aware of this if you don't like walking. It will take you a day to explore one side of the strip on foot but it really is the best way to see it. You will be fine heading south towards the strip on foot but head north and you enter a poor area and you need to go through this if you want to reach downtown and Fremont Street,. In daylight you will be ok walking here as along as you are not alone. After dark or if alone is better to get a taxi if you need to pass through here. Don't let this put you off the Stratosphere as my partner and I always felt safe. Oh, and you have to do the Tower at least twice.

It clings right onto the northern end of the Strip though the taxi shuttle from the airport counted it as being downtown and charged me more! The main advantage of staying at the Stratosphere is the reasonable price for slightly above basic accommodation. For a single traveller like me, I would rather spend less on the hotel room (where I intend to spend as little time as possible) and put the savings towards a show, meal, etc. The view from the Premier Tower is quite nice but can also be quite rundown from lower rooms on other towers. Check in has always been slow with a long line. There's also a compulsory $5 per day 'resort charge', which gives free tower admission from 10am-1pm daily and a few other fringe benefits. The check in clerk tried to bully me with the fact that he didn't have any rooms in my class when I had pre-booked and paid for but I stuck to my guns and got an upgrade. The Stratosphere isn't anywhere as plush as some Strip hotels but I don't think you can expect that for the amount you pay. There are quite a few eating options though not all of them are open everyday. I enjoyed the buffet which fills you up. The overnight diner offers some very cheap meals with coupons readily available. There's an outdoor pool and spa bath on the 8th floor. Reasonable size with a volleyball net set up and basketball hoops and balls freely available. There's also a table tennis table and a bar in the pool area. The ride to the top of the tower is compulsory in my opinion, especially at night when the neon really brings the town to life. There are indoor and outdoor observation decks and yes, the thrill rides at the top of the tower do shake it, so don't worry - it's not an earthquake! There are also a lot of laughs to be had from watching the faces of the thrillseekers on the rides. I love roller coasters but even I was a bit worried at the look of X Scream and Insanity. They are certainly unique ride experiences because of the location. There are a couple of shows on - American Superstars, a tribute show which was entertaining and available cheap with coupons, and Bite which I didn't watch. There's a shopping mall with more down market but cheaper stalls than some of the lavish Strip hotels. I didn't find travelling along the Strip that bad - it's a 5 minute walk to the Sahara hotel and the monorail which has 7 stops along the Strip and takes 15 minutes to travel to the other end of the line at the MGM.

It was a comfortable room, however the maids were loud the next morning as they were cleaning other rooms down the hall. Maybe the hall itself amplified the noise. The casino was okay--it had a sort of party atmosphere and the machines (video Black Jack) seemed to payout decently.

I was also a bit miffed that the windows did not open, but since the room had decent climate control I didn't mind too much. The casino was a standard casino... no different, really, from the Indian casinos I've been to here in Northern California. We went to a lot of the bigger hotels along the main part of the strip in our sightseeing and noticed that all their casinos were very themed and a bit more professional looking than back at the Strat. Although, the Strat did have the cheapest minimum Blackjack tables we found ($5) other than TI. So being Blackjack players, we did most our gambling back at our home base for the weekend. The layout was pretty confusing too. I usually got pretty turned around, but by the 4th day of our trip we knew generally where things were. I also appreciated that the shops were on the second floor and we weren't forced to go through them on our way to any attractions, unlike some of the larger hotels. A brief word on the pool... it's on the 8th floor, which to us was a bit deceiving. We assumed that it had to be an indoor pool since the hotel has about 24 floors. Not true... it's out on what I assume is the roof of the casino. Generally nice, decent bar, lots of family activities. There's a volleyball net set up with water polo type balls floating around and a few basketball hoops set up along the side. There was plenty of chairs, but not enough shade. Wasn't the best pool we saw in our sightseeing at the other hotels, but it was definitely a better pool than your average hotel. We did decide, however, that despite the price we would not stay there again. As I mentioned, the room was nothing special and it was so far away from the main part of the strip (like Janelle H said, it was way farther away from everything than we thought it would be) that cab rides to any of the other hotels ranged from $10 to $15. We didn't do any real calculations, but figured we'd probably spent enough to cab fees to cover the cost of staying at a nicer hotel closer to the heart of the strip.

We went to the American Superstars show which was fab and included in the ticket was the chance to go to the Romance Lounge at the top of the tower it was breathtaking the views were unbeleivable and the lounge was really romantically decorated, the staff were good up there too it was a different world up there. My only one gripe with this hotel was the night club they have there Pollyesters you can get in for free but once you are in there all the seats were reserved so you had to stand all night and the drinks prices were so expensive it cost close to $20 for a bottle of beer and a diet coke which was more ice than drink.

However, when we got to our hotel and got checked in, we could not have been happier.

Sure, we were a little away from the \"Strip\", but who cares? I mean, you could stay at the MGM and want to visit the Venetian, and you are still going to either have to cab it or walk. Might as well save some room money for those cab rides! And its not like we really had to cab around that much as it was, we never wnated to leave the hotel. We won 970.00 dollars at the slots at the Strat and not only did it pay for our vacation, but afforded us the luxury of being able to eat at The Top of the World restaurant, which is at the top of the Strat. Great food, great service (which is rare in Vegas) and all in all just one hell of a good time. The only thing with which we were not entirely satisfied with was the check in time. It is at three, so if you are there early, you are stuck till then. The casino was lots of fun, the room service was FAST and HOT, the bathroom rocked, and there was a digital safe in the room for those of you who don't care to stroll around Las Vegas looking to get mugged.

The Stratosphere is indeed very cheap (even cheaper once we complained) but the service and cleanliness of the hotel did nothing to inspire a second visit. I suppose it started on booking, I didn't receive an email confirmation although they money had been taken and I had a confirmation code, I'm easily panicked though so I attempted to contact the hotel but they don't seem to be a bit fan of email only phone (and I'm not a big fan of phoning the US from the UK). After taking over half an hour to check in (felt longer because we'd just got off a 10hr flight) we were told that there were no more Non-smoking rooms available and we would have to take a Smoking room, not great when both of us are asthmatics! Apparently it says in the hotels T&Cs that Non-Smoking rooms are not guaranteed and that this is the normal process (never had this before anywhere else!) Hotel room smelt of an ashtray, I'm sure even a Smoker would have protested, not even a heavy dose of airfreshner did the trick. My partner complained to the front desk and was told they'd put a purifier in there to help. They didn't... we did the typical British thing and gave up the complaining as it obviously wasn't working! We did however notice that the cleaner had not bothered to actually dust the room and obviously hadn't bothered for quite a while and so there were various surfaces we just didn't put things on for fear of disturbing the well settled dust. We did in the end complain on check out, although they weren't too bothered about our health reasons for not wanting a smoking room they seemed to be more worried about the dust...a discount was given thankfully and although it didn't spoil my first impressions of Vegas I won't be going back to this hotel there are far nicer ones actually on the strip like Bill's Gambling Hall!

The area isn't the best but it's not bad either. Finding the hotel is somewhat easy because of the huge tower that is on the property site. However because of its size it's a bit of a maze trying to find the guest parking. Like the hotel which basically has a 'World' and 'Premiere' part, the parking is divided accordingly. It's advisable to park in the right part depending on the side of the hotel you're booked. You'll probably only find this out after checking in, but just be aware. I paid to stay in the Premiere part of the hotel which is more modern. On arrival I was offered a room with a strip view for $10 a night extra, which I foolishly went for. I then discovered that this was in the older ' World' part of the hotel and the room stunk of smoke and was not as modern as I was expecting. The 'strip view' was not really up to much, seeing part of the strip but not the whole length. I managed to get moved to the Premiere part but they claimed that I'd only booked rooms in the older part so refused to refund the $10 per night. I had to later go down with my confirmation to demonstrate otherwise and the hotel then promptly adjusted my account. Checking into the hotel is a pain as you are forced to walk through a busy casino on your way to registration. Registration desks were plentiful and I only waited 10 minutes. However when I checked out the lines were at least 40 minutes or so, so I used the self checkout option Once settled, the hotel room was of a good standard with reasonable amenities, but no fridge. They appear to want to keep you there, which is a reasonable strategy. There's a load of restaurants and mall style boutique shops within the hotel at reasonable prices. You also get access to the tower included in the cost of the room (if you get the resort fee included). This is a must-do event, as you get breathtaking views from the viewing gallery. There's also some white knuckle rides to tempt you at the pinnacle of the tower. I didn't try any of these as they looked horrendous, mostly involving tipping you off a tower nearly 1,000 ft up, but probably best do this at night for the ultimate thrill. For the price I paid I think this was a reasonable hotel and probably one of the finest value in Vegas.

They booked there on our recommendation. I hoped that things would look up after check in. WRONG. The line for check in was huge. We waited around 40 minutes whilst the 2 staff on duty worked the check-in desk. We had booked 2 non-smoking room but were immediately told that only smoking rooms were available. We pointd out that both our bookings were confirmed as non-smoking and were told that under no circumstances was that guaranteed. I asked where on their booking wesite this was made clear at the time of booking - see customer services was the response. We argured that as my son and his girlfriend are both on prescription medication for asthma, a smoking room was unsuitable. No change in her attitude. Clearly you DON'T GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR - they had already charged us for the room at the time of booking. Having spent 10 hours on a flight plus the check in time at the airport, plus queuing at immigration and car hire - we just wanted somewhere to rest. We took the rooms - the stench was really strong. The pillows and bedding were saturated with smoke. We went out for some air freshener. We tried to move room the next morning - the staff were not at all interested. We stayed at 8 more hotels this trip and all gave us exactly what we had booked. Customer Services at the Stratosphere clearly don't care. The room was reasonably clean.

We were able to see the sun set over the Mountains as well as the Strip below us light up, as we viewed the entire city while the restuarant revolve a full 360 degrees during the hour and half that we were enjoying our meal. After our meal we wen to the Show at the Stratasphere titled \"Bite\" (not recommeded for children, adults only) The show was great for my Husband, as the girls danced around topless, The only regret was that the male preformers in the show did not entertain the women of the audience as well as the men were entertained, with one exception, the lead male singer, not bad looking, and he had a voice that made your heart go pitter patter. Overall Bite was an excellent choice for an after dinner show. My husband and I were so pleasantly suprised after reading some bad reviews, that our suggestion is to try it, and remember, don't believe every thing you read and don't try to go completely as if you were on a shoestring budget, let yourself enjoy your surroundings, You too will be as wonderfully surprised as we were. Stratsphere won our hearts. Hats off to them and to their employees. The only thing sad was that our Camera broke and we were unable to get the photos that we were hoping for.", "Date": "August 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bayville, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cStratosphere? No Problem!\u201d", "Author": "Bobadoochi", "ReviewID": "UR8395975", "Content": "Let me start by saying that I'm an average working man from Jersey who enjoys going away on vacation every year. When I book a vacation I normally choose the \"middle of the road\" package deal. A clean, comfortable room with a descent view, courteous hotel service and a pool is all I need. This is exactly what I got and then some when my Fiance and I stayed at the Stratosphere for 5 nights back in June. If you want first class? I suggest you pay the extra money and get a suite at the Stratosphere or stay at one of the 5 star hotels further down the strip. Dinner was good at the Courtyard Buffet with a very wide selection of food. No complaint on the quality of the cooking either. I tried the breakfast buffet at Lucky's it's very small but had all the basic breakfast food I enjoy eating. In the casino I played roulette for the first time. The dealers were very friendly and helpful and made me feel real comfortable about being a first timer. If you enjoy celebrity impersonators then go see the American Superstars show, it's very entertaining. If your an Elvis fan? Darren Lee A.K.A. Elvis will knock your socks off. He's the next best thing to being the real deal. Location! Location! Sure it's the last hotel on the north end of the strip , you know that when you book it. Face it, anywhere you go on a vacation there is going to be some degree of walking. You catch the \"Deuce\" bus right in front of the hotel, it costs $5.00 per person for 24 hours of service. When you want to get off and walk you do so, you get tired and want to cool off? get back on again. The bus will also take you Downtown to the Freemont Street Experience. Would I stay at the Stratosphere again? Absolutely! But, I liked Freemont Street so much I think the next time I vacation in Vegas I want to stay in a hotel Downtown. If you are thinking of booking the Stratosphere, relax your making a good decision. Believe me when I tell you you'll have a nice time. Good Luck! And don't forget to check out the pool.

I called the front desk three times to get a room change; was told we were in a nonsmoking room already, which was a lie. After another 40 minutes, we were given a nonsmoking room on a nonsmoking floor. We were also charged a $5 resort fee which we wouldn't use anyway because we were there for one night. Since it took so long to get a new room, they took off the resort fee (Ooooooo!!!). My husband was also ripped off $5 at the vending machine to get one bottle of water.

I am glad I did because it was literally you \"get what you paid for\". I got my trip off Expedia.com and this was the most reasonable rate for lodging I could find that was on the strip. After I got my baggage from McCarran airport I checked in without any hassle. They gave me two room keys and explained the rules. My room was located in elevator number one section which is actually behind the tower and staircase to the \"r\" level of shops. I stayed on the sixth floor. As with most casino's you have to walk through the gaming area to get to anywhere. I got into my room and it was clean and had all the basic necessities with an ironing board, iron, TV, a table and two chairs. There was a place to hang clothes which was nice. The decor is sort of strange I have to admit. There is a sort of olive color on the carpets with strange tans mixed in. It was not that big of a deal with me as with other reviewers. Being you are on a budget in the first place you should not complain because there are far worse places to stay. This is not the Bellagio. The staff was helpful and was accomodating if there was a problem. As far as eating the casino has the basic buffet for $7.50 all you can eat breakfast. The dinner was about $14.00. I could not comment on lunch because I was already out most of the time. You have to walk all through to the back of the casino to get there which is kind of a pain. There is a small lounge to the right called \"Oasis\" showing video's of major concerts and then major league sports on the weekend. I sat in there a couple of nights watching the Eagles and Eric Clapton. In the mornings they have a travel kiosk by \"Lucky's\" restaurant which is also next to the valet parking. They have a Japanese restaurant and an Italian restaurant called Pellegrini but I never got to eat at either one. There is a Karoke bar which is annoying kind of (most are) but it was really dead in there. On the \"R\" level is where the entrance to the main tower is. I think it is about 1579 feet tall. I never got up there. The lines were way to much of a wait to pay 8 dollars for and stand around. Because the city is open all the time the nights get crowded, especially for the attractions and restuarant at the top. I cannot say much but there is a $17.00 charge that includes the rides up there. I believe there is a roller coaster and a gravity ride plus a new tettor-totter type ride that is opening soon. At the \"R\" level there is a bunch of shops. Not major retailers but some interesting shops like those including Chinese gifts, Western wear, a massage machines kiosk, magic shop and rock and roll themed stores. There is a McDonald's, Haagen-Dazs Ice Cream place, sandwich place, pretzel stand, and a Pizza place. If you need internet access there is a gift shop with a couple of PC's there. You can pay $5.00 for 15 minutes. There are also some shops that just sell postcards, bottled soda and water,shot glasses and Las Vegas themed gear. As you know every little thing is to make money. I worked out in the open air weightroom on floor 8 that was a five dollar charge. $12.00 if I wanted three days worth. It is NOT included in the room charge because a separate company owns the gym area and runs it as well. The pool deck was busy so it was distracting a little lifting free-weights. You can go inside to use the treadmills and stair machines and it is air conditioned. My only mistake or oversight was that I did not realize the Stratosphere is located so far to the north of everything. I spent 11-15 dollars in cab rides to either the Bellagio, Venetian, Luxor or back from Ceaser's Palace. I had to hit the ATM in the casino more than once. Most of the action is down south on the strip, where all the major casinos are. One day I actually walked home from the Bellagio and that was a mistake because it is far and my feet were killing me and it get's hot there. The nearest casino to the Stratosphere is the Sahara I think. They are building a mid-sized casino or club the next block south of the Stratosphere on the same side of the street. I think the Hilton is going to be running it. Bring a lot of water because the Las Vegas water supply is nasty tasting, like salt. Bottled water is a big thing in Las Vegas. My advice is to go to Walgreen's and buy a six pack and chill it as you need it with ice from the machine on your floor. Bottled water and soda is in all the stores and Vending machines in most casinos.

Yes there was a 15 min queue to check in at about 18.30. Yes we were given smoking rooms even though we'd requested non-smoking rooms, but they actually didn't smell smokey and although we were told we could have a non-smoking the following day we declined the offer. The room itself was an average size with two double beds, a small seating area with chairs and table. It was all clean and room service was adequate. We were given two rooms next door to each other. There are two pool areas on 8th and 25th floor. We used the one on the 8th which was quite adequate, though not much sun shade, fine for me but not for fair skinned or people who don't like direct sun. There is also a gym with an outside weights section and some table tennis tables(under some shade). The bar is shaded and this is where you are supposed to smoke though people do still smoke by the loungers. If you ask at the bar for a glass of iced water it is from a gallon bottle and free, if you ask for a bottle of water you are given a small bottle and charged for it. Didn't try the 25th floor as it is free for women but men have to pay $10! Though I guess up there you get more of a breeze. The hotel has plenty of 1cent gambling machines which seem to get few and far between in the 'posher' hotels. The location for many is a down side but we chose the hotel as we wanted to be in 'downtown' vegas. We jumped a cab to Freemont street $8 (for four) evidently there is a bus that goes that way but didn't find out till later. We ate in Roxeys diner not bad food, not bad service beer is cheaper in here than in the bar, unless you are playing on the machines!

We didn't go up the tower, we were given vouchers on check in, didn't read them properly, as it is only free to hotel guest between 10.00-14.00.

We did call that day - they already had it in their systems we requested it (not happy I woke up early just to make that call unnecessarily).

Boyfriend thought we didn't need maid service our 2nd day so he hung the 'do not disturb' sign out for an hour til I realized it. I took it off. We left the room from noon til 9pm and when we came back the room had not been touched. I didn't call for more towels or anything - we were only there for 2 nights.

Of course you can't compare Stratosphere with Mandalay Bay but we didn't expect such a small room. Even a motel 6 room is bigger! The swimmingpool has a great location (6th or 8th floor) but it became a big disappointment. I really don't understand what's the company policy is to play the music so loud that it makes one sick. Is this a swimmingpool or a discotheque? Should quests as short as possible and swimm with earplugs? The night became also a nightmare. Although we stayed on the 23th floor the noise of a stupid train which crossed a road every 30 minutes was very clear. It seems to be a law in the States that trains crossing a road must claxon. This is a very irritating sounds which makes it very hard to sleep. The next day we would swop rooms to the other side of the building (Strip side) assuming that we could avoid he trainnoise. The frontdesk asked us to return at noon and placed us on the holdlist. So we did, but at noon no room available. We're asked to return later on the afternood.

Again we've returned to the frontdesk and complained about this silly solution. They appoliged but couldn't do anything because the hotel was fully booked. So we decided to leave immidiately and check-out. But the nightmare wasn't still over. The frontdesk would charge us 20 USD for a late checkout! That wasn't our fault, if it was clear in the morning that we should get this room we should check-out at that time, but we didn't know because we're on the holdlist. After protesting the supervisor decided to skip the extra charges and we leave the building for ever.", "Date": "July 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hayward, CA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Budget Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Spicy143", "ReviewID": "UR8229611", "Content": "My Boyfriend and I stayed at the Stratosphere Hotel July 11-15th.

Rude Concierge - I had to wait in a 30 minute long line that extended into the main casino to check in. When I asked the Concierge about the line she said, \"Thats how it is at every hotel in Vegas. If you want to Check-In I suggest you stand in line.\" 2. Resort Fee?!?! - You have to pay a $20 \"Resort Fee\" at Check-In that they mention no where when you book the room. They basically wait till you've booked and paid for the room and slam it down your throat after you've already committed. 3. Misrepresentation/False Advertising - I booked the Stratosphere specifically because they advertised how impressive and huge their sportsbook was. When I arrived I found a 12 seat racebook with 9, count them, 9 seats reserved for VIPs. 4. No Room Safe - Vegas can be a dangerous place to carry cash and, until now, I have never had a room without a safe. Upon request I was told that some rooms have room safes and some do not. After requesting one, I was told they don't offer them. 5. Nickeled and Dimed - My wife is not a morning person, so I went down to their cafe to place a to-go order. They wanted to charge me a $1/item fee for my to-go order. Also, at all the betting locations, they require you to make minimum bets (of $20) to recieve free drink orders. 6. Unaccomidating Service - At night I requested two extra pillows, one for me and one for my wife. They informed me that their policy is one pillow per room per night. They suggested that I call back the next night for the second pillow!?!?!? 7. Solicitation - You can't even enter or exit this place without getting solicited by timeshare salesmen. I didn't plan a vacation to have to beat salesmen off with a stick. People were literally having to run from the timeshare peddlers on the second floor near the shops. Conclusion - The Stratosphere was a nightmarish experience. I will never stay there again. Note: I stand by this review. If you wish to contact me directly email me at gponto18@gmail.com. The Stratosphere absolutely ruined my vacation and I would not wish my experience on anyone.", "Date": "July 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "manchester uk", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "helenearth", "ReviewID": "UR8221865", "Content": "This hotel is great.

We booked the room through a package deal from Worry-Free Vacations. Our original package included a room in the World Tower, but we were upgraded to a spa king room in the Premeir Tower. We contacted the Strat prior to traveling and let them know that we were celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary and asked if we could have an upgrade. Upon arrival we had the new upgrade as promised. The check-in line took about 10 minutes and moved rather quickly. We checked in on a Monday around 6:30 p.m. We have stayed at more expensive hotels in the past, but you truly get what you pay for here. Keeping that in mind, I think the Strat is a great place for those who are on a budget. We chose to stay here so we could spend our money in better places. For example, we saw two shows, \"Spamalot\" and \"KA\"-by Cirque du Soleil. These were great and come highly recommended. We also tried the Dan Marino's Steakhouse at Hooters. It was the best steak we have ever eaten. It is a must try place! Location seems to be a discouragement for most people. However, my husband and I rented a car from Dollar Rent A Car. If you are staying at the Strat, you should consider renting a car. You can get deals as cheap as $25 a day. There is always space in the parking garage or you can do free valet parking from the hotel. The hotel was clean and our room was taken care of daily by very efficient maids. The bed was comfortable and we slept really well while in this hotel. On occassion, you might hear the person next to you, but overall a somewhat quiet place. We ate at Roxy's the first night. You must try this 50's style restaurant. Great food and atmosphere for sure. We also ate at the Courtyard Buffet. It had a wide range of food options. I would have to say it was ok, but not great. You will have to pay a $5 a day resort fee. However, this includes access to the tower daily, laundry services, and pool access. We didn't take full advantage of all of these, but we highly recommend the Tower! Finally, I believe the Stratosphere is a good choice for those who don't mind being down the Strip away from the main action. We enjoyed our stay. You get what you pay for so keep that in mind.

I managed to wangle a double room for $38 a night Mon-Thurs from their website by booking in advance. This is rediculously cheap for what you get. I would say the hotel is probably a 3 star european wise. You do get a mix of middle america here with a few odd balls who doubt were taken by the price. Unlikely Paris Hilton will be staying anytime in the future Casino is O.K. if a little characterless. Some low limits on the blackjack.

Rooms were very clean, nice bathroom and we had a great view of the mountains. Rooftop pool are was surprisngly good with basketball, ping pong , towels, bar etc. The one and only drawback that I can see is that you are at the very end of the strip. Forget about walking it is way too far. The Deuce bus which in principal is a good idea..takes forever to go down the strip (stops +traffic) and you really don't want to be waiting in the heat in the middle of July for a bus...we ended up gettting taxis whcih never cost more then about 10$ which go the parallell roads. We ended up spending most of the evenings in the other amazing hotels on the strip which are nicer but much more expensive. Circqu de Soleils Love is awesome and worth checking if yu can get a ticket. The area outside the Hotel isn't the classiest in the world but it isn't too bad.

Sure it's on the north end of the strip, which kind of sucks. But here's my number one Vegas tip: rent a car! It's so fast getting around if you just drive on one of the roads parallel to the strip. We left the Strat. at 8pm and made it to Paris for an 8:20pm dinner reservation, and that includes parking and walking from the lot to the restaurant.

That kind of says it all. If you are just looking for a clean room on The Strip (albeit, at the farthest northern end, and halfway to downtown), The Strat is tough to beat. If a bargain is what you're after, you have a car or are willing to take the bus, and if you don't mind putting up with some annoyances, book your room. First, the good stuff: Wait, I just said it all above. To expand, the room was impeccable, and very quiet. They also gave me a \"fun book\" for my $5 \"resort fee\" that included a ride to the top, which is the tallest structure west of the Mississippi. Now, the bad stuff: I didn't get in until about Midnight on a Sunday night, and was exhausted, and wanted nothing more than a shower and a bed. Instead, I was greeted by a line for check-in that weaved through all the \"maze,\" and extended out into the casino. I signed and got in line, which moved at a sloth-like pace. At least one guest thought it would be helpful to start yelling at the clerks, which only soured the atmosphere in the stratosphere even more. To be fair, two of the clerks were really struggling with a really obnoxious couple who had enough paper to indicate they were buying the place, and took up about 30 minutes of time. Though the room was clean and offered a nice view, there was a cigarette burn in the comforter, and one of the light bulbs was burned out. The most bizarre thing about the room - I kid you not - was the toilet seat. I don't know if they only ever put women in this room or what, but there was no way that toilet seat would stay up short of duct tape or a piece of rope. And it didn't seem that the toilet seat was broken; rather, it seemed that the toilet water tank juts out too far to allow the seat to stay upright. I would love to have seen the face of the guy that decided to buy these toilets, especially if every room has the same problem. Finally, the buffet is crummy. Even with the $2 guest discount for a lunch buffet, you're better off going elsewhere. Think wilted salad greens and frozen pizza and you get the idea. That is about exactly what I had. Having said all that, The Strat is about the best deal you're ever going to get on The Strip. If you don't have your heart set on staying on The Strip, I'd suggest staying Downtown, which I find a much more satisfying experience overall, and for the same price. (See my review of The Four Queens). Also, keep in mind that walking The Strip from The Strat just isn't an option, given its location. Hey, what do you expect for such a bargain rate?

So being a high roller was turning into a low class situation..hm......Management was great at trying to solve our problems. Nobody ever knew what was going on and the people at the rewards desk never knew what was going on ....not much knowledge of the rewards rules....We became so stressed out at one point my friend said lets just forget this and enjoy the trip..I encouraged her that she would be mailed out offers so gamble and make the points. As I did......I paid more for my room than everyone else that I asked...The hotel said thats because I booked with them not online... Big Deal when I booked I asked if I would receive the online rates and was told yes.. More problems...The tub and sink in the room would not drain properly as I had to shower in the soap scum from my friend ..yuck...A friendly asst manager did move us to a different room . This helped improve my stay.It was still a regular room too. I checked my Mastercard and found out the hotel charged 390.00 for my room .I had a free 3 nights stay ..Had to make another trip to the desk to straighten it all out..On our last day we had a late check out. We came back from shopping and the room keys would NOT work but lucky our luggage was still in the room... More hassle.My personal belief about the rewards cards is they controll your win I'm probably wrong but when I played without it I won.

Maybe I will go to Circus Circus nest visit as the stratosphere only gives the special once...as in my case...Truly I was insulted to read the offer to be lower rates and 2 for 1 show tickets. big deal how many time can a person go to see Bite and American Superstars. This time I never even received a room or meals...Its all a gimic in my mind. But at the same time it only leaves a bad taste and makes a person wiser about free stuff... If it sounds to good to be true it is. I have recomended this hotel to many people and the rewards. In the future I'll probably say all the hotels are the same....They just want your money.

I have included on photo but it cannot do this sightseeing platform justice. Also don't try the Trolley bus, they are supplosed to run every 30 minutes we waited 1.5 hours frightended to leave the stop as we thought the bus would sail past as we left.

We had requested a king, smoking room and we told all they had were king, non smoking but they could move us the next day. We called down the next day and were moved. We stayed in the Premier Tower and our room was basic, but clean. It did not have the glitz and glamour of other hotels, but was well worth the money we paid. The bathroom was very large and the bed was comfortable. Plus, we had a great view of the strip. The hotel is at the top end of the strip, but it is still not too far from any of the other hotels. We actually took cabs the first few days we were there and had a rental car for the last half. The valet is the fastest around. We ate the buffet a couple of times and even had our meal comped twice. The food was great for a buffet and always had a great selection. Plus, the food was hot and fresh. I also recommend seeing one of thier shows -- American Superstars. Very entertaining. I was hesitant at first, but 5 minutes in I was glad I went. The view from the top of the tower is like no other. The pictures we took were breath taking. I also HIGHLY recommend renting a car for a portion of your trip and discovering the areas around Vegas. Red Rock Canyon was beautiful -- we went there first. Vally of Fire was even more amazing. Simply amazing. Also, Hoover Dam and Lake Mead are musts. I will say I was disappointed in the Hoover Dam tour -- years ago when I went on the tour they let you go to the bottom on the Dam and take pictures. Breathtaking to say the least. This part of the tour is now gone due to 911. I have to say I don't understand the reasoning behind this. They still take you down 500+ feet and you can view the generators which create power for 100 million people. Plus, you go through a security station on the drive in and then go through security screening before going on the tour -- If you are going to do something stupid I would hope they would have caught it by then. Needless to say, I was disappointed. But, the drive out there is still worth the quick trip. Overall, we will being going back to Vegas within the year and I will be staying at the Strat. I can compare this to Green Valley Ranch where I stayed just a month ago on a business trip. While GVR was top notch and very nice, I just can't justify the cost difference if I am footing the bill.

After traveling 9 hours we had to wait in a very long line. After all the wiating we found only that the staff was very rude! We asked how to get to our room, and he said \"look at the signs\" It was very easy for him to have just told us to turn right and then left instead of having us walking all over the place. they have a few fees which they do not tell you are going to be put on your CC when you arrive. when you call in person and pay the first night they do not subtract it from the balancce. So we had that fee, plus a $250.00 Incidental Fee, which we were not told about. I knew about the resort fee so I was ready for that one. We had to retrieve another CC because the one I was using did not have a high enough balance on it to put a hold on the room. We called personally and I feel that we should have been told about this 250.00 fee. So I had to get another CC from a purse that was with the bellman. After using the correct CC, the Clerk was still very rude. He was not helpful and did not answer any of out questions. Once we got to our rom which was absolutely beautiful It was the Grand Suite very happy with this room and the price except for one thing. when I called to reserve this room I specifically asked for a smoking room, I booked this room in Early March not last minute. Whe we arrived and got comfy, I realized there were no ashtrays, so I called the Front desk, and was told that it was not a smoking room and they apoloigized. Well we were staying for 5 days and did not want to pay for something we did not request. So I asked if we could be moved to the room that I had been told I was getting when I called to confirm just one week before my arrival. I was told that I would be called the minute that another Smoking suite was available. This was @ 11PM So we knew it would not be until the next day. a minute later they called up to our room and said it would be impossible to switch us because all of the\"Grand Suite smoking rooms were going to be renovated the next day! I spoke with the manager, who was no help at all. He said I was not guaranteed what I asked for even though when I confirmed a few days before i was told I was getting what i requested. He told me I could not smoke, but what I did in the room was my business but he woulod not send up ash trays. needlesss to say I went to sleep being very upset about the Whole check in experience, and was afraid that the rest of our stay would be the same. the next morning I called down to the front desk to see if they were going to change our room. The Day time Desk clerk said that there was no reason to move. Becaue the suites were big enough to filter the smoke and it could be smoking or non smoking and she would send an ash tray right up!! What a difference a day makes. I cannot understand why the night desk clerk was such a jerk and she was so nice. but the problem was resolved. Our room was beautiful, we had a view of the mountains and the strip, the price for this suite was lower than a double when we bbooked it! The food at the Stratrosphrere is great in every restaurant great choice of restaurants. great gaming area, lots to chose from. I've heard that this Hotel is in a bad area. I did not see what was so bad about it. We had a car, so maybe that was the key we got to the other end of the strip by going down the back street, and there was nothing to be afraid of as far as I could see. and we traveled this road at all times of the day. I think that the Stratosphere is a very nice place, I would stay there again.....no doubt. Only thing I would recommend is to rent a car. but this goes for no matter where you stay. Cabs are expensive, and the busses take forever and the tram only picks up on one side of the strip in 99 degree weather, who wants to stand in the HOT sun!! As I said I would have rated this Hotel 5 stars if it wasn't for the hassle we went through at the desk and in our room. Maybe the stratosphere needs to train their staff on how to be more customer oriented. I would recommend this hotel, if you don't mind not being in the middle of the strip.", "Date": "May 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Detroit", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Stratosphere!!\u201d", "Author": "VivaLV1", "ReviewID": "UR7665275", "Content": "My daughter and I stayed here from May 9-12 for her 21st birthday.

The only problem was at Lucky's where we waited a long time for service but it was 2:00 a.m. and very busy for that early in the morning. They probably didn't expect that big of a crowd and wasn't prepared for it. I would advise that if you stay here be prepared as the deuce bus doesn't always pick you up at night heading north on the strip.

All of our friends and family were there and the location was never an issue (it was close to downtown and the freeway that took us into Henderson). I did have a few big probelms, though: 1. Check-in on Friday sucked. I got there at 3pm and my room wasn't ready. The guy pointed me to the wrong line to pick up my room key (an hour later), so I wasted time standing in it. Eventually they got me a room, but it was a long wait. There were a lot of people way more angry than me, though, so an hour must not have been too bad by comparison. 2. The pool was FREEZING. Like, painfully cold. Even my kids who will usually go in any kind of water wouldn't stay in it. 3. Someone decided to jump off the tower in the middle of our stay and the response from the hotel was atrocious. You'd think they'd have a communication and business recovery plan already in place, but nothing was done. No message to guests about what happened or how we would be inconvenienced because of it, no statement, no nothing. It could have been handled SO much better. As it was, they had to close down several tables and the service that night was absolutely terrible. I don't blame them for the tragedy itself, they're not responsible for that - but they do have a responsibility to respond and communicate to their patrons. It would have saved them a lot of face, too - you couldn't believe the different rumors I heard from different guests and staff alike.

We wake up in the morning to find - OLD RED NASTY stains all over our sheets and blanket! Neither one of us were bleeding! We asked for all of bedding to redone, it took hours for them to come and change the sheets. When we came back to our hotel room that night we pulled all of the covers off to inspect and what do you know??? Red stains still all over our blanket.

We stayed at the Strat between 9th and 17th April '07. We're a mid-twenties couple from the UK who had never visited Vegas before... And we loved the Strat. The wait to check in was about half an hour (but we saw similar sized lines whilst wandering the major hotels on the strip (Paris and MGM to name two). Our room wasn't ready, so we checked our bags at the Bell Hop stand and had a great cocktail at the C bar until then. The C Bar is a great place to chill out and soak up the atmosphere, it plays great music and the service was always swift and helpful. When getting our room keys the Reception staff were courteous and pleasant, although a little harried (basically better than your average British service!). We were seen straight away by being ushered to the VIP checkin line on our second attempt. Our room was on 22nd Floor of the Premier Tower, and it was very large, with a great view (which we requested at checkin - no 'bribes' required). The bathroom was large and the 'Tower' shaped shower gels and shampoos were a nice touch. Everything was clean and well cared for. The bed very large and comfortable. The walls were thin (thank you weird 'whopping' gang of men in the room next door at 4am) but we only experienced this issue on one occasion, most people didn't seem to be shouting in the corridors. The Casino itself, whilst being less flashy than the main strip hotels, had a massive amount of waitresses who were always circling taking cocktail orders (we were at the Bellagio and MGM for an hour gambling in each one and never saw one waitress). The atmosphere in the casino reminded me of a british pub - it's loud, but incredibly friendly and not overwhelming (in fact it's where we did the vast majority of our gambling). We also found that we tended to win more at this casino (not sure if we were lucky or if the other hotel's slots are less loose!). The Band that plays Thursday through Sunday is basically a Cabaret show, but they sing well and will entertain for an hour max. The 'Bite' show is definitely worth a look, it's pretty amusing, although I'm not sure it intends to be. Basically if you like women pretending to be sexy vampires whilst dancing to 80's Soft rock you're in for a treat!! PollyEsthers, the Strat's new club is hilarious, although wear really flat shoes if you plan to go (there's only seats in the VIP areas). Each room is fabulously decorated in either 70's, 80's. 90's or 00's style (we're talking full models of Deloreans and Hummers on display). The flashing dancefloor in the 70's room is also pretty cool. It gets crowded, so we wished we'd arrived earlier, rather than stumbled in at midnight. The Strat is quite far from the main strip, but the Deuce is frequent, cheap ($5 for a 24 hour pass), but slow due to the traffic. The plus point is that, when you get on the Deuce you usually find a seat and then get to sit back and watch the world go by in air conditioned comfort. I preferred the Deuce to the Monorail, which is a bit of a rip off at $5 one way - but if you're in a hurry it's much quicker, go through the Sahara, rather than around it - we made that mistake and walked for about 2 miles before reaching the station (D'oh). I found it relaxing to travel back from the strip at night, it's like being on your own London Tour bus, and it gives you precious minutes to recouperate before hitting the bars in in the hotel. The restaurant at the top of the tower is fantastic. You may choose to get ripped of by the Photographer lady ($70 for two full size photos and 2 wallet sized ones - phew) but she is very talented and compliments you throughout so you feel a bit fab! The meal was excellent, although I felt the service was a little slow and wasn't on par with the other restaurants in the hotel. But then, who really worries about service with Vegas spread at your feet? The view was breathtaking and worth each cent we spent there. The other restaurants were great too, particularly Mr. Lucky's where you order, you are brought your food and then you are left to your own devices without being asked if you're ok every five minutes.
