The air conditioning was very efficient, if too efficient at times! But on the hot weekend when we visited, it was very welcome.

The big problem was the room, which in my experience would be lucky to be considered two star, not the three star advertised. First of all it was tiny. The room was long and narrow - about six feet wide by about 18 feet max, and it this narrowness that made it less than comfortable (see my comments about the bed further down which will hopefully explain what I mean by this). Into that was crammed a wardrobe with safe, a minibar fridge with a TV and radio alarm clock on top, a small round table and two chairs, and something that I can only call an excuse for a bed. It was no more than about four foot wide - we actually thought it was a large single bed. It was shoved against the wall at one side, with just enough room to walk past at the other (no bedside shelves/cabinets - just a shelf above your head). If you needed to go to the loo in the night you had to climb over your partner, and then try to climb back in and get comfortable enough to sleep. The tea and coffee making facilities were right at the bottom of the bed so that during the night the duvet would rattle cups, saucers and teaspoons if they weren't shifted out of the way, though finding somewhere to put them was a challenge. What's worse, the bed sagged at the edges, so you were either cramped up against your partner or sliding off the edge of the bed. It also had a tendency to slide away from the wall, which left you falling into a hole. And if that wasn't bad enough the wall is coated in some sharply textured white paint. I was left with a bleeding elbow after banging against it while trying, in vain, to get comfortable in the middle of the night. We had stayed in the Multatuli twice before and went back because it was clean, tidy, and very easily accessible (opposite the Central Station). But never again - it's still clean, tidy and of course accessible, but the rooms haven't been refurbished in years, it's very, very tired decor wise, and the room was atrocious for the money and star rating. Admittedly we opted for a smoking room and I suspect their smoking rooms are probably the worst in the hotel - it's the only reason I can think of for this room being so poor. It's no excuse though, we paid the going rate for a three star smoking room and feel totally ripped off. The breakfast was adequate, with the usual array of cheese, cereals and rolls. The coffee was in stay warm pots that didn't seem to do their job that well (lukewarm coffee was all you needed after a night in that bed). The scrambled egg was never the same two days in a row (ranged from cold and watery to fairly tasty, or on one occasion not there at all for about ten minutes, by which time I'd made do with a roll and cheese). There were also mini sausages which were nice and spicy and boiled eggs still in their shell. So overall, the breakfast was little more than something handy, so that you could go down get a bite to eat and then go back to bed to try to catch up on some of the sleep lost due to the bed. We never did though, which impacted on the rest of the holiday as we were constantly tired and not able to properly enjoy the sights and entertainment this fantastic city has to offer. The staff are friendly, and we were allowed to stay in the room until noon on checkout day as our flight wasn't until late that night. The bathroom was small and allowed just enough room for your knees when sitting, but it was spotlessly clean and if combined with a better room would not have been cause for comment either positive or negative - just OK. Wifi broadband can be purchased at about 10 euro a day, or just under 40 for a week. You may be wondering why we stayed in the room and didn't complain. We should have, but by the time we'd tried to sleep in the bed our stuff was already all unpacked and it seemed easier just to put up with it. I'm sorry now we did - never again. I'm also sorry I didn't take any pictures of the room but by the time we'd packed I just wanted to get out. Bottom line, if you're considering staying here I would advise you to make sure you get one of their better rooms.

Location-wise this hotel is fantastic, it's right opposite Centraal Station so no taxi's required from the station and it's right in the heart of Amsterdam, within walking distance to Dam Square, the Red Light District and all the great bars and restaurants. This hotel is clean and fairly comfortable and believe me, I have stayed in a lot worse in Amsterdam. I think the price you pay possibly reflects the location rather than the hotels amenities but in general I thought this hotel was fine for the price. The hotel reception is open, clean and welcoming, the front door is locked and opened only by the hotel staff which makes it really safe once you are inside. There are a few steep steps up the reception area which may pose a problem for those less able as the staff do not have a concierge service, although we did not have a problem. The corridors are narrow which is pretty much the same in every hotel I have stayed in this city and sometimes the corridors smelt of cannabis smoke and although this did not pose a problem for us it may for others. I would suggest though that you will find this in most hotels unless you go to the really expensive upmarket hotels. The bedroom was a little cramped, we had a double on the second floor and there wasnt much room to walk around after the case was put on the floor, the wardrobe was a good size, one half was shelving and the other half was hanging space although there were only 4 hangers so there is a limit to what you can hang up unless you take your own. The bathroom was lovely, very clean and a good size, the shower was excellent and there were clean towels every day. The room was cleaned and the bed remade every day, I could not fault the cleaning staff at all. We never used the breakfast option when we booked as I knew there were loads of nice cafes for breakfast nearby. On the down side, the hotel charge for storing luggage on the day of departure which I think is a bit of a rip-off. It's a standard rate of 5 euros which I think is steep considering we were only leaving our case for 1 hour. On check-out they don't print you out a receipt and I think they may have over-charged us for the mini-bar, their card machine was not working either when we checked out which meant we had to go to find an ATM to get cash before we were able to leave. Luckily we had plenty time before our flight or this may have become a problem. I thought 10 euros for internet access per day was a little steep, although the wireless connection was perfect and we never had any problems at all. We had a room at the back of the hotel (room 243) which was fantastic as there was no noise issues at all. The room was always nice and warm too, but not stuffy.

It was really really awful, the experience is still fresh in my mind after almost 2 years. i'm determined that I won't be back. Never ever. I stayed in a very small single room. Once you entered the room there is a small desk and a wardrobe on your right, the bed is right in front of you (you'll be facing the length of the bed, pillow side on your left), and if you turn left there is the bathroom. At the end of your bed there is a window. The air con is right above the bed. The bathroom smelled of urine. The air con made me cold but there is no way to turn it down, and if you turn it off... it gets worse... there is so much dust in the room that if you turn off the air con, the dust instead of kept on being blown about in the room it settles on you. I could feel dust coming down on my face, my arms, all over me. In the end I couldn't bear it anymore and turn the air con back on. The alternative is to open the window - but being a single female staying - I kept it locked and suffer the cold air con and i could not sleep all night. Because of the small room size, the noise in the corridor is clearly audible. What is the point of renting a room if I couldn't sleep in it?", "Date": "September 12, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aldershot, England", "Title": "\u201cNever Again!\u201d", "Author": "MissLister", "ReviewID": "UR5768078", "Content": "We have just got back from the Multatuli and I wish I had read this website before I booked the hotel. Firstly the room was tiny, nothing like the photograph on the website. The bed was uncomfortably small and there was a tiny window with shabby curtains. A 'cell' would be a more appropriate title. The coffee shop smell was also lingering in the main entrance. My main gripe is Rats or Rat. I don't know how many because I didn't see one but I most definitely heard one. At 5.30 a.m. my husband and I awoke to an extremely loud rustling noise. I whacked the light on and the noise stopped instantly. There was a paper bag on the floor that had a tiny amount of food in. We looked around the room and saw nothing. Actually I was quite convinced it was a ghost to begin with and I stayed awake in the darkness. About an hour later I heard the noise again. I wanted to book another room as I couldn't bear the thought of another night locked in this rustling cell but my husband refused to pay out more money. As I said, we didn't actually see a rat and I was pretty convinced the room was haunted so we did not say anything to the management. It did cross our minds that it could have been a rat though. I did think it was a little strange paying up front for a hotel? After reading the other comments on here I definitely think the Multatuli has a rodent problem and I for one would never return to it.", "Date": "September 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leeds, England", "Title": "\u201cMuch better than expected!\u201d", "Author": "trekka", "ReviewID": "UR5623390", "Content": "I initially booked this hotel through Hotels.NL and my friend then recommended I check it out on this website, and I was absolutely devastated when I read the other reviews!

We arrived in Amsterdam and found the hotel straight away, perfect location! The front desk staff were very friendly and helpful, and the reception area is lovely. There are some steep steps to get into the reception, which might be a problem if you are travelling with children, etc, but fine for us. The room (123) was ok in size and was very clean. There were one or two minor touches that had been overlooked, eg, the bathroom had obviously been recently refurbished and needed an extra coat of paint on the ceiling, one of the lampshades needed replacing and the curtains had come down at the edge, but otherwise a very nice room! Beds were very comfy! lovely matress! And absolutely NO signs of rats or bed bugs (trust me, I checked!!!) I would stay here again if I came back to Amsterdam.

I found a good rate over the internet and decided since it was so close to Centrum I'd book it for my wife, one year old son, and I to stay for three nights. The first thing I noticed was that although they advertise an elevator, you have to walk up nearly a flight of stairs to get to to it. Not real baby friendly. Also, you have to pay for your stay in advance, which normally wouldn't bother me, but it turned out to be a problem later...read on. When we got to the room I realized that the rooms looked deceivingly larger on the website I made the booking through. The first night went without much incident, but the floor above us creaked and woke the baby a few times. On the second night we were awakened to the sound of rustling in our trash can at about 2am. When I threw on the light I discovered a rat scurrying away. We wated up for a while to see if it came back and after about an hour we tried to go back to bed. But after about 30 minutes of darkness, the rat came back. My wife couldn't take it and we requested to move rooms. The man on duty was nice enough to give us a larger room on the second floor and appologized for the inconvenience. We moved up to the other room only to discover either the rat had followed us and brought a friend, or that the hotel had a rodent problem. Needless to say, we weren't real interested in spending the third night there and asked to check out later that morning. Unfortunately the manager was not there and the person on duty wasn't trained on making a refund to a credit card, so I had to go back once again to ensure my thrid night was properly refunded. My advice, don't stay at this hotel, or if you're still thinking about it after reading this, at least ask if they've got their rodent problem under control before you do.", "Date": "February 9, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "united kingdom", "Title": "\u201cnot so bad\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4088547", "Content": "I had booked this hotel via the web.

Amsterdam is a very expensive city as far as accomodation goes but if you can find another hotel at the same price I'm sure it'd be better. The rooms were very small with paper thin walls. Amsterdam has a great night life so whenever someone would arrive back at the hotel at 2am above us, below us or in any room near to us we'd be woken up and eventually have to go and ask them to talk quitely. Also our room had windows facing the street so there was traffic noise all day long, the owners need to invest in some decent windowframes to minimise the noise, they were dated and wooden. There is no tea/coffee facilities in any of the rooms, I believe you have to pay to use the safe, and if you want to change the channel on your TV you need to go and purchase a remote for ?20 (you get this back but I think it's a bit rude). They also charged us ?2 for each calls that we RECEIVED! The cleaners would burst into our room at least once a day (usually while we were asleep or in a state of undress) even though there was a 'do not disturb' sign on the door EVERY single time! But the worst factor was the staff at the front desk who actually yelled at me and my girlfriend; to enter the hotel you have to ring a bell, be VERY careful that you only ring it once, ring it twice within a 60 second period and you too well get a stern telling off from these extremely rude dutchmen and women.
