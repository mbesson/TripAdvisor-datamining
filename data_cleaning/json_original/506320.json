The location is quiet during daytime and a little bit busy in the evening. It is located in a mixed residential, commercial and KTV bars. Although there are KTV bars in the area, tourists are most welcome and not being harrassed by the pretty girls around, unlike in other red light districts in other cities.The hotel rooms are not too small and comfortable for a good night sleep. We got rooms 502 and 503 just in front of the elevator and we slept well even if other guests comes in and out of the elevator. The noise is tolerable. The rooms are cleaned daily and the staff are friendly specially the Filipina staff ( I did not get her name) who was on night duty. The bus stop is only about 10 meters away which you can ride going to other parts of Singapore. However, the bus stop going back is about 200 meters away. Plenty of fast foods in the area.
