Breakfast is always plentyful and delicious. I would recommend anyone exploring Istanbul to stay here and enjoy its cleanliness, its beautiful terrace, its proximity to many good restaurants and all that is offers. I came here from Darful tired and I left completely rested and rejuvinated. Thanks to everyone in Agora Life who has made my stay pleasant and memorable.

It was perfectly located in the Sultanahmet area (old Town) off the main street. Being the old town this street was very narrow and at certain busy times taxis are unable to drive along to the hotel because of parked cars ... it is a feature of the busy life at peak times in the old town. Our taxi driver dropped us off in the main street at the head of the sreet the hotel was located in and we trundled our case along the pavement to the hotel where a member of staff was outside waiting to welcome us in. This minor inconvnience was a small price to pay for an otherwise perfectly located hotel. On checking in we were given excellent information on tram journeys i.e. where they run to and where to get tokens, sightseeing trips, nearby restaurants and the main important sights only a few minutes walk from the hotel. We were also given information on a business card size of opening and closing times of about 12 close by sights. The view from the terrace was amazing. The Turkish breakfast was colourful and plentiful and omellettes could be ordered if desired. Our room was bijou. but we didn't plan to spend time in it and it was well appointed with a julliet balcony which provided an excellent view of the building across the very narrow street.Quaint. Sometimes you have to give a little to gain a lot and locality and roof terrace are fabulous.

Let me tell you all about it! :) We were four American girls sharing two standard rooms located on the ground floor (L01) and first floor (102) of the hotel. Location: Agora Life is located off a major street, less than \u00c2\u00bd a block up an alley way (loved this as it was very quiet during the night). It is a 5-10 minute walk to most must see attractions like: Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, Basilica Cistern, Grand Bazaar. Near great restaurants (My favorite Sultanahmet Fish House Restaurant),a tram stop, a grocery store, and a stone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s throw from a wonderful Turkish bath house (Caguloglu) Accommodations: Our room (L01) was equipped with two closets providing enough space for all of our belongings, a full size couch, and a safe. The overall layout of the room is small, but it was perfect for us. We loved that on a daily basis it was kept nice and clean, never did we have to ask for anything. The bathroom was always stocked up with toiletries, clean towels, and we were given bottled water, tea, coffee, and fruit. The hotel also provides bathrobes and slippers to be used by guests during their stay. They have free Wi-Fi throughout the hotel. I had a hard time connecting on my phone from our room, but my other friends did not have a problem so it could have just been my phone. However that was not even an issue, as the hotel has a laptop computer in the lobby for guest to use. The speed is fast, never had any connectivity issues. I was able to upload pictures on a daily basis to send back home to friends and family. It was also nice to hang out in the lobby as the staff always offered something to drink, and would answer questions and provide suggestions as to the things that we should include on our daily itinerary. THE TERRACE is A-mazing, it has spectacular views of the water and Hagia Sophia. That terrace was witness to many crazy photo shoots of the four of us. I went up there during sunrise and sunsets and Oh boy! was the view breathtaking! Complimentary Breakfast: One word\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 DELICIOUS!! AND if you miss your scrambled eggs or omelets all you have to do is ask and they will kindly prepare them for you. Hotel Staff: This is the part where I get teary eyed\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. I actually miss ALL of them!! :P They were all very nice, kind, and friendly. On day one, Isa (front desk) sat with us for a while as we drank tea going over the places that might be of interest to us, he explained how we should get there, what means of transportation we should use, etc. etc. Furkan (bellman) was quick to help us to our rooms, adjusted our room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heater so that we were comfortable. Kadir (hotel manager) always answering our questions with a smile, and providing that personal attention that made us feel at home. Irfan (hotel owner) was so kind when he unexpectedly presented us with gifts (scarves) that will always remind us of beautiful Istanbul and their hospitality. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget about Eser (front desk) who helped with entertainment reservations and Cagdas (bellman) who even provided my friend with a grocery list when she inquired about the preparation of our breakfast. I highly recommend this place!! You will not regret it!

And the breakfasts included in the room cost were plentiful and delicious: a good mix too, including beautiful yoghurt and muesli, excellent breads, salads, boiled eggs, wonderful sausage rolls using spicy Turkish sauces etc. Best b'nb in 9 months of travel in Europe and USA. The room also had a safe, something that a lot of hoteliers really underestimate the value of. Leaving passports, laptops etc in safety is a real asset (no reflection on the hotel staff, by the way)...Too few have had the in our travels (advice to hoteliers: add this high up in your list of resources!).

I randomly booked the Agora Life and I'm so happy I did because this place is awesome. The rooms were comfortable, clean, modern and I had an amazing view from the Bosphorus suite. The front desk staff were extremely friendly, helpful and they spoke English. They gladly helped me arrange for a private guide, taxis, reservations at restaurants, etc. The level of outstanding customer service and attention to detail made me feel like I was staying at a really nice apartment building with a front desk that I had known for years. I never felt anything less than their best and most important customer and the other guests I spoke to felt the exact same way. The breakfast downstairs was great. Lots of cereals, breads and cheeses. The breakfast attendant, Ugor (sp?), also made me eggs sunny-sided up every morning without any extra fuss. Towards the end of my stay, he had the eggs ready for me and I didn't even have to ask. That kind of attention to detail and willingness to go above and beyond was typical of my stay at Agora Life. Lastly, the location was ideal to tour the old city. It's easily 5 minutes away from Hagia Sofia. It's about a 15 minute taxi ride from the bars and clubs of Taxim but the ride was about 18 Turkish Lira. I personally liked staying but the old stuff and then taking a taxi to the bars at night. Agora Life is perfectly situated so you can visit some historic stuff, walk back to the hotel to rest and then go back out at night. My friends and I walked around during the day, came back, rested and then took a taxi to go out. OVERALL - Customer service and a great deal are really important to me. I know there are other hotels that are slightly cheaper than Agora Life but I would gladly pay the extra few dollars to stay at a nice hotel that's clean, modern, perfectly situated and that comes with great customer service. -Nicole, Lindsay and Stacy", "Date": "January 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cComfortable room, helpful and friendly owner and a superb location\u201d", "Author": "Aldy_1982", "ReviewID": "UR122280757", "Content": "I only stayed for one night at Agora Life but it was excellent.

But this hotel totally won me over and I ended up staying there for two weeks, with only great things to say about this fine establishment and its wonderful staff. On some days of my stay they did not have rooms available (I had not reserved in advance), and I had to stay at two nearby hotels which made me appreciate Agora Life Hotel even more. First of all, I would like to extend sincere warm thanks to the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s owner and staff for providing guests with such a wonderful lodging option, for their warm, genial hospitality, and exceptional service. Hotels can easily make it or break it for the overall impression of a travel destination. In this case, Agora Life Hotel and its wonderful staff were a huge factor to make my Istanbul trip a truly memorable visit. Can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait to go back! LOCATION: Agora Life Hotel is located in the heart of the Sultanahmet, i.e., Old Town, area of Istanbul. The Sultanahmet area is home to the world famous Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, Topkapi Palace, Grand Bazaar, among other attractions. It is the historical part of the city. Sultanahmet is perfect for visiting the historical places, but with the tram, buses, and ferries, it also provides an exceptionally convenient base for quick and easy excursions and trips to other parts of this fascinating, one-of-a-kind city. The Sultanahmet area has lots of hotels, all of which are small due to the small size of buildings in this historical area. I concluded that Agora Life Hotel had a superb, unmatched location, at least for my travel needs and preferences. It is central, within a short walk, under 10 minutes, to key points of interest. A very short walk in one direction brings you to the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, Topkapi Palace, etc. A very short walk, 10 minutes maximum, along a no-tourists walkway, in another direction brings you to the ferry station, the Spice Market and shopping in that area, and what became my favorite spot - the fascinating Galata Bridge and the New Mosque area. From there, you can take a ferry to the Asian side, ferries leave every 20 minutes, 15 or so minutes ride, costs 1.75 TL - great deal!; other locations along the Bosporus, etc. Or take a tram to Taksim and that side of the city. A short walk from the hotel in another direction leads you to the Grand Bazaar. The tram line is a very short walk, under 10 minutes, away. There are also ample restaurants and food outlets in proximity. At the same time, the hotel is located on a small, very quiet, tranquil street, allowing you to relax when you get back to the hotel from a busy day. The area felt very safe, even when walking alone late at night. Here I will add that Istanbul in general felt notably safe. I read about it in travel books. But still, I was amazed how safe the city felt, especially considering its size, with 15-17 million residents plus millions of tourists, and so much activity. ACCOMMODATIONS: The hotel has 16 rooms, ranging in size and view. I stayed in one of their most economical, standard rooms, facing the street. The room was small, but it made good use of space and certainly provided for a comfortable stay. This is a relatively new hotel, just over a year old. The hotel was fully renovated, tastefully, and with quality materials, such as marble, and quality appliances. Everything was in like-new condition and top repair. The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s overall decor was neutral, pleasing, and of neutral-modern style. Very pleasant. The rooftop terrace offers panoramic views of Hagia Sophia, Bosporus, and the city - ideal for lounging during warm summer days. GUEST ROOM: As said, I stayed in a standard, most economical room, facing the street. The room was small but very comfortable. I always looked forward to returning to its comfort after busy days exploring the city. Furnishings and amenities included small side tables, one chair, an electrical kettle, tea cups, packets of tea and coffee; a 1.5 litter bottle of water replenished daily (complimentary); minibar with enough space in it for additional items; two bathrobes and two sets of slippers. The bed was appealing, with quality bedding, and certainly provided for a comfortable night of sleep. Lighting was ample, with a ceiling light and also lamps. There was a well functioning A/C, and one could also open the window. I wish they provided a luggage rack, and there was space for it. Otherwise, the luggage had to be stretched on the floor, which was inconvenient. The bathroom was brightly lit, with quality appliances, sparkling clean, with enough towels, toiletries and counter space for guest items. The upkeep both in the bedroom and bathroom was excellent on all days, very clean throughout, with no issues to report (and I am picky!). Future guests should keep in mind that the hotel has only 16 rooms. So if you have any particular preferences, such as single or double bed, then express those clearly when making a reservation. Large hotels can easily move guests around to accommodate them, unless they are at full capacity. But with just 16 rooms and consistently high occupancy, it could be a challenge. GUEST SERVICES: The hotel has a simply exceptional team of staff! This includes the front desk, personnel at breakfast, housekeepers, - i.e., everybody that you encounter there. The front desk is staffed 24 hours. It is a small establishment, and all guests receive personalized service (without being intrusive in any way). All arriving guests are provided with a large map of Istanbul and overview of attractions. Staff will readily answer your questions and they really go out of their way to assist. Kadir at the front desk was a star performer and deserves special, warm thanks, for his sunshiny attitude, hospitality, through knowledge of Istanbul, and enthusiastic assistance. I had lots and lots of questions about sightseeing suggestions, directions, shopping etc etc, incl. some pretty focused, esoteric questions - and sure enough, Kadir could help with any of it. All staff were ready to help. If you stay at the hotel for a couple days or longer, you will likely also meet the hotel owner, who takes the time to greet and welcome guests. BREAKFAST: The breakfast was very impressive, and a huge positive factor as far as I am concerned. No need for lunch after it. They call it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153breakfast,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but it was more like a brunch. As is typical in hotels in Turkey, it provided coffee, tea, assorted juices, assorted cheeses, cucumbers, tomatoes, hard boiled eggs, bread, plain and flavored yogurt, olives, pastries, cake, and things like that. But what was rather unique for this hotel is that they also provided prepared food and offered made to order omelets. For example, they had hard boiled eggs cut and garnished with green onions and seasoning. Also, tomato salad, in addition to cherry tomatoes. Also potato salad, carrot salad. On some days they had this out-of-this-world totally delicious eggplant dish, delicately prepared with olive oil and spices. On different days they had assorted fruit and delicious strawberries. Made to order omelets were also available upon request (complimentary, part of breakfast). The food offerings were really generous and abundant. Everything was fresh and attractively, abundantly presented. All items were replenished promptly. The breakfast was from 7:30 AM till 10 AM. But staff kept replenishing food to full levels even after 10 AM, if there were guests in the dining room. On a couple of occasions I witnessed some guests who overslept the breakfast, yet the hotel staff accommodated them and provided food. INTERNET: The property provided complimentary wireless internet which functioned flawlessly. For ex., I watched a couple full-length movies on YouTUBE, and the wireless internet handled this without a glitch. The hotel also had a laptop with the internet in the lobby for guest use. ADDITIONAL IDEAS: Even though the hotel does not advertise this, but I thought this hotel could be a terrific choice for a corporate retreat, small wedding, anniversary celebration, or events like this. If it is a small group, then the entire hotel can be booked, all the 16 rooms. If an event requires more rooms, the hotel staff can easily make arrangements with nearby hotels. The hotel has a very attractive, comfortable, functional dining room, located next to their kitchen, it can easily be used for a small meeting or celebration event. The rooftop terrace, with its magnificent views of Hagia Sophia, Bosporus, and the city, could be superb for a small wedding celebration, small banquet, or event like that. They have an excellent cook as part of their staff. And there is no question that their staff has the expertise and experience, plus the work ethic, to make all the needed arrangements for events like that. Destinations like the Caribbean and Hawaii commonly accommodate weddings, corporate retreats, etc. Why not Istanbul? TIPS TO FUTURE GUESTS: (1) Do not hesitate to contact their staff for assistance. They pride themselves in providing exceptional, personalized service and will be more than happy to assist you. (2) Keep in mind that the staff knows Istanbul really well. They can easily help you with information and arrangements not just for the common tourist points of interest but also more esoteric queries and requests. (3) Contact the hotel directly through their e-mail to make the reservation. This way they can provide you with more specifics about the various room choices they have. Also, you may be able to get a better rate by booking with them directly rather than using third-party reservation systems (not sure about that, but that is the impression I got). (4) Even though the hotel does not market this (at least not to me), but they do have wine, various drinks, snacks etc available, in addition to what is on the mini bar list (so I was told when I asked). They have a kitchen and all the supplies onsite, so I would think they could provide room service and accommodate catering requests if so desired.", "Date": "June 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel, will be back.\u201d", "Author": "fenerbahce2011", "ReviewID": "UR111402043", "Content": "I am Turkish, and we stayed at Agora Life for 5 days with my English wife and her sister + partner, and we will go back.

Most reviews described the Agora life as class with an old world charm or spectacular views. Well let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s address class with old world charm. The hotel is in an alley or what appears to be a very small street barely accessible by car. The taxi driver had to walk me there because I could not see it from the corner where he tried to drop me off. It is a nicely renovated building surrounded by other building currently undergoing construction. The staff was friendly and greeted me with kindness. I was upgraded to the deluxe room but coming from Dubai perhaps my expatiation was a little too high. The room was very small and done in a minimalist fashion. My king size bed took up forty percent of the room but it was comfortable. The minimalist style of my room permeated throughout the hotel. Starting with the dry mini bar and ending with everything else. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s correct there was no alcohol in the mini bar but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no problem because you can get a drink at the bar right? Wrong there is no bar and barley a kitchen. They serve one meal which is a complimentary breakfast which I found to be pedestrian at best. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go looking for a late night snack because you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get one. On the upside the location is within 10 minutes walk from all the tourist attractions. If all you need is a bed and you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t drink or crave night life within a stone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s throw then this place is for you. The view is nice however I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not the type to sit in my little room and stare out the window. This is the most boring place I have ever stayed and it was not inexpensive. For a few more dollars I could have stayed at a five star hotel in Taksim district. This would have placed me near shopping, restaurants, night clubs, and Jazz clubs. I would have been able to get that midnight snack or see another person. The only people I encountered the entire time I was there was the staff. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ok to supply minimal amenities but because everything in this area closes early you need to stock up on whatever your needs may be. It was cold and raining and I was forced to go out because the hotel offers nothing. In conclusion if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want any other human contact in your hotel or you like it very quiet; this place offers a view and close proximity to all the attractions. However for close to the same price you can stay near Taksim in a five star hotel and enjoy some night life and take a trolley or a cab to the tourist attractions without being healed hostage by old world charm with no real amenities.", "Date": "December 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat 2 Nights in Top Floor Suite\u201d", "Author": "kandb17", "ReviewID": "UR83993005", "Content": "Hey, not cheap by any means but stellar room with stellar view.

Breakfasts were delicious with fresh ingredients and omelets can be made to order. There is a patio on the top floor which has a magnificent view. Staff was helpful. We paid a reasonable rate of 95 Euros per night for 5 nights in August. At this rate or similar I would not hesitate to recommend it. In looking at online rates on several sites , it looks like the rates are all over the place for stays in September and October. I am not sure if this is an error, or there is a main attraction in Istanbul or that the rates have gone up significantly.

The Agora Life Hotel is a small, personal, and very well located hotel where you immediately feel welcome and at home. Upon arrival, Dafne and her very friendly staff members (including Ceng\u00c4\u00b1z and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mish\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd), provide information about where to go and what to see and how to get there. They offer you a Turkish cup of tea with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lokum\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Turkish delights) and they immediately make you feel like you are staying in their home. This small hotel is new, modern, clean, fresh, and well designed. It is tastefully decorated and is provided with air conditioning and internet. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lobby\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd feels like a cosy sitting room. The breakfast is lovely. The location of the hotel is ideal, slightly off the beaten track in the middle of Sultanahmet in a tiny alley (sokak) (where my son could get a soothing shave and play backgammon with the locals) and yet within walking distance of all the major sights, public transportation, and good restaurants (especially the Fish House on the corner). If you can get the room at the top (as we were able to), it is well worth it: the uninterrupted view of the Bosphorus and the Haghia Sofya is breathtaking. What is most impressive about the hotel and the city is the warm hospitality of the Turkish people, especially remarkable in a city of 17 million people! This hotel feels like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153home\" in a city with a wealthy multicultural and historical heritage. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a personal, well located, affordable, and comfortable place to stay during their visit to Istanbul.
