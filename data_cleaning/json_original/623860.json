The rooms are typically small but are very nice and some have views. Its located right on the canal but if you are taking a vaporetto...or ferry, its a few blocks over 4 bridges that is difficult to get to with luggage. its easier to take a water taxi that will drop you off right at the hotel. I've never been a fan of the hotels in Venice because they are typically smaller than most other hotel rooms in Italy and this one fits right in. With that said the rooms are comfortable and very clean. The bathrooms are updated and new with enough room to maneuver around. The hotel is a little hard to find and most of the people you might ask are no help. Remember the street you are on so it may be a little easier when you get back from dinner and drinks. If you are taking a cruise I suggest taking a water taxi, and if you are alone or a couple, you might want to try to share the ride as they are expensive ($100 US). try to talk them down if you can...mine did it for $80. Not bad between 4 people but if there is 1 or 2 of you, again try to share the cab ride.

We had a vision of a romantic hotel in Venice, with a view of the Grand Canal. We were wrong. We booked the hotel because of its proximity to the major sites and because the website states that it has views of the Grand Canal. We expected the hotel rooms to have a view of the Grand Canal. It appeared that only a few rooms on the top floor may have had views of the Canal. Our room certainly did not have a view of the Canal. Rather, we our room had a window off to the side of the room that overlooked the street and wall of the next building. The hotel is not right on the canal, but a few buildings behind it. I understand that as with most hotels, not every room has the perfect view. We requested Grand Canal view on our reservation. When we checked in and noticed that we were on the first floor (which could not possibly have had the view given the location), we mentioned that we had requested the view and asked if we could move to a room with a view. The front desk employee completely dismissed our question and stated that he could see our request on the reservation. He then proceeded to hand us our keys and told us that another employee would show us to our room. We asked if another room was available. We were simply told no. I felt like they made no effort to accommodate us. If it wasn't late at night, and I hadn't been up for 24 hours, I would have protested. At this point, I was ready for a bed, view or not. I feel like their website is completely misleading. Wifi is a charge 5 Euros per hour. You will only receive free wifi if you book online through the hotel website, which is a current special. The hotel was located in convenient spot. It was short walk to the Academia and St. Mark's, as well as many restaurants and shops. We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go in Venice. It was also very quiet. I am a light sleeper, and I could not hear anything from the street or in the hallway. The reservations also included a continental breakfast. We walked through a bar area if we used the stairs to get to our room, but I never actually saw anyone use it. There's also a small courtyard area located off of the bar. Our stay at the hotel was fine, but I never could get over my disappointment with the view or how the front desk staff handled it.

What a fantastic difference from other hotels where the Airconditioning shuts off as soon as you leave the room. Access to the hotel from the train station is easy.

It was our first trip and hopefully won't be our last. Next time we will definitely go when the weather is warmer. I can imagine the city is 100 times more beautiful if the sun is shining.

Roma we took the ATVO ferry Line 1. to the Giglio stop as advised on the hotels website. (35mins) which takes you all the way along the Grand Canal. \u00e2\u201a\u00ac6.50 return. General advice whilst in Venice is : Everything is very expensive. I paid \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10.50 for a cappuccino in one restaurant, so search for non touristy restaurants to eat in. If there is live music there is an additional charge on your bill. In San Marcos square I paid \u00e2\u201a\u00ac11 just to listen to an Orchestra while I drank a cup of coffee. Check your bill! Several places double charged certain items. It is very easy to get lost so buy a good map or bring a compass. You instantly lose you bearings because the alley ways are so windey. Don't get roped into conversations with people on the street. They will want money at the end. Ok so, onto the review of the hotel... Reception, Breakfast Room and general areas were clean, well decorated and faultless. They weren't 5 star stunning, but they didn't need to be. They were functional. The room on the other hand was absolutely gorgeous. Cosy, beautiful, wooden beams, high ceiling, four poster bed, two windows where we had views to the grand canal, lovely traditional venecian artwork on the walls, not remotely shabby, spotlessly clean and my god what a comfortable bed. Lovely bath with rain shower overhead. Small but cosy bathroom and bedroom but extremely luxurious. You MUST push the boat out and pay the extra \u00e2\u201a\u00ac50 for rose petals in the room. We arrived to a room full. Petals everywhere you looked. A heart design on the bed. LOVE written in petals in the bath, petals in the sink, petals on the bedside tables, petals on the writing desk.... it was the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. I also pre-ordered a bottle of Prosecco and plates of Cold meats and cheese. I wouldn't bother with the food but the Prosecco was lovely and refreshing. I will list the few negatives but only because I need to be objective. None of these things bothered me particularly because the amazing room made up for it. Ok, so... we arrived to a very hot room. Heating was on full blast. We tried switching it off but never did seem to get any cooler. We slept with the windows open which was actually rather nice. The hair dryer didn't work, I called reception and they immediately brought us up another. Day 2. The maids cleaned the room, took our old towels and forgot to give us new ones. I called Reception and more were instantly brought up. Day 3. We hung the Do not Disturb sign on the door but they came in and cleaned anyway. Breakfast consisted of Cereals, Yoghurts, Cold Meats, Cheese, Hard Boiled Eggs, Apricot Croissants, Sponge Cake, Whole Fruits, Shortbread biscuits. Cappuccino was lovely. There are only 6 tables in the dining room which is not enough for the 25 bedrooms. So that's my review. Beautiful Room.

The room was very nice with a lovely spacious bathroom. We had to leave early on the last morning and the night porter checked us out. He had difficulty in working the credit card machine and ultimately I had to give him a debit card as he kept saying the credit card was being refused.

This hotel is a little gem.Our rooms were large with lovely bathrooms,spotlessly clean and the staff who spoke excellent English were very helpful.Breakfast is Continental style,cereals,bread rolls cheese and ham,fruit etc. If you are staying for two or three days avoid St Marks Square between 10am and 4pm as there are hordes of day trippers and the place is teeming with people.It is a lot quieter late afternoon and in the evening it is magical. Similarly if you want a gondola trip it is 80 euros during the day but is far more romantic if you go early evening although the cost is 100euros.Both trips last forty minutes. Best value is a Vaporetto ticket which will take you around the Grand Canal and you can visit The Lido which has a beach and also visit Murano,Burano and Torcello all on the same ticket !A three day pass cost 33 euros amazing value!

What a delightful surprise. Pros: Extremely friendly and helpful staff; convenient location (walking distance to Piazza San Marco); adequate breakfast; excellent air conditioning (necessary as the August temperatures in Venice were around 100); spacious room for 4 Cons: Water was working only intermittently on our departure morning while they were fixing a pump; while it's walking distance to everything, the immediate neighborhood is, um, sleepy. Things to note: - If you're arriving by vaporetto with a lot of bags, you'll have to cross a bridge or two from the nearest stops. We came by (pricy) water taxi, which drops you at the end of the block from the hotel. - Be sure you know exactly where the hotel is. There's no sign visible from the street so it would be easy to miss. Once you know where it is, though, it's easy to find again. - Everyone was very helpful and David in particular was willing to invest all the time required to help us sort out dining recommendations, walking plans, etc. - We had the family suite on the top floor. The main bedroom was large and comfortably slept four in the three beds. The sitting area is small and awkwardly shaped but was adequate for us to set up all our suitcases. The bathroom was great and very large by European standards. - Internet is pricy at 5 Euros/hour. Note, however, that it's per hour of usage, not an hour of clock time once you sign on, so that you can get a real hour of usage, however many minutes at a time that you need. - It was great to walk back into a cool, even cold, room after coming in from the hundred degree Venetian heat. For that alone, the room price was a bargain. - While pricing other hotels, I found they were charging from 200-250 Euros per night PER PERSON. Getting this room at about 350-400 Euros per night for all four of us made it a great bargain. Even without the price savings, I would consider this a perfectly pleasant hotel.

Having only found out our destination at the check in desk at the airport, I was extremely excited to say the least. I can honestly say that Venice did not disappoint. On arrival we decided to take the water bus (vaporetto) from the airport which took around 50 mins and was 13 euros each (compared to the 100 euros the water taxis charge it was great value). We hopped off the water bus at San Marco for Saint Mark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Square, which is the closet stop for the Dragomanni. I would strongly recommend picking up a map of the city before you go as we would have been lost without it. Our hotel (the Dragomanni) was approximately a 10 minute walk from the San Marco stop. Everything in Venice is done on foot and I can imagine that it would be a bit of a drama for those with big heavy cases, particularly when you have to lift them up and down the steps of the countless bridges!!! I suppose that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the best excuse to pack light. The Dragomanni is situated down a beautiful narrow street just a stones\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 throw from the Grand Canal. On arrival we were greeted with a warm welcome by the hotel staff who checked us in and gave us a brief overview of the local area. They also made a reservation at a local restaurant for us \u00e2\u20ac\u0153La Feluca\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which was very popular with the locals, which is always a good sign. The staff were very helpful and could not do enough to help us. The hotel is very contemporary but manages to maintain some wonderful traditional features such as the beautiful arched stone staircases throughout. Our room was lovely and very roomy for a boutique hotel. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor was very elegant and the room was spotless. The bathroom was particularly large and once again very stylish with marble tiles and speakers in the shower. The breakfast was lovely and consisted of pastries, cereal, fruit, ham, cheese, breads etc etc and was served in one of the many beautiful rooms in the hotel. The hotel is ideally located for exploring the city and was a perfect base for visiting Venice. I would highly recommend the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Venice in a day tour\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as it gives you such a good insight into this beautiful city. My boyfriend booked the tour through Expedia and it included a two hour walk around the city with a very good guide and then an hour on a boat cruising the Grand Canal. A definite must for getting some lovely photos. The scenery is breathtaking, particularly from the top of the Campanile di San Marco, where you can see the whole of Venice. The Basilica is also a must and of course a trip to Venice wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be complete without a gondola ride. They are extremely expensive at around 100 euros for 45 mins but totally worth it. The experience is fantastic. As a final word I would definitely recommend Venice, it is such a beautiful city and I can highly recommend the Hotel Dei Dragomanni, not only for its superb location but the fantastic service and beautiful d\u00c3\u00a9cor. My boyfriend and I will definitely return. I really should stop calling him that because Venice will always be remembered as the place he became my fianc\u00c3\u00a9.

Marco Square and most other sites, so the hotel was in a good area. It also was in an area that was a little bit quieter than the other areas of Venice, which we thought was nice. The staff was top notch. They were very friendly and very helpful. We had a minor problem with our safe. It seems that the safe is battery powered and our safe gave us a low battery alert, but I did not realize what it meant. All of our travel documents were stuck inside. We realized it at about 11:00 pm the night before we were catching an early train. The night staff could not help, but first thing in the morning a woman was helping us. They never had this problem before, but it turns out we needed a 9 volt battery and they aren't easy to find in Venice. Nevertheless, they ran around and got one and we got our documents. Don't worry, because if this happens to you, I can be sure that they have a stock of 9-volt batteries on hand now. Although we missed the early train, the staff really went out of there way to make try and help us. The breakfast was very good with fresh meat and fruits and very good coffee. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone going to Venice.

Our room on top floor(paid more for a view) was small, but luxuriously decorated and clean- no problem here; however, our view was a little disappointing as the hotel itself faces out to the less dramatic portion of the grand canal(for Venitian standard), and because our room was connected at the patio with our neighbors who stayed out on theirs all day, we weren't able to open the curtains without being conscious of them. So that was a drag.

We were in room 25 very cute room with windows and a small little patio that over looked the Grand Canal. Our water taxi dropped us of just steps to the hotel. The bar was nice great service, the breakfast was avarage in a very small room. David and Marco were very happy to help us with whatever we needed.

The hotel is in a great location within walking distance of the many tourist attractions. We walked to and from the hotel every day with no problems. Based on other reviews we must have had one of the smaller rooms - our bathroom was tiny (but perfectly decorated, modern and extremely clean) and the room itself was small and overlooked a quiet alleyway which, with the busy waterways, is not such a bad thing. The room had a shower, hairdyer and personalised toiletries, the bedding was clean and white and the room had Sky TV. Our curtains were closed of an evening and chocolate sweets were left for us for Easter. For 3 nights it was expensive but, considering it was Easter, reasonable for a 4 star. Breakfast, which was included, was fresh and had a good choice of pastries, bread, cereals and juice. Taxi's can be taken from right outside the hotel (if you can afford it!) but we found it much better to walk everywhere - as advised in all the guide books. Although there are a number of restaurants and bars close by there is a lovely bar in the hotel which again is small, but well stocked. It's very relaxed, it serves snacks at any time and we found it extremely convenient when arriving back from an evening or afternoon out.

Lots of room with great views of Venice, with skylights to add to the view. The location was ideal. A short walk to the Vaporetto and Academia Bridge, restaurants and shopping nearby.

I booked my \"Deluxe\" room directly thorugh the hotel website as the pictures of this room looked amazing. When we got there they showed us our \"Deluxe\" room which was absolutely nothing like the pictures on their site, much smaller, no view and dirty marks all over the walls. When I complained about this and said that I booked this hotel because of the pictures on their website (even the standard room looked better than this one!) they came up with some lame excuse that everyone's tastes are different and they had no idea what pictures I was referring to!?! I'm not even sure they showed me a deluxe room. Tehy then showed me 2 more rooms that were slightly better and we went for one of those. Still nothing compared to what I was expecting though and not worth the huge amount of money we spent on it. Again it had dirty marks (from previous guests I assume) all over the walls (a lick of paint really would not have taken much effort), the toiletries in the bathroom were the bare mimimum and only replaced once in 4 nights of staying, the mini bar consisted of 2 bottles of water and 2 lemonade (no snacks?!), the WIFI Internet was not free but quite expensive, the hotel info on the desk was a photocopy of the original document, there were no bathrobes or slippers (there have been in any othet 4 star hotel I've been to) and we only got the turn down evening service once! The breakfast was another thing absolutely not worthy of the 4 stars. The juices tasted cheap from a carton, the fruit salad was from a tin, the scrambled eggs and bacon looked so disgusting we did not even want to try it, and the overall joice of food was just very limited. Overall I would not book this hotel again, simply because I think it's more a 3 star and they take advantage of being close to Piazza San Marco so think they can get away with not giving you any of the extra little things other 4 star hotels give you. For such a huge price I expect much much more and I'm just going on experience of other hotels I've stayed at.
