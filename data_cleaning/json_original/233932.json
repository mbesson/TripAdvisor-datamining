We had read that Venice hotels are usually dark and dank so didn't expect much. We had a room on the second floor (yes, you do have to climb several flights of stairs) and walked into a beautiful light airy room with more space than either the Rome or Florence hotels in which we had stayed. Our room looked out onto the canal and we had fun watching the traffic early in the morning. If you wanted to look disparagingly at the room, yes, the walls were dingy but they were cloth - not wallpaper - and the furnishings were an 18th century style with beautiful old Murano style chandeliers. We thought it all very charming. The bathroom had hot water and great water pressure and the 6'8\" person was able to shower without being cramped. It was a quiet neighborhood and the walk to the vaporetti and Grand Canal was only 5 minutes. Breakfast had all the coffee we wanted and a great Italian sweet bread (as well as other rolls and cereal). It doesn't seem that Italian continental breakfasts are anything but coffee and bread from our experiences. If you want more, go buy something else at the markets nearby. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. Our flight from Marco Polo was at 6:30 am so we hired a private water taxi to take us there. From the hotel to the airport was less than 15 minutes. Expensive but worth it at that time of day.

The rooms weren't big but were warm and comfortable. There was no lift and no help with our suitcase though we are in our 60's. It was 56 stairs up to our floor. There was help for the young women, however! The breakfast was good, plentiful buffet style and never crowded. We liked the area. It wasn't too touristy.There was a good local shop just round the corner. Also there was an excellent shopping street with a market that went on till about 8 pm.

Then you can take a vaporetto to this hotel, take the one that lists the Tre Archi stop -- the hotel is right there when you get off the vaporetto. I would suggest getting a 24 hr vaporetto pass. Upon walking in, you will notice that it is an older hotel (like most in Venice) and that you will be required to pay a VAT (city tax or value added tax) for each night you stay there. The room we stayed in was on the first floor, which mean it is actually on the second floor... We had a nice few from the back of the hotel and it was very quiet. It was mentioned before that the breakfast was lacking any type of meat(s), but this is typical for Italy, bread with some cheese or butter spread is the norm. Here are a couple of recommendations when traveling to this hotel: 1) Bring your own bar of soap as the soap provided is a packet of liquid. 2) Bring your own shampoo and/or conditioner, what the hotel provides is not enough. 3) Understand that this is an older hotel and it may or may not have a bath tub -- our room did, but it didn't have a shower curtain, but a clear and moveable pane of plastic that really didn't keep the water in the tub. 4) Bring water back with you at the end of the day as I didn't see or find a vending machine to purchase water. 5) There is wifi access in the lobby only and it is quite expensive, I would walk down a bit and goto MQ10 -- it is a cafe with free wifi. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a cheap, affordable hotel. It was easy to get to, the staff was friendly and it was relatively close to everything -- remember, you can walk just about anywhere on Venice in 30 minutes or less.

We made all of our arrangements for trains and hotels totally alone on the Internet. After going from London to Paris to Milan to Verona, we decided to continue our tour with the GATE 1 travel program from Venice to Florence to Rome. Our first stop was the HOTEL TRE ARCHI in Venice. This was an alternative in their tour plan for us to get ONLY train tickets and hotels. We naively expected that they would at least give us information such as tour and dining options when we arrived as well as let us know where the official tour group was going even though we did not sign up for that. We paid about $2,000 (now about 4,000 Euros) for this limited service. In retrospect, this was a scam and a ripoff. We received nothing more than train tickets and hotel rooms! We could have done that ourselves. We expected some kind of services for our money, since we were supposed to be following this specific tour group on the same trains and hotels. We never met anyone from GATE 1, including any people on the tour that began in Venice on May 24. We stayed at a hotel that they recommended in Venice. It was the Hotel Tre Archi, which was a disaster from the moment we walked in at mid-afternoon after taking a private water taxi from the Train Station, which cost an outrageous $100. But, we had no alternative without any idea where we were going in the maze of waterways. Maybe we could have received directions on how to get to the hotel on a public boat from GATE 1. They gave us nothing but a receipt for the hotel with the address. No one at the station could help us. The young woman at the counter was totally bored and little help. She told us the room was on the first floor. But, in Venice the first floor is about the third floor, probably because of flooding. She told us to go up the stairs since there was NO ELEVATOR and no porter to help. Why is that in an upscale hotel recommended by GATE 1? They should know what FIRST FLOOR means there. As senior citizens, it was no fun dragging heavy suitcases up two flights of stairs. The girl should have told us to leave the bags when a porter comes at 8PM. We were in no rush to have our bags at that time. When we got to the room, there were no TV controls. The girl at the front desk had forgotten to give them to us from our key box. Duhhh!

It's fairly near the train station, has a convenient \"bus stop\" (water-bourne bus) directly at it's front door, but you can walk to it in about 10-15 minutes. I arrived without a reservation and asked about a room for one night. Franco, behind the desk, was courteous and showed me up one flight of stairs to a room with a balcony overlooking the canal, with queen bed, & private bath for which he quoted 50 Euro including breakfast. I asked if WiFi was included, and he said they usually charged 4 Euro/2 hours, but he'd throw it in for free. After having just looked at a couple of other nearby 3-star hotels which offered less, for more $$$, I said, SOLD. The floors are marble, and the 10-foot high walls are covered in fabric neatly trimmed with cording. The entire hotel is clean, and seemed well maintained. I was there at the 'shoulder season' so you should not expect this price to be available during the summer. Also, because it was not yet summer-time, the central air-conditioning was not available, but thanks to it's thick walls, and cool marble floors, this was not a problem for me in early April. The staff was nice, and later that evening, the night clerk, Calub, was very responsive to my request for some ice and graciously lent me his lighter when I asked for some matches. The WiFi had good speed, and I was able to Skype outside by the canal while I enjoyed a beverage and cigar. Contrary to some other posts, I found the breakfast more than satisfactory; three varieties of dry cereals, coffee cake, croissants dusted with sugar, yogurt, rolls with your choice of 'spreadables; butter, honey, jelly, cream cheese, and wedges of soft cheese. The waitress will serve any type of coffee you want; cappuccino, American coffee, or espresso, and there is an orange juice machine, and tea bags. I have only a couple of CONS for this hotel; The TV in the room was small and did not have a remote control. However, this turned out to be a small problem as only 3 channels ( 2 Italian, 1 German) were available. The other, is that there is a certain amount of noise associated with overlooking a canal, as the canals serve as the streets in Venice. The \"bus stop\" in front brought with it the noise of the boats coming and going at the dock until about 11 pm, and in the morning you can hear the city getting to work, as the boats motor by below bringing cargo and supplies from the mainland. Even the garbage trucks are boats. The good news is that the thick walls and double pane glazing in the tight-fitting balcony doors will effectively block this noise, if you close them. After looking at my pictures of the front of the hotel, it appears that my room, Room 118, is the only one with a true balcony. The CONs are minor, and are easily overshadowed by the PROs.", "Date": "April 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brighton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cThe break fast was absolute rubbish!

The walls were also very thin. You could hear every door slamming and the clack-clack-clack of heels and shoes in the hallway.

We arrived at the hotel and, in agreement with other reviewers, felt that the person at the front desk lacked enthusiasm or, at the very least a smile - but no big deal. We were given room 120, which was in between the 1st and 2nd floor - too hard to explain. The room was nice - a room with a double bed and fridge and a smaller room with a single bed and desk. We used the single bed to place our suit cases, jackets, etc. The ceiling was low but it shouldn't be an issue for anyone under 6'6\" The bathroom had double sinks and was nice. No elevator so be prepared to carry the luggage - no one offered to help. The breakfast is not good but, from talking to others, it is standard fair for hotels in Italy (perhaps the 5* ones are better). Walk to the local supermarket in the morning and grab something there. The hotel is on the border of the old ghetto which makes for a lovely place to walk and see where the Venetians live. It is also where the more affordable restaurants are. The location, away from the Grand Canal and main stops means it is quiet at night but it can take a while to get back there by vaporetto after 11 PM (that is when the express vaporetto stops and you have to take the local). You can walk to St. Marks in 15 - 20 minutes and it is a very enjoyable walk. Our only issue with the room was the shower or lack of a shower. The bathroom has a tub a glass partition that is hinged to the wall and swings - this is done to create a wall when showering. However, the tub did not have a hook to place the shower handle high enough to use the tub as a shower. The only hook was by the faucet of the tub. I had to stand holding the handle above by wife so she could shower. I mentioned it to the desk person and he said he would look at it - of course, nothing happened. The next day (before our last night), I mentioned to another clerk who must be the manager because he was generally concerned and asked to see the problem. I explained how to fix - was it ever done - who knows? It is a warm, clean, safe, and convenient place to sleep.

I'd booked a specific room, and confirmed it the week before. On arrival I found someone else was in it, and I'd been placed in the attic, which by the way doesn't comply with Italian laws for this grade of hotel in terms of the electrics, warning notices or the sloping ceilings. (The owners had previously used these two rooms, but the new owner turned them into bedrooms.) I finally got the room I wanted two days later, but not one word of apology. Most of the staff were still as friendly, and, or course, the brilliant location hadn't changed, and the building itself can't help but have a certain elegance, being a former palazetto. I also got someone to carry my bags, but only after asking and explaining that I have a disability; and it was done with a bad grace.

The walk to St Marks square was easy and the main route lined with shops. Unfortunately I wouldn't rate the hotel above a two star. Our room was very small. Our travelling companions were in a much better room, which had the bedroom on a mezzanine floor, giving an area to put suitcases. Our main problem was that water leaked out of the wall every time we had a shower. This wasn't just a small leak and the floor was completely immersed after a quick shower. When we asked for extra towels to soak up the excess we were dismissed and told it would be fixed. This never happened and we never got any extra towels. Breakfast was only average, but we soon learned this is pretty much par for the course in Italy. We probably wouldn't stay there again, but it did seem difficult to find accommodation in Venice.

The room had skylight windows, no views and a sloping roof, which meant one had to stoop to negotiate movement in the room. No-one suggested that one could have a remote for the TV, so when we asked we were offered one for a 25 euro deposit. The shower was barely big enough to turn in, and the water ran from hot to cold throughout the shower, sometimes at a trickle. Breakfast was very poor - one of us asked for cold milk on the second day because the option was hot milk or cream the previous day - we were still brought hot, frothy milk, but this time cold frothy coffee, which was of poor quality anyway. On day three, the usual lack of initiative of the staff meant we were not offered any coffee but, having experienced three days of very little choice and slow service we decided to pass on this - we had already decided to get our own breakfast items from the Billa Supermarket, such was the poor selection available.

It was advertised to us as 3 star accommodation, maybe this is the case in Italy but i would rate it as a 2 star (possibly less) here. Summary of bad points; No lift - i never use a lift anyway but..... to expect someone to lug a heavy suitcase all the way to the 2nd floor, i feel is a little unreasonable. Staff - made few attempts to talk in english, and i dont understand much italian. Room (210) - was so small, there was just enough room to walk around the bed, i know that the room is just there to sleep in but it would have been nice to be able to get my suitcase under the bed! (also, the fridge in our room did not work and when we asked for it to be fixed they told us to go out for a while and by the time we got back it would be mended. It was not, and never did get looked at the whole time we were there. Although our room was cleaned, the dust under the bed confirmed that it was not done properly. Bathroom - had a nasty smell to it, i suspect this was the sewer system, but still, not very nice. Also, the water was only sometimes hot, the rest of the time it was just warm. Hotel bar - we borrowed 2 glasses from the bar for a bottle of wine we brought with us, the bar only 3 had wine glasses in total (none of them matching) and no ice (a bit dissappointing as our fridge did not work either) Hotel web site - this really annoyed me. The web site gives information on how to get to the hotel. It obviously needs to be updated. We got a taxi from the airport (Treviso) to Piazzale Roma which cost 75 euros, i wouldnt have minded so much if the web site had not advised it would cost approx 25. Also the AVTO bus back to the airport costs 5 euros 1 way not 3 as suggested by the hotels web site. Breakfast - soggy cereal, jam, dairylee cheese triangles, melba toast and yoghurt, in my opinion, does not constitute a 'continental' breakfast. Summary of good points; Comfy bed. Clean towels.

My experience of Venice as a whole was that they really couldn't be bothered with the tourists as, like a vaporetto, another would be along shortly (there were a few exceptions but few and far between). This hotel came into that category, I'm sad to say. I had booked some time ago and asked for a canal-facing room as we were celebrating my birthday. As it was, we got put in the attic with views of the rooftops if you stood on tip-toe to look out of the skylight.
