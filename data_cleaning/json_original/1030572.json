{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Love it! Stayed there for 5 nights, it's definitely one of the best hotels i found! The rooms are clean and new, the bathroom is huge! Apparently this hotel is newly renovated so everything in this hotel seems fairly new.Definitely good value for the price (we pay 6500 yen per person) also the hotel is very convenient, right behind JR ueno sta.There are many cheap resto around for those on the budget. I accidentally found a cute little karaoke bar 10 metres away from the hotel. The owner is just so nice! My stay in sutton hotel brings many good memory.Highly recommended!", "Date": "Dec 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR692441371", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "lemonteanosugar"}, {"Content": "Nice, Clean, SMALL place Its a nice hotel, located in a very busy part of the city. The rooms are very clean, except small to the extent i cannot open my luggages - can only open one.But the bathrooms are HUGE full size ones with bathtub. The hotel has washing machine, cold and hot water machines for tea and coffee. I like the clean sheets, clean rooms and nice big bathroom, The location is also good, 4 convenient stores within distance and a noodle house tat closes really late. At 2am. Rare in Japan standards. Ueno is near to everything, and has cheap food. Also cheap to get to airport.

Booked four nights, two months before my travel, if you want a no smoking room you should book well ahead. Average price for a superior single was 8600 Yen. Arrived around noon and could leave my suitcase there after I payed for the stay.The hotel is at a very busy street, lots of traffic throughout the night.Also the walls are very thin, you will hear every sound from the room next to you. So if you are noise sensitive bring your earplugs.8600 yen is not a bargain for this part of town and while the rooms are small the bed was extra large for one person making it hard to store your luggage. No closet, just two hooks an the wall.Nice bath with large bathtub and heated toilet seat ;)TV had no international channels, but some movies where in english with subtitles. Taito-ku is my preferred part of Tokyo, you will not find any upscale Hotels here but if you like a downtown atmosphere and easy excess to all parts of town look for a hotel in this area.", "Date": "Nov 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR513433956", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "Mikedus"}, {"Content": "Nice modern hotel We stayed here for 3 nights in early November. The Sutton's location is really convenient to the Ueno JR station (about 2 minute walk - just take the Iriya exit). The room was neat, modern and clean. The bathroom was great and even had a bath you can fit into. The staff were always friendly and helpful (with good English). Our room (as i imagine all in the hotel) fronted a busy xpress way which means traffic noise all night - probably pretty typical of many placesTokyo. The breakfast included was fine, and I'd say it was a value for money hotel.", "Date": "Nov 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR459707701", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Mothie"}, {"Content": "Location,location,location My wife and I stayed at this little gem for three nights on Sept.21st based on the great recommendations of fellow tripadvisor members.Thanks for you advise.I am just going to reinforce what's already been written. This small hotel is very convenient for transportation from taking a direct Keisei liner from Narita to Ueno, using the above ground JR Yamanote line to the Ginza and Hibiya subway lines.There are many local eateries in the station and within blocks of the hotel and there is a very colorful scene that unfolds every evening at the Ameya Yokocho, which is a street market that hawks fruits to shoes. The Ueno Park is worth a walk with it's museums and statues. One stop away on the Ginza line is Asakusa with the Senso-ji shrine and the great Nakamise-Dori street.We stayed in a small double bed room as the other rooms were not available. It was very, very clean and the bed was comfortable. A little problem with space for our luggage but manageable. A great selection of toiletries are available. Just be careful of the toilet!The room rate is very reasonable for Tokyo and is a great bargain. There are lots of hotel options but I doubt there are many out there that presents such a value and such a rich local scene.They include a very basic breakfast but you have a Starbucks option at the Ueno station and many bakeries.TIPS: For airport transportation, the Keisei Skyliner is a reserved seating 60 minute express with limited stops that charges Y1920 while the Limited Express is a subway like train with many stops, takes 75 mins. and charges only Y100. I tried both and the Skyliner is worth the extra money.The JR Yamanote line is a convenient loop that links the neighbourhoods and is worth just as an orientation ride. If you are not sure of your fare, just buy a Y160 ticket and then have your fare adjusted when you exit. There are machines for that purpose just before the exiting turnstiles. Ditto for the subways which have more English directions. They are easy to get used to.Definitely do the Tsukiji Fish Market and the auction (5-7AM). Transfer to the Oeda line (one stop away) and get off at Tsukijishijo. A Tokyo instituition.And try the food dept. at the nearby Matzuzakaya department store. It will blow you away. We bought a variety of foods and ate back at the hotel's lobby.Finally, the Japanese are very well mannered and polite, please return the courtesy and you will have a wonderful time.Hope this helps.", "Date": "Oct 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR273771318", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "SamVancouver"}, {"Content": "We Loved Mr. Matsushita!

Given the price of the hotel, as two friends traveling together, we booked a junior suite. It was HUGE by Japanese standards. Two rooms, including two sofas, two mini fridges, two flat screen TV's, two hand basins, and two good sized beds (of course). Although it was located on a busy road, inside it was quiet and traffic noise was not noticeable. Staff were friendly and helpful with reasonable English.Internet was provided in the room. However, uploading photos onto picasa web albums was blocked, which was a bit inconvenient. Breakfast wasn't flash, but it was adequate. Tea/coffee/juice and toast and pastries.

We stayed here with our 2 children for 5 nights in a junior suite which accomodated the 4 of us very well. Price was great ( less than $200 AUD per night including the simple breakfast). We booked through the hotel website via email. Our room looked exactly as pictured on their web site. This hotel is not a full sevice hotel (ie no door man, no restaurant etc) but it was just what we were after. There is a guest laundry which is very handy, the rooms have all been recently fully refurbished  the staff were friendly. We were on the 6th floor  did have some traffic noise from the express way but not enough to be of any concern. The lift is very small but again this wasn't a problem. We were very close to both Ueno station  the Keisei station which made getting around Tokyo easy. Also very close (walking distance) to several convenience stores, restaurants, Ueno park  Ameya-yokocho market streets.

After having heard positive things about this particular hotel, we were dead-set on staying after finding the rates were very competitive with everything else out there. A hotel that was near a major train station was top of the list ,and Ueno station is one of the larger hubs of Tokyo. Entrance to the Ueno station entrance is a very short 1-2 minute walk. Another thing I really wanted was for a place to do some jogging at night. Ueno park is great for this purpose, so the location of the hotel also made me very happy. Ueno park has a lot of museums and sights of its own. Very nice to be able to just walk there directly from the hotel!Our room had two single beds facing down towards a freeway. Despite this, it was relatively quiet except for the occasional loud motorcycles passing through that enjoy revving their engines to purposely display to the public how loud their bike is (apparently, this is a cultural thing in Japan). The noise did not impede our sleep.The room was very small, barely enough room to even walk through with the suitcase stacked upright. Unfolded, there was no room so we had to take what we wanted out and pack up each time to avoid tripping over our luggage. There were no drawers and only a very small closet. Although small, there was a decent sized fridge tucked away, TV ,and a desk with an ethernet port that allowed for high speed internet access (free). Since I had brought my laptop with me, I loved being able to tap into the net from my room.Although the room was small, it was immaculately clean. And I do mean immaculate. They give you these white slippers to use in the room's laminate floors. We wore them and after walking around, we look underside to see how 'dirty' they would get. Nada, it was perfectly white throughout our stay, we even moved the beds around and walked around under there to give the full white glove 'test' and again, perfectly clean. There were a few downsides. For one, you had to stick your key into a special socket for any of the lights to work. It was quite dark when entering the room unless you held the door ajar to let in light from the hallway. We didn't appreciate this. Another thing is that the the staff demands you 'turn in' your key whenever you exit the premises. The elevator forcibly stops on the upper level lobby floor to remind you to do this. I thought this was just tacky. The breakfast buffet was not very good either. It only consisted of cheap breads and often ran out. Still, the gesture was nice.Overall this was a pretty decent stay.", "Date": "May 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR975900567", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "orangekitty"}, {"Content": "Pretty good The hotel is nice and modern. Very new and ultra clean. I really like the ambience and the location is also very close to Ueno JR Station. Abundance of restaurants in the vicinity as well. You can get free coffee and tea from the 2nd floor. That is also the location for the washing and vending machines. Complimentary breakfast is minimal but adequate. Staffs are fluent in English. Free internet access (3 laptops at the lobby). Good bathroom amenities. The sliding window can be opened but very noisy. Compliments to the hotel - The window must be double glazed since no noise once the window is closed. The only downside is the size of the room. I am used to non 5 star Western style hotels in Japan and I know how small the room can get but the Sutton Place's hotel room isn't even equipted with a drawer, let alone a cupboard!
