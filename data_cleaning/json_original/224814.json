On our arrival we waited for almost 5 minutes before someone came to the counter. We paid, went and retrieved our things, and went to the room. First thing we saw when we flipped on the light was a bug fly through the room. Then after sitting on the bed for 10 minutes the must and mold smell was so strong that I had a strong allergic reaction and couldn't breathe, almost an asthma attack. So we packed up our stuff and went to get a refund. The kid working there went and checked out the room and said it was \"used\" and he refused to give us our money back. Offered us another room. We argued with him for a good 30 minutes about giving us our money back while coughing my head off and thinking I'm on my way to the ER over it. Even called the cops but they said it was a civil matter and probably couldn't do anything. The guy was really rude, ripping paperwork out of our hands, to the point of where I thought there was going to be a physical fight. Then he said he wasn't going to give us another room. Eventually he showed us a few rooms, I took an allergy pill, and we found a new room that wasn't much better. The guests in the lobby were even saying that it wasn't right that he wouldn't give us our money back, that he was being very mean and rude to us. The room was dirty, moldy, carpet was so dirty we wore our shoes to go to the bathroom, just disgusting but they already had our money. We would've charged back but we used our bank card. The microtel we stayed at in Holland, Michigan was awesome. When we told all of our friends and family about it they were shocked as well because they have stayed in Microtels around the USA and loved them too. This one gives Microtel a VERY BAD name. I will never stay at a Microtel again and will never recommend one either.

About five of us (who came from different locations) stayed at this hotel in three different rooms. At first when I booked the room and then saw some of the reviews on here, I was a little concerned. But honestly, it was okay for my 2-night stay. At first I'd booked a single room thinking I'd be in the room alone. But then upon talking to some of my fellow roads enthuasiasts, I found one person who wanted to split the cost and share his room with me. When I called to cancel my own reservation, the gentleman on the phone at first told me he couldn't cancel. But I gave him my confirmation number, and after a minute or so it was all set. (Weird.) He had what I believe was an Indian accent, so he may have been confused. The room was clean and comfortable. No problems there. The only annoyance I had was about the computer in the lobby for guests to use the Intenret on. The night check-in girl had whom I was believe was her boyfriend or husband (and also a young child or two) lingering around and spending too much time on the Internet. I can't remember whether there was a sign announcing a time limit for the computer, but at one point, I asked him if he'd be much longer. Finally he left and I was able to sign on to check my e-mail and stuff. The continental breakfast was fine - typically what you'd expect from a $70-a-night motel. Muffins, cereal, oatmeal, juice, etc. Overall, the hotel was okay. I probably wouldn't stay there again though - maybe only if it was cheaper.", "Date": "September 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kalamazoo", "Title": "\u201cfilthy floors\u201d", "Author": "Bonzer", "ReviewID": "UR11911825", "Content": "In town for the traveling exhibit from the Louve, at the museum of art.

Fortunately the sheets were clean. Another concern there were fewer than 10 cars in the lot but they put everyone near each other. We heard some noise but fortunately the other guests quieted down to sleep early. I was happy with the bagels and muffins in the morning because they were individually wrapped. At check out they did not have modern office equipment, the clerk struggled to provide the receipt. We will return to the art museum it was fantastic!
