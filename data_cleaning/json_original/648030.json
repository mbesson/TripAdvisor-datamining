The front desk would not allow him to go in my room for that 50 minutes while I finished up packing. They said it would be a charge for another person.

It is in the middle of Barri Gotic, less than a minute's walk from Las Ramblas and the Liceu Metro stop, and a 5 minute stroll to La Boqueria. The front desk people are very friendly and efficient, and speak English, although some better than others. What can I say about the room? I would say it compares to Motel 6 in the US. It is an old hotel and in need of some renovation. The 3rd floor room looked out on the Carrer de la Boqueria, so it was very noisy until very late at night. There were automatic metal blinds that did cut down on the noise, but it made the room stuffy.The (twin) beds were quite comfortable, and with earplugs in, sleeping was not half bad. Don't bother with the TV. It had a lot of static and was not worth watching. Besides, there are many interesting sights waiting to be seen outside the room. During the time I was there the room had a distinct raw sewage odor that came from a wall vent inside the shower. I had to keep the bathroom door closed, and even then it was discernible. Although I saw them cleaning the room and floors thoroughly every day with desinfectants, there were some unappealing stains on the bathroom floor. The towels were old and rather threatbare, and it would have been nice if they could have had a bath mat to step on after getting out of the shower. The hotel provides tiny pieces of soap, but you have to bring your own shampoo. I would recommend this hotel to my younger friends who are budget conscious and just need a place to sleep.

Hence I know it would be noisy at night but it was also in a prime location... in the middle of La Rambla, less than 100m from Liceu metro station, on the green line, which is the direct line to most of the places we wanted to visit. The reception was friendly and helpful and fluent in English, whoever was manning the desk. They also have a left luggage area, although it is not secured. They have a dining area but I have never seen it open. I guess, why use it when there are so man eateries just yards away. It is not far from the La Boqueria market where we got our daily rations of fruits and juices for breakfast. Carrfour express was also nearby where we got our crossaints. Thats breakfast sorted! The air con was not working - I dont know if it was deliberate or not, but as it was October,we just had to open the patio doors to let in the cool air. This door led to a narrow balcony which I only went out to once as I did not feel safe on it 5 floors up. At least I was not worried about thieves climbing in at that height! Cleanliness was perfect. Mattress and shower was fine too. TV was only a 14in CRT but at least it had 2 English news channels .. better than some other hotels I have been to with no English channels. Another reason I picked this hotel was the free wifi. Tested the speed and it hovers at around 20kbyte p/s. Sometimes it does slow down and you have to disconnect and reconnect the wifi to continue surfing. However it was functional for webbrowsing. On the safety issue, I had a young kid with me and it was ok. There were prostitutes hanging on the La Rambla corner at midnight but they never bothered us. However, it would be best for kids not to be out past 10pm where shops start closing and some of the side streets off the Ramblas gets a bit deserted.

We were originally looking for a cheap city break and 1st looked at Travelodge in Barcelona but decide it was too far out and too expensive. We were so lucky that we searched again and found the Hotel Condal. We had originally booked a double but were informed that there was a problem with the 1st night and that only a twin was available (room 405) but we could change the following day but we said that a twin was ok for the 3 nights. The room was all we needed for our short stay. The wardrobe was small but adequate and had a free safe. Satellite TV was what we expected a couple of music channels (Spanish and German) 2 News Channels (BBC World and CNN) the rest were a mixture of Spanish German and French. So don\u2019t go expecting spending an evening in watching TV. There is no coffee/tea making facilities in the room so bring your own travel kettle and cups (no fridge, so maybe long life milk is an option). Also there is no hairdryer. But if you know these things in advance you can always bring your own. The maid came in everyday with fresh towels and did our beds. The hotel website says you can have a la carte breakfast\u2026.. I think something happened in the translation as all you could buy was coffee/tea/fruit juice and croissants/toast/pastries for breakfast. - 2 coffees 4 rounds toast with butter and marmalade was about 7 euro. The location of the hotel is great. The street the hotel is located on, is pedestrianised and is midway along las Ramblas, (the walk to las Ramblas is about 1 min). A few doors away from the hotel is the Tapas Gaudi where you can get a cooked breakfast with coffee & fruit juice for a reasonable price. But beware of restaurants in the las Ramblas area that do not display the prices of their drinks. A \u00bd litre glass of coke can cost 6 euros and \u00bd litre glass of sangria can cost 9 euro. Even though the food prices seem reasonable watch out for the drinks. There are fast food outlets around such as KFC and McDonalds/Burger King but Pans where you can buy filled baguette meals are good value. There is also the market on Ramblas near the hotel where you can buy fresh food. One place we were really pleased to find for a mid afternoon snack was by la Sagrada Fam\u00edlia. Near the stop of the blue bus tour is a corner caf\u00e9 where you can buy coffee and croissant for 1.20 euro (I think it\u2019s where workmen from the church go). Palau de la M\u00fasica is a place we missed seeing as you needed to book in advance and as we had booked the 2 day hop on and off bus tours we could not guarentee getting back in time. If you enjoy seeing the sights you can take a hop on and off bus tour which has 2 routes. It costs 23 euro for 1 day or 29 euro for 2 days Over all this was a very enjoyable trip, only spoiled by the cost of drinks.", "Date": "January 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pennsylvannia", "Title": "\u201cWonderful experience!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "Rose117", "ReviewID": "UR54019274", "Content": "Clean, friendly and in the heart of Barcelona's famous Las Ramblas.

First of all the location is unbeatable. Right of Las Ramblas close to the Bocqueria, halway between Placa Catalunya and Port Olimpic, and in the heart of all the shopping. Right between 2 metro stops, which meant we were connected to EVERYTHING at anytime. Plenty of restaurants in the area and bars. This only bothered us on the first night since we were exhausted having arrived from Ibiza (go figure) and wanted a good sleep, although there was loads of screaming and yelling coming from outside. After that, it was usually quiet at around 2 am (and this is Barcelona, why would you go to bed before that??) The hotel looks directly onto another building, I believe a hostel, and it actually was a great way to meet people! Staff was amazing. Very friendly and helpful and patient with us no matter what time we came in. There was also free wifi internet in the lobby which was fast and useful. Theres also a bunch of internet locations around the corner which was nice too. We had to extend our stay an extra night, but the hotel was fully booked, so they offered to move us to their sister location, a ocuple of steps down, but called up the day we were meant to check out, and said we could stay and even keep our room. The rooms are, at the end of the day, 2 star. Nothing extravagant at all. Extremely basic and small. Bathroom was relatively clean. Toiletries basic - shampoo and soup. And they brought extra towels upon request. Bare floor. AC was fine, except for the last night, when I think the whole hotel suffered. That was an absolute disaster. FYI the windows need to be CLOSED for the AC to work. Most hotels in spain have that system installed. Beds I have to say though were INCREDIBLE uncomfortable! Very hard and springy and horrible. And they made noises all ngiht whenever anybody shifted just a bit. That too me was the biggest disaster. So overall would recc. based on service and location, but defiently not extravagant or luxury. Extremely basic but worthwhile, and this coming from someone who enjoys 5* on a regular basis.", "Date": "October 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Princeton, NJ", "Title": "\u201cGreat Clean, Safe Hotel\u201d", "Author": "mj1010", "ReviewID": "UR45768243", "Content": "I stayed with my girlfriends for one night prior to a cruise.

My room faced the narrow street (so the noise just bounced off the walls), and even with the windows shut and the motorised aluminium shutters down, it was LOUD. The bar a few doors down the road didn't help, especially when the Football was on! Even the church bells in the morning (which normally I would find charming) was enough to drive my sleep deprived mind to murderous thoughts, at least until I had my coffee. Breakfast wasn't included in my rate, but the hotel's small cafe downstairs served coffee and sweet breads. I never ate there, prefering instead to pay over the top tourist prices for the privilege of enjoying my breakfast on La Ramblas, so can't comment on the food! Hint, shop around for your coffee! One place cost \u20ac3.95 when the cafe next door to it was only \u20ac1.80 which is waaaaay more reasonable! The room itself was small, but well laid out and clean (except the yellowing bed spread with a multitude of stains ewwww!) The bed was ok, but not great as it was a bit too firm and I could feel the springs in places. The bathroom was clean and efficient but the towels were a bit small and rough.
