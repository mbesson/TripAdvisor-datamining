For the ones that still may want to reach it, just get the Hertz Logan airport POI and you'll be able to see it when in the neighborhood. First surprise came from the front-desk when I was candidly asked if I'm sure I have a reservation there ... only seconds later to get the confirmation while I was already checking out checkmytrip.com in order to get the nice but customer relations unskilled lady the confirmation of the booking. Second surprise - suites. Now, I just got back from an inferior ranked location in which one room was bigger than the entire \"suite\" from this hotel. I believe that 3 closet sized rooms (bathroom included) cannot be considered a suite even if you throw a second tv in the living and a large desk with three chairs (?!!??!?). AC was noisy and I mean very noisy. Not to be picky but even turned off the device was making sloshing noises. May worth mentioning that the in-wall unit is 3 feet away from the bed so no-one can be mislead by my not at all bat like hearing abilities. Internet connection costs $ 9.99 per day PER DEVICE... and the speed is analog lines dial-up... cross-referencing Logan Airport's $7.99 24 hours premium access and also their lower speed advertising based free WiFi option (which by all means it's nothing but a fast one to which you are granted access upon viewing an ad or completing a survey) I can conclude that this is a rip off. Shorting this review out although there are other things to be said, the shuttle van that transports you to the airport may leave you in the wrong terminal if you were unfortunate enough to respond to the driver question about the airline you're traveling with since he's unaware of the term of code-sharing and every attempt to tell him that you should be dropped off at terminal B instead of E it's futile. For what it matters, walking the almost 2 miles inside the airport from terminal E to B it's a good workout and you also have go walk in an open parking lot so be sure to have a shower before you check out from the hotel.", "Date": "March 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Louisville, KY", "Title": "\u201cConvenient location and quiet\u201d", "Author": "briak-ky", "ReviewID": "UR125951898", "Content": "Nothing special about this hotel except its location.

There was plenty of room to spread out and the king sized bed was very comfortable. Unfortunately, the pullout couch felt like a pullout - nothing luxurious there.

We ate breakfast in the hotel both mornings and it was fair. You could get cooked-to-order omelets and eggs but everything else was standard buffett fair of sausage, bacon, homefries, scrambled eggs, pancakes and waffles. There was a nice enough selection to keep all 6 of us happy between the items mentioned above plus yogurts, bagels, fresh fruit, oatmeal, pastries and toast. Nothing fancy but enough to keep you full until you can hit Quincy Market! My only complaint was that on Friday evening, after we realized there were no extra pillows in the closet for the pullout couch, our request for additional pillows was never granted. It was remedied the next day. We did also use the pool, which was small but adequate since it wasn't terribly busy.

The subway (T) is literally a short (5-8 minute) walk across one of the most beautiful play parks and soccer field we've ever seen! Every day our youngest insisted on stopping for a moment to splash in the play fountain or climb on the playground equipment. Don't want to walk? No problem...the hotel provides a free shuttle around the block and drops you off at the door of the subway station. When you return in the evening, just call the hotel lobby and they will send the shuttle around for you. We did this on a late evening when it was raining. Other amenities were nice...kids loved the pool, cookies at the front desk each night along with a early evening reception. The pull-out bed is the only negative...it would be comfy enough for a child or teenager, but for us adults it wasn't supportive enough. It was our choice though...we wanted a room to ourselves and let the kids have the nice beds! Lastly, our hotel housekeeper was wonderful! We left her a small tip each day, and she got more and more creative in her special touches on the room...stuffed animals arranged on the beds, and extra snacks and a sweet note.", "Date": "June 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saudi Arabia", "Title": "\u201cDecent hotel, but way over priced\u201d", "Author": "expatrick", "ReviewID": "UR114772866", "Content": "The propery is older, somewhat outdated, but clean and comfortable.

Kudos to the express service. On appearance the room looked clean, but really it wasn't. Dust was everywhere and the bathroom floors had mold. Not a good sight. Things got worse when I took a shower. Yikes. The drain (located across the room; keep in mind it is a handicap room) overflowed and had water come from the opposite side of the bathroom. A nighmare. They ended sending someone to address the problem and I have to admit, watching the plumber/handy man open up the drain was one of the grossiest things I've ever seen.

Sadly, it was not the best Embassy we've stayed at. The property was in the midst of a remodeling during our stay, as signs throughout the building apologized and thanked us for our understanding. We didn't notice any real \"remodeling,\" and wondered if the signs were just an excuse for the general lack of cleanliness we experienced. The hallways were in need of vacuuming, and the elevators were full of crumbs and in need of vacuuming, as well. We arrived at our room after being greeted at the front desk by a pleasant, if not especially personable, clerk, to find that it was unacceptably dirty and smelled strongly of cigarette smoke, despite the \"no smoking\" sign on the door. There were stains on the carpet, hair in the shower, an apparently uncleaned toilet, and cluttered with miscellaneous furniture. My husband returmed to the front desk to request a different room and was told that all that was available was a handicapped suite. We decided to take our chances and found the new room to be much more acceptable. Being handicapped-accessible, it was free of the extraneous desk and there was much more room to move around. Additionally, the bathroom was great - big and roomy, although with a standard bathtub (not a roll-in type), I don't know how truly \"handicap accessible\" it would have been. This room was slightly cleaner, but at least didn't reek of cigarette smoke.

I can accept that the room was not ready but the attitude of the front desk was not professional.

These were good.. The other perk... breakfast and a 2 hour \"managers reception\" (which usually means cocktails/beer/wine and some food was a huge disappointment. The breakfast was OK... it depends if they had what you were looking for when you got there. They ran out of bacon, coffee, cups, and glasses several times while I was down for breakfast. I don't know if the bus people were on strike but it looked like managers were picking up plates and clearing tables. They did not seem to like what they were doing and were rude to many. If it was the regular work staff.... then they need an attitude adjustment. But let me warn those who look forward to the \"free\" booze at the Embassy.... you won't get any here. It is a State law that does not allow anyone or any business to give away free drinks. Heck... they don't even have \"happy hour\" in Massachusetts because you can't sell liquor at a discount either.

The bed had numerous fluffy pillows and the alarm clock is quite handy and easy to use. The bed seemed a bit lumpy but there might have been a pillow top on it. Still, I got a good night's sleep and I was surprised that being so close to the airport, it was fairly quiet. The mini fridge and sink, found in most Embassy Suites is always a nice addition. Unlike the other three Embassy Suites I have stayed in, the hallways at this Embassy Suites are not \"open\" in does not overlook an atrium. Being a solo female traveler, this is one of the main reasons I stay at the Embassy Suites and I was concerned that this safety feature was not part of the hotel. I have some concerns about customer service and I hope in time some will be corrected. After picking up my baggage, I called the hotel to ask for a van pick-up. I asked the operator where to wait. I travel to Boston irregularly and sometimes I forget where I have to go for van pick-up. I want to make sure I'm going to the right place. Hotel employees should remember that travelers don't always know where to go--that is why they are contacting the front desk. I'm wondering if the majority of the guests who stay here are business guests or airline crew who stay at the hotel often and \"know the ropes.\" Her reply was rather rude and abrupt--I was asking a question, in a neutral tone--I wasn't yelling at her.

He refused a tip and said that he was actually a hotel engineer who didn't want me to have to wait because the actual valet was busy! Check in was flawless. I was taken right away by shuttle to the airport stop on the blue line. I could not believe my ears when the driver took a call from his boss that I overheard. The boss told the driver how much he appreciated him, and the driver told the boss that he had made his day and he loved working there. My husband used a pay phone to call for the shuttle from the Airport subway stop and was astonished when the shuttle showed up in about 3 minutes (this is really nice on a cold winter evening). Their shuttle runs every 15 minutes 24/7 to all the terminals and was right there on time at 4:15 AM when we needed it. We were told that the staff will give you a to go bag of a muffin and apple if you depart before the restaurant opens at 6 AM. When we returned we called for the shuttle which arrived very quickly and they had our car ready and waiting with the heater running at the front door (again very appreciated on winter morning). When I went to tip the valet for handling the bags and bringing up the car, he had vanished. Also the shuttle driver went out of his way to make sure that we understood how to navigate the airport exits on the way out of the hotel. Could all of this \"niceness\" really be happening at a big city hotel? It is hard to believe, but they must be serving happy pills in the employee cafeteria!

We didn't stay here when we came back, because, probably due to the AL championship series (Red Sox) which was going on then, the price more than doubled. I'm basing my review on the price we paid--that is, $160. I have also stayed three times at the Hilton-Logan (two for extended stays) and at the Hampton Inn-Logan for a four night stay, so I can compare these three HHonors properties. To be brief, the Hilton gets the edge over this hotel only with respect to its fitness facilities. The only improvement the Hampton has over this facility is that its parking is free (and easy). While all three made for a comfortable, pleasant stay, I would prefer to stay in this hotel if the prices are similar (big if--it really depends on expected occupancy!). (1) Roominess. As one might expect from an Embassy Suites, the rooms have more space. I will have to qualify this by saying that the living room was a bit smaller than that of any other Embassy Suites I've stayed at, however. This hotel is the only one of the three with two TV's, a full-sized couch, and a full-sized dining room table in addition to the coffee table. And it's the only one with a microwave oven and full sink. (2) Easy access to the T, and the only one of the three which does not require a shuttle. You're just a few stops from downtown. What could be easier? (3) Easy access to rental car lots. Again, the only one which doesn't require a shuttle (across the street from Dollar, Hertz, and Avis lots)--although the others will send their shuttles (4) Best breakfast, hands-down. The Hilton has an expanded Continental breakfast on its top floor for us HHonors Gold members, and, as usual, the Hampton two hot food offerings. Embassy Suites are known for their breakfasts and evening receptions, however. (5) Best dinner. We ordered room service at the Embassy Suites, having arrived after 10 PM. Our dishes were delicious (I had the seafood pasta)--even better than the better of the two Hilton eateries. (6) The Hilton and the Embassy Suites tie for their excellent shuttle service--rarely more than a 5 minute wait for either (they are both so close to the terminal). (7) The views are a virtual tie for the Hilton and the Embassy Suites--assuming you get a room with a city view. The Hilton does have a nicer gym in that it has a changing/locker room (I 'm never thrilled about going in the elevator in sweaty gym attire), as well as a sauna/spa. Also, if you have a car, the Hampton Inn will be more convenient--just park in and leave when you want for free. I loved our all-too-brief time at this Embassy Suites.

The rooms were spacious and clean. There was a nice big bathroom and a small fridge and microwave. Lobby includes a restaurant and bar. We only used the restaurant at breakfast time. Room rate includes a breakfast. Breakfast was pretty good with an omlette station, pancakes, waffles, fruit and the usual assortment of donuts and carb fare. The first night we stayed in and ordered room service. Room service was pricey as it typically is in hotels, but the food was decent and it didn't take long to get. The one downside of this property is that it isn't close to any restaurants. If one desires non hotel food then a trip on the T into the city is the way to go. One reason we chose this hotel other than the fact it was close to the airport, but it also close to rental car agencies.

Massachusetts law however prohibits the free booze, so don't expect it, and the one draft Guinness beer that I bought at their bar was almost $7.00, and the food at the reception was the same every night, deep fried cheese sticks and deep fried raviolis. I did find a liquor store about a 10 minute walk from the hotel where I bought a case of beer for my 8 day stay, and there was a fridge in my room. The bartender tried to tell me that it was illegal to bring beer downstairs, but I really think that he was just upset that I bucked the system. The pool is inside and although I didn't use it, it just seemed like a typical indoor pool, and the workout room was smallish. To get into the city you have several different options. You can take a taxi which will cost you between $25.00 and $30.00 for the 2 to 3 mile ride, or take the hotel shuttle to the airport and catch the Silver Line bus from any terminal, for $2.00 each ride. I bought a week long pass that was only $15.00 and was good on both the bus and the Subway, which they call the \"T\". I bought this pass just inside the baggage claim door at the airport. The Blue Line \"T\" is a 5 minute walk through the park across the street, and takes you right into the main tourist part of Boston, get off at State. The State station is right in the middle of the Freedom trail, so you can take it to the left or right.

No problem, as we wanted to get some lunch anyway, so we asked about having them hold our luggage. \"No problem,\" I was told and \"Please go wait over there by the concierge desk\". So we wait, and wait, and wait, all the time in the full view of the front desk and the lady there who had told us where to wait. After about 10 minutes I go back over and ask if we are going to be able to check out bags some time today (actually I asked very nicely), and she acts very surprised that we were still waiting. Hey lady, we've been standing right in your full view while you weren't doing anything for 10 minutes--why would you be surprised? So we finally get someone to help us check our luggage and I then I go back to the front desk lady and ask her for directions to some nearby food and she recommends we walk down Cottage St. to Chelsea where there is a very good pizza place. Great. However after walking probably 3/4 miles (with a 9 and 13 year old) all the way to the end of Cottage we find it never intersects with Chelsea and that you have to walk over a few blocks. Gee thanks for the great directions lady. Strike number two. As an aside, we never did find the place but we did find a nice little sandwich and ice cream shop in the area that I highly recommend--sorry can't remember the name, you'll have to ask the front desk ;-). When we get back to the hotel we find our room is now ready and we check in. When we then ask for our luggage, you'll never guess, we again have to wait standing in front of the desk and have to again ask them for help. Strike three. While we're waiting for our luggage we notice that, hey, isn't that all of our luggage sitting completely unprotected in a small alcove next to the desk with no one around? Why yes it is. Next batter, strike one. It was somewhat amusing when the guy came to give us our luggage (a different person from the one who took it) that HE started to look for it in the locked room next to the desk and WE had to tell him, no, its right there in plain view. Even he look surprised. So now we go up to the room and I have to say again, what a disappointment compared to the other Embassy Suites I've stayed in. And this hotel is not some cheapo hotel either. If I was paying $100 a night, yeah, I'd expect the room to look as tired as it did but not for over $240 a night. Second batter, strike two. Honestly, at the rate this hotel is going in the short time we've been here I think I could strike out the side. I should add like others have done that the nightly managers reception is dry due to local laws. I had read Tripadvisor and knew that however so I wasn't surprised. What has surprised me though is the nearly uniform ineptitude of the staff we have encounted and the somewhat rundown condition of the facilties. I am not a complainer by nature and have always had great experiences at Embassy Suites, so I think the difference from what I've come to expect from this chain is prompting me to write this review as I did as much as the poor experience I have had here. So, even though we are supposed to leave for three days in Maine then come back for three days and stay and this same Embassy Suites, we are cancelling and looking for a better option. Even though this is probably the most convenient place for us to stay there is no way I'm paying to stay here for three nights. I am sure I will stay at other Embassy Suites in the future, however, I am equally sure that I will never stay in this particular one again.", "Date": "August 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "seattle", "Title": "\u201cworst embassy suite ever\u201d", "Author": "travelhappySeattle", "ReviewID": "UR8264087", "Content": "Staff knew nothing about Boston, public transportation, location Brandeiss and no one would help Air conditioning did not work Asked for non smoking and put in a \"non smoking room\" but could still smell smoke on floor and in room, could not get room switched 2 lamps broken breakfast disorganized, dirty silverware, out of juice driveway cannot accomodate van", "Date": "July 31, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cdecent experience but not typical Embassy Suites\u201d", "Author": "lisat1", "ReviewID": "UR8220751", "Content": "Overall it was a good stay although we were only there for one night.

June 29th- July 2nd. I did not want to pay center city prices. Since we are avid users of the T, we wanted to be close to a T stop. The made to order included breakfast and the nightly manager's reception was a definite plus. We are Hilton honors members and usuallly gravitate to Embassy Suites. As pointed out by other reviewers there are some differences at this Embassy Suites. You do not have the large atrium with all of the rooms coming off of it. Your room opens onto a hall instead. This eliminates one of my pet peeves found in most Embassy Suites. That is the 3 AM door slam which tends to reverberate throughout the cavernous atrium. If you are sleeping on the pullout, this is something you can't miss. The rooms are a little smaller, but not to the extent that it causes a problem. They have at least 4 shuttle busses. (I counted) They are very close to the airport. Our view overlooked the Dollar rent a car lot with the airport in the backround. If you have kids who love planes, you can look out the windows and watch the planes take off. You also overlook the new astroturffed ball fields. Bring your soccer ball and enjoy. The new T station is a very short walk from the hotel. You simply come out the main entrance, cross the street, walk around the fields to the left, and run right into the T station. If you are in Boston for a few days and plan to use the T for your travels, get the 7 day link pass for only 12 dollars. The T is an experience in itself. Lots of people watching and always a station convenient to your destination. Boston is a walking city, and the T helps you to do that. The hotel has a business center with computers for your use. There is a small gym with a couple of treadmills and a few other machines. The pool was mainly frequented by children nonstop. There was supposed to be adult supervision, but I rarely saw any. So if you are an adult looking for a little relaxation in the hot tub, this is not the place for it. I don't fault the hotel for this situation though. Just a product of the me generation. To sum it up, I would use this hotel again in a heartbeat when visiting Boston. P.S. There is a kiosk located by the front desk for you to print out your boarding passes.

This hotel is convenient to the airport and to all public transportation which is a breeze to use once you get used to it. We drove in with a rent a car - then I checked in with my bags and returned the car and the hotel shuttle picked me up. The airport is literally a stones throw from the airport. But I never was bothered by airplane noise. We had a FABULOUS room. The only room left was a handicapped accessible - no problem as the only change was grab bars and a higher table. Despite the discounted rate, we had a room with a beautiful view of the Boston skyline. You can walk to the T line (subway) through a nice park area or you can take the shuttle to the bus to the T line. After the conference we went all over boston using our subway cards and it was a snap. I am a west coaster so we dont usually do public transportation but it was easy and quick. The hotel as with all embassy suites has a cooked breakfast. It was really helpful and we always took just a couple things for later snack like a piece of fruit or yoghurt which you can put in your inroom refrigerator. The ONLY drawback is you are not close to ANY type of food service so eat while you are out and again you can stock up on a couple snack items from breakfast for later. Also suggest that you NOT take a car as it is not setup for parking. In addition, if you have kids the pool is not huge and is indoor and not heated.

Unlike most Embassies I've visited, the atrium doesn't extend all the way up to the top floors. The building is much more like a standard hotel with enclosed hallways and rooms on both sides of the hallway, rather than being open to the atrium. There's also no pond or anything in the atrium, just the restaurant. Service was courteous and efficient. I never had to wait long at the check-in desk and room service only took 30 minutes. However, restaurant and room service prices were pretty high. Most entrees on the menu were $30, plus 18% automatic gratuity for room service, PLUG $3 delivery charge. I did like the room layout and everything was very comfortable. Instead of the \"rectangular\" standard Embassy layout where you enter into the living room and then the bedroom is further back by the window, with the bathroom sandwiched in the middle, this had more of a \"square\" layout. The living room extended all the way to the back wall and window, the bedroom was to the right with its own window, and the bathroom was in the hallway corner with doors opening to both living and bedrooms.

My room was essentially three rooms (living room, bathroom, and a bedroom). The bed was large (king) and extremely comfy. The linens were drawn and they had big fluffy pillows. The decor was modern and fresh. The bathoom was crisp and well maintained (i.e. no water marks on the ceiline, no mildew or gunk on the tiles, no cracked floor tiles). The living room was small but functional with a desk, a TV and small loveseat type couch.

Also, if you want to get a cab from the hotel, forget using the valet or calling a cab, you'll be waiting forever. Turn right out of the entrance and walk 20 yards to the street corner and hail one, they pass by every few minutes. Hotel is spacious, rooms nice. We were on the top floor and had a stunning view of the downtown skyline. Lobby is good, free breakfast is fair. Staff prompt and friendly.

There were 2 queen sized beds in one room and a sofa bed in the living area. As we were 2 couples, one had the room, one had the living area - it worked well. The bathroom was a 2 way bathroom which gave us some privacy. The hotel rate included shuttle service to and from the airport as well as a free cooked to order (plus continental) breakfast each morning. The variety of what was available for breakfast was great, although inconsistent. Don't expect to have the same variety every day. There is also manager's drinks each night, we only took part in that on one night, a nice touch. The staff, apart from the front desk staff, were all very pleasant. Often wearing several hats depending on what was required each day. As it was so close to the airport the wait for a taxi was very minimal. The restaurant/bar staff were also helpful, on our first night one of them sat down with us and provided us with some good Boston hints for our next days exploring! That was great!

I had thought they would have a lot of appetizers seeing that Mass. wont allow happy hours. I had expected chicken wings, meatballs etc. When we arrived at the hotel we thought we would get a drink at the bar, it doesn't open until 5, it didn't look like you could order a sandwich either until 5:30. There is nothing within walking distance. We ordered 3 drinks later, a beer, a glass of wine and a rum and coke, the bartender didnt know if $20 would cover it, it came to $17, plus tip. Didn't stay there long. The breakfast is just so, so. probably the worse french toast i've ever had and the omelets werent much better. The living room area was adequate but not large.

We were flying out of Logan and wanted to see Boston but did not want to pay the $300+ hotel rates to stay downtown. I booked the AARP rate for $151 on the Hilton website. I am very picky about hotels and our room was immaculate and is the cleanest hotel room I have ever stayed in. The room was nicely decorated and we had plenty of room. I don't know how old this property is but it appears brand new. The staff was very friendly and helpful. This hotel is located on a street with alot of car rental companies. We had rented from Alamo and turned the car in immediately upon arriving at the Embassy Suites. The hotel shuttle would have picked me up but I walked since it was a nice day. It took about 7 or 8 minutes to walk to the hotel We mostly took taxis to go downtown since we had our 4 year old and my parents who are older with us. Taxis cost anywhere between $22 and $25 to go to Faneuill Hall, Public Garden, or the Aquarium. I think that some drivers must have taken us the long way around. We paid a variety of rates to go and from the same places. For example one night we paid $27 to go to Faneuill Hall, coming back it was only $10. We had a mini-van going so that was an extra 5 and also going downtown you pay the fee for the Ted Williams tunnel (about $5 I think). So even after you subtract the mini-van and tunnel charges there is still a big difference in what we paid. I did take the T downtown by myself a few times and it was very easy. The hotel shuttle will take drop you off and pick you up at the Airport T station. I did walk the first time I went since it was in the afternoon. I do not recommend walking the first time you go as there is alot of construction in the area and it is difficult to find. I had to stop and ask people where it was a couple of times and ended up walking past where I should have.
