It's a very central hotel, so for that it gets a big plus. However, there were many negative points to the hotel, which meant 2 stars only. Firstly, AIR CON! There is none at the hotel. The first night was so hot, we didn't get any sleep which we thought would ruin our stay. However, we did manage to get a little used to this, although it did mean around 4 showers a day. They have a fan (old fashioned one on the roof - noisy) but it's nothing like air con. Secondly, the room and the whole hotel could do with a little updating! The wall paper was a little torn and also faded. Thirdly, there was quite a bit of noise coming from other rooms. On one night, we were woken up by a group of teenagers at around 3am slamming doors and shouting, and this went on for a good hour or so. Also, we had a dog in the room next door (although this didn't bother us, we could hear him yapping every now and then). Lastly, security! Or lack of! We arrived back in the room around mid-day and found our room door wide open. We went in expecting to see the maid, but there was no sign of anyone. After 5 minutes of checking out stuff, we realised the gate (to the outside, not a balcony but a little flower pot area) was open and the maid was out there who seemed shocked to see us. How long the door was open for I don't know. Also, we had a fair bit of money with us and there was no option for a safe or security box at the hotel. A plus (in my opinion) is the lift! Yes it's about as old as the Colosseum, but it's brilliant! I loved it anyway! As we said, it's a good location for anyone, very close to the Termini Station, athough we did walk everywhere. We did all the usual visits and sightseeing and it's all very easy from the hotel. There's also plenty of food places within 5 minutes of the hotel. I hope this helps, if anyone has any questions, please feel free to contact me.

The hotel is about 2-3 minutes walk from Rome Termini station (which I think is their best asset!). We took a room with shared washroom (the room has a sink though). Washroom is very very small. The shower area is only about 2 ft x 4 ft. Absolutely, no big fat person can fit it in. The room doesn\u2019t have air conditioner, just a small desk fan. There\u2019s a small TV in the room with only 1 English channel. The hotel is kinda difficult to find since there are lots of one way streets in the neighbourhood. It is situated on top of a pasta & pizza restaurant and the room we got was facing the street. We didn\u2019t get quality sleep on our first night in Rome as all we could hear was the noise from the people eating at the restaurant, cars passing by, the screeching sound of the streetcar on the rails, and the sound of tables & chairs being stacked when the restaurant closes at past midnight. The hotel is generally kept clean. There\u2019s an old-type elevator that only 2 people with small luggages can fit in (see attached pictures). The male receptionist only provided answers to questions we specifically asked, and gave us a map. There was no effort to give us more details about the neighbourhood, the public transportation, good restaurants, etc.", "Date": "July 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sotteville-les-Rouen, France", "Title": "\u201cClean, comfy, great quality for the price\u201d", "Author": "thelynne", "ReviewID": "UR114776062", "Content": "We stayed here for our spring break. For what we paid, we could not complain much. The room was small but clean and comfortable... we loved that we had TV with the BBC news, a clean bathroom that we never had to wait for, even though we shared it with the floor... and the location, which is very convenient for the train station and the main sites. The noise comments are true but we were tired enough not to notice. Double bed is actually two singles stuck together, but whatever. Staff is willing to explain to you which metro stops you should take for certain monuments. Small problem. When we invited a friend to spend an evening in our room, the hotel staff got pissy and forbade him from being there. It was annoying.

Other than that, nothing very special. Reasonably clean, reasonably friendly and helpful staff (most of whom speak decent English). It was pretty noisy outside, but we were very close to the station, and I'm not sure we could have found quieter this close. The setup is a bit confusing, with Terni sharing a single reception and lobby on the second (\"first\") floor with another sister hotel \"Dina\". As elsewhere in Italy, the queen bed is really just two twin mattresses side-by-side on a single frame. Probably no way to get a queen mattress up into the building.

There are many hotels near the train station, so I would take my chances somewhere else next time. We have been very happy with the generally reliable reviews on hotels on TA, this is the only exception. Price was highest of any city we stayed in (including Venice) and room was the dirtiest.

The best thing about this hotel is its location. Less than 2 blocks from the main train terminal in Rome (this is the one you arrive from the Airport and leave to other cities from) which is also where the local subway is located. This subway takes you everywhere in the center of Rome including the Vatican, Spanish Steps, Fountain of Trevi, the Colosseum, etc. Of course you will always have to walk a little from the station to destination but riding the subway is an inexpensive way to get you really close. Also this terminal is in the middle between routs A and B of the subway. It is the best terminal if you ask me, so it would be good to stay near it. Now about the rooms, as I said they are very simple but clean. We stayed in a double room 112, in winter time. The heater worked well and there was plenty of hot water in the shower. It has a hair dryer, shampoo, soap, and all those basic things. In general the bathroom is small but efficient.
