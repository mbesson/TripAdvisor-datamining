The actual area the hotel is in is still the city of Rome, but it's a fairly residential suburb so not action central. There were a number of Embassies and Consulates nearby, which should give a fairly positive indication of the nature of the area.

The location was nice as it was a fairly quiet area of Rome and did not deal with outside disturbances too often. As for the list of things that made our stay a bit of a disappointment, here is the list. Employees - not the most personable, and this was not due to language barrier. We could walk in and out of the lobby without any sort of acknowledgement of our presence. The rooms could've been cleaner. The fabric covered walls had perm. water stains on them. The shower was tiny. I've stayed in enough european hotels to know that things tend to run on the smallish side, but we're talking tiny by even these standards.

I have booked many things through the internet and have never seen a confirmed price change once you put in your credit card details. The hotel offered no help and took 206 Euros off of us.

This was mine (19years old) and my boyfriends (22years old) first holiday away together without my parents! Getting to the hotel itself was such a pain after we realised the metro station would have taken us there with no effort at all! This was our fault for not checking the metro map and instead walking there which took at least 30mins so if you are going, catch the metro after the train to Policinio (cant remember how you spell it!) Once we arrived though, the male receptionist was extremely helpful. He gave us a cartoony map of the city and marked the places of interest (Colosseum, Vatican City etc.) and where we would get off the metro. We constantly asked him for his help and he was always willing. Breakfast was a typical continental breakfast but plenty of food for all. The english tourists were very pleasant and the waitresses did their best to speak to us but spoke little english, yet always polite. The room was fantastic! After booking, we saw the pictures of the old green style rooms and were then disappointed, but on arrival we had a gorgeous room with adequate space, a huge double bed and lovely balcony over looking other hotels. None can be a 'city view' as this hotel is too far out and does not overlook the city, simply the side streets which are still pleasant. Went to a local pastry shop 5minutes away a few times which did the best chocolate croissants we have had! This hotel is great for those who want quiet in the evening but is still incredibly close to the action and attractions via the metro for whenever you need. Police sirens were quite regular though which did wake us a couple of times yet there was police every where we went, in and outside the city centre. We had been warned of pick-pocketers but were always aware of our hand luggage and luckily never experienced any. Eventhough this did not happen to us, we were always weary and never took more euros than we needed. Colosseum is ridiculously cheap for EU citizens so make sure you take your driving licence or passport with you. For people under 16 (i think!) it is free, and discount is for those between 17 and 26. Vatican City was expensive as we opted for the tour but the only thing we splashed out on and thoroughly enjoyed it. Would recommend. As i said, out first holiday away together and was definatly a success. Hotel was fab and Rome is certainly a romantic city! Perfect for couples of any age, probably not the best for large families as quite basic. Hope this helps!

The noise around Rome is high anyway mainly due to the incessant row of the ambulance sirens being left on all the time!

Got rather stuffy on a couple of nights, but the air con did not function, so I had to open the window, which in turn let all the usual city noise in. The breakfast self serving area was slighly small, so it got a bit crowded when at peak times (8.45 - 9.00) and the breakfast did not quite hit the mark for me. eg fresh orange juice was at an additional charge !
