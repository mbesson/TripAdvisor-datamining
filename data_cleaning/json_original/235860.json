The owner/manager Nicos, his brother and sister are charming, speak a few languages and are happy to answer questions, guide and help you.

Hotel Doni is a hotel that has a star placed under its name, and perhaps it is wise, not becouse it doesn't deserve more. No only becouse in that way you will get a pleasant surprise on your arrival. The breakfast at the hotel are enjoyed in the dining hall by the reception area, no channel view since the windows are too high on the wall. They serve simple breakfast rolls and marmalade, honey etc. There is juice, coffee and tea at the breakfast table. The staff at the hotel are service minded, speaks very good English and seems to have really good local knowledge of Venice. The hotel's location is priceless, I would say quite optimal, at least for the price you pay. With about 300m to St. Mark's Square, 200m to the nearest \"boat bus\" stop. It gives you the feeling of being in the heart of Venice! You are surrounded by canals, alleys and shops, restaurants and sights. But one thing should be borne in mind - service at the hotel seems to be quite unique. The feeling of being welcome is not quite present in many of the restaurants and shops of Venice. The city is a must for history interested, in fact for any traveler. And the city shall be enjoyed from the back streets and alleys. Perhaps rather than from the gondolas in the canals. It is certainly a fantastic way to see the city or it ishould I say live the city, but it is also an expensive pleasure. Perhaps the \"boat buses\" is the best option for you, just remember your camera and also stand in the open part of the boat for the best pictures.

Our room was on the third floor and was very charming with antique furniture and a picturesque view of one of Venice's cute, narrow canals. In the early evening we had a prime view of a parade of gondolas and lovely echos of singing gondoliers and according players playing for tourists. We shared a bathroom on the second floor (toilet and shower) but also had an in-room sink and bidet. The room and bathrooms were a bit dated but clean. As others have mentioned, the towels are very small, but knowing this ahead of time, we made sure to bring a travel towel and robes to walk comfortably from our room to the shower. The bed, while hard as a rock, was surprisingly comfortable! The pillows were also very hard, but luckily we brought travel pillows that made it okay.

Good thing is, it's right in the middle of things. Right in front of the Vaparettos that will take you to the other islands and back to the main for not very much money. +-3 euro?

When you go inside, the lighting is dim and cozy; you are greeted by a smiling face (mine was Nikkos). He told me how to get back to the airport when I left, which was my biggest worry since there is no street traffic in Venice (just boats and walking). I asked in advance for a room with a private bath, which was worth the extra $$ for me because I need my privacy in that area. There are not too many creature comforts in the room (TV, refrigerator, clock, etc), but for a short trip, it doesn't matter. It's just a place to sleep and leave your stuff...Venice is the kind of place to get lost in all day and night.

Basic is fine as long as fresh and new. I don't want to go on holidays in a place that is less than the simple standard where I live in Sydney. Doni is not fresh and new. It is a 1700's building (which is fine - it is Venice!) but the interior wallpaper, paint, bedspread, sidetables, chair etc don't look like they have been refurbed since possibly the same time my nanna moved into her first house in Sydney around 1955 (and I am NOT taking about priceless antiques!!). I could see it was clean, but the \"oldness\" and dirty finger marks all around the door frames, doors etc etc make you feel it is dirty. I have to say this was a real downer on my visit to Venice. I could see that the bathroom fittings have been renovated (ie. toilet, basin etc). The GOOD about Doni is location, location, location!! Directly behind the Daniella ?? hotel, it is PRIME Venetian real estate. You will be hob-nobbing with the Versace wearing tourists heading off to dinner at the finest of waterfront hotels. The other good point was that my room on the 3rd floor DID look over the small canal with the gondolas going past every night at sunset with the most magnificent renditions of \"O Solo Mio\" (?) and \"Feniculi Fenicular\" (?) I clapped so hard for the singer and accordian players that my hands were burning! That was tops!! OK - in summary, it was 3/10 of all my hotels on my 28 days in Switzerland and Italy in the EUR65-85 single room price range (I paid EUR65 so bottom end of the deal). If you are desperate to stay for this amount of money, it is OK. I strongly recommend you \"suck it up\" to coin a Sydney phrase, and realise Venice is one of the worlds top 5 most expensive cities, and pay the EUR100+ to stay somewhere a bit more fresh OR, stay a bit away from S.Marco ie. maybe Lido or Accademia Bridge area - nowhere is too far away in Venice - Rialto and Accademia Bridges are really only 15 mins walk from S.Marco Square (provided you don't stop and look at all the shops inbetween!!) The funny thing is that if the manager/owner was a bit more welcoming or interested in my stay, I probably would have thought a little better of the place (kinda' like visiting your nanna's place), but he just wanted to make sure I paid in cash when I left and that I could be out by 8.30am - and that's all he cared about. He was not rude, just money hungry for his cash. Ce la vie ...

I would recommend it without any reservations, and hope to stay there in the future. I chose the Doni (Albergo roughly translates to \"nicer, but still cheap hotel\" in Italian) because with them I was able to get a canal-view room for a price I could afford. Their website doesn't do much for me: the images are of dark, crowded rooms with frighteningly crimson beds. As we carried our bags from the Vaporetti station to the nearby Doni, I warned my partner not to expect much. I was in for a suprise. From the busy quay, we turned down a narrow alley (so narrow that despite reading up on Venice ahead of time, I thought it was *just* an alley) and walked a hundred yards before finding ourselves walking alongside a peaceful canal. The Doni is situated in an old building, and the the rooms go up all the way to the top (warning: room twenty-one entails three flights of stairs!) We were greeted wood paneling and Mozart, as well as Nico, whose friendly correspondence via email had convinced me to give the Doni a try. Nico told us that though we would have our first two nights in the room we'd booked, we would have to move on the last night for a previous reservation. That was a bit of a disappointment, but ok. We surrendered our passports, and climbed up to room 5. Room 5 is large by European standards and huge by Venetian standards, big enough to fit three beds in it with room to spare. The bed was great- comfortable with some of the best linen I've had in Europe (I typically stay at cheaper places) It came with a bidet, sink, and a wardrobe. But the real prize were the double windows which opened out over the canal, complete with the colored glass rondels famous in Northern Italy. I threw them open and propped my elbows on the ledge for a perfect view of the canal, nearby bridges, and a small yellow canary singing in the barred window opposite me. It was heaven. Actually, our whole stay at the Doni was pretty great. Breakfast was good for Italy; plenty of coffee and hot milk, corn flakes, jam and nutella, rolls, and some frightening juice we steered clear of. The hotel has a night guard and the door is always locked, but a quick buzz will generally summon the gatekeeper quickly. One amusing note: I noticed I was getting bitten by something in Venice. On the second day, the welts had only gotten bigger, so I thought I'd ask Nico if there were mosquitos in the area, and if so, where I could get an insect repellant. Nico thought we were accusing his hotel of being unclean. He insisted on looking at my bites and loudly protected that they weren't insect bites, I must have been scratching myself. We headed up to our room for a nap, but Nico wasn't done. After about twenty minutes, there was a knock on the door. I was sleepy (and in a nightshirt) so I dispatched my partner to deal with it. Nico was back for round two. He insisted vociferously (I'd even call it yelling) that there were NO BUGS in his hotel; my soft-spoken partner tried to calm him down, apologized, assured him that we didn't think anything of the sort, but Nico thundered on for a few minutes, telling us that we could see his complaint book if we didn't believe him! It was an entertaining end to our stay in Venice, though the mystery of the Venician biting insects still lives on. Highly recommended hotel- I definitely plan to return.

The Doni is certainly no luxury hotel, but it was worth the price we paid.", "Date": "April 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Yorktown, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cYou get what you pay for.\u201d", "Author": "TravelNovice", "ReviewID": "UR4998815", "Content": "What I had to keep reminding myself of was the fact that we were paying substanially less than what it would have cost to stay elsewhere in Venice. If you are traveling on a budget and you need an inexpensive place to stay, this place will certainly do. On the postivie side, the guy who runs the place is really great and the location can't be beat! Other than that, it's completely no-frills. I had to keep reminding myself, \"You get what you pay for.\" And in Venice, to stay somewhere nicer, you'd have to pay a whole lot more. Breakfast consisted of bread, butter, juice, cereal and coffee. The towels were hard, wrinkled sheets (you know, when you take a soaking wet towel, wring it out as tight as you can and then air dry it without fabric softner...). The beds in our room were not more than springs but the ones in our friends room were better. There are no TVs in the room. And most rooms do not have a private bathroom. It's a shared bath in the hallway. The thing I had the hardest time with was the shared bathroom. The bathrooms were very clean at 9:00 pm when I gave my kids a shower before bed. But when I woke up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom I about killed myself slipping on the floor...a rude awakening at 3:00 am! And in the morning when I went down the hall to shower I was pretty grossed out. Now I shower at my gym so common showers don't usually gross me out. But the body hair all over from the previous user caused me to turn my nose up. Mine may have been an unusual circumstance but with a shared bathroom you just never know what you'll get! Would I stay there again? Personally, probably not. Would I recommend it to someone who was traveling on a tight budget?

This is not The Plaza, but for what it is I have to say I was impressed. At the last minute my wife and I decided to visit Venice, I searched for days for a resonable priced hotel room during the busy Easter weekend and had a tough time finding one that was close, clean and charming (the only other option I found had terrible reviews). The room we got was the only one available in the hotel and had a shared bath. The shared bath was not my choice because my wife is a stickler for cleanliness, but surprisingly it was extremely clean and caused no problems at all. The room was bare bones, possessing a certain charm that is missing in most hotels. Our room overlooked the canal allowing us to spend our mornings and evenings with a great view without any walking needed. The staff was fantastic. All workers were very friendly and accomedating - all times of the day. The only criticisms are 1) the breakfast - very basic, not worth waiting around for if you are an early bird 2) the pillows were very dense - I actually loved them, not my wife though - I guess it is a matter of personal preference.", "Date": "April 17, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saddle Brook NJ", "Title": "\u201cGreat Doni\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4569559", "Content": "I can't say enough about this hotel and it's great location.
