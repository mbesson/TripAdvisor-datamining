I took one of these, not super spacious, but comfortable enough and a wonderful view. The only things could have been better during my stay were the tiny fitness center and their management, the overflow breakfast seating (in a conference room) over the busy Easter weekend, and not being able to check into the room until after 2pm.

I mentioned this to them after calling to confirm the booking and they first upgraded us to a slightly larger room but it was the view which was nicer. left a bottle of sparkling wine in an ice-bucket with a card. Sweet. Very nice quiet modern room, nice view, good sized bathroom/ wc. The terrace, on which you could have your breakfast on depending on the weather, had a lovely view over the river towards the Museum Insel where the bust of Nefertiti is housed. Unique with its' centrally-located 1 million litre aquarium which encloses a lift. Be warned, however, the aquarium/ lift belongs to the Seaworld chain which is located on the opposite side of the block and requires a separate ticket and actually has nothing per se to do with the hotel. The lobby bar is comfortable enough with a great selection of snacks and drinks. Unfortunately, we weren't there when the piano bar was going. Great staff particularly the bar staff and room service. The club sandwiches at 3am after a night out at the Cabaret were a Godsend!!! The spa/ pool rooms aren't massive but large enough and again, the attentive and diligent staff made all the difference. Concierge, reception, chamberstaff, etc - were all fantastic! The restaurant Heat is a great fusion of Western, German and Asian dishes which have, in my opinion, blended quite a unique selection of kitchens. Only criticisms: the pillows were too soft and the pool closes at 10pm instead of open 24hrs!!! All in all a lovely stay, nice 5-star standard experience, perhaps return with the kids next time!

It is astounding too, even though it does appear smaller in real life than in the pictures, it is still immensely large with hundreds of fish swarming around it at most hours. It really does form the centerpiece of the hotel and possible the Radisson Blu chain too. The hotel itself though is excellent. Ultra-modern, clean, intuitively-designed rooms with great functional bathrooms, AC (not loud) and opening windows, some of which have a beautiful view on the impressive Berlin cathedral just over the Spree. If you're lucky enough to get a room facing the aquarium (which I didn't want due to my preference of only natural light by day) you'll be able to gaze at the fish for hours. The small pool in the basement is clean-cut, simple and usually fairly empty and there are good changing facilities, free towel use (ones that get hot on contact!) and much more. Reception staff were very friendly, as were all of the other members of staff we spoke to including a particularly friendly doorman who provided us with his inside knowledge of the city he lives in to quickly locate the things we wanted to see. Although we didn't eat at the restaurant, the environment was very attractive. A glass facade facing the River Spree, the Berliner Dom and the UNESCO world-heritage site of the Museum Island. The offer of food was very good with as many salami, ham, cheese, egg, cereal, bread, yoghurt, fruit and more varieties than I've seen elsewhere for more money and just as many stars. Particularly notable about the hotel is its location. Although the complex seems set back into an old building with very little visible facade on the main street, it is located next door to the Berliner Dom, just a few minutes walk to Alexanderplatz and literally two minutes from all of the Museumsinsel attractions. The Hackische H\u00f6fe are very close and serve as one of the nearest U-Bahn stations. Friedrichshain, Kreuzberg and the other Western-Berlin attractions are a fair way off but easily reachable by S and U-Bahns alike. Shopping is closeby with a wide array of retailers within 15 minutes walk including drugstores, supermarkets, fashion and department stores. Restaurants are a plenty and so are pubs, bars and restaurants. A definite, comfortable, modern but humble retreat in the otherwise hectic, alternative and lively city of Berlin.

The other areas are no way near as nice (I saw them all), Radisson overlooks the amazing Berlin Cathedral (you can even request a room overlooking it) and is also right next to the telephone tower.

We are keen walkers so we covered much on foot but a near metro station is at hand if you need it. One other key factor is that the hotel is situated right next to a parade of restaurants and coffee shops, ideal of dinner and breakfast - fresh bread and coffer every morning! On the subject of food, the hotels own HEAT restaurant is super, the staff friendly and keen to please and the food really good, there are some reviews on here stating the price is a bit much but hey, I do live in London and \u00a340 -\u00a350 per person for a (GOOD) meal is worth it!

I was told to go to my room and wait for the police. I had to wait 3 hrs for the police to come so I could file a report. When finally a police officer came, he had apparently been already informed by the manager of the hotel, but was told a different story. Adding insult to injury, the management at the hotel showed more interest in deflecting resposibility away from their staff than showing concern about what had happened to me. They told me that these sort of things are not uncommon at the hotel, that theft has happened before and that it was my fault I'd brought valuables with me to the restaurant. If that was the case, they should have place warning signs around the hotel. I travel often and to many places. I know theft can happen anywhere in the street and in public places, but this is a 5 star hotel and you would expect it'd offer a safer and more secure environment for guests. Obviounsly, not Radisson Blu Hotel.

Clean, quiet and an amazing fish tank in the foyer. Book a room on the top floors so you get a good view of the fish tank in the lift every time you visit your room. There were three divers in there one morning cleaning the glass. If you don't get a top floor room, your 'lift' access card wont let you visit the higher floors of the hotel and you miss out on the view. Free wi-fi, your laptop will fit in the safe. Try and get a deal with breakfast included in your holiday package otherwise it can be a considerable extra cost. There was a lovely Christmas market opposite the hotel when I was there. This hotel is in a brillilant location, if you arrive at Tiegel Airport, the TXL bus which leaves the airport every ten minutes or so, stops almost outside the hotel. We arrived at night and spotted the front of the building lit up as we passed it and then stopped at the next bus stop. The 100 bus also stops outside the hotel and this route takes you to many of the sights and you can also pick up other useful routes, such as the 109. We bought a Berlin Wellcome Card for 22 Euros for 72 hours from the BVG desk at the airport. Follow the signs to the information desk at the airport, and just to the left of this desk is another office where you can buy the card. You get a map, a book and a ticket, which you must stick in the little yellow box when you get on the bus the first time. It stamps the ticket to validate it and then you just show it when you get on and off transport during your stay. You can use it unlimited on buses, trams and the underground and cut price entry to most of the key sights. The ticket includes the TXL bus to and from the airport which takes about 20 minutes. There is a river boat just down the steps outside of the hotel restaurant which takes you on a nice tour for a few Euros with your Berlin card and the card can also be used to get a discount into the DDR Museum which is just down the steps and well worth a trip as it's interactive and very interesting if you like social history about the Eastern Bloc and communism, you can climb into a 1980s Volvo and sit in a prison cell and sit on the sofa in a 1980s Eastern European living room.", "Date": "December 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "manchester", "Title": "\u201cNice relaxing unusual hotel where you can sleep with the fishes\u201d", "Author": "davidmlowe", "ReviewID": "UR121360027", "Content": "The impressive fish tank greets you as you check in.

It just feels like a very busy place where people pass through and when I stay in hotels at this price point I'm looking for that something extra, the personal touch, the differential - and it's more than just getting a chocolate on my pillow!

It is perfectly situated for all the sights of Berlin. It is located right next to the River Spree and Berlin Cathedral as well as the television tower.

We initially chose a room facing outside but this does not give you a view of the Cathedral etc, rather restaurants! So definitely ask for an AquaDom facing room. Only the business class rooms give views of Berlin! Reception were more than happy to switch us though! The room comes with a flat-screen television, Juliette balcony and large bathroom with powerful shower and lovely toiletries. Each night they place a chocolate by your bed which is a nice gesture! I found the staff excellent and really accommodating. I was ill for one day so put the do not disturb on the door. Housekeeping rang later to check if I wanted the room servicing and offered to help in anyway they could - impressed! We also requested late checkout free of charge. Oh the soundproofing is excellent-could not hear a thing from the lobby! I loved the spa facilities. There are 2 saunas and 1 steam room. Also included are foot-baths and amazing showers that spray you in all directions-very relaxing! The pool is small but as I was the only one in there it didn't feel small. It's a little cold so you have to swim! It also has powerful jets which you can switch on to swim against or just float away from! The hotel is spotlessly clean and beautifully designed. I could have watched the fish all day in the Aquarium! Berlin is a wonderful City to visit. We took a boat tour right outside the hotel to get our bearings. If you want to visit the Reichstag you must register by email at least 3 days beforehand. Check their website for details to avoid disappointment!

When we arrived at the hotel we were amazed by the aquadom in the foyer which we could also see from our room overlooking the foyer. The room is small with two hard and uncomfortable single beds pushed together, the pillows were like cotton wool and give no support whatsoever. We didn't sleep well at this hotel as a consequence.There are no teamaking facilities in the room, room service is $7 per small pot, given that we had just spent 7 hours on a train it would have been lovely to have a teamaking facility in the room, there is a mini bar but its very expensive. There are three English channels, two of which are news channels, one is Sky Cinema but half the time the movies werent in English despite it being listed as a English channel. It is lovely being able to see the aquadom from your room but its quite noisy with the door open, constant pinging of the elevators, general hub bub, also because there is no natural light or air its very dark and stuffy. Better to admire the aquadom from the foyer and have a room overlooking the river instead. Berlin itself is wonderful, when you leave the hotel turn right and keep walking in that direction towards the Brandenburg Gate which is about a 15 to 20 minute walk away. We walked up to the Gate twice, once in the daytime and again in the evening when it was lit up and there was a pianist playing right in front of it, amazing! We turned left on our first night towards Alexanderplatz which we found to be grotty, unfriendly and smelly. We only did this once! There are several lovely cafes right next to the hotel overlooking the lovely river and impressive Berlin Dom.

So we got a room on the sixth floor. We checked in at 1 PM, but they had no available rooms at that time, so the staff took our number and then they called us when the room was ready. We also asked for Internet access and we got a special access code. A nice touch and we could then sit in the big lobby while we were surfing and looking at the amazing aquarium. They also guided us to the nearest shopping mall with a smile and mentioned that we could borrow an umbrella from the Concierge, as it would be raining all day... And of course they took care of the luggage until the room was ready. The room (number 6101) was OK and on the top floor. Located right in front of the elevators. I noticed some rooms on the 4th and perhaps 5th floor, had a balcony wide enough for a small table and some chairs, but ours was just big enough for a person to stand there. We had a great view of the Cathedral and the boats passing by below. There was complementary Jelly Beans in a small bag :) and bottled water. You will also find a Nespresso coffee maker, which is standard in a lot of Radisson hotels and that's always nice. Free Wi-Fi and it worked flawlessly for once. Perhaps because we only used the code we got when we arrived. A lot of TV channels including 4-5 in English (mostly sports and news). One channel played a movie which was dubbed in German, but the next channel had the movie in its original language. The breakfast wasn't as impressive as in many other Radisson hotels, especially in Scandinavia. Here you'll find a regular buffet with a couple of hot dishes - Mostly eggs and sausages. They only had 1 bread toaster and it only took 2 slices of bread at a time, so you can imagine the wait you might experience on a busy day. They serve breakfast both in the restaurant and the adjoining lobby where you can enjoy a view to the huge fish tank. The waiters are very service oriented and I'm especially impressed with the service they offered a disabled man and their patience as he had a lot of trouble expressing himself clearly and therefore he got quite frustrated. We got late check-out which is offered in the business class upgrade upon availability. That was nice and we could then enjoy a film and relax in our room after breakfast before we left. As we were leaving we exited the basement parking and it wasn't a pleasant experience, as there are often a lot of traffic when you drive onto Spandauer Strasse from the parking garage. We were hit by a large truck that was stuck in the entrance of the garage and therefore decided to move to the exit lane, he just forgot to see if anybody was there already and the front of our car got totally smashed up. As the driver didn't spoke English, we went back into the hotel to get a translator. They wouldn't/couldn't help us with that in the reception, but they did call the police. Luckily the building inspector drove right behind us and he could lead the police to several surveillance cameras and from those the police could help us out as the truck driver at first didn't recognized it as his fault. We could have used a bit of help from the hotel in that situation, but I guess they didn't want to stand in the rain when we were no longer officially guests at the hotel?! Before the accident the hotel was almost a 5 star hotel (only the buffet breakfast lacked a bit), but when they left us standing alone with the truck driver who didn't understood us or recognized our anxiety while waiting for the police in front of their parking garage, I can't give them more than 3 stars.

The location is really nice if one is busy in Mitte - tourism, some shopping and the nice Hackescher Markt neighborhood, the Berlin Madison Ave., with really good restaurants. I also found the staff uniformly friendly and trying; the front desk was always very nice, and all maintenance staff greeted the guests as if after some very good training. And I like the pool that allows lap swimming, which has good opening hours (6 am - 10 pm). Why then just an \"average\" rating? Because all this may be as it is, but this is just not a ***** hotel by any standards - it is a **** one. Some of the general hotel amenities are ****, but the standard *rooms* (and these are not a cheap class but the main category) are definitely not; partially, they are even ***. And for me, the key to hotel is my room and not the public areas. Beds here are small, mattresses not that great, rooms are small (too small for two I think), the wifi (in a normal 4th floor room) often so weak it switched off (ipad, so the receiver was not the problem), a very inconvenient bathroom desk fromwhich things kept falling; a bad water and crane system that necessarily flooded the area with the stuff there; no reading lamps at the bed; and so on and so on. Sure, this is way better than a Motel One and even for **** I would have found this probably okay. But the fact is that for the price the Radisson Blu demands, and seeing how much other hotels in this category cost - Berlin is not expensive for hotels - there is no correlation; one pays to much for small, inconvenient rooms. If one wants precisely this location and/or the fish tank and isn't fussy about rooms and sleep quality, one should go here, but if one looks for a genuine ***** hotel, one definitely can find a much better one in Berlin, and for less money.", "Date": "July 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Athens, Greece", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location \u2013 Reservation problem\u201d", "Author": "Alexandros D", "ReviewID": "UR115631416", "Content": "Perfect hotel with an exceptional lobby and very good facilities with great staff.

Being there over the Christmas timeframe, there were many Christmas markets within walking distance. The hotel offers all of the comforts one expects such as a restaurant, bar, nice rooms, gym, and as an added bonus an aquarium. The staff were extremely helpful to include printing out documents that I needed and would've delivered them to my room if I hadn't beat them down to the lobby. Certain members on the bar staff were extremely slow, but it looked like it might have been a new crew. The biggest issue I had was with the concierge. Given the increased security measures, the only way to see the Reichstag was to have a reservation for dinner. We made our reservation for four for Christmas dinner through the concierge, however when we showed up the polizei had no records of the reservation being made at all and we couldn't go in. The rooms were nicely appointed and comfortable. We had a view of the Dome which was nice in the winter with the snow and blue sky. Wireless in the rooms is free, but if you want to use the computers in the lobby you'll need to pay. The speed was fast enough for what I needed it for. In order to use the elevator, you must use your room key which is a nice safety measure. The stairwells were also locked on the floors past the first floor as well, so you could evacuate if necessary but visitors couldn't bypass the elevators. The aquarium is adjacent to the hotel, and has part of it in the hotel lobby itself. It was relaxing to sit at the bar and watch the fish swim by. The aquarium itself is also worth a visit. We ate at the bar a few times, as the restaurant was overpriced for the special meals. The restaurant is reasonable at other times, but still pricey which was probably why not too many people were eating there.

The price (even with the guest discount) was too high. The rooms were modern. We had a view of the dome which was very nice.

All the maid did was make the bed and give us new towels. This shouldn't happen at any hotel. We didn't complain though. Luckily the next day the maid actually cleaned the room. The elevators were a pain. We go stuck between floors once. It was no big deal because the staff got us out within a few minutes. However, in general, the elevators were taking forever and were doing things like going down instead of up...etc. The hotel breakfast was very very good.

They have no idea and gave us wrong directions both ways. They kept saying to take the S9 from the closest station directly to the airport. There is no S9 at any of the stations near the hotel.

I would stay here again, unless I found a similarly located place a bit less expensive offering similar amenities. I had breakfast included -- otherwise it would be very pricey. Travel tips: Convenient #100 bus traverses the central city and the stop is to the right over the bridge. Easiest S-bahn stop is Hackesher Market -- turn right and then right again along the walk by the river. Follow to S-bahn. An Asian market is on the street across from and parallel to the S-bahn, where you can get inexpensive mineral water, tea and snacks for the room. Museums also accessed by walking along the river walk. It's only 5 or 10 minutes to get there. HEat restaurant very good. Room service also good - excellent \"veal escalope\", which is schnitzel. Some good restaurants in the Nikolaivertel. Cross the street in front of hotel and cross the Marx-Lenin square and you'll be in the area. I liked Provencal (along the river another block); also Zur Gerichtslaube small German restaurant by the Nikolai church. That whole area interesting to explore. I found Alexanderplatz extremely confusing for transportation and avoided it when possible. I did not take the airport bus, but it also stops by the hotel. Taxis from Tegel were only around 20 euros.

We booked a twin room at this hotel on the advice of a friend who knows Berlin well. The whole trip was pretty much seamless. Ahead of arrival, I found the concierge very helpful when discussing options for transportation from Tegel Airport (they offered to pick us up, but in the end we got a regular taxi costing about EUR 20 for a 25min journey). Check-in was quick, friendly and painless. The reception area is probably one of the biggest 'draws' for the hotel - in the centre there's a huge cylindrical aquarium containing one million litres (more than a quarter of a million US gallons) of water and a vast array of marine tropical fish. Each morning a couple of divers enter the tank to clean the glass and do maintenance. It's pretty cool - especially because the hotel's elevators are also glass so you get a view of various levels of the aquarium as you rise towards your room. There is a bar running around the base of the aquarium and it's a nice place to sit if you're waiting to meet someone or to have a drink. We had booked a Business-class room - it was nicely furnished, showing no signs of wear & tear, and had plenty of wardrobe hanging & shelving, plus a Nespresso-style coffee machine and good-sized desk. The room overall was not particularly large (just big enough for twin beds, two armchairs, desk etc) but it was certainly good enough for our purposes. The beds were comfortable, although the pillows were very soft indeed. All the linen was nice quality - not shabby or threadbare towels, which can be a disappointment in a nice hotel sometimes. Breakfast was in their HEat restaurant which is a kind of fusion place but the breakfast was very traditional Northern European - cold meats, cheeses, fruit & cereal plus a selection of cooked meats & eggs from the buffet. All very tasty and included in our room rate, which I prefer. Also included in the room was internet access - both wired in the room and WiFi elsewhere. Every hotel should do that! The location is extremely good if you're sightseeing - right on the edge of Museum Island, so literally three minutes walk to the Pergamon, Altes & Neues Museums, five or six minutes to the Deutsches Historisches Museum, ten minutes to the Brandeburg Gate. There are a number of U-bahn stations nearby for longer journeys and there was always a plentiful supply of taxis outside for when we were feeling lazy.

The concierge did not know the way to seemingly one of the most happening night club in town which we later found out was just 2 blocks But I must mention the staff in the night shift is downright rude, the internet in my room was not working, he had the audacity to tell me I should then just come to the lobby and access it and not trouble him.

CONS: -before staying in hotel, ask for a room with a view to the river or the street; the rooms with view to the big hall are rather claustrofobic. -the hotel is very big, with a lot of visitors everyday: finding a table for breakfast can be quite hard sometimes. If it's nice weather, you have to get breakfast outside, beside the river, but again you may queue for a table. -the breakfast is very expensive: it's worth only if you eat a lot and skip the lunch; there are two places where to get breakfast: the one in the hall of hotel has got less food than the one in the restaurant area. There are many cafes close to the hotel. -the swimming pool is very small and the water is rather cold, it's meant to be used only after the sauna, I guess, not just to hang around in the swimming pool. -the all wellness area is fine, but small: the gym is brand new but small, in the afternoon you may find all the tools busy. PROS: -I never liked aquarium, but this one is wonderful, I must admit. -breakfast in restaurant area is very good and rich -sauna, steam bath and gym are very clean. -All the employees are very kind and nice; the hotel is beautiful, clean and verything works perfectly.

This was my wife and I's first visit to the city and really enjoyed it. We picked the hotel based on a friends recommendation, and weren't disappointed. The hotel is located in an area which is very close to the Brandenburg Gate, Check Point Charlie, both about a easy 30 min walk away, and opposite the Cathedral and TV tower. The hotel is very modern, and the rooms reflect this, with white walls, and almost sparten furniture, but they are spotlessly clean (as you'd expect in Germany) and have large well appointed bathrooms. Our room had a mini bar, hair dryer, TV and all the mod cons you'd expect of a 5 star chain hotel. To be honest, its not the kind of 5 star hotel we've stayed in on previous holidays, but for the money, its fantastic. We were offered a room overlooking the aquarium on the atrium or a outside view. We choose the later, and had a room on the top floor with a side view of the river and the cathedral. The room had a very small balcony, but I noticed that rooms on lower floors, 2 - 5 had larger balconys with tables and a chairs. We had dinner in \"Heat\" which is part of the hotel on the first night, food was good, but expensive when compared to the other meal we had in berlin, including Saturday night dinner at \"Bocca di Bacco\" the michelin starred restaurant on friedriche Strassa. One top tip is to take a open top tour bus. This is something I never usually do, but on arrival we had a few ours to kill until our hotel room was ready, and it was great. 2 Hour tour from the Brandenburg Gate was only 10 euro each, and it gave us a really opportunity to see a large amount of the city, we'd never have discovered on foot, also it gives you a real perspective on the size of the city.

My parter had ordered a birthday cake which was delivered to the room as soon as we arrived (and was gone within a matter of minutes! :) ). The room was great! Two walls of floor to celing windows with amazing views of the TV tower and the square opposite. Breakfast was included and consisted of everything you could want. Noone would leave hungry! We ate dinner in the restaurant one night. Food was of a very good standard and I was suprised how reasonable the prices were (that goes for the whole of Berlin!). The hotel is in a great location, right by so many of Berlins great attractions including Museum Island, TV Tower and the Cathedral; with fantastic shops and restaurants literally a few steps away. One tip, there is a Thai Restaurant on the right hand side of the hotel (under the glass covered side street). The food is fantastic and very reasonable! The main drawing point for most will be the large aquarium! it's spectacular and we spent one night drinking in the bar area watching it for hours.

The big fish tank is cool, but not enough in itself to stay at the hotel. The real advantage is that the hotel is a three minute walk to the Alexanderplatz. Out the front door and 100 meters to the left are the 100 Bus which takes you directly to the Reichstag and the Brandenburg Gate, and the TXL bus, which gets you directly to the Berlin Tegel Airport in 35 mintues. The hotel is modern and clean. The staff are very professional and helpful. The breakfast buffet is awesome - especially if you like to chow down. They have seven types or rolls and bread, seven types of honey and jelly, seven types of meat, fish and sausages, Seven types of cheeses. Many types of fresh fruit, yoghurt, cereal, fresh cooked omelettes, etc. As an American, I would give the breakfast buffet a 93. It loses two points because they don't have blueberry pancakes or waffles. Hey, when in Rome....! But if you leave breakfast hungry, it's definately your own fault! Enjoy Berlin! One last secret tip, for dinner, go out the front door, turn right, and then right again. Walk along the Spree river til you come to a raised train bridge. There are several cozy alternative restaurants to your left, but if you walk a little farther to your right, you will find a very romantic courtyard - free from cars, filled with all kinds of pubs and tastey restaurants.

My colleague and I were offered rooms facing inside the hotel as we were so awed by the aquarium. Food at the HeAT restaurant was also top quality, and you couldn't wish for more choice at breakfast. For a hotel with so many rooms, there was still plenty of space in the restaurant. As a bonus, it works well for tourists too - at the end of the conference, we were dropped off at the Brandenburg Gate and it's a 15 minute gentle walk east to the hotel - perfect. Finally, in the evening, the bar, which stretches around the base of the concrete columns supporting the tank, is the perfect place to watch the fish swim in darkness. A great hotel.", "Date": "April 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow", "Title": "\u201cModern\u201d", "Author": "Conluceo", "ReviewID": "UR59484455", "Content": "We recently spent 4 nights in this hotel. When we arrived we were greeted by the friendly doorman who ushered us to reception. As soon as you walk into the lobby you notice the giant aquarium towering above, which is a tourist attraction in its own right. This is a really nice hotel, with excellent decor all round \u2013 very comfortable. Room: Our room was modern and minimalist with a flat screen TV, mini-bar, comfortable bed and small balcony. The room overlooked the aquarium and bar area. Despite this there were no problems with noise drifting up from down below. I agree with another reviewer who said that the room sometimes had the slight odour of poor drainage. In addition there was no ironing board and iron \u2013 which was inconvenient. Location: The hotel is in a great location, adjacent to Museum Island and less than 10 mins walk from Alexanderplatz (train station), Hackescher Markt (where you\u2019ll find bars and restaurants) and Nikolaiviertel (the historical centre of the city). Food: We stayed on a room-only basis and never stretched to the rather exorbitant \u20ac25 per head breakfast. This was not a problem as there are plenty of coffee shops and cafes in the surrounding area. We recommend a visit to Alex Caf\u00e9, below the TV Tower, where you can enjoy a buffet breakfast for \u20ac7. We ate in the hotel\u2019s restaurant \u201cHEat\u201d, which is described as \u201cmodern international\u201d. The tapas starter for two was excellent and included; Thai coconut soup, scallops and the ubiquitous currywurst. The mains were good but my choice didn\u2019t quite meet expectations. However the dessert was excellent with probably the best cr\u00e8me brulee I\u2019ve tasted. Add to this, nice wine, great beer (especially weissbier) and you have a good package. We also visited Reinhardt\u2019s (10 mins walk from the hotel) and enjoyed good food in old-fashioned wood panelled surroundings. Bar: The hotel bar is something of a thoroughfare and not very cozy. There was a decent selection of bar snacks/teas/coffees \u2013 all served by attentive staff. The range of beers on offer was somewhat limited but what they had was good. Splash Leisure: The leisure facilities included; gym, treatment rooms, sauna, steam room, pool and great showers. The pool is best described as a \u201cplunge pool\u201d and is barely enough for one swimmer. As with the rest of the hotel the staff were friendly and helpful.

There was no trouser press as promised and the iron that was brought up to the room was in a very poor state. No tea / coffee facilities in the room.

As we are both travel agents, we got a fantastic deal on the rate, which swung it for us - as I do think the hotel's rack rates can be very expensive, but this is due to the hotel rating. Flew into Tegel (TXL), and caught the TXL bus to the stop before Alexanderplatz. This is located just across the street from the hotel, and a single-use ticket from the airport to the hotel costs just EUR2.10. The bus takes about 35 minutes, so is the best bet for a cheap transfer. The hotel itself is beautifully done, nice little touches like crudites with your cocktail in the bar, and a hairdryer in the room that can be plugged into various sockets instead of being wired into a drawer. The lobby and indeed the hotel is dominated by the Aquadom, however I won't talk about this as nearly all reviews of this hotel talk about it. The Sealife Centre is not especially big, but is a nice place to visit should you have a couple of hours spare. And obviously, you get to go up the Aquadom as part of your visit, which is quite interesting. We didn't eat (the expensive) breakfast in the hotel, but opted to go to the American Diner which is joined onto the right side of the hotel one morning, near the Aquadom entrance. This is a lot cheaper and you get really big servings. Had a massage in the health spa in the basement area of the hotel - this was a lovely way to relax after walking round the tourist sights of Berlin, and at EUR40.00 for a 30 minute back, shoulder and neck massage I feel this is a very fair price. Especially for a hotel spa, which tend to be more pricey. The sauna and pool facilities were very well kept and quiet, with the pool offering a current-resistor for those wanting some gentle exercise whilst relaxing. The staff are all very welcoming and knowledgable, and you can purchase U-Bahn/S-Bahn and bus tickets from the Concierge Desk. They will gladly help you organise the best way to travel round Berlin, and helped me and my friend plan the best route round the main attractions. With their help, we managed to see the Brandenburg, Checkpoint Charlie, the Reichstag and the Fernsehturm (which is actually just up the road), all in an afternoon with minimum travelling! The rooms are decorated in a fresh, modern way, with bright clean bathrooms and flat-screen TVs. Albeit the only English-speaking channels are Bloomberg and BBC World News, but you don't go on a trip to watch TV all day, do you? The door on our bathroom was a two-way door, which can either shut off the whole bathroom or shut off the toilet part only. Which is useful if you both need to \"use\" the bathroom. Also, the mirrors in our toilet part were positioned so you could see the whole of your head - not really a major point, but thought I would mention it to all us girls who like to be able to see what hair we are straightening! If you do fancy a nice breakfast, I recommend going to the Fernsehturm (TV Tower) early in the morning, and paying the EUR10.50 to go up it and the additional EUR10-20 for breakfast in the revolving restaurant. It is pretty much the same cost as eating at the hotel, but is a fantastic experience and it was lovely to watch the morning unfurl over Berlin as we ate our scrambled eggs and smoked salmon.

However, apart from some few square meters less, the room was almost the same (we had the chance to compare it with another couple's room). Room - cozy and well equipped. The only two things which are missing (if you are use to them) are a 'visible' clock and a coffeepot. All the rest is fine and nicely arranged: flat TV set, frigobar, hairdryer, etc. The bathroom is roomy, featuring both the tub and the shower and a very modern washbasin. A small suite of bath products are daily provided. For a modest extra charge, you can have a \"Business\" room, which is featuring also some 'add-ons' like slippers, bathrobe, newspapers, etc. Hall - the Radisson Blu is a magnificent building, with a very luxury hall in the middle of which stands a fantastic acquarium which is enjoyable almost for free for the hotel guests. The atmosphere is persuasive and quiet. You can sit on a sofa, have a drink and relax with you travel mates watching the tropical fishes going back and forth and in the blu water behind the glass. Breakfast - sumptuous. No other words can better describe it. Wellness center - most of the facilities, such as swimming pool, exercise room and sauna are for free while for some other services like the solarium or the massage you need to face a quite expensive 'menu'. Location - right beside the Berlin cathedral and few steps away from the museums area, this hotel proved to be very conveniently located for all the itineraries we had in our mind. Within 2-3 minutes walking we could reach: the TV tower, Alexander Platz, the Hackescher mkt area, the S-bahn public transport station; with few more minutes (less then 10) you can reach Friederich Strasse and see the Brandenburg Tor and the Reichstag.

The receptionists were very professional yet warm, accommodating and helpful. The standard check in time is 1500H but I arrived much earlier than that but, the receptionist warmly offered me a room that was ready. Aside from that, they were also very patient waiting for me because I scramble looking for my confirmation number since I lost it through my numerous unsorted files in my iphone and I didn\u2019t have any print out for my reservation. By the time I found my reservation number I was given the standard plastic key which serves as a way to use the elevator and confirmation for entrance to the breakfast in their restaurant. The room that I reserved was a standard, non smoking with 1 queen size bed was pretty decent and clean. It offers a spectacular view outside the main street although; it is also possible to request to have the aquarium or the Berliner Dom as your view. The room also has a safety deposit box, a mini bar, enough storage and closets plus a pressing machine and you can also call their service to give you an ironing board and iron should you need one. The water closet was modern and elegant with shower in a bath tub, a hair dryer and other usual hotel complimentary. There was also a cable TV with enough local and international programs. With regards to the internet connection, the room offers both wireless and wired connection. The connection was very strong although the initial set up for wireless took a bit longer but once I was log in using my room number then everything was good and working properly. For the breakfast buffet, it was located in their restaurant \u2013 Heat. I didn\u2019t regretted that I chose the option to include a breakfast on my reservation because the hotel choices of food and morning drinks were excellent. By the time I settled myself to a table, a waiter would happily ask to serve me a coffee and leave the rest of the coffee thermos on my table. The buffet offers a wide array of breakfast food from different kinds of bread, pastries, meat, sausages, cereals, yoghurt, some fruit, marmalade, cheese and there is a waiting chef who would cook your type of egg. As for the drinks, they offer different kinds of freshly squeezed juice, tea, and even different kinds of water. Moreover, the restaurant was decent, filled with energetic staff and the arrangement is well organized. As for their amenities, they have a rather small swimming pool which, as I have tried, can accommodate at least 2 small-sized adults swimming simultaneously. The fitness room was equipped with enough exercise machines. They have enough steam and sauna room which was fantastic. Some foot bathtubs and automatic showers. Their changing rooms had enough lockers and amenities like body shampoo, lotion, a hair dryer and you can also request to the nearest reception for a nail file, ear buds, etc. With regards to their massage service, which I had booked, the feeling of satisfaction after the 30 minutes back massage wasn\u2019t long lasting. The moment I stepped out from the door, I didn\u2019t feel relieved. I think it has something to do with the masseuse who was tired. On the negative side, there are only few that I can mention. One of that was, the climate control ventilation in my room was utterly noisy. It seems like I was sleeping in the engine room of a boat. Aside from that, by the time I checked out, I was wrongly billed from their bar which apparently belongs to someone else as the signature shows.

When we first arrived before we could shut the taxi door the porter was there to collect our bags and welcome us, the reception is absolutely stunning with the aquarium tank - my little boy was delighted (even had to come down at night to see them after he had his pj's on to see if they were in bed too - their lights go out at night to give them peace). The height of the hotel when you are in reception is amazing - it is really stunning. The staff were so friendly and helpful - I sadly lost my camera on the third day and they did their utmost to help, when we returned on our last day one of the reception staff had even phoned local taxi companies to see if it had been found. We didn't try the restaurant / bar / spar / pool so cannot comment on them. The lifts are glass so a wonderful view as you go up and see the fish. We went business class (got a great deal from Expedia) - the room was of moderate size and was of very modern design. It was spotless. The view from the room was breaktaking of the Berlin Dom (feel's like it is within arms reach it was so close) and had a small balcony with table and two chairs outside, and the river outside with all the christmas lights glistening in the trees. We had a lovely walk along the river (We were lucky enough to have snow as well :0) We also took a boat cruise along the river which was fab (the guy who did the commentary only did it in German though but it might be different in the summer months when busier) - it lasted about an hour and they served hot wine etc on board. The price for this was 9 euro each (not including drinks etc) and free for our son. This was right outside the hotel. There were all sorts of goodies, delicious smelling body lotion, shampoo and bath gel, slippers and fluffy robes in the room (part of business class rate again). We apparently had some sort of ipod access but we didn't use that. The soundproofing was fantastic - you don't hear a single thing outside the hotel room. Lovely little chocolate each by the bed and big bottle of water to welcome you (also more chocolate the day after). A coffee making machine was also in the room which made a lovely cup of coffee and we also had a free newspaper delivered as part of the business class room. The hotel was about a 30 min taxi ride from schonfeld airport which cost around 40 euro. We also took a taxi to the zoo which was about 15 mins away and about 15 euro. This hotel however is apparently very close to the Alexanderplatz station but we chose taxi for ease with little son and buggy etc etc. We also went to the Seaworld which is just around the corner - it was like 47 euros for all three of us and all our son wanted to do was rush through so that wasn't really worth it - but if he had been older I think he would have loved it (I would have too if we could have stayed for more than 3 second in each room :0) - it was really well done. Also as part of the package you could go up the lift in the Blu Raddison Hotel inside the fish tank - we didn't end up doing that. If you do go to Seaworld the way out is when you get to all the mirrors - we couldn't work it out and went back on ourselves!! We went to the zoo the next day and it was only 24 euros nearly half the price. Berlin Zoo is fantastic - if you are young or old, family or just a couple I would recommend it . My favourite bit is the hippos as you can see them under the water when they swim past you - it was brilliant. Also near the Zoo is the kurfurstendam area which is fabulous with the Ka De We shop which is out of this world (especially at Christmas time). The only thing that I found on the downside about the trip was the bed, it was twin beds pushed together and they kept separating in the middle - everything else was just perfect . We had breakfast as part of the business class package and it was exceptional. Also we tended to sit on the far left as you go into the heat restaurant and a certain lady seemed to serve us each day (I guess it was her area) and she was simply fabulous, nothing was too much trouble. My little boy had his own cutlery with him and had finished his yoghurt. Two minutes later she appeared with the spoon all washed and dried on a serviette - I didn't even see her take it - it was a top service.

Really interesting guide called Jacob who really made the tour and gave us extra time. The small group tour (only us) was also great and took us everywhere. It was 35e each and well worth it. The museums are fascinating and all well worth a visit especially the Technology museum. Be careful state ones are closed on Mondays. We were there just in time for the Christmas markets - wonderful atmosphere with the ice skating and funfair and music. Found finding good restaurants a problem as we had so little time but we had terrific steaks at the Bloc House which is a chain and there are several in Berlin. We found a really good restaurant for our birthdays in Nickolas Plaz near the 2 spired church in the reconstructed oldest part of the city. Wonderful area with winding streets.

The hotel lobby (apart from the aquarium) was tiny and distinctly average.

The lobby with the aquarium, is neat, but to really watch the fish you must pay and enter through sea world. We had a room facing the courtyard (view rooms more expensive) which we found very pleasant and comfortable.

To explain my \"Average\" rating, let me say that I am comparing it to other hotels of the same class. The hotel is very nice overall but about average for a 4-5 star hotel. We stayed in a \"business class\" room which gave us a view of the river and cathedral. I was expecting panoramic views but the cathedral is so close and tall that it was all we could see from our windows (we were on the 5th of 6 floors). Another reviewer is correct in that, although these rooms have a bit of a balcony, you are prohibited from opening the doors onto it -- consequently you have no access to fresh air. The room was large enough but not what I would call spacious. The rooms which are not \"business class\" are smaller and I suspect they would be cramped for a week's stay but probably ok for two or three nights. Other reviewers gave high marks to the hotel's Noodles Restaurant and Aqua Lounge. Both are now defunct which means that the hotel has a lobby bar and one restaurant--\"Heat.\" The front desk staff explained that they planned to try \"something new\" but gave no indication when that would be. Most hotels of this class have a choice of bars and restaurants. The lobby bar is not inviting in my opinion--too open, too few comfortable seats, too much noise and foot traffic. The breakfast buffet was plentiful with a good selection of items, but absolutely identical every morning. Since we stayed for a week, I grew a little tired of seeing the same things waiting for me every morning. However, the presentation was quite nice, it never seemed overly crowded (probably because the price kept many away), and it was replenished frequently. The service was fast and friendly enough. The front desk staff was pleasant but we found one of the concierges to be rather surly and tried to avoid him after our first encounter. Having to wait for someone more courteous to come on duty is not acceptable. The maid service was okay but on two days the dirty coffee cups were not removed but strangely placed behind the TV. Newspaper delivery was spotty. The porters and doormen were the best I've encountered in a long time. Bottom line--we got a fairly good rate from American Airlines and the hotel was worth what we paid. However, it is not worth the rack rate in my opinion. If you can get a deal, go for it. Otherwise, keep looking. P.S. Sights in Berlin seem to close without warning.

For my job, I have been fortunate to stay in a lot of supposed '5 star' hotels, and the Raddison surpassed all of them. We got out the taxi and were immediately greeted by the concierge who took our luggage inside. We checked in effortlessly and another staff member took us up to our room and explained how to use the air-con and asked if we had any questions. Our room was immaculate, the beds were very comfy, the shower was very powerful and there was a seperate area for the toilet, so someone could use the toilet and someone else could still use the bathroom. The fish tank was amazing and our room looked out onto it. The breakfast buffet was superb, the selection of meats, cheese, pastries was excellent and staff were always on hand to top up anything running low, to offer us tea and coffee or to help if they could. The location was amazing, we walked to the various Museums within 10 minutes, there are amazing restaraunts nearby (I would thoroughly reccomend Emmas Bar and Grill - friendly staff, good price and it's like German Tapas - come out of the hotel, turn left, left again through the shops and it's at the end of the covered section). The Tour buses even have the Raddison as a tourist attraction, so if you want to go on a tour bus, take about 10 steps outside the hotel and get on a bus! We spent a lot of time in the bar, and the young bloke who served us on about 10 occasions was so polite and friendly - his English (and the English of all the staff) was exceptional - I ordered a pot of tea, and got proper tea leaves, a tea timer and about 3 different sugars! It was touches like these that made the Raddison such a lovely hotel. It was very quiet at night time, the sound proofing was superb and I thought the rooms were a good size - the mini bar WAS expensive, but sod it... it was nice to have one, and if you're on holiday, why not use it once or twice? We didn't eat in the hotel either night, but on the second night, went to a small restaraunt called 'Solinos' which was brilliant. It's across the park, straight in front of the hotel, and down a small street to the left of the park... All the restaraunts across the park looked amazing - very authentic and very busy. As for the wif-fi, yes.. I did have problems - so I plugged my netbook into the wall instead and that solved the problem. The wi-fi kept dropping every 5 mins, so I would suggest using the cable and you should be fine. It's not the cheapest hotel going, but if you're going to splash out - make sure it's worth it.

The best thing about the Business class rooms is that breakfast is included, and this is a really excellent buffet, with hot and cold food and items made to order if required. The soundproofing between rooms is superb, when we were there, the hotel must have been close to full, but we never heard any noise from any rooms, or indeed from outside.

The experience in Radissons was very good, and I will return without any hesitation. The aquarium in the hall is spectacular, the hotel lobby , bar and restaurants have a beautiful design, rooms are comfortable, you feel you are in a 5 star. Anyway I noticed that everything works better if you do not have to ask something to the personnel of reception, young people and maybe not so expert. Statistically, the first time they seem to not understand . Then, if you try a second time, maybe . Ok, my English is not really the best, but it's not the worst in the world, and I speak a fluent French that gives me a second chance ... I made a reservation through the hotel website, 2 business rooms (a double room + a single room with king -size bed, smoking). Few days before our arrival I sent an email to the Radissons to reconfirm our booking, and I had an e- mail from the hotel that everything was ok. At check-in the receptionist told us that they didn't have any business with king-size bed as we asked at the moment of the booking. We asked for any category of room with a king-size, and they gave us a VERY dark, standard room, view over the opposite ( and very close) building. The receptionist idea of king-size: 2 twin beds together ( not very comfy) with 2 single blankets... The other room ( business) was really great: wonderful view over the Cathedral and Museum Island, small balcony, wi-fi, LCD TV with sat. channels, coffee/tea maker, large bathroom with everything you can need ( very good quality of courtesy products), bathrobes and all what you expect from a 5 stars hotel, and maybe something more. Complimentary water at arrival, beds very confortable, room very clean, no noise at all, relax relax relax !!! I could live there for a couple of years.. Some problems with the room key : you can take lifts only with your key, but you are allowed to go ONLY TO YOUR FLOOR. If you have a friend in a different floor , then you have a problem (do not ask to reception) Breakfast was absolutely perfect (I thing the best I've never had..) , with a wide selection of EVERYTHING , and very good service. Breakfast is served in the Heat restaurant, at the ground floor, and you can have a beautiful view over the river. We tried the Noodle restaurant, which was quite good , with a sort of German approach to Thai food, and it has a good service. The hotel has a small SPA, who offers different possibilities for body/face treatment, at interesting prices. Also in that case we had some problems of communication. We were a group of 3 women, and we had only a short time available in the evening. For that reason, before making the reservation in the SPA, we asked expressly if the 3 treatments could be done at the same time. We thought that in a hotel with some hundreds of rooms there was more than one person doing massage. When we arrived in the evening, the \"spa-receptionist\" was changed : he told us that what we asked was not possible at all, with the attitude of someone thinking you are a group of idiots. Business rooms have a wi-fi free internet access . We hadn't our laptop with us ( holidays..), and we would have liked to use the internet point . The first day we asked to the receptionist where to find it: he sent us to a different floor of the hotel, without anything similar to a computer. The second day we tried with a different receptionist, who told us that the internet point was few metres far, at the reception floor. Use of internet costs Eur 0,35/ min ( i.e. 21 Eur/hour), so I would suggest you to take with you your laptop or a Blackberry . A small problem at check-out ( chapter \"Reception : the revenge\"): they charged us for the standard-single occupancy the price for double occupancy.

I stayed there for a weekend in August, city was full of tourists yet this hotel offered much better deals than other hotels of similar class. It is located right next to the \"museum island\" close to the opera and unter der linden street. It is within 15-20 min walking distance from the Brandenburg Gate. Reading this review you probably already know that it has this huge aquarium right above the lobby and high up to the roof which could be seen from many of the rooms. It is quite fascinating and definitely a great idea! Rooms are clean and modern with some nice amenities. Try the pool which although small allows you to relax after a busy day. Breakfast although really good is expensive and I myself preferred to explore some nearby local eateries to get some good food to start off the day. In fact there are quite a few interesting places close to the hotel which are not always full with tourists. Try especially Barcomi's Deli at Sophienstrasse which is definitely one of the best places to get a good bagel in Berlin! Also, check pubs, restaurants and clubs at the Hackescher Markt. Both places are 5 minutes walking distance from the hotel. Those are places for young, easy-going people who look to have fun in Berlin. I also had a dinner in one of the city's fancy restaurants - Bocca di bacco, and it is really a fine place (very romantic with great ambience) which I have reviewed in a separate review. In short, Radisson SAS Berlin is a top class hotel, with nice, modern design, good facilities and friendly staff, located in the center of a great city. I cannot really write anything bad about it.

It was just around the corner from a major shopping centre and within walking distance to museums, monuments and sites of interest!Hotel looks great on the outside, and the reception area with its giant indoor aquarium is amazing but thats where it stops. Our party had booked two twin rooms with adjoining doors but when we arrived at 12.30, we were told we had to wait till 3pm as the adjoining rooms were not available. We waited till 3pm but then were promptly told that the rooms were still not ready so we must wait till 5pm. As we were so tired we decided to just take two rooms on the same floor instead but were disappointed as this was not what we booked. We were then given the keys by the receptionist and made to find the rooms by ourselves. We were not told anything about the facilities in the hotel or even told when and where breakfast was served. Then when we got to the rooms the 'twin rooms' consisted of two single beds pushed together to form a double. They were not even separated for our arrival; when we did pull them apart the headboard did not extend long enough and so we barely got them a foot apart. Every morning the cleaning lady would then push the beds together again despite our obvious wishes to keep them apart. The rooms were more 3/4 star standard than 5. They were very small and there were no robes or slippers, no bottled water, turn down services or even biscuits with the tea and coffee. All these you would expect in a 5 star hotel, especially as we had paid 5 star rates. Downstairs, the restaurants and bars were overpriced by cheaper Berlin standards. The Thai restaurant was lovely but the Heat restaurant was a bit of a disaster. I ordered Monkfish and got three tiny separate pieces of rather mangy looking fish, no bigger than three chunks of scampi; it was fatty, veiny and poorly cooked, I couldn't even eat two bites of it. Very disappointing for a five star restaurant. The spa area was however lovely and I got a great massage for \u20ac40!

Although the reception and bar area is below your window you cannot hear a single sound as the very thick, floor to ceiling glass balcony doors are soundproofed.

Be warned \u2013 the sauna and steam room does not permit swim wear i.e. it\u2019s nude (and mixed) with a towel for modesty if you prefer. My only 2 complaints are:- 1. Whilst the aquarium is positioned in the hotel lobby/bar area it is not actually part of the hotel but belongs to the Aqua Dom next door. Thus in order to take a ride in the elevator up through the middle of the huge cylindrical aquarium you must pay an entrance fee to the Aqua Dom which is expensive. Sadly the hotel advertisements give the impression the aquarium is part of the hotel, however you can still enjoy stunning views of the aquarium. 2. The pillows are awful, too soft.

It really is spectacular and makes this the most unique hotel foyer and bar area I think I have ever been in. It\u2019s particularly funny to watch the aqua dome visitors going up and down in the lift inside the tank, you wonder if they are watching the fish or if the fish are watching them. I had booked via the hotel web site as this offered me the best deal. It was the Easter weekend and I noticed that the rates went up steadily for the same rooms so I would book early if possible. The choice of queen rooms was restricted, most of this size of room seems to be in a twin configuration, or they are smoking rooms. I phoned the hotel and they arranged for us to have a non-smoking queen room, even though the web site said there were non available, they reconfigured a twin room and were very helpful. If possible try to get a room with a view of the aquarium or one with a view of the cathedral, our room looked out onto Alexander platz which is fine just not as unusual. The room was smaller than other hotel rooms we have had in Berlin but the storage space was adequate and the bathrooms were clean, modern and bright. The staff were all very helpful, we ate in the bar and in the Aqua lounge, one thing is the choice of food in these two areas is the same and very restricted for vegetarians, but the main restaurants seem to have a very extensive menu. The location is very good for Mitte, river trips, Unter den linden and the museum island. The gym facilities are good, with a small but nice swimming pool, three different types of sauna or steam room and a good range of spa treatments. A note for anyone of a shy disposition, as in many places in Europe, the sauna and steam room areas are not gender specific and they encourage you not to wear your bathing suits.

The chocolate shops that surround the hotel on either side should not be missed, especially the hot chocolate. Steer clear of the restaurant Borchadt, which despite being recommended to us by friends, and despite having a German relative make the reservation for us in advance, had a rude manager, terrible service and mediocre food despite the high price with the US exchange rate.

The hotel is very centrally situated and has a wow factor in the reception atrium with its awe-inspiring aquadrome. This is normally a pay-to-see commercial attraction separate from the hotel, and it has the unfortunate disadvantage of constantly crowding the lobby with passing pedestrians having a free look from the hotel side. Our room was adequate if a little small but was clean and well presented. Our stay entitled us to a bottle of champagne on arrival in the room, but this turned out to be a bottle of German sekt when it arrived. It took a telephone call from us to the manager before room service would replace it with the genuine article. Dinner on the first night in the restaurant H-eat was less than expected. The food was disappointing in presentation and flavour and our main dishes achieved an unusual condition in that they were both over-cooked and cold. Our disapointment was compounded with the arrival of the bill \u20ac146 for just 2 courses and wine. Indeed one of the most consistent things with this hotel is its high prices for less than perfect drinks, food and service. Drink prices in the reception bar were high by comparrison with other 5 star Berlin hotels with which we are familiar. Breakfast had to be queued for and it is not ideal to be given the option of breakfast in the reception atrium while being gawped at by tourists along with the fish! One very unpleasant experience in both the restaurant and the lobby bar area was the mass of fruit flies that became a constant and annoying nuisance. Perhaps the hotel will try to remove the nuisance at some stage - certainly staff seemed not to care. The main issue with the hotel is it's 5 star status. I would question any establishment who uses this label while not providing basic 5 star amenities in rooms. No bathrobes or slippers, no mineral water, no CD player, one towel per guest per day, no turn-down service, and poor quality toiletries and absence of simple items such as cotton buds, nail files and hair conditioner. Needless to say, all higher-price rooms offer these but as the place isn't cheap to begin with and it claims to be 5 star why the difference between this and other 5 star operations in Berlin?

Originally had two rooms facing outside as the ones facing the tank are not interconnecting. We were so taken with the Aquarium we asked to move so we could have Aquarium views and the hotel happily moved us to two rooms next door to each other. Good move. It was very peaceful watching the fish and we enjoyed watching the divers feed the fish and clean the tank each morning from about 8am. Hotel lovely spotless. Breakfast superb lots of choice. Good location for sightseeing. We enjoyed a trip on the river spree. If you fancy this option use the boat next to the hotel breakfast room. It was in english and very interesting. We also went on the bus tour which was good to see all the sights but the commentary was disjointed and dull. We visited the Legoland Discovery centre which is an indoor venue. It was good better for under 10's though. We liked eating outside at restaurants with heaters the other side of Hakkechermarkt oppsite to the Hagen Das. The food was nice. We also got reservations to eat at the tv tower's revolving restaurant via the concierge it's busy so worth asking a few days before. The night we went it was foggy but we still went . The Kids loved the fact the restauant revolved. The food was very basic. We were still eating the starters and the main courses arrived ! Without the fog the view would be great. We went on the Berlin Hi-Flyer (\"Welt-Balloon) one of the biggest helium balloons in the world. You silently ascend above the roofs of the capital to an altitude of 450 feet . The balloon is restrained by a cable attached to the ground. An electric motor pulls you back on the ground . The whole trip took about 20 mins and the view was great.

Anyway the hotel, having not been to Berlin before, I hadn't a clue what or where we were staying. Went on the reviews from this site as always, so here goes, Bad points - None, as in none at all. Good points - Staff - superb. Polite, helpful, etc etc. Spot on. Food - The Noodle Bar - Excellent. Didnt try the other, Heat or the bar so cannot comment. Also didn't try the breakfast. Bars - The bar in the atrium is brilliant especially with that aquarium above you! The Aqua Bar downstairs near the Noodle Bar is superb and very Chique. Cocktails are top notch , but they are E10 each on average, Long Island Iced Tea or the Mai Tai or for pure alcohol the St Pauli Killer. Gym - Brilliant. Went in three times, had it all to ourselves. Treadmills, x trainers, weights, bikes etc all in superb condition. Pool - Nice with counter current which is a right laugh till you get used to it. Sauna - Ace, three saunas and like has been said before, they are mixed and you can go in naked, but this explained on all the doors and in the changing rooms. The massage facilities etc looked nice as well but didnt use them. The hotel is within two minutes of the u bahn etc and the TV tower. For a top steak go out of the hotel turn left, and within 100 yards on the left there is a nice restaurant called Block House. Opposite the hotel to the left across the park is a bowling alley, once again this is a nice place not some seedy joint.

It lies on the river at the end of the main tjhoroughfare Unten Den Linden.

For good eating and drinking turn head for the otherside of Hakkechermarkt and the miriad of restaurants and bars serving the student area. Oranienburgerstrasse is the main bar street and try the bar Assel. The food is good and the bar atmospheric. Further up Oranienburgerstrasse is a restaurant called simply the Oranien. The food there is especially good - try the Goulashsuppe - to die for. Alternatively walk across the park opposite the hotel to the \"Nikolaiviertal\" area and tucked away next to the old Chuch behind the first street you will find a superb pub called the Zum Nussbaum.

I had never considered staying there (I have had to stay in hotels in between long-term apartments) until I read the reviews here and found a great rate. Wow! What a gem, especially for tourists. I stayed ina Business Class room for 159 EUR. The upgrade from 119 got me free internet access, free pay movies, bathrobe and slippers, free newspaper, prime Dom view, Nespresso maker, and an iron and pants press. You'd have to make the call yourself. At the lower rate, in particular, the hotel represents outstanding value. Non-suite rooms are 27 sq m (standard and business are the same) and don't feel crowded at all, thanks to very clever room design. The shower is a bath/shower combination. If you need a walk in, you might want to double check. Had dinner at hEat, described as Fusion. I stuck to the Indian submenu, which was high-quality, but underspiced (i.e., mainstream), with a limited menu. Great service, though, and reasonable prices. The lobby is dominated by the huge aquarium rising through the center, which (as long as you never consider what might happen if it breaks) is a fun change from the norm. It does bring a lot of tourists off the street who just want a peek, rather than paying admission around the corner to ride up the center of the aquarium in a slow lift. Those crowds, however, are fully blocked off from the lobby, so noise is kept down. It is, however, a large hotel, so don't expect boutique charm and great people watching in the lobby. For a tourist, the location is outstanding. You are across the river from Museum Insel, and on the road that becomes Unter den Linden. (Tip: The 100 and 200 buses, which run across the city and provide a penny-pinching alternative to a city tour bus, stop right out front. If you want a quick shuttle along Unter den Linden -- stay, two stops to get to Friedrichstrasse -- ask for a \"kurzstrecke\" ticket from the bus driver. At 1.10 or 1.20 EUR, it's half the price of a normal AB ticket and lets you go six bus stops in one direction. Nice trick if you're feet are starting to give out). The hotel is also directly across from the Fernsehrturm (TV Tower) at Alexanderplatz, and an easy walk to Hackeschermarkt and the hipper areas of Mitte. In the other direction, Gendamenmarkt is also an easy walk. There are several good, upscale restaurants here including what I think is the original Lutter & Wegner and a very nice Italian restaurant Buca di Beppo.

The lobby opens up in to a big aquarium which as has already been said looks a lot more impressive in real life than in the photos and feels only a step away from being a classic James Bond villains HQ. We had a room on the first floor and both my girlfriend and I were worried that it would be noisy as it overlooked the bar/breakfast area, however the room kept out the noise very well and unless you slid open the window you couldn\u2019t hear a thing. The air conditioning in the room and hotel was excellent and helped cool us down after a day out sightseeing, plus the modern styled room had a cooling feel to it as well, this was very much needed after a long day out walking in the sun. The bathroom was nice apart from the mirrored toilet. We didn\u2019t have any issues with the shower/sink. The two single beds had been pushed together into a double and were comfortable. The room also had a free mini guide to Berlin from the hotel which was a nice touch as was the big TV and tea/coffee facilities in the room which were nice first thing in the morning and last thing at night for a little bit of unwinding after a long day of walking. Food wise we didn\u2019t eat at the hotel but there are some small cafes for picking up a cheapish breakfast between the hotel and Alexanderplatz station. There were a few little restaurants tucked in the walkway between the hotel and the adjacent building.

The hotel is well set up for travelling through Berlin, the places you can\u2019t walk to are easily accessible via the u/s-bahn lines that are very clean and frequent (like the new bits of the London tube). On our last day we asked at the hotel if they had any stamps so we could send our post cards, unfortunately they had run out but they did offer to send our post cards as soon as they got some which was a nice gesture.

Our room was compact, however spotlessly clean and very quiet. We never heard a sound from the corridor or the adjacent rooms, ever. The d\u00e9cor in the room is modern and \u2018minimalist\u2019. Very nice. Flatscreen TV was smart, but a bit fuzzy. But we didn\u2019t go to Berlin to watch telly, so it didn\u2019t matter. We had dinner in the Noodle Kitchen. It was delicious and not expensive. We made a reservation and were provided with our own table by the window overlooking the Berliner Dom. The restaurant staff were extremely attentive. The bar staff (especially one) in the bar directly by the Noodle Kitchen were wonderful. The reception staff and concierge are rather snooty, however. We didn\u2019t eat breakfast in the hotel (so overpriced \u2013 there are several delicious bakeries very close by where you can have superb traditional breakfasts for far better value). They\u2019re pretty mean on the toiletries for a \u2018five star\u2019 hotel \u2013 little plastic capsules of fruity flavoured shampoo & shower gels \u2013 yummy \u2013 but why fill the trendy container up with only 6 or 7 when there\u2019s room for 9? Sounds petty, but it really does come across as stingy. Lower star hotels we\u2019ve stayed in also offer razors, toothpaste, combs, etc\u2026 there was nothing like that. Not that we ever really use them, but they\u2019re nice touches and come in handy if needed. The bed was comfy, but our \u2018double bed\u2019 was two singles pushed together \u2013 not very romantic \u2013 my husband found the gap in the middle very annoying. The Radisson is in the former east of the city and is well situated \u2013 U-Bahn, Alex & Hackescher Markt walking distance close by. The Berliner Dom is immediately opposite across the dark & still River Spree. The enormous aquarium is interesting. The fish seem well cared for as there were divers in the tank every morning swimming around maintaining the feature. I requested a platter of fruit and chocolates in our room and it was beautifully presented, and for 15 Euro well worth it. The hotel very kindly also provided a (free) birthday cake for my husband, which was lovely. I think what impressed us most about the Radisson Berlin is that, without asking, we were offered at checkout if we would like our luggage stored until we could come back later to collect our bags before our late flight home. Excellent. On Berlin \u2013 the transport system is incredibly efficient \u2013 and so cheap! Euro 2.10 on the trains \u2013 bargain! The streets are generally clean and we found the Berliners so friendly. Twice while we were in the middle of the street with a big map in our hands, locals spontaneously approached us with offers of help with directions. I tried to speak German in shops and cafes, but everyone just spoke back in English, and they were all full of information and eager to help us enjoy our stay. There were occasionally pockets of drunks around and street con artists on corners \u2013 but it\u2019s a big city \u2013 it\u2019s all part of it. Enjoy! Would we stay at the Radisson again? No. There\u2019s competition from hotels in Berlin offering better value. Can see why this hotel appears to be slipping down the ladder of top hotels in Berlin on Tripadvisor.

When we pointed out in so many words that this was something he ought to have checked out before turning us away and forcing us to make a 15euro call back home, he gave us free tickets to the Aqua land as a compensation. Never got the chance to use them though, preferring to spend our limited time on Berlin's many fascinating museums. Our room was a standard size business room, with a nice view towards a park and the Nikolaikirche. It was extremely well insulated against noise; a very important point since the street in front of the hotel is heavily trafficked at most times. In addition, just a stonethrow away, The Palast der Republik was in the process of being torn down. This was very noisy indeed, but with the window closed we heard practically nothing.

But no problem; there were plenty of opportunities for a very good and inexpensive breakfast within a couple of minutes on foot from the hotel entrance. The bathroom was very stylish in appereance, but at closer look, several design solutions were just very awkward. For one thing, the wash basin was a porcellain bowl placed on a wooden top. Absolutely a feast for the eye when new. But because of the constant spilling of water from handwashing etc, the wood was now cracking up and appearing very worn. Furthermore, the glass half-wall glued to the bathtub was inadequate when showering, with lots of water on the floor as a result. On the other hand, this inflexible halfwall must be a major obstacle for the room ladies when they're cleaning the upper part of the tub. A full-length shower curtain would've been a much better option. And then there was the awkward design of a single swingdoor functioning alternatively for the separate toilet cubicle and the rest of the bathroom. This door wasn't even full-length, so it must be a real problem for American couples with their hang-ups about bodily sounds when on the toilet.

We were not disappointed. This is an ultra modern hotel - just as depicted in the advertisements and pictures elsewhere on trip advisor. The large aquarium in the lobby is the focal point of the hotel and goes some way to warming up the atmosphere of what could be described as an otherwise impersonal but very pleasant and efficient hotel. All staff were friendly, helpful and pleasant, adeptly switching instinctively it seemed, from German to English as required. Our room was not large but commensurate with the room rate and perfectly adequate for our needs during a weekend break. It was comfortable and quiet - we were never aware of outside traffic noise or that of other guests. The room was made up and tea/coffee facilities refreshed very promptly each day. The porter who showed us to our room was particularly helpful providing information about the hotel, location and Berlin's sights and went out of his way to provide us with bathrobes when they weren't included in the room rate. We ate all our meals in the hotel and sampled both 'Heat' and 'Noodle' restaurants - both excellent and not overpriced. Breakfast, although not included in the room rate was very good value and provided something for all tastes and diets (Atkins, GI, Low fat etc....the lot!) including full cooked breakfasts, cereals and nuts/seeds, several types of breads, cheese, smoked fish, yoghurts, fresh fruit and juices and prosecco. Kept us going 'til the evening! The atrium bar was quietly efficient and pleasant for an afternoon pick me up coffee and cake or for an after dinner nightcap. The only reason I haven't given an 'excellent' rating is that the hallways on the floors of the hotel were very bland and impersonal, rather in the style of a UK airport hotel. Other than that, I couldn't fault it. I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to those wanting out and out luxury in every respect, but for everyone else, it's great. Beware though, when the temperature outside is in the minus figures, you are likely to receive electric shocks from everything from the lift button, to the door handle to the cutlery!!

It certainly provides something interesting to look at when in the lobby, the bar (located under the aquarium) or in the lifts. The rooms are clean, airy and very comfortable, with two single beds (pushed together to form a double), individually controlled air conditioning, 23\" flat screen LCD TV, minibar and three telephones (two in the bedroom, one in the bathroom).
