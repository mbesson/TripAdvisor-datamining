{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Hotel Azzi, Hotel Anna, or 1 of 6? Used Venere as their price was less than Hotel quoted. When we arrived the Triple room that had been confirmed by the Hotel was not available so they crammed a Cot into a Double room. This room was small and also had a bathroom whereby the shower spayed the entire bathroom including the toilet paper! We were moved to a larger room at the front of the hotel the next day, a proper triple and other than the increased street noise where well satisfied with it. It was a long hike up the stairs and the room was in a different Hotel sharing the same property. In fact there were about 6 different hotels in the same building!

We loved this hotel. We came by train to Firenze and it was just a short walk from the main train station. We were struck by surprize when we we were handed the keys to our room. I think we were lucky, as we ended up in a big suite with a big batroom where we even had our own jacuzzi...and we paid only 65\u9227?with breakfast. (Booked through venere.com). Lovely tiled bathroom, lovely decorated room with wooden, antique furniture and nice beds. Breakfast was decent, but simple, just what we needed before strolling south to all the marvels of Firenze. The hotels is situated in a nice, quiet street within easy walking distance of all sights. Close to Academia (Michelangelo's David), a 10-minute walk from the Cathedral and maybe 15 minutes from Uffizi. The hotel is an old convent with a nice a terrace and nice lounge-breakfast area.

The ambience included chipped bathroom tiles, questionable sheets, and the squeaky dusty floor. And the funny smell also. All in all, it felt very depressing and weary just to be in the room. If you can cope with that to enjoy a chat with the kind owner, look at the arty objects decorating the lobby, and have a wonderful breakfast in that spacious breakfast room, then it's OK. But I don't believe ambience should come at the expense of cleanliness and coziness.

My son and I stayed at the Azzi for 2 nights in July. Our room was basic (open shower) but spotlessly clean, quiet, air-conditioned, smoke-free. It is part of a building containing several hostels and we were put in a 3-star affiliate in the same building. We ate our breakfasts downstairs, where there is also a charming little bar, and the lobby with a big comfortable couch also has bookshelves crammed with interesting titles.No phones in the rooms, nothing fancy for those who are looking for luxury or a place to loll by a window with a view (a highly recommended activity in general, just not what we were after on this trip!), but we were either out and about in Florence or asleep, so posh would have been wasted on us.The location is close to the train station, so, convenient if not scenic, but we enjoyed our strolls through the central market to the historic center.What made Azzi stand out is that the night manager, Gianni, went out of his way to make sure we could get a good gluten-free dinner, even phoning ahead to the recommended restaurant w/o telling us to make sure we were taken care of! In the mornings, Giulietta, the day manager, not only saw to it that our parbaked gluten-free breads (available in every pharmacy we visited in Italy!) were cooked for the morning's breakfast by the helpful Fatima, but also had one cooked for us to take on the road. The location is close to the train station, so, convenient if not scenic, but we were a lovely stroll through the central market to the historic center. When we left, Giulietta was very concerned that we have gluten-free options at our next stays, and gave me stern instructions on how to secure that result.

Of course the hotel itself was kind of smelly but that is normal for a 2 star in Italy. What was really shocking was my experience with the staff. I had been in contact with Giulietta several times prior to arrival and every contact we had was pleasant so I had no reason to suspect. But the first morning I arrived downstairs to meet Giulietta for the 1st time who, despite all of our pleasant contact, barked at me that we had to pack our things and change rooms immediately. When I asked why, she told me she had a large group of clients she had to accomodate. I was under the impression that WE were ALSO clients and politely explained that since she decided to tell us at the last minute at 8am in the morning just before we had to leave for a very important meeting, it was not possible. She started arguing with me and insisting we had to move. I apologized and told her no, but that I would do my best to be back by 12pm. She demanded my phone number so she could call if we were late. Our meeting ran late and I called her (out of courtesy) to explain I could not be there on time. What happened next was unbelievable. She began screaming in my ear -carrying on and cursing me for not being able to come back. She said she would go and take our things herself and I threatened to call the police. Then she threatened to call the police if I didn't come back. I was at a professional meeting and some of my nearby colleagues could hear her yelling through the phone it was so bad. Never EVER in my life has anyone EVER spoken to me in such a way - let alone an associate at a hotel I was staying at!!! I finally hung up because I could not get a word in through her ranting and raving. I showed up after my meeting and she immediately apologized. But the damage had been done. We kindly said we'd prefer not to stay there another night and left. I have stayed in many hotels in many cities but have NEVER experienced such a horror.
