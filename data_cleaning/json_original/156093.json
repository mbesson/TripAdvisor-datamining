Location is right downtown Vancouver. Entrance to the hotel although having a West Georgia address; in and out access to the hotel is via Howe Street. From the hotel, there is a very short walk to the waterfront promenade where the sea planes come and go. Lots of shopping in the mall attached to the hotel. A few things that are a little over the top in terms of price that most customers may not notice, but I did. A daily rate of $12.95 for the internet? A price of $7.50 for a 1 litre bottle of water in the room? Free wireless would be nice so one doesn't have to go to the business centre. The answer from the staff that the business centre can be used free of charge, is not a good alternative.

Official website checked and no apparent changes. Here's the review: Couldn't ask for a better location, with my office, shops, restaurants/cafes, public transport and most things worth visiting/seeing in downtown Vancouver within walking distance. The first room I stayed in was a corner room (complimentary upgrade): very classy and spacious with tasteful furniture all around, worthy of 4.5 green dots. Given the standard room I paid for the second time around, which was a lot smaller (half the size, maybe? 2.5 green dots) and took a lot of shine off the first stay. What was consistent, thankfully, were those lovely L'Occitane toiletries. Very helpful and polite staff, as one would expect in a hotel of this calibre in North America. Quite baffling though was the fact that they still charged for internet connection, in this day and age. The gym and pool area was arguably the Achilles' heel of the hotel. The gym was equipped with fairly old machines; having the paddling pool right next to it (without any partitions) also meant that I was exercising with children and their parents in their bathing suits on a few occasions. These were somewhat compensated by nice touches such as complimentary fresh apples and iced water (with various sliced fruits) at the reception for the guests. Great value for money and if you don't belong to any hotel loyalty schemes (Four Seasons doesn't run one but many who do have properties nearby), this hotel is hard to beat.

Across the street from the Canada Line, above the mall, and walking distance to Robson Street, Gastown, Canada Place, Stanley Park (a bit longer of a walk). The only day we didn't walk was we took a cab to Granville Island, then a ferry from there to Yaletown, then the Canada Line back to the hotel. Everywhere else we walked. Taxis are abundant in front of the hotel if you need one though. -Rooms were very clean and hotel overall was very peaceful and quiet -Pool/jacuzzi/gym area was on the fourth floor and well maintained. Pretty view of the city and nice to unwind at the end of the day. -Lobby area was nicely decorated with Christmas trees for the holiday season Cons: -view was of a building rooftop even being on the 10th floor -shower/tub combo was VERY small and narrow -initial check in treatment was poor. We were the only ones checking in at the time and no one helped us with our luggage. When asked for help by bellmen outside, they told us to go to registration, where no one helped us there either. We told the lady at the desk upon check in it was our first time at a Four Seasons as usually we stay at the Marriott's when staying at a nicer hotel and we were celebrating my 30th birthday. The only thing she offered was for us to pay 150 more a night for a slightly larger room. We passed. -Staff service overall was mixed. One lady at the concierge desk was very helpful while another acted like we were bothering her. Some bellmen outside were helpful with directions and such while others like with our luggage practically ignored us. Overall, it was a great location and very small, but nice and clean rooms. We stay at all levels of accommodations ranging from budget to JW Marriotts.

Stay away.\u201d", "Author": "koala25", "ReviewID": "UR120755504", "Content": "My husband gets a special rate at Four Seasons in the Middle East and Southeast Asia and I've had positive experiences staying with them...until I decided to spend a long weekend at this property. I thought you could not go wrong with Four Seasons, but this was a rude awakening after staying at Four Seasons in Bangkok, Chang Mai, Sharm-el-Sheikh, Houston, and Amman. Upon arrival I called the reception upon arrival, because I couldn't locate the hotel directory in the room. They said they don't have one. Now I know why! Because there's nothing, I mean nothing at this hotel! Staff: They couldn't care less you're staying there. The people at the front desk are unfriendly and won't go out of their way to help you. Whenever you talk to them, they don't smile and tend to give you Yes/No answers. Room: The furniture is old and the room has a Holiday Inn feel rather than Four Seasons.There's no tea/coffee maker in the room.The tiny cheap hairdryer is pathetic! Is it a toy for Barby? It took me 30 minutes to blow dry my hair and in the end it looked like crap. Spa: There's no SPA! It didn't occur to me to ask at the time of booking if they have a SPA, because all of the other Four Seasons I've ever stayed at have one and I assumed it was standard. Fitness Center: This is not a state-of-the-art fitness facility as some other reviewers describe, but a tiny, damp, and dingy room with very few old and rusty machines. It's right next to the swimming pool and working out was a torture because of the screaming kids in the pool.There was a guy there when I checked in, but he disappeared and never came back, so I had to go to the reception to ask a question that I wanted to ask him. Walking into the locker room I felt like I was in a YMCA in not such a nice part of town.They don't even have a steam room. It's pathetic! Food: On the room service menu they have \"Big Salads\", so I decided to order one. When I order a \"big salad\" I expect to receive a salad that is large enough to be a substitute for a main course.Guess what? I paid about $40 for five uncut romaine leaves, four very thin pieces of tuna, and one half of grilled lemon. What a rip off! I also ordered a cup of coffee and was brought a thermos of coffee.I hate waste of any kind and was infuriated that they charged me for 3 cups of coffee, because that's what they put in the damn thermos. Guess what, most people don't drink a whole thermos of coffee at once, so I basically ended up paying for something I did not need. Breakfast: It was very average. There's no buffet, only a la cart menu. Paid about $45 for an omelet and coffee. I ordered pancakes the next day and the syrup that came with them was very thin and watery (I suspect they dilute it). It wasn't pure maple syrup and we are in Canada, out of all places! Restaurant: I came in around 3:00 p.m. and was presented with a very limited snack menu. The hostess did not walk me to the table, just pointed to it. Then came the waiter! I don't even know how they hired this country bumpkin to serve guests. He was very sloppy and borderline rude. When he brought the check there was no pen inside and he didn't hear me yelling to him to bring a pen as he was walking away. One of the guests gave me a pen. Needless to say, I did not leave a tip. When I was checking out, they asked me how my say was and I told them it was disappointing. They asked me if I wanted to talk to the manager, but I was in a hurry, so I said \"No\". I asked one of the receptionists to take my suitcase downstairs, which she did, but she just put in on the ground and left without saying goodbye. This was plain rude and I'm shocked and disappointed.", "Date": "November 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Canada", "Title": "\u201cExcellent staff, excellent rooms, excellent service!\u201d", "Author": "Ve_Lu_Me", "ReviewID": "UR120662010", "Content": "Please don't get any second ideas by reading negative comments about this hotel.

Did anyone else stay at the Four Seasons in Vancouver October 28-November1? The way my daughters and I were treated and pampered, we thought WE were the only guests.

From the doorman who greeted us and grabbed our luggage, to the front desk who, seconds later, greeted us by name as we emerged from the ground floor to the lobby on the escalator, we felt royal. Jarrett, the front desk manager, escorted my daughters and me to three different rooms with three different views so we could choose our preference. Although I was pleased with all views (did NOT see any like those city rooftops others posted), we decided to upgrade to a junior suite on the 24th floor. We enjoyed mountain and waterfront views and the frequent flights of seaplanes. In fairness, the view was not unobstructed. You are in the middle of downtown so there are other tall buildings around. Centrally located, we walked to many venues, including the waterfront, galleries, restaurants and Rogers Arena where we watched the Canucks vs the Caps. The concierges were knowledgeable, helpful and efficient. Our information was accurate and suggestions excellent. I slept on a rollaway bed and..... slept well. On a rollaway! Wow. I could have stayed on the hideaway bed but there was plenty of space in the room and it was my choice for the rollaway. The girls had the king bed and were very comfortable. Some things that could have improved our stay.....free WiFi. Shocking it is not provided although we used the business center for our internet and printing needs. Also, would have liked a hotel guide with amenities listed. Kris, our exceptional bellman, answered any and all questions we had on arrival. Even so, more information at our fingertips would have been desirable. The Yew restaurant was expensive and I grumbled at the price of my breakfast as I ordered.

The Four Seasons brand carries with it a certain level of luxury, design and aesthetic. This location is not representative of the brand in any way. The bathroom was so small it was hard to turn around in it, and the tub/shower combo didn't drain properly so I had to stand in 6 inches of water while showering. And there was no ventilation in the tiny bathroom so it got foggy and had to clear out. The bath rug was vinyl! The decor is clean lines, but dated.

And, only a two hour (absolutely breathtaking) drive on the Sea to Sky Highway to Whistler. Incredible August weather, snow still on the mountains, less foot traffic and hospitality at its best.

Don't miss breakfast - order one of the gourmet omlets from the menu! As for room accomodations - bedding, cleanliness, amenities, turn down service - all up to the exceptional standards of the Four Season's. We stayed in both suite and delux room accomdations as we spent time in Vancouver upon our arrival in BC and upon our departure from BC.

Hard to find a solution to that dilemma unless they start from scratch and level the hotel - which I'm sure is not an option.

Warning for families or parties of 4 or more: While we loved Vancouver, the cab rules on number of passengers is absurd. No more than 4 passengers in a cab. They do have mini-van cabs - but it is up to the driver whether they will take more than 4. My mini-van (the same as most of the cabs I saw) easily sits 7 with cargo, but they are rule followers! The secret when ordering a mini-van cab is to say you only have 4 passengers. We never had an actual cab driver refuse us when they showed up and we had 5 (including small children), but the cab companies will not send one if you tell them you have more than 4 or they will send two. The hotel staff seemed to sympathize with us on the cab rules as did the restaurant staff at a place we ate, but rules are rules - or a racket is a racket.

I am a loyal Four Seasons customer and always will be. Although this property is a little dated compared to some of their others, the service is impeccable. On one occasion they knew it was my birthday and upon arrivle had a cake waiting in the room. Like I said before, the hotel is a little dated, however they recently went through a multimillion dollar renovation. This allowed them to update all rooms and common areas. The lobby is beautiful and understated, as are the knew furnishings in each guestroom/suite (big improvement in the bathrooms). Overall the hotel has greatly improved its overall look in the past few years, while maintaining that FS standard of excellence in service. If you're looking to dine at the hotel, room service is a must (no matter what time of day). In addition to the room service there is the trendy YEW restaurant in the lobby, they have a good selection of dining options, and offer an upscale atmosphere. You will find the young, jetset, and goodlooking as a the regular clientele. The added bonus of staying at the Four Seasons is the location of the property. It is situated right atop the Pacific Centre, and although this may seem like a nightmare to some, as it gets packed with people after 2pm, it does offer the luxury retailer Holt Renfrew at the one end of the centre. The Van art gallery is right across the street, along with a number of good restaurants and shops (Robson/Burrard St.) Overall I would strongly recommend this hotel as one of the best luxury hotels currently in Vancouver.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location, very clean\u201d", "Author": "MoDivinOttawa", "ReviewID": "UR115912490", "Content": "This hotel is located perfectly on West Georgia, downtown Vancouver.

They had a coffee station in the lobby in the morning, but it ended at 8am. They had very small take-out coffee cups and tiny pastries in small numbers which were slow to be refilled.

It is a good hotel, but in need of a makeover, it's getting rather dated. I only have a small complaint about the staff on check-in. I'd just flown in on a long flight from London and wanted to go to my room to sleep. My company had booked the room and provided a credit card for the booking. However the clerk insisted I provide another credit card until he could confirm that my company was picking up the charges, which I did. However my corporate card was not working when he tried to charge $2000 to it. Why they need to charge that much at check-in is beyond me, especially when he has the card that is going to be used for the booking on file. Anyway, after arguing with them I had to provide a personal card for him to pre-authorise the $2k. I hate doing this because it locks up personal funds, and it is a nightmare to get re-imbursed by my company later. Anyway long story short, the idiots ended up charging my personal card for the entire trip and had to issue a refund later and charge my company card as they had been instructed to do initially. It was very annoying and totally un-necessary. Not what I call exceptional service... The room was fine, apart from the fact they can only provide two double beds in a room and not two queens. A double bed is just too small, even for a 2yr old child and an adult to sleep in as we did. I don't know why any hotel would even bother with double sized beds anymore. Normal sized people just cannot sleep comfortably in them. The pool and fitness centre was a nice surprise. It has an indoor and outdoor component. The fitness centre also provided dumbells, which is becoming rare and is very much welcomed by anyone who works out regularly. Another annoying thing is that they lock access to the lifts from the bottom level for some unknown reason. Sometimes the bell staff were there to give access, but mostly you had to catch the escalator to the next level, then the lift from there - annoying when you have a child in a pram. Guests should be able to access these lifts with key/swipe access, but it looks like the hotel and lifts are too old to have this technology.

It's not that the hotel isn't \"nice\" - it certainly is - but some of the things I encountered simply have me shaking my head... Let's start with the in-room internet. The hotel offers two options: painfully SLOW internet (useful for email, Twitter and Facebook updates) for $11.99 per day, and relatively FAST internet (capable of streaming video, etc.) for $16.99. WTF? This is supposed to be a FOUR SEASONS HOTEL...who in their right mind would opt for dial-up quality internet, and why would you even offer that to your guests? (If you're going to go that route, why not offer a \"scratchy, ripped bed sheet offer\" for $30 less per night?) More importantly, why are they still charging for it? Most business-friendly hotels now offer conveniences such as free WiFi, free local phone calls, coffee in the rooms...but this place offers NONE of that. Phone calls are still charged at $1.55 each, coffee is unavailable (unless you're willing to mortgage your house and pay room service something like $10 per cup), and the aforementioned two-tier internet is simply mind boggling. (Parking is $29 per day.) The kicker was seeing a 1 litre bottle of \"Whistler Water\" on the dresser with a $7.50 price tag on it. Really? Dear Four Seasons: People are paying you $200 + to sleep in your rooms, and you can't GIVE them a bottle of water? Would the $1.29 decimate your ROI or REVPAR...or would it leave a nice taste in your residual clientele's mouths? That's just dumb management in my books, and if you want to present yourself as a \"classy\" hotel, you should start by showing a little class yourself. As it sits, I was left with the impression that the hotel was moochy, and that it survived by nickel and diming people to death - not cool. When the front desk clerk asked me if I enjoyed my stay, my response was: \"Well, it's kind of like my mother's perfume. It's not entirely unpleasant, and it was probably very nice back in its DAY... but it doesn't turn me on in the least.\" That's the Four Seasons Vancouver: it's your mother's perfume. In my opinion, this hotel is really out of touch with today's reality. There are several very nice boutique hotels in Vancouver that \"get it\", but this hotel is still living in the 90's and there are (apparently) enough people out there who are perfectly fine with that. I'm just stunned that they are SO behind the curve, and I would suggest that they realize (sooner rather than later) that their esteemed brand name is only going to take them so far.", "Date": "December 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Anonymous", "Title": "\u201cGreat choice but needs attention to some details\u201d", "Author": "Jaquesspratt", "ReviewID": "UR89957486", "Content": "Although quite familiar with Vancouver and the major hotels there, this was our first stay at the Four Seasons.

The bed and pillows were amazingly comfortable, as expected at the Four Seasons. The bathroom was a disappointment, with cold ceramic floor, a small tub with a hinged glass wall part way down the tub to protect the floor from shower use. To get at the bath/shower controls, one had to step into the tub as the hinge was distant from that end. There were no safety bars or handles to help extricate non athletes who ventured a bath. The water flow was restricted, and the temperature in early afternoon degenerated to warm at best. Towels were plentiful, toiletries of top quality, and two pristine white housecoats were available. Noise from the hallway and adjacent room was unexpected. Self parking is awkward at best in this city with a car hatred. However, valet parking worked flawlessly. The staff were uniformly excellent. The Yew bar and restaurant in the hotel were among the best I have experienced. Don't miss their 50% off any bottle of wine promotion on Sundays, available both for brunch and dinner.

So, I'm a little surprised to find myself giving 5 stars to a hotel that has nice, but not amazing, rooms. However, everything else here is so slick and perfect that I have to give it the top rating. Don't get me wrong, the rooms aren't bad or anything. They're not huge, but certainly not cramped either. The linens are all of high quality and the furniture is comfortable, especially the wonderful beds. The recent renovation has freshened up everything and the design scheme is restful, with beige background and either rust or sea-green accents. The big flat-screen worked well and had a good selection of channels. Bathroom is standard-issue; about the size of Marriott but dressed up with nicer toiletries and countertop. I don't understand why the glass door doesn't cover the full length of the tub, but it wasn't a problem. Views are pretty good once you get above the twelfth floor or so; lots of interesting city-scapes, plus if you're luck a mountain/water view. Location is great, central to everything--a twenty-minute walk would take you to just about anywhere in the downtown area you wanted to go, including Stanley Park. Other hotels nearby (in case you want to bar- or restaurant-hop) include the Fairmont Vancouver (great lobby lounge), the Met right across the street, and the Shangri-La, where MARKET by Jean-Georges has an amazing $32 prix-fixe lunch (try the braised short rib with apple and jalapeno). There's a skytrain stop in the mall attached to the 4S, but it can be confusing to find your way to it and back the first time. The hotel has both a lower-level street lobby and a second-floor lobby up an escalator which is where check-in and the restaurant are. These are done in a nice mix of both traditional and contemporary Asian decor. The restaurant, Yew, is phenomenal. It serves all three meals and has a lounge area, a large bar, and the restaurant proper. We found the service there to be sensational and sincere and the food was tops. It's a very interesting menu and everything we had was perfectly prepared. I can recommend the paella, the halibut, the buffalo meatballs in pasta with a great bleu cheese, and the appetizer of maple prawns (drool). Service in other areas of the hotel was also wonderful, from the all-over-it bell staff (never a wait for a taxi, never opened a door, bags taken and retrieved swiftly) to the attentive front desk. Those folks will take time in meeting any room preferences that they can, gladly change American to Canadian currency and even gave us customs forms when they realized we were headed back to the States. Another great feature of the hotel is fourth-floor pool/fitness center/garden. Good equipment, locker rooms including saunas, and a truly nice rooftop garden with waterfalls, streams, bridges, and plantings plus interesting views of downtown including the Top of Vancouver revolving restaurant where the food isn't so good but the views are.

The rooms are relatively basic and comfortable but nothing extraordinary from any four star hotel. The bathrooms are small in each room with a bathtub/shower combination as opposed to a separate shower stall. The counter in the bathroom is only big enough for one person at a time so my wife and I trade off getting ready in the morning. Again, everything is clean and works but is is average. Another example, today we got back at 3:40 in the afternoon after having left the hotel at 9:30 in the morning. Neither of our rooms were made up so I had to call housekeeping to get it done. They responded rapidly but is it too much to expect that this would not be necessary at a Four Seasons? Finally, when we travel with kids the nicer hotels normally send up a small treat such as cookies and milk. Other Four Seasons do this along with other top tier hotels. Not at the this Four Seasons. Do my kids need this? No. Would it be a nice touch? Yes it would. That is why I say that this Four Seasons is very good but not great.

We were assigned a room on the tope floor, but it was located directly across from the stairwell and the ice vending machine. It was not quiet in the least.

The other negative is the fact that you had to pay for internet (plug in or Wi-Fi) where as at the Met. you had to pay for WI-FI, but not if you plugged your computer in to the outlet they have in the rooms. I really do not understand why expensive hotels do not offer free internet, that just seems silly. Over all - if we go back to Vancouver with our kids I will for sure stay there.

Check in was a breeze and all of the staff we interacted with were extremely friendly and professional. The restaurant Yew is very modern and offers a unique menu. There is a large bar and table top area where customers can order off the appetizer menu or full menu. The bartender we encountered was very attentive and personable. The pool/spa/workout area is fantastic. There is a large indoor/outdoor pool with a nice hot tub. Surrounding the indoor pool area are the cardio machines and free weights. The layout definitely works and is very bright and airy with lots of windows looking out onto the rooftop terrace. The pool area also offers indoor and outdoor patio seating. There are lots of tables and chairs outside for relaxing, reading or lunch. Flavored waters and coffee are available in this area all day long. The gym equipment was state of the art and all cardio machines had cable television with complimentary headsets. Vancouver is a wonderful city to explore on foot. We were able to cover most of the major areas, including Granville Island, in 3 full days. Taxis are plentiful and accessible in case you would rather ride than walk. Stanley Park was definitely a highlight of our trip. We rented bikes on the boardwalk by the convention center and spent a few hours traveling the seawall and checking out some of the sights inside the park.

Despite arriving on the heels of a large group we did not have to wait long before being welcomed by Andrea W. at the front desk. She was extremely friendly and helpful and we wish we could have thanked her again before we left. When we got to our room we were pleased once more as it was bright, spacious and comfortable. When I called down to the concierge desk that evening for dining advice Connie was cheerful and accommodating, and was even able to make a reservation for us at a local restaurant that doesn\u2019t normally accept reservations. When we arrived at that restaurant the hostess sat us right away, despite there being a wait list, and remarked \u201cisn\u2019t it great to have connections like that?\u201d When we got back to our room after dinner we found our daughter\u2019s fold-out bed nicely made up and the extra toiletries and towels that my wife had requested waiting for us. On the Sunday we were meeting very old friends who we hadn\u2019t seen in a long time who were driving up from Seattle to meet us for brunch. The front desk staff at \u201cYew\u201d (the horel restaurant) were friendly and gracious when we explained that our friends had been delayed. Then, when they arrived, the nine of us were promptly seated in the \u201cwine room\u201d. All I can say is \u201cwow\u201d. That was a great spot: comfortable, bright, elegant, and it really eased our task of maintaining control over four children ranging in age from seven months to 11 years. The serving staff then continued the now familiar trend of efficient and courteous service. Thanks to all the staff at Yew, we had an excellent dining experience and a great visit with special friends. One generally assumes a high standard of service when staying at a Four Seasons Hotel. Even so, the staff and facilities continuously exceeded our already high expectations and contributed greatly to the overall success of our Father\u2019s Day weekend.

I know that the construction site is not Four Season's fault, but I feel that, until the construction is done, they shouldn't be selling any of the rooms on that side as \"view\" rooms. I felt somewhat cheated. - When I told the reception, upon checking in, that it was our tenth anniversary, the person checking us in asked us what day, and told us he'd have room service bring us something special on that date.

It also had a Big flat screen TV (LG) with a decent amount of channels (cira-60) also had a very comfy single seat with matching stall and a work desk with lamp (if necessary). Room lighting consists of 4 lamps and No main light. A superior radio clock (with iPod dock) was a nice feature. Room had ample storage space: good wardrobe space (with a sufficient amount of hangers) and 4 draws in the TV stand - which I find is very understated and rarely provided by hotels. Bed was amazingly comfortable (very strong contender for my favourite hotel bed ever). Bathroom is nicely done- simple and effective, but quite small (by North American standards). Has a shower/bath combo. The shower had adequate water flow although not luxurious (if I was being pedantic). I really wasn\u2019t a big fan of the shower guard as it ruins the bath and shower layout and seems quite dated. Room had essentials \u2013 bathrobes, tissues, soap, shower-gel, shampoo, ear buds, hair dryer etc etc. I liked the shampoo and shower gel but the soap not so much. Has turn down service (more revenue generating than comfort orientated). Free daily newspaper delivered to room (must use door knob labels) and free internet access in the lobby.

The Four Seasons has a staff policy to make sure that they always greet you with your name at any contact. Sounds silly, but it works to be appreciated. Great concierge. Nothing ever seems too much trouble (e.g. coming in at 2-3am and getting your shoes picked up for shoe shining before your meeting in the morning). Food: Had a couple of meals at the hotel.

It has world class parks, attractive beaches and yacht harbors, urban amenities, outstanding restaurants and great people. What it lacks is a Four Seasons hotel. This property just does not make it when compared with other FS city hotels and resorts. As mentioned in several other posts, the big problem is the building itself. It is dated in both design and operations. At night we could hear elevators, heating and plumbing. A year or so ago we stayed at the Four Seasons Los Angeles at Beverly Hills. It\u2019s in an urban setting, but the moment you step inside you immediately feel that it\u2019s a welcoming retreat from the city outside. Not so at the Vancouver property. Part of the problem is awkward architecture, as the entry level (for taxis or when you\u2019re walking) is a barely welcoming reception area. You need to take an escalator to the main lobby, which might not be a problem except that the main lobby is also cold, and on the night of our recent arrival, extremely noisy, as it is adjacent to, and almost part of the Yew restaurant and bar. This a structural problem, but not related to the age of the building. Yew has just been substantially renovated, and in fact it's a great restaurant and bar. It\u2019s just not properly separated from the lobby, which should have been done at the time of the renos. The reception clerks have to speak quite loudly to make themselves heard over the din. There were also a couple of minor service issues. The hotel was obviously not at capacity, and the reception clerk offered an upgrade, but stipulated a price of an extra $100 per night. I turned it down. I should have been more direct and demanded a free upgrade but I was pretty surprised that there was a proposed charge, and didn\u2019t feel like haggling (in necessarily raised voices) in the lobby. Over the years we have stayed at FS properties elsewhere, including Los Angeles, Hualalai and Lanai. This weekend was our 17th and 18th nights with Four Seasons in the past 12 months. We have received upgrades in the past, without ever being requested to pay more. The way I see it, if you have an empty suite and a good customer, why wouldn\u2019t you offer a free upgrade? Apparently that\u2019s not the way the FS Vancouver looks at it. Another, also minor, service issue was that I phoned the concierge to get a local radio station frequency. She didn\u2019t know and said she would phone back. She didn\u2019t. When I called 10 minutes later, she had the information, but said she had forgotten my room number. The room itself, a \u201cdeluxe\u201d king, was not of FS quality. Closet, bathroom and dresser were small. The desk features a spaghetti-like tangle of electrical cords underneath, in full view (admittedly a bit like my office, but I don\u2019t rent my office out by the night). Non-flat screen tv. I was also appalled at the windows which can be opened at floor level. This is a high rise building, and there is no balcony, so this window would lead to a multi-storey drop.

Food, drink and service were excellent. It\u2019s an expensive night out, but you definitely get what you pay for. I will also add that the Vancouver FS is in an excellent location, which is one reason I have gone back several times since the 80's.

I knew from other reviews that this would not be a five star location. Let me state that the property was clean, everything was in working order, and it was well located. The reason that I booked this hotel is that I hoped that the staff would make up for any shortcomings of the facility. Upon arrivial I knew that I was right. I do not know where they find such great people. The staff was able to make us overlook the \"1970's Marriott style building\" and made our stay feel pretty close to a five star Four Seasons experience. The front desk, concigere, bar, and valet staff were all wonderfu! It is not thier fault the building is showing it's age although they seem to work a little harder to maintain the high standards and make sure that we had a great experience. Look at some negative reviews on Trip Advisor. It is typically the hotel employees who ruin an experience for a guest. Most low reviews are from travelers who expected something that was not delivered by the hotel staff. That said, this location actulally improves my opinion of the FS brand. If the price is correct I will tolerate mediocre (but clean) decor as long as it is met with caring, talented , and hosptiable individuals who excel at thier jobs. Someday soon I am sure that the company will make the investment and upgrade the rest of the building. (They just finished the bar and dining room) At that point it will be back among the best that Vancouver has to offer. Until then enjoy the reasonable rates, great service, and convienent location in a great weekend city. Here are a few insider tips! Find out when B.C. days are and book that weekend.

After all, this is a Four Seasons hotel. We were planning a small family reunion and were staying at the property for only one night prior to a cruise. Because there were multiple rooms involved, we spent quite a while making the arrangements with the hotel staff prior to arrival. The service we received was excellent from both the front desk staff and concierge to arrange misc details prior to arrival. Many hotels offer no help if any prior to arrival. That was not the case here. The rooms were very nice. We booked both Premiere Rooms as well as an Executive Suite. The Premiere rooms were very much like Jr Suites and very spacious with corner views on the city below. The Executive Suite was even larger with two complete rooms and a spectacular view of the water and mountains (not to mention the magnificent pool deck complete with paths, waterfalls and a running brook). The decor of the rooms was a bit \"antique\" for my taste, but such is common with the Four Seasons, especially older ones. It could probably use a bit of a renovation as well, but overall I was very happy with the quality, size, amenities and views of the rooms. During our stay, the entire front desk and concierge staff was excellent. Due to the complexity of planning the stay and schedule of several people, we made many requests and they were all taken care of with the top service you would expect from a Four Seasons. They even arranged for an in-room massage that was perfection. There were a couple of minor problems related to a biling issue and a room service amenity delivery. Now, these were both very minor issues and not something I would penalize a hotel for in my rating. However, the sole reason I'm rating this hotel with a 4 and not a 5 is because of the experience we had when we went down to the front desk to enquire about these issues. Now, granted it was very late (around midnight) and so the normal staff wasn't there. But the gentlemen manning the desk, although not outright rude, was apathetic and only partially helped us and even then only after prodding. He was also rude to other staff members for no reason in front of us. To the Four Seasons manager - all it takes is one bad experience with a staff member like this to tarnish an otherwise perfect stay. He gave us the service I would expect from a 2 star hotel, not a Four Seasons. I don't want to leave you with a bad impression of this hotel, however.

We enjoyed the bar with its intimate, relaxing spaces and the breakfast restaurant with its soaring windows. In both cases, we had the excellent service we\u2019ve come to expect from the Four Seasons. And the food and drink were wonderful \u2013 the breakfast is definitely worth it. The reviews were right about one thing: the hotel should be renovated. Hotel styles change and this hotel, which seems in some ways stuck in the 80s, should reflect that. Except for the bar, it lacks intimate spaces that make it feel more cozy, comfortable and exclusive and the relative (for a Four Seasons) plainness of its larger public spaces doesn\u2019t convey the typical Four Seasons ambiance we\u2019ve become accustomed to in our travels around the world. We were upgraded to a Corner Deluxe Room with wonderful wraparound windows affording a view of the city and some of the mountains. The room had a comfortable bed and a nice layout, but the garish curtains and dated furniture were a drawback. We also thought the somewhat cramped bathroom was a bit dowdy; it was not as nice as the relaxing oases we\u2019ve seen in other Four Seasons properties.

Robson Street (known for its shopping) is two blocks away. The Pacific Centre mall is attached to the hotel. Lots of cafes, stores, restaurants within a few blocks. Cabs were always available at the hotel. Stanley Park was about an $8 cab ride away. 2. ROOM: We reserved and received a Deluxe Corner Room (2208) on the 22nd floor. We had a nice view of the harbour around Canada Place, and the mountains in the background. The Deluxe Corner room is a mild upgrade with floor to ceiling windows on two sides. Furnished nicely. 3. AMENITIES: A very nice indoor/outdoor swimming pool (heated) with exercise equipment on one side of it. No extra charge for the fitness equipment nor the pool. Cocktail and food service on the outdoor patio portion of the pool. Very nice public areas. Staff was always very nice and helpful. 4. FOOD: Didn't eat in the restaurants. Had room service breakfast once and cheese and wine in the bar once. 5. VALUE: Rack rate on this room was $430 per night; I reserved it for the Entertainment Card rate of $215 per night. I did have to show my Entertainment card at check in (a first).

Keep in mind that not all hotels listed have the Half Price room availability for the specific dates that you want to stay. It can be frustrating at first. You have to work at it a little bit to get the discounted rate at a suitable hotel. If the toll free reservations are not successful, try the direct call to the hotel.
