The hotel is very modern and cool. We were told we would receive an upgrade to our room and of course we were very excited. We get to the room and it is a normal standard room...... we then worry about what sort of room we would have been in to begin with. After a day of shopping we return to our room to find that it was not cleaned. We look at the room controller to see that we had accidentally left the do not disturb button on. Our bad. So one of the girls calls to have some fresh towels sent up and ask to just have our beds made. No one comes. The next day we ask the concierge to book us to see Alcatraz. She gives us the number so we could do it. Wait a second...... No we need you to do it..... So she does. We taxi down to that area early to go ahead to will call to get our tickets so we could have a nice lunch before Alcatraz. At will call we find out that only two tickets were purchased and we needed three. Of course it is now sold out. One of the girls calls the concierge to find out what happened....they say this is a normal occurrence that the Alcatraz tickets are mixed up (what?!?) but they apologized for our waisted time and said we would have a gift waiting for us in our room. That evening we come back to the room to find that yet again it has not been cleaned........with no gift. We have now had it. We talk to a manager about it he of course apologizes and sends a bottle of wine and a stress ball and candle. We brush the afternoon off and get ready for dinner. We have been so excited to use the house car (a bentley) for dinner so we go downstairs 20 minutes before our reservation to let them know we would like to use the car. We over hear them ok-ing the couple in front of us to go out side the 2mile radius the car is limited to. We wait for over 45min. We start a new with the driver and he is amazing. We return and the valet now apologize for our wait and offer to buy breakfast. I feel like there were so many other smaller things that happened that really put a bad taste in our mouths about the St. Regis. The whole place is not horrible the restaurants, bars and of course the Remede Spa are top notch. I would NEVER stay here again but I would come back to the spa because they truly know how to make their guest feel special.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cSt. Regis is a safe bet for quality in SF\u201d", "Author": "jfwoodman", "ReviewID": "UR126705909", "Content": "Stayed here to celebrate wedding anniversary.

We've stayed at the W before (and did again for a few nights this trip), but the St Regis feels so much more luxurious for the money. The furniture at the St Regis is better quality (the W furniture reminds me of IKEA), the bathroom actually has SPACE you can use, they give you shower caps, cotton balls, etc.....things you would expect for the price. We were in town for a very large video game developers convention (GDC). This may have led to the younger (most of the guests were 25-40), Silcon Valley vibe at the hotel during our stay, but it worked perfectly for us. We are Starwoods Gold members and even though we were on a conference group rate, we were upgraded to a large, lovely corner room, free WIFI, and given a 4pm checkout. The room was modern, sun-filled, and spacious. It had a great shower and nice separate soaking tub. On the 7th floor, you could barely hear some outside street noise which might bother a very light sleeper. We didn't really have any views, but that was fine. The hotel itself is right next the Moscone center and an easy walk to many restaurants, coffee places, shopping, and transportation. The downstairs bar/lounge area was hopping early to late afternoon, but then quieted down later in the evening. It's great little area to have a quick cocktail or meeting and actually be able to hear each other speak. If you need a more rockin' late night crowd, you can walk one block down to the W which carries on much later (and louder) into the night. The spa was lovely. Had a massage with Dennis Trump (I usually always go to a girl, but none were available. He did not disappoint).....what a nice guy!! At the end of the treatment, I asked him for some restaurant suggestions and he gave us some wonderful choices. The pool at the hotel is outdoor only so that was a bit of a bummer, but would be great in the warmer months. I would def. recommend this hotel for a romantic get-away or a business trip.

From the lobby to the doorman to the staff at the Vitrine Restaurant to the butler service! The butler service impressed us the most! My husband forgot cufflinks for his shirt and asked to borrow some, but was told none were available at the time. Although, we had to improvise using other materials (we were running late for dinner reservations) we found a box of cufflinks in our room upon our return. They sent someone shopping at the nearby Macy's to get us some. Even though, it was too late, that kind of service was still very much appreciated! Thank you, St.Regis! Due to the closure of the Bay Bridge, we took the BART into the city and got off at the Montgomery station. It was super easy and there was no hassle with parking. Of course, we packed light and were able to walk the few blocks to the hotel. We loved the high end marble flooring, leather walls, and luxurious linens. We didn't hear much noise from others in the hotel room, but you could still hear the sounds of a big city below. So keep that in mind. 13th Floor was not high enough to buffer the sounds of sirens from fire engines and police trucks. But it was very quiet after midinight or so.

I won't go into the details but have since written to starwood corporate service department and would like to hear back from the hotel management. To be fair, once we checked in and went past some very odd guest experiences (which I'll attribute to the butler we communicated with), the service improved tremendously.

American Express had to take care of the false accusations. Their management team is awful, extremly condescending. OH AND JULIE -- SHOULD BE FIRED ASAP SHE IS THE EPITOME OF FAIL. Here is my letter to the St Regis: The serious and shocking allegations leveled by management of the St. Regis hotel of wrong doing on my part involves smoking in a guest room. As I have told all parties involved, I DO NOT SMOKE, I HAD A LOVED ONE JUST PASS AWAY FROM CANCER.... I expect prompt attention to this matter. I have never ever been wrongly accused of smoking before, especially by a supposed 5 star hotel. These accusations have cause myself and my wife plenty of anguish and ruined our honeymoon. I am mortified and sincerely hope this is taken care of before I escalate this to the next level. Attached find my response to front desk manager Julie --: Hello Julie, Thank you for removing the mini bar charge. As I had told you at check out, we did NOT use the minibar. As for the $350 charge for smoking I don't know what your talking about? Neither myself or my wife smoke. We are marathon runners and smoking is not one of the things we do to train. A close relative of mine recently passed away from cancer, WE DO NOT SMOKE. At this point proof from the St. Regis is necessary that in your words \"you and your guest appeared to have smoked in a non-smoking room\". I am completely shocked....The first room we were given the whole floor smelled strongly of smoke, also we had no cell service. We asked to be moved promptly, which we were NOT and the second room also smelled musty / smokey in addition to being dirty. Also the whole 12th floor smelled of smoke. My wife and I had several problems staying at the St. Regis San Francisco . First was asking to be moved and our \"butler\", or the front desk dropping the ball. We checked in at 1pm and were not moved until approximately 7pm. The bathroom and the window ledge were filthy and we had to let housekeeping know to come and clean it again. There was never ice or water in the room, after we made a point to let housekeeping know we wanted it there. Several times we ran out of toilet paper and had to call the front desk, half a roll was left in the room and not an extra anywhere to be found. We ordered room service once, the order was all wrong, they forgot my fries with the sandwich, and also the dressing for my wife's salad. We had to wait another 30 minutes to get the ordered items, by that time the food was cold. Never once were we greeted by the doorman when we walked in after a long day. Both floors we were given rooms on smelled of smoke. The final problem was when we were checking out and you Julie -- were helping and there were bogus charges on my bill. This is extremely unprofessional and completely the opposite experience I've had at other St. Regis properties . I am a frequent traveler and I have never been treated so poorly by a supposed 5 star property. As I told you when I was checking out yesterday I am in Napa Valley for few more days of vacation. Your email this morning pretty much ruined my day. I would expect the St. Regis to solve this today amicably and issue a complete refund asap.

The hotel is conveniently located in the San Fran downtown area with walking distance to pretty much all of the attractions in the city. The hotel itself is modernly decorated and well maintained, with an atmosphere that is almost more like ones typically seen at Mandarin Oriental than St Regis. We booked a Metropolitan Suite and the room was very specious, with a nice dining table and comfortable L shaped couch. All of the phone dialing and lighting were controlled by digital pads. The bathroom was bright and nicely done as well. Although there was not a second bathroom we were pleased to see two sinks in the spacious bathroom. So with such a nice hotel, how come I only gave it three stars? First it had to do with room service. Both my bf and I are late risers and thus we ordered breakfast in every morning during our stay. Although the food itself is delicious, getting the food itself is not such a smooth process. There is only one day, out of 4, that the room service department got our order right. The first day they missed the pastries. The second day they miss the Maple Syrup (to go with pancake, which is stated in the menu and should come without a special request). On the third day, even though I specifically asked for some honey to go with my French toast over the phone, the honey was missing when the order came. I understand that this may not be the delivery person\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fault and feel bad that we have to send the person back every single time to pick up the missing items, but the person who took the order and the person packing the order should really take the responsibility of checking the completeness of every order. Since this is a five star hotel that charges 21% of service charge (& I believe there is a $5 delivery fee in addition to that) for room service, this type of service is really Not acceptable. A 5 star hotel should be able to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153earn\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd its 21% service charge instead of getting it by default. It was especially disappointing that when we addressed this issue during check out, we merely got an answer of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153oh we are surprised to hear that and will address this issue with room service\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd without a word of sorry or any apology from a supervisor (which is surprising to see for a five star hotel). There are a couple of other things in addition to that. In terms of the room itself, although the room is nice/bright/high tech as previously stated, there was a huge crack in one of the sinks (and I have a picture to prove that) that was obvious there since the installation of the sink. Although it did not affect the functionality of the sink, it was surprising for a guest staying at a room with rack rate of over $1k a night to see that in the bathroom. In terms of the hotel service, although the service mostly live up to the name of a five-star hotel, has its high and lows. The staff at the Concierge desk (I believe his first name is Steven) was extremely helpful and gave us all sorts of tips in addition to the maps and explained thoroughly with regards to different ways to get to places. On the other hand, the bell guys at the Parking area were not nearly as nice and often opened the door with a stone cold, annoyed face. Overall we definitely enjoyed the room and the location of the hotel and had a wonderful time in San Fran.

The rooms are very modern and clean and spacious. However, there is a lot of street noise, enough to wake anyone but the soundest sleeper up a few times each night. The Taxi situation is miserable. That is because the hotel is not on a street where Taxis travel much. Allow for about 10 minutes for a cab, but could be much longer if there is a line. The hotel was unhelpful when I called the 'butler' to ask for them to call a cab for me, in the hope I would not have to rely on one being flagged down. The butler told me that they had cabs lined up and there would be no wait, which was completely false. There were no cabs lined up and it took 10 minutes to get one. I was actually very unimpressed with the 'butler' service advertised heavily by the hotel. I thought I might watch a DVD and called the 'butler' hoping he could bring by the list of DVD's the Hotel keeps on hand to loan. That was completely nixed. I was told that I would have to go downstairs to the front desk to see the list. Not very 'butler-esque', in my opinion. Why call them butlers if they are not going to go out of their way to help? Another strike-out was when I called to ask whether they had any materials I could have to wrap a small gift. Now, I know that sounds a little prima-donna-ish, but I have asked at another hotel and they were able to help with this. Actually, I hear from a friend who works in a hotel that most hotels have some wrapping paper on hand for their own use. Anyway, my request was refused, actually I felt they ridiculed me a bit for it.

We've arrived from airport in the evening, approx. 20:30. When checking in we've been informed that the hotel was sold out and therefore, even I'm holding Platinum SPG status, we would get only a Grand Deluxe room - but top floor (20th). Holding Platinum status, at US$ 389.00++ there isn't even breakfast included nor is there a Club Lounge with all-day snacks, drinks... When entering the Grand Deluxe room I asked myself where they've lost the \"Grand\". The room was small, maybe one of the smallest I've seen at SPG during the last year. But okay, we didn't come to SFO to stay in the room and therefore I decided to stay. But when the bellboy left and we sat down we realized a big noise. I switched off the aircon - but the noise remained. I means not a bit of noise, I mean real noise. According to what I understand this noise was caused by the aircon located on top of the roof - just above our room. I called the front desk and they told me to send a technician. But nobody came. I called again and informed again about the noise. The manager at the front desk told me he trusts me - but he couldn't do anything about it. I asked if they'll let me go to another hotel and he agreed. The only positive I can say about the St. Regis in SFO is that they brought us with their hotel car (free of charge) to the Ritz Carlton where we got a beautiful room with Club Lounge access (fatastic!!!) at just US$ 30++ more. Conclusion: a) don't accept a top-floor room b) don't stay at the St. Regis if you expect a 5* experience - because 5* means more than a nice lobby and room c) if you can spend 10% more go to e.g. the Ritz-Carlton and get a Club Floor room with all the benefits", "Date": "November 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cnew swanky property in seedy part of town\u201d", "Author": "flaviator", "ReviewID": "UR87097634", "Content": "If you're on expense account, then you can stay here.

It was my first stay at a St. Regis property. I was traveling alone and was looking forward to staying at a nicer hotel than normal for a medical conference. I was not disappointed! The location was a nice 5-10 minute walk to my meetings. The hotel is fairly new and has a modern asian cosmopolitan feel. It seems to cater to the business travelers. Every part of the hotel I visited was spotless. My room was immaculate. The bath was luxurious with a soaking tub, travertine marble shower with rain shower. There were plenty of soft towels, bathrobes and a flat screen tv in bath. Housekeeping was great with turndown service every night. The bed and linens were amazing. I heard sirens during the day but I didn't notice any at night, guess I slept really good! I liked the touch screen controls at the bedside for the blinds, lights, temperature. The radio wasn't that great, not great reception, no ipod dock. The only thing I didn't like about my room was the view. I had a fifth floor room with a view of the air conditioning vents and of people in the museum of modern art looking out and taking pictures. I found out later when I visited the museum that there was a where's waldo sculpture on the roof of the building behind the hotel! I asked for a different room with a better view after I checked in, but was politely told that there were no other rooms available due to the conference. I had expected to maybe get a smaller room since I was paying the conference rate of $349 night. So, I kept my blinds closed the whole trip. I paid for internet the first night then used the free local sites the rest of my trip at Starbucks and the Grove. I spent two post conference evenings in the Remede spa getting a pedicure and a massage. The spa was very relaxing, with very nice friendly staff. I loved the champagne and chocolate truffles! The infinity pool was very cool! I used the fitness center one night to work out. I thought it was clean and well serviced. I ate dinner at Ame and had a very nice meal with amazing service. I also had dessert and a drink in the bar one night. It was a weeknight with a calmer, quieter crowd, unlike the weekend when the bar was packed. There are several restaurants within walking distance of the hotel like California Pizza Kitchen. It's San Francisco so there are coffee shops on every corner, Peet's and Starbucks. The Grove is a really cool restaurant next door that serves all day and has wireless internet with your meal. I had the best chicken pot pie I have ever had there! There is a walgreens a half a block away, and an italian market across the street where you can buy a bottle of wine or get deli food. As a single woman, I felt very safe walking around the immediate area of the hotel and convention center. I only saw a few street people, not as many as I had expected. The area around the hotel seems a bit saner than the Union square area. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and would not hesitate to stay here again. I felt very pampered and well cared for! All the staff I encountered were friendly and professional. The doormen were friendly and welcoming. It isn't a place I would take my family on vacation, and it probably wouldn't appeal to everyone.

St. Regis. My wife and I went for a romantic weekend from 9/23 - 9/27. We did not realize it was \"Oracle Week\" at Moscone Center, right across the street. Huge convention. It was jam packed at the hotel, but that was not their fault. We reserved an executive premier king, which is supposed to be one of the larger rooms. Our first room had a smashed table lamp and bacon crumbs on the duvet cover. The carpet had dirt on it. We had to wait at check in for the room while it was being \"inspected\". Some inspection. They clearly did not wash the duvet cover or vacuum the room. We complained and they moved us to a different room that was absolutely smaller with no seating. We complained again and were told that it was the last room available and that it was the exact same size as our previous room, it was not. It was definitely a down grade. We are Starwood gold members, but the front desk did not want to hear from us again, they were overwhelmed, so the director of guest services (Ken/Kevin?) called. He was extremely polite and professional, he apologized profusely. He offered 100/night off our bill because there were no other rooms available, (Oracle week), so we accepted. We really did not have a choice. The 100 off per night was nice, but we really like nice hotel rooms, and this kind of ruined it for us. We had planned to have some friend's up for cocktails because they wanted to check out the St. Regis, but since there is no seating in the room we met in the bar. We were embarrassed to show them our room. Some of our main complaints about the room: there is no I-Pod docking station in the room. Shocking! This is San Francisco, Apple/ tech center of the world. You have to clumsily plug your I-Pod into the back of the T.V. after calling the internet butler to get a cable. The T.V. is your stereo system. Lame. The bathroom only had one sink, there should be two at this category of room The closet is miniscule, we had to jam our clothes in. You have to call for an iron and board. There should be one in every room. These rooms are clearly designed for a single traveler attending a convention right across the street, and if that is the case, and your company is picking up the tab, it is convenient. There is no luggage storage. The lighting is dim. The bedside room controller (clock, phone, lighting, automatic drapes) is clumsy and awkward to use. (If you have ever stayed at a Peninsula Hotel, they have those system controllers down.) They charge 14.95 per 24 hour use of internet. That is a robbery when you are spending 550/night (plus a whole host of taxes and fees, not their fault). There is free internet access pretty much everywhere in S.F. Overnight parking is 50/night, ouch. Also, BEWARE, the hotel is right next door (literally) to a very large fire station. The trucks/ambulances come and go all night long, sirens blaring. It is very LOUD and we wore ear plugs. On the plus side, the bed was comfortable. The rain shower in the bathroom is the best I have ever encountered, very strong with tons of water, and I don't usually like rain shower heads. The staff is excellent and friendly. You never see a maid's cart in the hallway, very classy. We left our room for about 30 minutes and the entire room was made up upon our return. They are a little stingy with soap/ shampoo, when the soap in the shower is down to a sliver, they should leave a new bar. Plus we left 10/day on the nightstand for the maid. Whatever. Great turn down service in the evening. Room service is excellent. The restaurant AME off the lobby is incredible and highly recommended. Great crudo and seafood, loved our waiter. If you are going for a convention at Moscone Center and your are alone, it is convenient. If you are going for a romantic/leisurely weekend with a loved one, this is not the place.

Overall, the St. Regis wasn't bad, but there are a few shortcomings. Service - the staff was friendly and very helpful. I did not experience any problems with those at the front desk. I was always greeted warmly and provided with the assistance needed. Definitely better than the Ritz Carlton, where staff seemed as if I was an annoyance. My main issue with the St. Regis was with the concierge on duty, as they all appeared unwilling to provide any additional information unless asked directly. For example, they did not let me know that tickets to the de Young Museum's exhibit was sold out when I specifically asked for directions and indicated that I needed to go purchase tickets; instead, I had to find out when I arrived at the de Young and was told that I could have pre-booked. In contrast, the concierge at the Four Seasons were more proactive. Room - stayed in a Grand Deluxe room and had a nice view of the city and the water. The room was very comfortable and large, similar in size to that of the Four Seasons. However, its furniture was showing some wear and tear with scratches evident. The closet was also smaller than those of the other hotels. The washroom had a great soaker tub that looked directly into the room, so you could have a view of the city. This was a nice feature that opened up the space and made it seem more spacious and bright. Plenty of towels that were nice and thick... I make a note of this because the towels at the Four Seasons should really be replaced. Extras - one small bottle of Evian was in the room during the day and another was provided at turndown. While a little more generous than the Four Season's one bottle at turndown, its still quite a bit more stingy than the Ritz Carlton. There is complimentary internet access provided through the business center - can't seem to recall if it's on the 2nd or 3rd floor - but you log in for 15 minute sessions with a countdown clock appearing at the bottom right hand side of your screen. You can extend the session, but you end up feeling rushed. Unlike the Four Seasons and the Ritz Carlton, there was no morning coffee/tea service in the lobby. I believe it is located on the 4th floor where the hotel's restaurant, Vitrine, is located, but it is quite awkward to walk past the hostess in order to get coffee. The gym is quite nice, but is shared with the residences. A full range of equipment is available 24 hours a day, which is a nicer option than the Four Seasons (contracted through Sports Club/LA with limited hours) and the Ritz Carlton (located in the basement and is much smaller). Overall, it was a pleasant stay.

My friend and I checked into the hotel around noon, and were promptly given keys to the room. The hotel had placed us in a room with two double beds on the 11th floor, overlooking SFMoMA. We never heard or saw anyone else on the 11th floor, which was nice. The room was absolutely gorgeous. Our bathroom had a soaker tub, shower with a rainfall showerhead (which had fantastic water pressure), nice vanity area and separate toilet area. There were plenty of towels, and we were pleased to see bath sheet sized towels. The Remede toiletries smelled terrible, but maybe that's the norm for the brand. (I didn't care to smell like a pepperminty forest, so I didn't try them.) We LOVED the Pratesi linens on the bed, and the beds were fairly comfy. The turndown service was a nice touch. The room lacked a few little amenities. There's very little soundproofing in the bathroom, and I didn't really care to listen to my friend use the toilet. Though the room has a soaker tub, they don't offer any bubble bath to use. The toilet paper and tissues in the room were rough, 1 ply paper. I expected something a bit nicer! Here's what we didn't like: the hotel staff seemed to think that we were of a much lower class than their other guests. Granted, we came in dressed fairly casual but we certainly didn't look like street people! When we asked for directions to the local BART station, the concierge clerk seemed appalled. The hotel advertises that they will drop you off anywhere within a 3 mile radius in the hotel Bentley, but we were never offered a ride nor did ANY of the employees mention it. I find it crazy that the hotel charges for WiFi, although they did have a business center for guest use. Internet time in the business center was limited to 30 minutes, or so we were told.

We were told it would be the ultimate in luxury and service. This hotel was GORGEOUS and the valet and bellmen could not have been more attentive and prompt. But we will NEVER stay here again. Here's why: We requested an early check-in so that we could freshen up from the car before seeing \"Wicked\". When my hubby called to confirm the reservation he was told that wasn't available (which was fine we know that's a perk that is rarely available in such a busy city) We arrived after our show at about 5:15. When checking in we were told our room was not yet available...WTF check in time is 3pm and it's 5:15 and our room isn't ready are you kidding me??? In our 10+ years of staying in 4 and 5 star hotels in SF this has NEVER EVER happened to us. We let the staff know that we had a dinner reservation we had to make and asked if a different room was available. They replied \"sorry, no, we are fully committed\" They would put a \"rush\" on the room and that they would be happy to get a few drinks for us in the bar while we waited. At 6:30 no one had come to tell us the room was ready so we went back to the front desk...where our keys were waiting in the Rolodex and the gentleman who had originally checked us in was MIA and we were helped by a young woman. HELLO!!! The guy knew we had a reservation to make and did not come get us when the room was ready! Soo basically, we paid for 21 hours in a hotel room and were already only receiving 18. We proceeded up to our room, they hotel itself was gorgeous. And as we opened the door we immediately realized why the room hadn't been ready...we were greeted by a room that had obviously been smoked in. It wreaked, it was disgusting. I called down to request a room change and was told that \"they were fully committed \" to which I answered \"I'm not staying in this room\" she said she would try to locate something (if you're full how are you going to locate something??) Like magic she called back within 5 min. and said that they had a cancellation for a room that was a step down from the room we were in. I said \"fine\" and then she asked \"would you like to come down to get the keys?\" HMMM....NO. You f*ed up, you bring the keys to me..talk about bad service! The second room we got into had no problems but the arrival experience had already left a bad taste in my mouth. I don't think I would have been so angry if they had just been more up front and honest with us about the room situation. Not to mention the fact that they tried to charge us the rate for the more expensive room we had booked and not the lesser room we ended up in. For the money we spent here I was shocked by the attention to detail or lack- there-of. A month ago we stayed at a Marriott for a wedding. We were informed on arrival that the room wasn't ready because someone had smoked in it and were immediately offered a different room (saving us the trouble of waiting for cleaning and moving rooms). Guess what...they also offered 50% off the rate without us even asking!! Now that is customer service. So...bottom line gorgeous hotel...top of the line luxery...service was aweful and not worth the $$, we will never stay again. oh did I mention the people in the room next to us were still partying at 3:30 am and after two calls to the front desk and a 45 min wait security finally came up and made them quiet down.", "Date": "July 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong, China", "Title": "\u201cDecent rooms, but service with a begrudging smile\u201d", "Author": "Baobab88", "ReviewID": "UR72383251", "Content": "Had high hopes of this hotel, but came away with a mildly disappointing opinion versus our expectations for a St Regis.

If we didn't already have dinner plans with friends, I don't think we would have left the hotel. We felt like a million bucks after the spa, pool, fitness room and a good night sleep. The staff was great as well. I had forgotten my shampoo and conditioner, called the front desk for an extra bottle-they had housekeeping bring me a whole bag! Overall the stay was great and staff was very nice. I would definitely come stay here again.

Prompt service from room service, valet car pickup requests, and on premises restaurant, Ame. \" Is there anything else I can do for sir ?\" was a common question with each encounter with this hotel's staff. Stay here if you like contemporary furnishings, spectacular city views. Lobby bar and lounge is popular with locals and can get busy and noisy later in the evening. Well designed lobby and public areas, perhaps this property is not for you if you prefer traditional furnishings, though. I enjoy the complimentary coffee available in the mornings on the fourth floor by the casual restaurant and the large L shaped gym on 5. I did not use the 6th floor pool or spa, however. Prompt and thorough housekeeping staff and eager to please turn down service in the evenings, with every request met promptly and willingly. Museum of Modern Art is next door, and Metreon Center is across the street for films, Union Square and Market St. shopping just a few blocks away. My only negative observation is that the room/suite furnishings are looking slightly worn, some stains on the mohair sofa, and wood furniture looking very slightly scratched. Lovely thick towels, bathrobes, generous toiletries. Closet and drawer space is very limited however, a common design flaw among higher end contemporary hotels, I find. High speed elevators with rarely more than a few seconds wait.

It has absolutely everything you could want. It has elegant decor, attentive service (excluding final check-out), great food, a spacious swimming pool, gorgeous rooms, a central location, and a tranquil atmosphere. The claims made in previous reviews about a poor location are false. The hotel is only half a block from the SFMOMA, across the street from the Yerba Buena Gardens, a fifteen minute walk to The Embarcadero and the Ferry Building, and a five minute walk to Union Square Shopping. The claims of street-noise are also mostly false. The only noise we could hear was the sound emergency sirens, which we only heard during the day. Our first room was absolutely amazing. It was very spacious and well laid-out. It was very tastefully decorated in a scheme of creme, pale green, light blue, and light brown with chrome and wood accents. The beds were extremely comfortable and the art in the room was quite nice. The televisions were great and had many channels. The bathroom was ideal. It was enormous and had a large soaker bath, a stone tiled shower stall, and a separate lavatory. The vanity was very large with a nice sink and elegant fixtures. One of the other great features of the bathroom were the doors in front of the bathtub. They were nice because you could see out of the windows from the bath. From our room on the sixteenth floor, the view was very panoramic. We could see the Yerba Buena Gardens, the Bay Bridge, and many of the surrounding hills (as long as it is not incredibly foggy). The service was also amazing. Almost every single experience we had with the staff was great. The housekeeping staff is fabulous and the butlers were great. Though, the some greatest of all the staff were the Concierges. They were all amazing. The greatest were Caroline and Mariah. They were extremely helpful. Caroline booked tour reservations for us to go to Sausalito, the Muir Woods, and Wine Country. None of their dinner recommendations disappointed. They always sent confirmations of our bookings to our room and also gave us walking directions to all the restaurants. The pool at the St. Regis San Francisco is also great. It is very large and the space is very light, airy, and elegant. The food at the hotel was also phenomenal. We ordered from private-dining several times and both the quality of the food and the service were consistently fabulous. The only complaint was about the mysterious 21% \"Service Charge\" that was automatically added to each cheque. (We enquired about the charge over check-out and the employee at the desk rudely replied that \"It is generally customary at four or five star hotels\". If that is so, why have we not experienced a similar charge at the many other five star hotels we have stayed at!?! Other than the latter experience, I would highly recommend the St. Regis San Francisco to anyone looking for an amazing San Francisco luxury hotel in a convenient location.", "Date": "September 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland", "Title": "\u201cLovely hotel, poor service.\u201d", "Author": "PDXStocks", "ReviewID": "UR38697601", "Content": "Lovely rooms, chic contemporary design with push button lighting and blind controls. Bathrooms are the bomb with Remede amenities, though no mouthwash. No Platinum SPG amenity delivered to room. When I called and asked if they deliver one, they said depending on occupancy they'll take the time to bring some \"sweets\" to the room, but with high occupancy they do not. Requested a wine bucket, ice and four glasses. 25 minutes later as I was fuming, having called two more times for a total of three calls, it arrived. No suite upgrade for Platinum SPG. They claimed they did not have any Astor suites available, so I fired up the laptop and told them they might want to take a look at the online website. They upgraded us to a corner room, but not without some major verbage on my part and only on the second day of our stay. Let's be frank, if you have Platinum SPG guests it's probably not going to create a good image of the management of this hotel for the front desk employees to get caught lying about whether or not upgraded rooms are available. No Club floor. For those who think this hotel is the \"best\" in San Fran, I suggest they try out a competitor a block away or the two well known hotels on Nob Hill that do have Club Floors. The style is different on Nob Hill but no comparison in service. We had friends come in to pick us up so they could see the room. Oops, first 30 minutes at the St Regis is a mere $10! The valet had been told they would be up and back down, but yet they did not leave the car up, even though they weren't busy. Down it went into the garage and we waited for 20 minutes while they retrieved the damn thing. I finally had a come to Jesus meeting with one of the guys and the car magically appeared. Overnight parking is a veritable bargain at $50. And if you're silly enough to use the hotel laundry service then you deserve the surprise you'll get with those charges. We dropped a pair of pants at a nearby cleaners for same day service with a wine spot from lunch rather than auctioning off our first born to pay for \"rush\" laundry with the hotel. AME is a fine restaurant. I'm not sure where the Michelin star fits in, but it's quite good and as pricey as any of the high end restaurants it competes against, but not overly so. Breakfast on the other hand looks to be outrageously priced. No buffet, and the room service prices will really get your attention. The gym is somewhat small and the weight equipment is packed in. Plenty of good cardio equipment and an attendant during daytime hours with cold water, towels and fruit. We've been in larger more spacious gyms, but there's nothing wrong with this. No iron or ironing board in the rooms. You have to call the Butler or Front desk. Each time we called, regardless of the reason or occasion the phone rang off the hook before being answered. Lord knows why, but in a hotel that wants to charge $350 and up per night, at least staff the phones appropriately. Once we got through the iron was delivered within 5 minutes, but no ironing board, but she quickly retrieved it and brought that once she realized we wanted an ironing board also. Acceptable flat screen tv plus one in the bathroom, which is really a very nice upscale touch, with a very good assortment of channels to select from. Also the robes and towels are excellent as one would expect in a 5 star hotel. Tub and shower. Location is next to SF Museum of Modern Art, other than that, if you don't have reason to be south of Market, the location won't do much for you. Thankfully, San Francisco is compact so most places in the city are within a short cab ride. Of the 5 star hotels I have stayed, this has the bones, but clearly I thought the service did not justify their pricing. If one has never experienced a hotel of this caliber I guess you could get all googly eyed at the glamour, the design, the lovely lobby/bar and the HOPPING bar scene on weekends with 20 and 30 year olds cocktailing until the wee hours, but it was lacking to us. Maybe the fact that we weren't even acknowledged as Platinum guests when checking in, no Platinum amenity, having to argue with the front desk or whether there were upgraded rooms, just left a weird feeling. We would not stay again unless it were in the low $200's. It doesn't merit anymore in our opinion. Now if we were on an expense account and could care less what our boss thought, then maybe we'd do it, but I'd sooner blow the corporate card on the 5 star a block away or up on Nob Hill.

The Hotel's pool adjacent to the Remede spa is very, very nice. You can order room service and eat over there if you want. Service: Most items bought up within minutes. Concierge was very helpful in terms of providing directions. One thing I have to mention here is that on the day that I am checking out, the housekeeping lady opened my door without even knock (nor the Do Not Disturb Sign) at 11am despite I had the checkout at 4pm. I should've deadlocked the door but still, with the hotel thats 5*? This should not be happened here and I have called frontdesk in regards to this issue prior to check out and they just said \"We will follow up on it, then hung up, seems like they were in a hurry). I have still not hear a word back as of now.

After a full day of exhaustive sightseeing, thumping music, horn-honking and drunken fights kept us up until 2AM!!

We were escorted to the front desk where we were quickly checked in. The man who helped us told us we would get connecting rooms since we had reserved 2 rooms. Additionally, one room had been upgraded to an Executive Premier room (a corner room). I couldn't wait to see the corner room. After check-in we were escorted to the elevators. Our rooms were located on the 9th floor. The first (smaller) room had 2 queen beds and had views of the Yerba Buena Gardens, Metreon, St. Patrick's Church, and the city. The materials, detail, and quality of the room was amazing. The decor is very modern, warm, and relaxing. The wall against the beds are lined with stitched leather panels, the wall/cabinet doors opposite the beds are made from Mozambique wood, and natural stone is used throughout the bathroom. The best feature of the bathroom is the rain shower. I could take a shower all day long. The second room, the corner room (Executive Premier room), was about 20% larger and had a king bed instead. The room had the same design theme and materials as the first room. The bathroom layout was about the same with the exception of it being just a little bit smaller. The view from the room was also the same as our first room with the exception of the corner that had floor to ceiling glass windows with breathtaking panoramic views of the Yerba Buena Gardens and the surrounding area.

We live in the East Bay, but have only been in the area for a year and have yet to see the sights. So we chose this weekend to catch Jim Gaffigan's performance and visit Alcatraz. We checked in about 6pm. The people at the front desk were very nice, and we were escorted to our room by one of the men who works there. He smiled the whole time, and was a bit pushy when it came to carrying our bags. He would not take my husband's no as an answer. Once at our room, he showed us the electronic system they have set up, and finally left. I'm the kind of person who likes to be left alone to figure things out for myself, so I didn't really enjoy this part of the hotel stay. The hotel room was beautiful. They have a deep soaking bathtub that can fit 2 people in it. The bathtub has doors next to it that open into the bedroom. This was kind of cool. There's also a t.v. in the bathroom. The only drawback about the bathroom was that the toilet and shower were cornered into their own little room, but the door that slides to close-off the these things from the rest of the bathroom leaves a little crack, so if I'm in the bedroom and the doors next to the tub are open, I can see my husband using the toilet. This disturbed him to no end, but it is easily solved by closing all of the bathroom doors. Also, on our first night, we decided to run a bath. The water was very dirty, which we deduced was from an incomplete washing of the tub. After we washed it with a facecloth, the tub was fine. Another drawback was the electronic screen that controlled everything. When we used it to turn off all of the lights in the room, we would awake in the middle of the night to lights turning themselves on. So if you do stay here, turn off the lights manually. It's really annoying to wake up multiple times during the night to lights. This happened on both nights of our stay. We ate breakfast at the Vitrine on Saturday. I got the french toast which was very good. My husband got eggs benedict. He didn't like the food, but that's more his fault than theirs. He had never had it before. Overall the service in the restaurant was good, and the food was very good. The only thing I must complain about is the staff's disrespect for privacy. My husband and I have stayed in many hotels, fancy and not. We expect more from hotels that we pay more for, but unfortunately that is where we get the least. This hotel has an electronic \"Do Not Disturb\" and \"Make Up Room\". We value our privacy a lot, so for every hotel we stay at, the \"Do Not Disturb\" goes up as soon as we enter and comes down when we leave (it does not come off any time in between). For all of the other hotels we've stayed in with the exception of The Palace in NYC, our \"Do Not Disturb\" has been honored. However, it was completely disregarded. Before leaving for Alcatraz, I made sure the \"Do Not Disturb\" was on. When we got back a few hours later, it was off and our room had been cleaned. When we approached Ron at the front desk, he apologized \"sincerely\", said he would report the incident, and offered nothing. Once I got tired to the whole thing and left my husband to argue, Ron offered us free breakfast or a reimbursement for the night's stay we would not be using if we chose to leave at that moment. Needless to say, a $50 breakfast is nothing compared to the $580/night I was paying to stay there... ...We had to speak to 3 different people before they would finally offer us a free night (and that only because we had to ask for it). After Ron, we spoke to Craig (the non manager, I don't remember his last name). He spoke to some woman in charge of hospitality and offered us a 50% reduced rate if we stayed. Finally, we spoke to Craig Chang (the front desk manager) who offered us the night for free. He even sent us a hand-written note apologizing for everything, and left a note at the front desk confirming that the night was free. If it had not been for him, this hotel would receive a star of \"1\" and we would never go back. I have not decided if we will ever stay here again. The room was great, and for the most part so was the service. Just make sure if you ever stay here and there is a problem that you ask for Craig Chang ASAP. Some other good things about the hotel is they have a 24 hour pool and 24 hour room service. We unfortunately did not take advantage of either of these things, but it's nice to have them.", "Date": "November 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Palma de Mallorca, Spain", "Title": "\u201cGreat Property & Great restaurant, but service off & $15 for internet\u201d", "Author": "DepDawg", "ReviewID": "UR21650143", "Content": "The St Regis is a good location, directly next to the Moscone convention center and 5 minutes walk from Union Square and all the shopping.

We got a reduced price by redeeming some Starwood points, but it was still expensive. Overpriced, to be more exact. We don't mind paying for true luxury, but this hotel doesn't even come close to that. The St. Regis is full of affectations (like the personal butler) but lacking in real amenities or value. We had a corner room on the 13th floor with a nice view of the Metreon and the Marriott (which looks like a better possibility for our next stay). The coolness factor of the touch screen bedside device soon grows tiresome. For example, the drapes can only be manipulated electronically and it is \"all or none\". Either they are all open or none can be opened. Given the nature of the corner rooms that means that if you want a view of the city, your \"neighbors\" in the next room automatically get a view of you. The bathrooms are very small and poorly equipped. Hard to believe that a supposed 5-star establishment doesn't even provide a shower cap. (they will draw a $1500 bath for you though, in a tub that is barely big enough for one tall person and scratched up). Our room even had a small hole near the ceiling where the pocket door seals off the toilet and shower from the rest of the bathroom. The only mirror in the room was in the bathroom above the single sink. Again, not our definition of luxury. I had to go into the entry way to do my hair, where there was a mirror and console table. As others have noted, they did contact us by email about our stay. To honor our anniversary they sent up a nice bottle of $7.99 sparkling wine. While it was a nice touch, it is hard to know if we should have been flattered or insulted.:) We did appreciate having the wine bucket though. We walked a block down to Walgreens where we could actually acquire enough ice to chill a bottle, and consumed some very nice sparkling that we purchased outside of the hotel for a Real Person's Price. With no coffee faciilities in the room, or down in the lobby, we were grateful that Peets Coffee is just across the street. For $$$$ a night the hotel could really provide at least a single-serving pod machine in the rooms. It would be way more useful than the tiny stereo system, or even the DVD player. Those are redundant given that most people travel with their IPod and/or buy movies on the TV if so inclined. (or in this case, walk across the street to the Metreon to see a movie). Finally, we came to the city to relax. Hard to do given that except for the bed there was no comfortable place to sit. The desk had two straight-back wooden chairs that were a testimony to form over function. I don't believe I have ever sat in anything more uncomfortable. I do believe that housekeeping does a nice job, and the staff is certainly trained to be friendly. We travel extensively here and abroad, and stay in a wide variety of establishments. The St. Regis would be at the very bottom of our list compared to other places in this price range. You can get a much better value at several other properties in the city. We chose the St. Regis because of the good reviews on Tripadvisor, and it was the only places that had availability. Now we know why the latter was true. SOMA is a great location and we will definitely make it our destination on every city trip. We will however not return to the St. Regis. They have a lot to learn about blending trend with function.

The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art is next door. Union Square, Market St. and the Ferry Building/Farmer's Market are within walking distance. The hotel deserves high praise for its location, design, style, technology, amenities and especially its service. The St. Regis and Luxury Collection are the Starwood group's high end chains. Having stayed 3 times at the wonderful St. Regis New York and having visited the St. Regis Monarch Beach CA and Washington DC, I was looking forward to my stay here, and at a convention group rate to boot. The hotel is about 2 years old and located on the corner of Mission and 3rd. Directly on the corner, the facade of a historic 8 story building was preserved and a high rise tower was integrated behind, beside and above it, on what once was a parking lot. The hotel occupies the first 20 floors of the tower; the top 20 or so floors are St. Regis residences. Within the older building are the hotel's 2 restaurants--Ame (dinner) on the first floor and Vitrine (breakfast and lunch) on the 4th--as well as the 2 level spa and offices. There is a landscaped terrace on the roof and another larger terrace on the 4th floor which was tented for an outdoor dinner party when I was there. The lobby in the newer building is compact but stylish and well-designed. A design feature of rose petals is echoed throughout the public areas. Our convention rate was for the superior room category on the lower floors (5-8), so I was pleasantly surprised when I was upgraded to a deluxe room--same size but on a higher floor (15). I also was able to check in early. My room looked similar to the photos posted on 1/1/06 by a TripAdvisor member from Sunnyvale CA. My room faced west with a view of Yerba Buena Gardens, Moscone and points beyond. The east facing rooms face the Bay, but several employees told me the views are often obstructed by the high rise office buildings of the Financial District. The room itself was not too large but contemporary and sleek. The entry foyer had a table, wooden floor sculpture and leather walls. There was another wood wall hanging in the bedroom. The bedside table held the St. Regis signature phone/computer that can control the thermostat, lights, window shades, alarm clock, etc. via a touch screen. There were 2 desk chairs and an easy chair, but no chaise lounge or \"fainting chair\" as seen on the hotel web site. There was a large marble window ledge--great for counter space. One wall held the 42\" flat screen TV (which did not swivel) and 3 recessed doors--one was a too small closet (only about 2 feet of space), another held a safe, fax machine (out of ink) and 3 drawers, the third held the minibar and fridge and DVD/CD player. The spacious bath had an enclosed WC, a tub that opened onto the bedroom, a separate shower stall with marble bench, rain head plus hand-held head. There was a 2nd flat screen TV, but only one sink. In the room and bath, there were not enough places to hang clothes or towels. Technological glitches included: 2 remotes did not work but were quickly repaired (batteries?). With the phone/computer, the party I was speaking to occasionally could not hear me, though I could hear them. The hotel turned this glitch into an example of great service when I requested a wake-up call and the operator called twice but could not hear me, so she sent someone up immediately to give me a personal wake up call at the door. Alas, the phone still was acting up on check out day. Overall service was top notch--quick, courteous and professional--especially the front desk and housekeeping. The problem of a constantly barking dog in the next room was handled well and with many apologies. The doormen were not so attentive--often talking with the valets. No one helped me when I walked up with my luggage when first checking in. Some of the concierge staff, while helpful, were a bit aloof. I believe all the St. Regis' offer Butler Service. In New York this is quite formal, but seems less so here. One Butler I spoke to on the phone was rather unprofessional--when she couldn't answer my question, she yelled/asked another employee without putting me on hold, so I could hear every thing. The public facilities include a medium sized fitness center open 24 hours with the friendliest staff, and a wonderful indoor infinity lap pool, also open 24 hours. The whirlpool, steam room and sauna are within the spa--all are on the small side. The \"Business Center\" consists of 2 computers and one printer squeezed into a 3rd floor alcove by the elevators. This may be a temporary location. Regarding the sound of sirens mentioned in other reviews--yes you can hear them, but I imagine the other nearby hotels--W, Four Seasons, Westin, Marriott--can as well. I have stayed at a few other high-end hotels here--the Ritz Carlton, Campton Place, the Palace. I would like to one day try the Four Seasons and the Mandarin Oriental, but for now the St. Regis is my favourite San Francisco hotel.", "Date": "October 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scottsdale, AZ", "Title": "\u201cTasteful, Modern Luxury at the St. Regis\u201d", "Author": "Mpmark", "ReviewID": "UR10055188", "Content": "The St. Regis San Fran is a beautiful high-rise property in a great location in one of my favorite cities.

The bathroom was spacious and the shower featured a rainfall shower head and a seating area in the shower along with a separate bath area. The concierge was helpful along with the front desk. Everyone was very courteous and service was excellent. Only blemish would be the lady who came by to fluff our bed. She ignored our do not disturb light and walked right in. I suppose that getting a bed fluffed might be important to some people but it was rather a nuisance to have someone just barge in. The restaurant below, Ame, is _ok_ but not as good as some reviews would have it. The staff there was also excellent and helpful although our waiter disappeared for long periods of time to talk ot 2 (single?) females eating together. He seemed to enjoy talking to them quite a bit which deterred from the otherwise great service. The elevators are quick and we only had to share it once with one other couple. They are well timed and calibrated so you barely notice the acceleration and deceleration of the elevator. The indoor pool, outdoor lounge area, indoor lounge area and the fitness center are top notch although the indoor pool can be a bit tricky to find. That may have been the reason why it was empty when we went which was a boon for us. Parking is valet only and internet is not free. There is supposedly a business center but we never could find it. But for all this there is a price to be paid. At the original price of $800 / night for our room, it would be very hard to justify staying there. I'm sure you can get cheaper rates than that as the price may have been inflated due to the All Star game.

Check-in went smooth. The views from my corner room were exceptional. Hotel was in a good location. Overall my experience was rather enjoyable and I discuss the room, restaurant and spa in detail below but the Noise level alone might keep me from returning to this hotel in the future. As others have discussed the fire station is located just a few blocks down from the hotel. I am not sure if it has to do with the fact that my room was located on the corner facing the street and that the windows were floor to ceiling but the noise level from the fire engines, police cars and ambulances is unbelievably loud. And the problem is that it is rather frequent and at all hours of the night. All I can say is that I hope they put in better sound proofing for the residences because if I had to listen to these loud noises in my home I would go crazy. Since we got that out of the way I will give you more detailed info about the specifics of the hotel. The Room: The bathroom was of average size with a nice shower and an individual size tub. I found the closest to be a bit small. I was the only using the closest but I imagine that it would be rather cramped for two people. The Plasma was a nice touch but was a bit small given the distance from the bed. The bed was very comfortable. The Maid service was great every time I stepped out I returned to a clean room. The control panel was a nice touch and very easy to use. The black out shades kept the room nice and dark all the way into the morning hours of sunshine. I like the complimentary water bottles they provide every time they clean the room. The internet was a bit pricey ($15/day) but I did like the wireless aspect. The Restaurant: I ate at AME one night and had a great experience. Although it was expensive the service was great and I had some of the best seared albacore I have ever had in my life. The menu is a bit exotic so if you are more conservative you might struggle to find something you enjoy. The Spa: I went to the spa for a 60 minute massage. I found the Men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s locker room to be a bit small and did not like that fact that there was nowhere to sit. You have to leave the locker room and take an elevator down to the waiting area, which is very small and underwhelming. The steam room had an odd smell. The sauna was adequate. The massage was one of the worst I have ever had. I feel that the masseuse did not really listen to my needs and her technique was just odd. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe it is my responsibility to have to tell the masseuse how to do her job. The bottom line with the spa was that it was expensive and I went there out of convenience but in the future I would probably make the trip to another spa as there are many nice spas in the city and most of them are less expensive. Should mention that a friend of mine (woman) had a massage and enjoyed it so maybe my experience was not the norm. Conclusion: So there was good and bad. I guess the moral of the story is stay here if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care about value and you own some ear plugs then this could be the right choice for you.", "Date": "September 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "shreveport", "Title": "\u201cunforgettable\u201d", "Author": "cel007", "ReviewID": "UR8656264", "Content": "what a wonderful hotel we chose to stay in during our trip to San Francisco.

The design in both the rooms and lobby is so restrained that it has no discernable style other than \"modern\". It comes across as cold.

A few small splashes of color, a plant, or flowers would go a long way to making these rooms special and giving them some warmth. The lobby and lobby bar also have a cold vibe.

Because of my job I don't often have time to do any research for restaurants to go to when travelling. I rely a lot of the time on the advice from the concierge where I'm staying. In the past I've never had an issue. But the concierge staff at the St. Regis needs a major overhaul. It was some of the worst service I've ever had. And that it was in a St. Regis is very surprising. The room was nice and clean. The rain shower was divine. The LCD screen by the bedside didn't always work. When selecting certain lights to go off, they wouldn't work - so we had to unplug lamps. Too bad the windows don't open and the AC blower isn't so strong. For the full story - keep reading. Otherwise, that's about it. FULL STORY: When we checked in, I asked the concierge for a restaurant where we could get Halibut. And maybe something with pasta. He sent us to a place called Rose Pistola in North Beach. When we got our menus we noticed there was no Halibut on it. That was irritating. We asked for a restaurant with Halibut and he sent us to a place WITHOUT it. Very strange. The only other item on the menu that looked decent was the Risotto. They were out of it. By that point it was nearly 9 PM - our choices were to eat there or go back and order over-priced room service. We asked our waitress if the chef would make us \"Aglio e Olio\" (an italian staple). He did, but it wasn't very good. In fact, we didn't see any garlic in it at all. The atmosphere in the restaurant was similar to an Applebees and the food wasn't much better. It was not authentic Italian. When we got back to the hotel I called to speak with the Concierge to inform him that he'd really let us down. He'd left for the day so I told the person who answered the phone. The man said the concierge would call us at 8:30 AM so I could tell him what kind of lousy dinner we had. No call from the concierge the next morning. The least he could've done was apologize. So I called him. That day (Monday) there was a new concierge working. I asked him to find us a place for lunch that served Caprese (that typical italian buffalo mozzarella and tomato salad). He gave us his favorite place, Scala's - and another one down the street. On our way to lunch we walked to a chocolatier given to us by Concierge Number 1 when we asked for a place to buy truffles. We said we wanted the best truffles - but NOT Joseph Schmidtt truffles. Well... We arrived at the address and noticed it was a candy store. They had chocolate items, yes, but none of them were truffles. Not a single one. We then walked all the way to the restaurant for lunch and noticed there was no Caprese on their menu. At this point it was like a running joke. Now Concierge Number 2 had failed. After running a Wild Goose Chase due to unaware and incompetant concierges we decided to just go back and look up Fodor's and Conde Nast online. Though Concierge Number 2 had booked us a place for dinner that evening, I didn't want to risk it. Doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results is insanity! It was our last night in the city and we were determined to find a good restaurant in San Francisco. Within 10 minutes online we'd found the best rated place in the city that was open on a Monday night (Jardiniere) and booked a table. Back in our room, Jeremy the Front Desk Manager sent his apologies and some wine and cheese. It was a very thoughtful note. Simply the mere mention was nice. Neither of the Concierges apologized. I got the feeling they don't like to admit fault. The trouble is = the database used by the concierge staff is not good. They need to compare that to Fodors and Zagats. Rose Pistola got 2 stars (out of five). That would've been nice to know. Had I known that, we'd have never gone there. Halibut or not. The other problem is they think about their personal tastes... Never once considering the tastes of their clients. They also need to ask better questions. Simply typing in the word \"chocolate\" into their database isn't going to bring up the best truffles in the city. Obviously it's my fault I relied on the concierges. But as a filmmaker, I don't often have time and in the past it's always been a great experience to rely on concierge wisdom. I shall think twice about returning to a St. Regis.

But there are some areas that can need improvements. But first lets get to the positives. full disclosure: we got upgraded from deluxe corner room to metropolitian suite due to SPG Platinum status. Postives: the suites are very large with two flat screen tv and 1 small tv in the bathroom. the bathroom amentities are probably the best I've seen among the luxury hotel chains. everything in the room is controlled by electronic key pad (windows, lights, alarm, do not distrub sign, etc). The property is new so you will have updated modern decor and new furniture. The bathrooms are huge! Almost 1/3 the size of the room itself. Everything was clean and housekeeping came twice a day. it seems like they know when we're leaving and when we're in the room. Turndown service always included bottle water. There was not a morning when they forgot to bring my Wall Street Journal and my requested US Today (you'll be surprised how often hotels forget or don't care). Towels are soft and constantly refreshed and well stocked. Wireless internet in the room! The doorman, bellman, and parking attendants are very nice and knowledgable. This property is walking distance from the shops at Union Square and the SF Moma (but very far from Fisherman Wharf, the piers, Golden Gate Bridge). The decor is very modern, clean, and intricate. They definitely spent alot building and decoring the entire hotel. The pool is open 24 hrs (no lifeguard). The pool is very clean and nice. It is also ideal for swimming laps. The valet service was FAST and front desk always personally called for our morning \"wake up call\" (not a machine). Cons: No ice machine. Unfortunately you have to call to have ice delivered to the rooms. Sometimes its just easier to walk down the hall to get it youself. The shower did not have a curtain or door, so you end up splashing water everywhere. My wife complained that it took her forever to wash her hair b/c of the \"rain showers\". Since the showers did not have doors or curtains, the whole bathroom fogs up, preventing you from using the mirrors afterwards. Most upscale luxury hotels have doors where the toilets are, this one did not. May be inconvient when you're sharing the bathroom with someone else or would prefer more privacy. I like the open feel but not in this area! Internet still cost additional $15 when you are already paying $800+ per night (whereas internet at low end properties like Hilton Garden Inns are usually free).. a bit backwards. Overnight parking for guests is $51. This is the highest I've ever paid for overnight parking at a hotel. The butler service that comes complimentary wwith the room is a bit annoying. She went through the entire routine of showing us where every single thing is down to the light switch and how to plug in your ipod in the dvd player. Wasted about 15min of our time when we arrive in our room. The hotel needs to realize when guests arrive to their rooms, they just want to relax and not be bothered. Breakfast was insanely expensive ($5 for OJ and $16 for Pancakes... before tax, tip, and service charge). I'm sorry... but no plain pancakes are worth $16. The house car (Bentley) was always out or busy, so we did not get to use it at all despite asking every single day for 3 nights. One night we lucked out and it was available but the driver said they are restricted to a 2 mile radius around the hotel (so its pretty much useless in my opinion). Not sure if that was true or if he just didnt want to do his job. The rooms did not have and ironing board, iron, or coffee machine (maybe ppl that pay $800+ a night do not iron their own clothes or make their own coffee?). Tips: get a room a few floors above 8th floor. We can hear the cars at night below (sirens, police cars, car engines, etc). Walk down the block for Starbucks or Peets Coffee for morning fix. Overrall: You DO get what you pay for. The property is very luxurious and the service perfect. But since everything is so expensive, it really leaves no room for error. Perfection should be expected.

The walk-in separate shower had a limestone bench and a rainfall spout on the ceiling. Though there was only one sink, the vanity was large and well-stocked. My girlfriend had a massage at the Remede spa. She said the facilities were very sleek--maybe too sleek--and that the service was impeccable. We had breakfast delivered to our room--it came RIGHT on time and was piping hot. The food was served on very attractive Vera Wang china. The service was extremely responsive and friendly. There is a beautiful infinity edge lap pool next to the spa, with many a comfortable place to sit. The gym is quite nicely outfitted and extremely clean. We made use of the complimentary car service--they seem to use a new Bentley--which was quite convenient and a nice touch. All in all, this was a truly comfortable hotel. With all the amenities, you might even call it an urban resort. Whether you are looking for a spot to enjoy a weekend getaway or for a convenient, luxurious business hotel, the St Regis delivers.", "Date": "February 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "La Canada Flintridge, CA", "Title": "\u201cGood Contemporary Design\u201d", "Author": "mike-lcf", "ReviewID": "UR6164289", "Content": "I stayed at the St. Regis for several days in mid-November based on the recommendations of some colleagues who travel to SF frequently and told me about this new hotel that opened this year. My usual place is the W, which I stay at about 2 times a month, which is just down the block. Positives: The hotel's lobby area is excellent. The design is contemporary but warm, and makes you want to congregate. I would rate the overall friendliness of the staff as generally good, though not overly exceptional for this type of hotel. The reception area did tend to get backed up and did not seem properly staffed. The hallway decor and color scheme is nicely done. I was happy with the size of my room, on the 18th floor. A control panel controls the drapes, which is something I just saw last month at the Royal Riga in NY. No problem connecting to the WiFi signal in the room. Rain showerhead in the shower is a nice touch. The lighting seems about right. The desk is generously sized and a good work space for business travelers; the desk chair is also very comfortable. Negatives: The quality of the room service food was simply horrible. I ordered the chicken caesar salad, which is something that should not be difficult to prepare. The chicken was terrible -- dry, hard and tasted like it had been sitting out for hours. I was so offended by my dinner I walked around the block to a nearby Chipotle and bought a burrito. The closet space is also very small -- and there is little shelf space for clothes. No coffee in the room, nor is any offered in the lobby. Also, although there is a nice 50\" HDTV flat screen in the room, it does not get any HD channels, which was perplexing. Finally, the speakerphone on the control panel does not work well -- I usually had to pick up the handset to talk.", "Date": "November 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cContemporary St Regis in San Francisco\u201d", "Author": "PauloAmore", "ReviewID": "UR6152528", "Content": "I booked the St Regis at short notice on an unexpected lay over in San Francisco direct with the hotel.

I have to say that at first we were disappointed and said we would go back to the Four Seasons or the Ritz. Some of the reasons were we were told that like the St Regis NY there was butler service. We were at the St Regis NY and loved the service we received from our butler. In San Francisco there was no offer to press clothes and no morning or afternoon butler service for coffee or tea. When I asked about it at first we were told it was through room service only. Then we were offered a coffee maker with starbucks which we took. It seems that there are 8 butlers on staff in SF compared to 62 in NYC. I do not consider there to really be butler service here. I have read several reviews concerning noise at this hotel I agree that there is an issue with a fire station down the street and when they blast their sirens it is loud even on the 19th floor where we were. But this is city hotel and street noise in SF as in NYC is to be expected. What we loved was the corner floor to ceiling windows in the room we had. It only had one sink in the bathroom but the soaking tub, shower and flat screen were nice. The hotel car was a new Bentley and they took us to dinner each night. The concierge was friendly but gave some inaccurate info on time and distances. The breakfast was good but expensive. The excercise room was well equipped but the Remede spa would not give you a locker if you did not have a treatment.

The hotel is a very short walk to Moscone Center, next door to the MOMA, and just steps from designer shops and many restaurants. An excellent location, and although guests can hear the sirens from the streets below, I'm not sure what any inner city hotel could do to avoid all such noises. I was lucky to get a corner room which had large windows fully across two walls. The room design and decor were beautiful and delivered a \"zen like\" aura....very calming. I used the large bath tub every day, but also loved the rain shower. I found the room commander screen complimented the hotel's contemporary design, easy to use and state of the art. Several reviews on this site have mentioned the screen was too bright, but they must not have seen the option to dim the panel which fully reduced the light for sleeping. The comfort of the bed was superior, both mattress and linens. My flat screen was positioned directly in front of the bed, and it was very easy to navigate the programming. I found the lobby to be quite intimate and loved the fire wall near the cocktail area. I enjoyed sitting on the sofas, sipping a glass of wine, warming by the fire and watching all of the activity in the lobby.

It seems inconceivable that when the hotel was built no-one appreciated how noisy the fire engines that go past at least every half an hour are and soundproofed accordingly. All cities are loud, but this was the one thing that could really have improved our stay. Actually, I lie. Two things, the other being that in our room there was a huge shower stall but no bath. The bathroom was easily big enough to take a spacious tub (the toilet alone had enough space to do backflips in) yet they had decided to forego one. I find this mystifying in such a beautifully appointed hotel. I am aware that other rooms in the hotel have baths, but we were not told this at the time of arrival and I laboured under this misapprehension until I got home and checked their website. Had I known, I would have asked to be moved to a room with a tub. Also, putting the TV in the bathroom above the sink is a nice touch, but pretty useless, given that most of the time when you're using the sink you're doing something else. I can only hope that they had the foresight to put it above the bathtub ( in the rooms lucky enough to have one). But minor gripes aside, it is a lovely hotel. That it is fairly new shows in the furnishings, which are still sleek and polished looking. The beds were hugely comfortable with sumptous linens and piles of cushions, and the chaise is a nice touch for relaxing and reading on. So many hotel rooms offer only a desk chair for somewhere to sit and read, so this was very much appreciated. We found no problem with the location of the TV, though I was slightly peeved to find you still had to pay for movies. Some other St Regis properties, notably the Lanesborough in London, don't charge for this service, and given the price you pay for a noisy room, little luxuries like this are notable by their absence. The touch-screen panel by the bed is a nifty little device but awkward as hell to reach and use in the middle of the night without your glasses when all you want is a bedside light to read by. I really wouldn't have complained about a switch by the bed! It also gives off a powerful glow, and as one accustomed to sleeping in complete darkness, I ended up turning it face down, thus rendering its usefullness pretty redundant. The honor bar is nicely stocked and reasonably priced, and the room service was quick and efficient when we used it. The pool is beautiful, but more of a gesture than anything else, as it's impossible to imagine people toiling up and down it -more suitable for a relaxing dip than anything else. We didn't eat in the restaurant, but heard nothing but good things about it, and the cosy bar in the lobby seemed to be a big hit with the guests and regulars. The hotel itself is in a great location for seeing the city without being in the downtown crush. The staff were thoroughly polite and charming, and the maid service extremely efficient. So to recap, it's a wonderful hotel, but I wouldn't stay there again simply due to the invasive amounts of street noise.", "Date": "October 16, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Redwood City, CA", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyable stay, wish I had more time...\u201d", "Author": "kht2006", "ReviewID": "UR5913640", "Content": "My husband and I spent one night (Saturday) in Sept 2006 as a mini-getaway without our toddler. We live in the SF Bay Area. We arrived a little before check-in time and was told our room was not ready. They offered to store our rollerboard, took our cell phone number and would call us when our room was ready. Check-in was fairly quick and easy. My parents were going to take my toddler home with them for the night. I took my daughter to the restroom in the lobby area to change her diaper. There was absolutely no place to do it. When I returned to the front desk to ask where I might be able to change her, I was told that our room was ready and that someone would take us up. I liked how your need to pass reception to access the elevators - always nice in busy city hotels. As others have described, a \"butler\" escorts you to your room and explains the room to you - in particular, how to use the computer touch pad by your bedside to control practically everything in the room. Mu husband had to remind the hotel about the champagne that he had pre-arranged. We expected it to be waiting for us when we arrived. However, it did appear that the hotel was ready for us b/c the champagne and chocolates showed up less than 2 minutes after my husband reminded them. The room is clean and spacious for a city hotel room. We were on the 18th floor facing the street (not the alley). I agree with the person who noted that the tv was not mounted in an ideal place on the wall for viewing from the bed. Also, it's an expensive high-definition tv but the hotel receives none of the HD TV stations in the area. Unfortunate waste of money. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom only has one sink, but that was not a big deal for one night. The bath amenities are generous - large bottles of shampoo, conditioner, bath gel and lotion from the hotel's Remede Spa. TV in the bathroom a nice touch. The movable wall between the spa tub and room opens the room up. The shower is large with both a \"rain\" shower head and your traditional shower heads. The decor is clean, modern with great stylish small touches. The closet is on the small side, but sufficient for the business traveler or people not staying long. The room had your usuals - slippers, bathrobe, umbrella, safe. Nice selection for the in-room bar and snacks. You also get your own fax. Breakfast was included for us. We ate in the restaurant. Not a large restaurant and we had to wait a few minutes for a table. We were directed to the coffee available at the restaurant entrance, but they were out of coffee so we stepped out onto the outdoor terrace for a looksy. When we returned a minute later, the coffee, table, cups, everything!, was gone. Odd. We went back out and someone came to get us a couple minutes later. The pool looked amazing - wish I had time to partake. The locker room was nice too - clean and had salon products. The lobby bar area looked cozy - did not have time to enjoy. The gym had a ample variety of equipment. As another reviewer recommended - there's plenty of Evian at the gym for you to take! Overall nice experience. People remembered our name and greeted us throughout our stay. Friendly staff. Our past hotel experiences include the Four Seasons, the Peninsula, the W Hotel, Hiltons, Marriotts, Hyatts.

If they can make a Bloody Mary, they can make coffee. My other complaint is the lobby bar which \"misses\" somehow. This bar is a big vacuous room, lacking warmth and congeniality.

They refer to you by name, and to me, though not essential, is always impressive. If you like old world decor, this is probably not the place for you. The decor is very modern, with a Zen quality; light, simple lines, fresh, natural, peaceful. The bathrooms are luxurious, and bedrooms, though not huge, are spacious and comfortable. The beds are comfortable and fabrics rich. The most impressive thing (though when you first arrive it seems austere and cold), the staff is warm and attentive, and the Hotel's attention to subtle details, creats an intimate hotel experience, much different than what you get from the large, impersonal business hotels.
