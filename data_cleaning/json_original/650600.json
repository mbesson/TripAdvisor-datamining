I find it at a very confortable place in Rome: 20 min by walking to Vatican, 2-5 min. to closest metro station \"Lepanto\". When leaving you have to pay 2 EUR per day for kind of voluntary city fee. Smokers are alowed to smoke only outdoors, there is one ashtry per hotel :). Breakfast included that means very poor continental, but have in mind I'm not complaining the location is wonderful and the rest fakes away. Very clouse there are food, clothes shops.", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Helsinki, Finland", "Title": "\u201cA nice place to stay for a good price\u201d", "Author": "kyllikkielina", "ReviewID": "UR123102655", "Content": "It was the 8th time that our group of friends (this year 39 persons) spent Epiphany time in Rome staying at Casa Valdese, Via Alessandro Farnese 18 (Prati).

But anyone interested in--or placed in--the (admittedly inexpensive) \"external rooms\" should know that they are dramatically different from the main hotel rooms shown on the web. They are in a garage-type building, and are minute. Their one window \"looks out\" onto a driveway filled with cars and surrounded by an solid fence. Their floors are very aged linoleum (there's no carpet), and there were ants during my stay. The shower consists of a showerhead hung over one end of the tiny bathroom, with a drain beneath--there's no barrier between this end of the bathroom and the rest of the bathroom, so water floods the floor. There's also nowhere to put soap or shampoo while using the shower, except the top of the wastebasket--you get the idea. You'll save money, but beware these very depressing rooms--spend more and stay in the main building!", "Date": "January 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stockholm, Sweden", "Title": "\u201cA very nice experience\u201d", "Author": "A swedish family", "ReviewID": "UR34516399", "Content": "Stayed one night in July and thougt the stay very pleasent. We had a comftable triple with a private large balcony to sit on in the shade spying on the quiet neighburhod below. The booking worked out fine and they had the recipt for this advanced payment already prepared on your bill, this felt very professional and safe. The rooms have AC and this one was just about ok in the heat. Beds were comftable and the bathrom had a nice shower with lots of space, I lacked one shelf to put the soap and shampoo on but this is of course a minor thing. They have a great roof top garden with a very nice view of Rome. Here you can have a glass of wine or beer. They have a very nice system for your drinks, you simply take what you want out of the large fridge in the dining room and sign the item on the room list beside the fridge. How great to have a system like that and that people seem to respect this service and thus sign what they take. A large cold beer comes at 2,5 Euros, imagine having that beer on the roof top and you have an experience worth a lot more than that. Breakfast was fine with a very friendly lady helping you to use the espresso machine. Reception could answer sightseeing questions and did not hesitate to check opening times on the internet to make sure yoy did not go to a place beeing closed. The subway is a couple of minutes away and you can also walk to the Vatican and other places from this perfectly situated hotel (compared to price). We had a car and could park it almost outside the hotel, we had to park on the blue line and thus had to pay 1 Euro an hour until 2000 Hrs. If you get the withe lines maring your parking it will be free. The area felt very safe both to walk and park in. If Rome comes on the travel list again I will certainly pick this hotel.", "Date": "July 12, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Casa Valdese", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d650600-Reviews-Casa_Valdese-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$99 - $459*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Alessandro Farnese 18</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00192</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "650600", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/2f/8b/bd/esterno.jpg"}}
