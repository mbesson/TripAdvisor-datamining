Wow, this was a fantastic hotel. We checked in very late. The woman on duty was fantastic (quick painless chech in). The outside of the hotel and the lobby were beautiful. This hotel has to be rather new...very clean. The best rate I saw on-line for the particular night we stayed would have be a AAA rate fro around $169.00...but I got it for free (excellent hotel to use points on)...a lot of points go a long way here. The room was beautifully decorated (for some reason, we got the handicapped suite (which was fine and very spacious. The room had two Queen sized beds, couch, chair desk, and a nice flat screen tv. Very clean. Well, the reason I picked this hotel was because the pool area looked pretty good in the Trip Advisor photos (wanted a cheap, nice hotel...knew we'd be coming in very late and wanted to swim a little in the morning). It seemed to have a little extra with the whale tail and penguins that sprayed in the pool....was cute and my daughter loved it. The pool area was very nice and clean. Water was warm. The pool area seemed to be shared with another Marriott that was located right next door. The free breakfast was okay (nothing spectacluar). However, the hotel was over-run with high school students on an over-night trip...no noise from them the night before, but they took over the entrie lobby during breakfast. That wasn't even too bad.

Chose this hotel from its great reviews and were not disappointed. On arrival we were asked if we wanted a high or low floor. We also asked (if possible) could we have a view of Seaworld. Our room was great - on the 5th floor with the best view of the Kraken at Seaworld. Beds comfy - cleaned every day, separate toilet from bathroom ( no bath). Excellent breakfast included. Free shuttle bus to Seaworld and Aquatica and also free Quick Queue passes every day to Seaworld. Staff very helpful and friendly. Food served at the pool which was good and included Pizza Hut pizzas. All food could be taken back to your room if preferred. We had a car which was very handy - to get to Busch Gardens, Kennedy Space Centre and Universal. Parking is approx $14 a day at all the parks. Parking is free at the space centre. I would definitely recommend this hotel and if we return to Orlando would stay here again. Discovery Cove was the hi light of our holiday followed by the Serengeti Safari at Busch Gardens. It's a very hectic holiday - the first time we've ever had to set the alarm to get up on holiday - just that we didn't want to miss out on anything. The only minor (and I mean minor) disadvantage is that there are not many restaurants within walking distance to choose from. There is a great TGI Fridays which we ate at several times. As we had a car we used to eat on the way home from the parks or in the parks - so this was never a problem. If you don' t have a car the I Ride stop is by the hotel which you can get to travel up International Drive. Seaworld and Aquatica are minutes away.

My family has stayed at many Marriot properties, and I have to say this is one of the best I have been to! The hotel has a sort of sea theme to it (which makes sense since it's right by Seaworld). The lobby was nice and spacious, there was plenty of seating for the free breakfast in the morning. There was also an internet cafe, concierge desk, and it even had it's own Starbucks! The front desk was very welcoming (make sure to grab some Chupa Chup lollipops in the bowl by the desk by the way, they're good!). The room itself I thought was very nice. It also had a sea theme to it (lots of blues and greens). When you walked in, there was a sitting area with a couch that made out to a bed, as well as a small fridge and microwave off to the side. A desk and some frosted glass separated this area from the two beds on the other side. The other part of the room included the two beds, a dresser, flat screen tv, spacious closet, and two bathrooms! Although the two bathrooms weren't both full bathrooms (one was larger and had a shower and large vanity, the other was smaller and just included a toilet and small vanity) I thought it was great. Both bathrooms were separated by a sliding frosted glass door as well. It made it easier in the mornings to get ready with two bathrooms since we had three people staying in the room. Free breakfast was great in the mornings! There were lots of pastries, breads, fruit, scrambled eggs, bacon sometimes, and cereals. They had waffle makers, and even this quaker machine that made oatmeal. It was all the typical breakfast-y types of stuff, and I really couldn't say anything bad about it. They had a pool area that we never visited, but it seemed good! There was a bar there I believe where you could get snacks and drinks. I'm sure younger kids and adults would both enjoy this. I don't think we had any problems with the service. Everyone who worked there that we talked to seemed kind and friendly. The maids were outstanding! The rooms were always nice and clean, and we always got the extra towels we needed. One day our maid even made us a towel swan! The only thing I can sort of complain about in that area is that we went back to our room one day around 4:00 and the maid was still in the room cleaning, but I do understand that they have many rooms to clean in such a short amount of time, and it was really no big deal. Also, the drive for us to Disney was not bad at all. It really only took a good 5-10 minutes to actually get to the parks, so don't put this hotel out of the running for you just because it's a little farther away. And if you're going to Seaworld, this would be an excellent choice considering how close it really is. If you enjoy staying in the nicer part of Orlando, this is definitely the hotel for you. There was a CVS and TGI Fridays very close to the hotel, so if you need anything or just need somewhere to eat, it is very convenient. My only other complaint about our stay was that the beds were sort of uncomfortable. The pull out bed was apparently very springy, and the other two beds were not comfy in some areas. This wasn't such a big problem, and definitely doesn't affect whether we would come back or not, but I still think it's an issue. All in all, we would stay here again in a heartbeat! It's great that we've found another Marriot hotel to be able to book at when we are in the Orlando area.", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas,Texas", "Title": "\u201cModern Clean Lines Design Hotel\u201d", "Author": "TexasTraveller562", "ReviewID": "UR126946175", "Content": "If you like sleek, clean-lines, modern type of hotel furnishings, then this is the place for you. After staying at four different Marriott properties in the very touristy Orlando area, I have finally found a place that I like. The rooms have a very modern feel, with light blues, greens, and browns. What I thought was especially clever, is that the commode is separate from the shower area. This is very helpful if you are travelling with a spouse or family. Each unit has a roomy closet, microwave, and a semi-separated desk area, separated from the sleeping space by a partion. The word \"suite\" is used a bit liberally, however, as the sitting area is rather small. It is essentially longer than a traditional hotel room, but still one room divided by a smoked glass partition. The pool area is very nice. The property shares a large, kidney shaped pool with its sister property, Fairfield Inn & Suites. There is also a whirlpool and \"tiki-type\" snack bar poolside. The exercise room is also shared, but was always vacant in the evenings. The exercise room was suprisingly crowded in the mornings, however. Breakfast was a little generic from a food perspective (but hey, its free!), and the breakfast area feels a bit crowded. It has an odd layout. The location of the property is very close to the Sea World parks and the hotel offers free transportation to said parks. There are several retail and restaurants very close by and a large Publix grocery store about 1/4 mile away. (There are sidewalks). My (very minor) complaints are that the elevators are slow, and on both my trips, one was always out of order, and the walls are a little bit thin. Of course, when your hotel is in a tourist area, there are alot of kids slamming doors and running down the halls. This happens pretty much anywhere in a resort area. Overall, I would recommend this hotel to business travellers, and families with 4 or fewer in the room. I think it would be a bit crowded for a family with higher numbers.

We were told to take I-4 west when it was actually east. Once we realized that the exit numbers were decreasing we took the first exit we could to turn around which was a huge mistake. It took us miles down the road before an exit was available, conveniently a toll road, to turn around. We called the hotel back and was told that depending how we left the theme park it could've been west. East is east! Once we finally reached the hotel I attempted to check in paying cash. Whenever you use a debit card they will place a 5-10 day hold for incidentals and I wanted to avoid that. I spoke to a clerk the day prior and was told that incidentals were \"complimentary\" which was confusing so I went ahead and took enough cash to cover it just in case. That's when Otis told me that I could not pay cash for the incidentals and they had to have the credit card. I explained to him that I had just left a Fairfield Inn and had no problem putting cash down on the room. He then explained that the Fairfield I stayed in was a franchise and not a real Marriott property, he also stated that they did not keep cash that late at night (11pm). At this point I was in no mood to argue and just wanted to get to my room. After checking in and taking a shower I proceeded to get into bed when I pulled down the sheets and found dirt and hair. I called front desk to inform them of this and was told that there was no one who could change the sheets and I could change rooms. Really had no choice at that point, so I re packed everything to move to a double room from the king I was hoping for. Once again I pull down the sheets to find more hair. Wanting nothing more than to check out and go elsewhere I call the reservation line to find another hotel. It's now after midnight so I would have to pay Friday rates and no guarantee I could check in at that time. So I call back to front desk and ask for new sheets to change the bed myself. After going through the first set because of more hair I finally found cleans ones. At 2 in the morning I'm finally settled into bed. Come 10 am I'm awoken to housekeeping entering my room even though I'm checking out that day. I call down to front desk and they reply that they will let the supervisor know. At this point I'm awake and ready to get out of there, I proceed to ask for the manager at check out when I'm told that she is in a meeting and I could speak to a supervisor, fine. Unfortunately the supervisor is not able to come speak to me and I must go next door to the Fairfield Inn to speak to him there. I explain to him everything that happened and he said he would pass it on, I specifically asked for the manager to call me. After three hours go by I attempt to call her to no avail. I left a voicemail on her direct line and have yet to hear back 4 days later. I'm not seeing the charge on my account so I am assuming they refunded the money but I'm not sure because no one has called or even sent an email recognizing the issues.

Arrived on a Friday evening around 8:30PM. Our check-in went smoothly Our party consisted of 2 parents and 3 sons. Boys all got blow pop suckers in the lobby, so they were good. We had a 2 queen bed room. The room was layed out very economically. It was not extremely wide from the left to the right but was fairly deep from the door to the outside wall. It had a small fridge and microwave. The bathroom set-up with the toilet and a small sink in one room with the tub/shower combo and a large sink area in a separate room was great for us. We found the beds to be very comfortable. The TV was a large, modern HD type. The couch area with the sofa bed was very nice for the kids to have a place to sit and watch the TV. The layout of the room was very functional in that it used the space in a very good manner. There was a decent sized closet. On the far outside wall was a dresser and an area to store luggage. For our 3 day stay, the room was great. There were a few nicks and scratches on some or the furniture. Some guests just don't seem to care how they treat other peoples' stuff. Also, housekeeping was very efficient we left notes for extra towels and had towels coming out of our ears. We did leave a $5 tip each day. That usually helps. The breakfast was well stocked. The scrambled eggs were the real variey as opposed to the powdered type that can be found at some breakfasts. There were several waffle makers. Their pastries and muffins were very good. The employees kept everything well-stocked and clean. It was a very nice breakfast that made getting out the door to the parks very easy. The only comment is that on Saturday and Sunday mornings they did not start serving until 7:00AM. The 6:30AM time that was employed on weekdays worked much better for us on Monday morning because the Disney parks were opening at 8:00AM due to the holiday crowds. Lastly, there were plenty of tables in the seating area. Sometimes it can be a nightmare finding a place to actually eat the breakfast at some hotels. The pool area is shared with the Fairfield Inn & Suites next door. It was very nicely themed. It was not crowded when we were there. A nice sized hot tub was enjoyed by our family on Saturday night. Plenty of parking. This property is located at the bottom of the International Drive hub so the traffic is not too bad. There is a TGIF's restaurant located in front of the lot of this facility and a Wendy's across the street. We were not visiting Sea World but it is located across the street from this hotel. Check-out was a breeze....our bill was left under our door. We paid $135 a night and thought that it was a bargain. We think that this was a wonderful place to stay. It took us a little less than 12 minutes to get to the parking lots of any of the 3 Disney parks that we visited. We usually stay at Disney hotels but refused to pay the ourrageous prices that they wanted for their moderate rooms. Compared to what we received and the amenities that Disney's moderates offered, the Spring Hill Suites were a no-brainer. We did have annual passes to Disney so our parking was not an extra charge.

There may be a logical reason for this, but I'll be jiggered if I can think of it. The rooms are kept clean and well stocked with towels and toiletries and the beds have good quality bedding and are very comfortable. The pool area, like the rest of the hotel, is very modern and clean with a bar which serves drinks and food. Breakfast was OK, but nothing special. There were hot options each morning which consisted of scrambled eggs, with a different meat, and waffles. Lots of cereals, yoghurts, fruits and juices were available. Seating could sometimes be at a premium as there was a school band and conference people there at the same time, but we managed. I do question the use of disposable plates and cutlery as they were poor quality and you tended to end up slicing through your plate when eating. Still, as I pointed out at the time, you don't get many hotels in Orlando that offer a breakfast free of charge. The staff were always on hand to offer a high chair and were always friendly. Reception was helpful to our needs and check in and check out was quick and easy. There is a small shop at reception which sells a few essentials. We also found the laundry handy and managed to wash and dry all our holiday clothes (fourteen days worth) for just a few dollars. I might be tempted to stay here again should we return to Orlando, but this much more pleasant section of I-Drive is getting a bit of development locally and maybe some more hotels may be built which will suit our needs should the teens to be old to travel with us next time, but if you're a family of four+ this hotel will fit your needs without a problem.", "Date": "February 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Farmington Hills, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Stay!\u201d", "Author": "JLK41811", "ReviewID": "UR124539837", "Content": "The hotel is clean, stylish and in excellent proximity to Sea World and Walt Disney World.

The pool was wonderful, especially for young children. There are pool towels available nearby as well as a restroom with a changing station for babies. The only thing I was disappointed in was the hot breaskfast. Yes, it is free which is wonderful but the turkey sausage and eggs left much to be desired for. I opted for cereal, yogurt and fresh fruit that was available. There is also a Starbucks located inside the hotel lobby for coffee lovers. In walking distance across the parking lot is a TGI Fridays and a CVS pharmacy. We dined at Fridays a few times and CVS was wonderful to have so close to pick up any beverages or snacks for our room.

The 14 day trolley pass worked out to be great value as we could travel the length of I Drive and visit both outlet malls and also use it to get to Pointe Orlando for an evening meal.

The restaurant serves excellent Italian fare including pizzas and pasta, all home made including cannolis for dessert. Michael at the Expedia desk in reception was very helpful in reserving places on the shuttle to Universal and also Busch Gardens which leaves from Seaworld and is free if you have tickets which cover both parks, we also spent a day at Aquatica was very close (in fact if there had been a footpath all the way there we would have walked there and back.

From what I understand they have shuttles you can get reservations for to take you to these parks. We only stayed one night, three of us, in a 2-queen room. The toilet is separate (entirely) from the shower, so you have 2 sinks and 2 areas that can be closed off. This is ideal if you're with people you're not comfortable barging in on if they're in the shower and you have to use the restroom. The only complaint I had was that the walls were a little thin so we could hear some of the other people coming/going, and the bathroom doors are loud as they slide. Other than that, it's a well appointed room with everything we needed, including a nice couch which appeared to be set up to be another bed if required. The beds were firm but not too firm, very comfortable overall. The work space was also nice. Breakfast was sufficient - there is a Starbucks Lounge that is open for about 4 hours in the morning. The regular Lounge they state they have was closed while we were there. The pool bar we never tried, but did see some very happy patrons who came from it, and they seemed very pleased. We tried the pool/hot tub in the morning, before check-out, and it was very empty, which was a pleasant surprise. I would assume most folks were probably at SeaWorld already, so if you're not a park goer this might be an ideal spot for you if you want to sun all day.

We requested adjoining, were told it wasn't a guarantee, was thrilled it was available. My parents, my husband & I, our 3.5 year old son and 16 year old nephew were on this trip. If you're able to go to the hotel BEFORE your first day at Seaworld, I would highly recommend it. They will hold your luggage behind the front desk, instead of leaving it in your car if you want. We bought our tickets at our local AAA office, but I think you can buy them at the hotel as well. We got there around 8:00am on Friday, got our Quick Queue passes for the day (they're available in limited quantities). Quick Queues cost $20 per person at Seaworld and allow you to skip the lines on: Manta, Kraken, Wild Artic and Journey to Atlantis; also includes one trip on the paddle boats and the skytower. They print out papers and before you go into Seaworld, you scan them, get cards and on your first ride, you get a wristband for the day. They change the color of the wristbands daily, so it's only good for one day. We did this both days, if we bought them at Seaworld, this would have cost $220 (one day 5 went, the next 6 went). When you get your Quick Queue passes at the hotel, you also get a \"discount\" card for use at Seaworld. We used it at the Underwater Shark Grill and saved 10% on our lunch (saved us $14). It's only good at the more expensive restaurants and I think a gift shop over $50. We parked at the hotel, and were aiming to take the 8:20am shuttle to Seaworld, but didn't make it. The shuttles leave on time, so we waited for the 9:00am shuttle. I think times vary, so call before you go. The shuttles are big (40ish people sitting/standing), we were expecting a minivan type, so were happy to see it wasn't. Took all of 5 mins to get to Seaworld. Seaworld parking is $14 a day or $20 a day for preferred parking, saving us $28. In the evening the last two shuttles were at 5:30 and 7:00 (again check times for your day). The 5:30 was crowded, as the park closed at 6:00pm. We were in our room by 5:45pm. :) We were looking forward to playing in the pool, but it was too cold for our little one. We went down to the pool grill, got pizza hut pizzas and went back to our room to eat. The personal pans were $5 each, there was also wings, pizza hut pasta dishes, garlic bread and grill foods: hot dog, hamburger, chicken sandwich, etc. The food was fast and yummy. That night we noticed TGI Friday's delivered to your room, but it was too late. The hotel was built in 2009, clean, modern design that we loved from the front lobby and breakfast area to the rooms. We've stayed at many Springhill Suites over the years. We really enjoyed the toilet/sink and shower/sink being separate, especially with my son and nephew in our room. Yes, the sliding door for both rooms has a frosted glass, it didn't bother us at all. The free wired internet was nice. The room had the typical Springhill amenities: flat screen tv, couch, desk, desk chair, microwave, fridge (no freezer section), iron, hair dryer and coffee maker. The big luggage stand over the a/c was nice too. Clock has an iphone charger. Plenty of lighting. Window opens a little with a screen. Breakfast was again typical Springhill style, make your own waffles (blueberry and original on Sat), cereal, oatmeal, yogurt, bagels, muffins, juice, milk, coffee, fresh fruit and something hot. Friday was real eggs, and turkey sausag, Saturday was biscuits and sausage gravy. We again loved the decor for the breakfast area, sheer curtains are used to offer some privacy, plenty of seating and room to move around. There is a Starbucks open in the morning, we didn't need anything there though. We got our Quick queue passes, checked out, got on the shuttle and enjoyed our 2nd day at Seaworld. When we were done, took the shuttle back and left. I would highly recommend this hotel to any family going to Seaworld. We didn't do anything else, just Seaworld. If you're keeping track, we saved $262 plus the cost of breakfast for 6, so easily $300 for two days at Seaworld. The hotel easily paid for itself!

Really there is room for 2nd toilet in that bath, just be nice for larger family on longer stay. OTHER: big TV, though other SHS sometimes have 2. Sofabed was not comfortable, but then, they rarely are. Ok enough for small, tired kids maybe but not adults. HOTEL: better than average continental breakfast, some hot items too plus the make your own waffles. Decent little pool bar, shared by Fairfield next door, as is pool, hot tub.

Well as it turned out, it was close enough but we were told at the front desk some of the roads had no sidewalks. Fortunately they had a free shuttle service to Sea World that was great. It ran often and only had 3 stops all at close hotels. If fact one of the stops was at the sister hotel Fairfield Inn only a few hundred feet away. While on that subject the SHS and the FI shared the outdoor facilities, pool, pool bath, hot tub, and pool bar. Both hotels looked like they were only a few years old. Nice location on International Drive stretch that is rural and set back from a road quite far so it was quiet.

It was a very nice hotel, but if we travel to Orlando again we might look into other hotels instead. Why? Since the moment I entered my room I pitied the hotel. According to a front desk clerk it was 2 years old. By the appearance of the room it looked older. There were stains on the carpets and the walls and little marks on all of the appliances. The room was pretty decent, but if you prefer a cleaner and closer-to-perfection type of room this hotel is not for you. If you don\u2019t mind a hotel with stains on the carpets and walls, it\u2019s fine. On this matter, it\u2019s a very kid-friendly hotel. Several families stay here, and there are several loud kids. Definitely not the quietest hotel in the area. The walls were thin and the doors all slammed shut, so it didn\u2019t make for the most restful night of sleep. On the other hand, the beds were very comfortable. It was also an inconvenience that the rooms at this hotel were not wireless. You had to plug into an Ethernet cable and if you wanted wi-fi you could only get it in the lobby. The housekeeping woman did an okay job. She skipped our room one day which really aggravated us. And then the front desk had the nerve to tell us that we probably had our do not disturb sign up when we had never used it. Since we complained, the maid came to clean our room, and it was picked up every night when we came back to the hotel thankfully. Breakfast was good and there was a fairly large variety to fit anyone\u2019s diet out there. The pool was quite pristine and clean, and though it was shared with the neighboring Fairfield it never became too very crowded because of the large size of it. There was a pool-side grill that also served some alcoholic beverages. It also was a Pizza-Hut to go, a smoothie shop etc. Basically there was a lot to choose from! On-site in the lobby there\u2019s a mini Starbucks which was convenient. Also, there was a concierge area run by Expedia. The concierges weren\u2019t the most helpful we\u2019ve ever seen but they did give us advice as to which parks we should go to and got us some pretty nice deals. They do leave pretty early in the day, though, so if you have any questions about dining in the evening, ask in the morning. We were heading out to dinner around 6 or 7 PM and no one was at the concierge area. The service at this hotel overall was alright. The front desk was fairly helpful and kind depending on which shift worker you were dealing with. Some were friendlier than others. The morning cooking staff was amiable and welcoming- probably the kindest people at the hotel. All and all, the hotel was pretty nice and it was in a convenient location on International Drive. There was a free shuttle at various times to Sea World, Aquatica and Discovery Cove that was nice. We\u2019ll probably stay here again in the future, but we definitely will be lowering our expectations. It\u2019s a high traffic hotel so it\u2019s hard to have individual attention as a guest and to have a sparkling room.", "Date": "August 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Great Yarmouth, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cplanning your first trip to orlando? then get this hotel booked up now!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "paul e", "ReviewID": "UR116533939", "Content": "Firstly i must say i used trip advisor to help us locate a decent hotel with the facilities we needed as a family for our fourth holiday to orlando.

The free breakfast is varied with scrambled eggs, pineapple ham, sausage patties, biscuits ( hot scones to me and you ) make your own hot waffles, toast, basically a good start to the day. The rooms (suites) are very spacious with plenty of room for our family of 5, 2 adults and 3 teens, they were cleaned every day and it seemed that care was taken to do it well, also there is free internet access in each room via ethernet cable, however there is also free to use computers in the hotel lobby. The staff were excellent, i really can not praise their efforts enough, always willing to go the extra mile if they can. There is a pool bar called Splash, next to the pool and the spa, which sells soda's, beer, cocktails, hot food like pizza hut ,chicken tenders all of which is not over priced for a hotel bar, keep your eyes open in the lifts for the infomation sheet telling you everything from the specials of the day, to the weater forcast, to whats for breakfast. Now if this is your first trip to orlando you have not experienced the queue's for the rides, they can be LONG and i mean LONG, up to 75 minutes on some peak days. This hotel has a facility in the lobby( see micheal ) where by if you stay at this hotel you can get unlimited quick queue passes for the day at sea world. So 75 minutes for the manta, kraken, journey to atlantis or the arctic thunder ride becomes about 2 minutes, be aware that these are on a first come first serve basis as there is a limited amount each day. International drive is a big place so if you do decide to rent a car, once you get you bearings this hotel is located right between univeral and disney with easy access to both. Right out side the hotel is TGI fridays and also across central florida parkway is a wendy's and a kfc, also a publix supermarket is a little further up the road. Sea world is right on the door step as is aquatica and you get a free shuttle service to both, saving about $20 a day in parking fee's.

The Fairfield (right across) has WiFi in the rooms....just in case you really want it. The pool is shared with the Fairfield also. The best part of staying at the hotel was that they offered shuttles to all the parks we went to, so we basically didn't have to drive our vehicles. OH I must mention this too you also, because it's not on there website!! Only one big disappointment for me, was that if you stay at this hotel, they offer you free fast passes for SeaWorld.....well they didn't say that they give them out one day before you go! So basically if you are going on a Tuesday, get your fast passess the day before (Monday!)....get in that line early, because they only have a limited amount. I was not very happy with this,since I was in line at 6:30 am for fast passes that I wanted to use on the same day and they told me I was supposed to pick them up on Sunday. Yes I complained!!

We bought our tickets in the lobby and received the fast pass on the spot with our purchased tickets.

We did use the shuttle and it was great. The staff were very friendly and we were glad to have the restaurant outside at the pool area so we could get food late after we had returned from the parks. We did not use the shuttle for Universal bc it only had one return time of 6:30 and we needed more time so we drove there but it wasn't far so it was fine. The rooms are great...the only problem I had with the room was the bigger bathroom did not have a toilet. The toilet was separate in a smaller bathroom with a toilet and sink only. This had some pros and cons with it. They had room to put a toilet in the bigger bathroom and had there been one, I would give the room a perfect 10. The breakfast was good. I liked the fact that I could go down and fix breakfast for the kids and bring it back up to the room. My son enjoyed making his own waffle so he would usually go down with me but we did bring it back to the room most mornings as the breakfast area was so loud and crowded...but expected as the hotel was at full capacity. One great tip for Universal is the single rider lines. We used those and had no trouble getting on rides fairly quickly without spending the extra money on a fast pass.

We then went upstairs to try to get kids up.The handout we recieved the previous nite before showed 8:20am as being the earliest free shuttle to the park so we resigned ourselves to driving the car and paying parking just to get there early. We went downstairs to eat the free breakfast(pretty good!) and a new staffer had showed up at the front desk. I asked her what was going on with the early entrance to Seaworld and the shuttle schedule. Low and behold this gal informed me a early shuttle was specially scheduled to leave in about 5 minutes! Which our family was not ready for! So we drove to Seaworld but the Seaworld help never showed up to let car traffic in till more like 8:15. Try to drag as much park and shuttle related info out of the staff the nite before. Early morning of that day is not the best time to do it.

One of the reasons we went with this hotel is the Starbucks located right in the lobby, however we found it wasn't staffed all the time. We arrived to check in around 6pm and there was no Starbucks staff in sight. That's fine, I basically wanted my espresso in the morning and hotel coffee just doesn't cut it. So, we arrived at our room, it's not really a suite. It does have a couch and chair and between the bed and the couch is a little desk built into a wall. I wouldn't exactly call it 2 rooms, it was one room with a dividing wall. The little round pillow on the bed was stained with what I hope was simply food. Otherwise, I'd have to say the room was fairly clean. There was only decaf coffee, although as noted above, there was a Starbucks in the lobby. Saturday morning we left for the Convention Center and we returned about 6pm...our room had never been cleaned. We had not left any \"Do Not Disturb\" sign on the door and had not left instructions with the desk or housekeeping, so why our room wasn't cleaned, I really can't figure out. I showered and as I was sitting on the edge of the bed in my bathrobe, housekeeping knocked on the door looking to make up the room. At 6:30pm!!

The property is very well maintained (aboyt a year old) and is connected to another Marriott property that shares a common bar, outdoor food area (serving pizza, burgers, etc), a pool and splash area, and a workout facility. The check-in was a bit wierd as they have a very space-age type set-up in the lobby with a round service desk that is awkward for conducting business when other guests are standing there. My room was not ready when we arrived so I was upgraded a bit to a handicap access room that was a little larger than the room we had booked with 2 queen beds and a pullout couch. The Room itself was clean and had a great view of seaworld (as requested). There was a nice flatscreen TV that was on a swivel and the ability to plug in an external DVD Player (great for the kids). The bathrrom was very strange as they had the shower/tub in one half bathroom with a sliding plexilglass door (not good for when people are asleep and light shines from the bathroom) and the toilet in anther half bathroom with a plexiglass sliding door. I guess they figured 2 people could use the seperate bathroom facilities easier, but trust me it was a little awkward if you had to use the bathroom after taking a shower and going between doors. The A/C was rattiling when we got to the room and the maintainance worker came up in about 10 minutes and installed a new A/C unit inside of 20 minutes. Great service, but I really think that should have been checked and replace prior to guest being in the room. That evening I had to make 2 seperate trips down to the front desk for bath-towels and sheets for the pullout couch. We did not discover either of these had been missing until returning home from dinner and a night out. We were unable to shower or put the kids to bed for an additiional 45 mins. The Breakfast area was just not laid out well at all. They did have a nice selection of foods, but the lines got crazy and the flow of traffic right thru table seating areas is just not well thought out. The staff at the front desk, breakfast area, bar, and concerige desk were some of the nicest and friendliest I have encountered and they geuinely try to make the guests feel welcome and help them. Most are very good at remembering names (impressive). Overall, I was happy as I booked this at a local special price of $82/nite for a room with 2 queen beds, a pullout sofa, free breakfast, and right across the street from Seaworld with a Friday's restaurant right in the parking lot. I would say that the property tries to do entirely too much and should focus more on avoiding the chaos at breakfast and straightening up the housekeeping issues.

The two glasses next to the coffee pot were covered with a paper covering. I uncovered one of the glasses only to find it dirty with juice pulp and and lip stains.

The shower has multiple shower heads with VERY STRONG WATER PRESSURE.

My wife and 25-year-old son arrived quite late as our flight touched down at MCO about 10 PM. Our rental at Dollar was waiting and off we went for the short drive to the hotel. The receptionist had our reservations in order, which were 2 rooms that were adjacent and connecting in a quiet area of the hotel. One was a King for my son and the other, 2 Queens for my wife and I. The rooms were both spotless and offered no surprises. Each had a small fridge and microwave. The room with 2 queens appeared a bit larger with a small walk-in closet. and a bath/shower combo while the King had a large stall shower and no tub. The closet in the King was an armoire type wardrobe with 2 drawers. Smallish capacity but adequate for our son. The rooms were located at the end of the hallway away from the elevators and most foot traffic so we always had a pleasant night's sleep during our 5-night stay. Since a basketball team was staying in the hotel and later a group of teenagers, this proved to be an ideal location for us. We used one of the hotel's 3 computers on a daily basis. There was always one available for our use and it worked in a proficient manner. We never took advantage of the hotel's free breakfast buffet as we always slept rather late. The hotel is very close to SeaWorld but not much else except a TGIF's and a CVS 24-hour Drugstore, both of which are just a minute's walk away. We always parked in the rear of the hotel as this was near to a card-coded entrance door which was very close to the hotel's 2 elevators. We found the staff to be very friendly and gave us excellent directions to any and all places we wished to visit. The weather during our stay was excellent. In the low to mid-80's every day and low 60's at night. There was only a spurt of thundershowers one late afternoon that lasted about 45 minutes. We did visit Disney World, Epcot, and Adventure Island at Universal, along with a quick stop at Ripley's and a magic show at Wonder Works on International Drive. Shopping consisted of a stop at the Florida Mall and a high end Premium Outlet discount mall plus the usual souvenirs at the amusement parks. We dined at Del Frisco's for steaks, Roy's for Hawaiian fare, Antonio's for Italian and had lunch one day at TGIF. We had 2 breakfasts during out stay. One at a Denny's across the street from the hotel and one at the coffee shop in the Peabody Hotel where we also had our Thanksgiving brunch buffet. All in all, a very pleasant vacation.

The modern decor gives it a boutique hotel feel. The room was, for a nice change, exactly like the photos on the hotel's website. Sure, the room could sleep five people (two queen beds and a sofa), and the split bathroom (shower/tub and sink in one, toilet and sink in the other) makes it easy for people to get ready, but for just the two of us we felt spoiled with all the space! The closet is almost large enough to be used as a bedroom (lol). Large flat screen tv can be turned around for either the sitting area or the bed area. Our complaints are very small ones - it would be nice to have a full length mirror and extra hooks in the bathrooms for towels. The toiletries, while nice smelling, weren't topped up - but I'm sure if we asked the maids we would have had no problem getting more. Oh, and the air conditioning is a little noisy, but earplugs take care of that.

It helps that the hotel put a sign up limiting your time to 15 minutes, although if no one is waiting then you can use it longer. The staff were super nice and there is an Expedia concierge on site (you will have a message on your room telephone the morning after you arrive). The hotel is right near Sea World - our sunset view of a roller coaster was cool - and provides a courtesy shuttle to Sea World which I highly recommend because while it looks like a short walk could quickly turn into a very, very long one when the heat is 31 celsius (88F) at 7:00am. They have several return trips that give you lots of time to enjoy the beautiful park. For those heading to Disney the shuttle is only $8US. There is a TGI Fridays a short walk from the hotel, a bank, grocery store, and CVs a short drive around the corner from the hotel. THE HEAT Ah yes, the heat. We were in Orlando from May 20 - 24 and the heat was, from what the locals say, just starting. The temperatures quickly got up to 37 celsius (98F) and I found water didn't cut it. Gatorade was more on the menu. Drink lots of water the night before if you can. I spoke to quite a few locals and they say there are some who adjust to the heat, but for most they never get used to it. Did I mention the humidity? We're talking pretty much 100% humidity ... without rain. Supposedly ladies don't sweat, they perspire. Not so in Orlando. I don't mean to get too personal, but ladies you will \"prespire\" in areas you didn't think could do that. Drink lots of fluids, and don't forget your hat or your vacation could turn into bed rest with heat stroke. Obviously sun block is a must. We used Hawaiian Tropic Sheer Touch Lotion Sunscreen SPF 50. I have super fair skin and didn't burn at all (or tan for that matter). My friend used it on her face and didn't have a reaction. It has a nice cocunutty-summer smell that didn't change to that chemical smell common for most sunblocks. We drank lots of fluids, kept to the shaded areas when possible, and had a fantastic time. CAR RENTAL We decided to rent a car. Looked into public transportation and decided a car rental was more efficient and given the heat we're glad we did. The I-Ride can be somewhat unpredictable, and the bus routes called for walking-bus-walking-bus-walking to get to places like Universal Studios. The roads are clearly labeled and we had absolutely no trouble getting around. Be warned though ... it seems the majority of drivers don't signal when changing lanes and they come up on your hind end pretty close sometimes. There are a couple of tolls from the airport, but they don't cost much ($1 and then $.75) and the roads are lovely (probably because they don't need to deal with, dare I say it, snow and ice). For car lovers ... or those who get bored on the road ... I noticed that there seemed to be a number of Mustangs in the area and so we made a game of counting them. In a 2.5 hour trip we counted 52 Mustangs! New Cameros and Corvettes are popular too. We rented from Budget (read a few bad reviews about overcharging at Dollar and Thrifty that made me a little nervous) and our pick up at the early hours was quick and painless. Within minutes we were off in our shiny, electric blue Toyota Corolla with a sporty little tail fin. The cars aren't marked as rentals so you look like a local (good for those worried about potential car break ins). The car did have some marks on it which I took photos of ... just in case. SEA WORLD Sea World was our favourite. For $109US we purchased the combo ticket for Sea World and Busch Gardens (you have 14 days to use the ticket). It's cheaper to do the combo or you will pay $78.95US just for Sea World and $74.95US for Busch Gardens. When you enter the park they scan your ticket, and your finger. We got there early and were able to do the rides first thing - front seat, screaming, adrenaline pumping good fun. Rides aren't just for kids ... we're in our 40s and LOVED it! Watched the killer whale show, the sea lion show, dolphin show, and an acrobatic show. All great. Yes, the killer whale show is short, mostly videos and borders the commercial, but cool just the same. Couldn't help but laugh at the sea lions and the actors. The dolphin/whale show was enhanced with acrobats and beautiful birds flying overhead. We touched the silky surfaces of manta rays while others held shrimp between their fingers to feed them. There is lots of shade and some of the venues are air conditioned which is helpful when you feel a tad overwarm (trust me, you will). Sure, the drinks are a little costly, but where we live a bottle of water can cost $3 CDN at the theatre so the prices weren't as shocking to us. We had a hand carved turkey sandwich with super fresh bread and potatoe salad at the air conditioned deli for about $10 (we shared the sandwich because it was so big). BUSH GARDENS Went to Busch Gardens in Tampa. Was about an hour drive each way and the roads are clearly marked. A trolley takes guests from the parking lot to the park. I recommend going early because it get hot and don't forget your hat. The temperature was the same as the day we went to Sea World, but for some reason it was close to unbearable the day we went to Busch Gardens. There is a fair number of shaded areas, but the walkways are not as wide which may be why it felt hotter. Again, your ticket is scanned and your finger is scanned. We did the Endangered Species Safari for $39US and loved it. This group is a little smaller than the regular safari, and a little longer, plus you get a bottle of water. Unfortunately we didn't get to see the rare black rhino, Forrest (he didn't want to come out of his air conditioned cave, go figure), but we fed giraffes chilled lettuce (absolutely cool), saw white rhinos, zebras, rare antelope (can't remember what they are called) and more. The keepers and guides were great and answered all of the questions. Highly recommended. As for the rides, unfortunately the Sheikra ride was down for a bit and when we got back to it the wait was just over an hour. Too hot for that. Sure, we could have bought fast passes, but there were only three rides we were interested in and the Montu was good enough to scratch the roller coaster itch. Had lunch at the Crown Colony Restaurant (mainly because I was feeling more like a microwave from the heat and the restaurant is air conditioned). Don't let the table service scare you off if you are budget conscious - I had the grilled vegetables for only $10. My friend had the albacore tuna salad for about $10 and I could barely see her over the mound of goodies on her plate (tuna, olives, veggies etc.). Plus, you can see the animals in the seregenti area. Around 5:00 the temperature became bearable, but only because the sun was starting to set, and we were able to check out more of Busch Gardens in a little more comfort. COCOA BEACH We drove along the coast and checked out Cocoa Beach, about an hour from Orlando. We could have eated at one of the many fast food places, but wanted to be spoiled with table service and found this great Italian place called Branos Italian Grill. For $10US I had a delicious pasta with lovely bread. Our server recommended Jetty Park near the cruise ships. She said it's neat to see the cruise ships depart around 4:30pm. It costs $10 to park (cheaper during the week) and you can spend a great day at the beach. It was surprising to see surfers mixing with swimmers and fishermen. Yes, you can fish on the beach .. where people swim! We walked down the pier and had a nice chat with some local gentleman fishing who were happy to show us their catch of the day. There were a lot of people fishing on the pier so watch out for fish hooks and keep your shoes on. SHOPPING We didn't do much shopping. Checked out the nearby Florida Mall. What can I say, it's a mall. But I can't say enough about Ross Dress for Less. It's sort of like a Winners (or TJ Max), but cheaper. I couldn't resist the 350 thread count Egyptian cotton queen deep pocket sheets for $22US (probably $70CDN at Winners), and a pair of Steve Madden heels for $12US. If I had the room in my suitcase I would have brought home a queen chocolate brown stripped sateen comforter and oversize pillow shams for $19US and chair covers for $4US. OUTTA CONTROL COMEDY CLUB DINNER I can't say enough good things about this place. For $25 you get all the salad, pizza, beer, wine, soft drinks you can eat. But it's not about the food (really, it's not ... the food is edible but nothing special). It's about the show and what a show it was. Tony Brent had us laughing so much my sides hurt. The show is child friendly, but adults will love it too. It's also interactive and you can't help but laugh at the way people behave on stage. He also performed magic, and I do mean \"magic.\" I have no idea how he did what he did. We didn't reserve our tickets, but given the reviews online you may need to soon. The room is small and seats people at four long tables. Definitely a MUST SEE while in Orlando. OVERALL All in all, I definitely recommend this hotel if you're heading to Orlando and all the sun and fun that the area has to offer.

To put that in perspective, Disney resorts were in the 4000 usd range for the lesser ones, and Universal ones were at 300 bucks per night. As you can tell I'm writing this review while still staying at the hotel, 9 days in our trip. The hotel is clean, and spanking new. It's part of a two-hotel complex owned by Marriott so it shares its swimming pool, fitness centre and other amenities with the Fairfield Inn. To be clear, if you want to stay in that area, you need to compare the rates for the two hotels as the two are identical in style and size. And by identical, I mean really, really identical. Don't be caught paying more to stay in either - go for whichever has the lower rate. In terms of style you're looking at a modern, utilitarian style seen in places like Premier Inn. Think clean, simple, very generic. I like it that way personally. This is true about the entire hotel except for the pool which has a nice splash zone zone for the little ones and a nearby jacuzzi. The pool however is smaller than the pictures found in the Marriott marketing materials. In terms of service this is were the 'utilitarian' style sort of fall on its own sword. The staff is slim, bareboned almost. They are courteous but don't expect them to get out of their routine to go and give you a great experience, this isn't the Waldorf Astoria. They will however try to promptly accommodate your requests if you have one. Breakfast is complimentary but very repetitive and basic. It's perfectly fine for a short stay but after 9 days my wife and kids are already asking for another option. Rooms are clean however I wished they had been kept that way a little bit better during our stay. I had to complain the room hadn't been vacuumed and the tissue box hadn't been refilled. My request was taken into account and the staff did check to see if it had been covered, however it simply shouldn't have happened in the first place. The mini fridge and microwave provided are convenient however the sitting area barely doubles up as a dining area. Don't expect to sit your kids and eat with plates and cutlery. That area of the room is more appropriate to much on sandwiches or takeaway burgers. The rooms, called 'suites' are bright, spacious and the sofa doubles up as a bed so you can sleep 5. I wouldn't recommend staying with anyone but family though as it's not THAT spacious and the walls of the toilet are paper thin, hint hint, nudge nudge. Odds and ends: The bathroom has a bath and a sink, it's functional like everything else. You also have a second, 'mini' sink in the toilet, as well as a storage area which is convenient to store your suitcases alongside your clothes. A set of 3 drawers and a little storage area below the TV is barely enough to hold the clothes for a family of 4. The TV is HD, but the cable service quality is patchy (expect compression artefacts and grain). Channels provided are the usual HBO, CNN , ESPN etc. There is a laundry room with washer dryer which is worth mentioning as it's quite useful. Location wise I didn't have a car so walkable venues were my #1 priorities. To be clear YES you can walk to Seaworld but it takes 30 minutes if you walk fast, and aren't afraid of not having a walkway at times. I did it with my 10 and 14 yo kids but it wasn't comfortable and regretted not getting a cab. Both Aquatica and Discovery Cove are walkable easily without hassle. Restaurants: TGI friday, A thai, a japanese, a kfc, mac donald, wendies are all in walking distance. We did some light shopping at a nearby Publix convenience store. There's also the usual assortment of CVS pharmacies and 'junk food' stores and gaz station forecourts. That's not bad but it's not great either. Keep in mind were you are, this isn't downtown San Francisco. We often wished we had a car. Universal had to be done by cab and we aren't looking forward to the LYNX bus for Disney. The hotel shuttle is USELESS and the IRide, even though it stops right in front of the hotel, only comes every 20 minutes. Florida mall is 30 bucks each way! It's possible to enjoy all the parks without a car but don't expect it to be perfectly seamless. Sleep quality is excellent. There is no sound inside or outside the hotel and the beds are really comfy. Conclusion: I would definitely stay there again or at the adjacent Fairfield Inn, with or without a car. Yes the hotel was basic but then again at this price expectations have to be realistic. Springhill suites is a clean, pleasant hotel ideal for business traveller and young families alike. This however NOT a luxury or 'soulful' venue and you will need to be assertive should a 'mistake' occur during your stay.", "Date": "April 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stuart, Florida", "Title": "\u201cWill Stay Here Again!\u201d", "Author": "mayshyme", "ReviewID": "UR57031658", "Content": "I loved the cleanliness of this hotel!

But when I got to the room, it was not clean at all. It looked like someone was still in there or it wasn't been done after guests checking out. I first thought I got in a wrong room! So I had to go back and ask for a new room. That was not a good way to start our stay. After we got into another room, I realized that there was only a walk-in shower, no bath tub. So I went back to ask if I could get a new room with a bathtub because it's more convenient for a two-year old. The staff was very nice and helpful. She gave us an accessible King-bed room on 5th floor. Room is very spacious. Bathroom and restroom are huge. We like the layout and decor very much. Have to say that it's not spotless. There were some stain and dusty spots throughout. Bed is nice but bedding sheets are not as comfortable as what we just had at Comfort Suites airport (sorry, can't help comparing). One nice thing though is that we didn't hear any noise from next doors or hall way at all during our stay. Breakfast was nice. Plenty of food and seating. Food is the same everyday though. We didn't have problem of over crowded during breakfast time like in other reviews. Maybe because the hotel was only about half full. However, our last day, which was Halloween, breakfast was a lot more crowded than previous days, but still no problem getting food or finding seats. One problem about their breakfast is that one (out of three) waffle machine was not working properly throughout our stay, then on last day, another one was broken too. Business center with 3 computers and free printing was good. Internet connection in our room was very slow though. Shuttle service (through 3rd party) to Seaworld parks is free and pretty good. We used it only once because we spent most of our time at Disney. We didn't use their shuttle service to Disney because it would have cost us (2 adults+1 child) more than Disney parking fee, and it has very limited schedule. Staff are very nice and very accommodating. We requested for a late check-out since our flight was late evening, and got 2 pm check-out without extra charge. Here comes the part we didn't like about this hotel, and this is why I couldn't give higher rating. Housekeeping was bad. Day 2, one trash can wasn't empty. Day 4, One trash can was left without a bag and empty tissue boxes were not replaced. Day 5, our room was left open when we came back at 8 pm! One of facial soap bars we got had moldy stain.

Room was large, trendy, and extremely comfortable. *******IMPORTANT***********Upon arrival, pizza menus where under our door, which I thought was great. I called STEFANO'S Pizza, biggest mistake ever!! Flyer stated best pizza and fastest service. Gentleman explained pizza would arrive in about 1 hr. After 1 hr 10 minutes, still hadnt arrived so I called. Stated driver was on his way. 10 minutes later, the driver calls my cell from his cell phone, explaining he had been pulled over and on his way. After a brief altercation in lobby, and $5 off my pizza and fries, I went up to my room at 4am to eat COLD, SOGGY pizza. Never again!! The next night, there were 3 more flyers under our door. ALSO:::::There was a message on phone regarding Discount Disney tickets. Don't fall for it, two guys working were very cocky marketers who tried to rip us off. They charge more for tickets than if you just buy at the park. Very rude and try to con you into time share rentals. SpringHill should keep a better eye on the the deceptive business practices of cross promoting companies located on their property. I will absolutley stay again, only this time I will not deal with the outrageous behavior of the businesses listed above.", "Date": "October 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat Pick\u201d", "Author": "mastcfw", "ReviewID": "UR45925285", "Content": "Very new and very nice hotel.

I had a nearby Hilton booked and then started looking into the Seaworld ticket prices and found that Marriott partners with them. The tickets alone (best price anywhere) for the 3 of us would have been ove $190. The room at any nearby hotel- $85. We got length of stay tickets and a new modern room for less than $180. This is abarnd new location VERY close to the entrance of Seaworld. It is right next door to the Fairfield Inn and they share a pool. There is a also aTGIF resturant within walking distance in the parking lot. This is a very new, sparkling clean hotel. The check in staff as excellent. We arrived at noon, well before a room was ready but they were happy to give us the Seaworld passes so we could enjoy the afternoon at the park. The package provided a Shamu stuffed toy for my son ($8.99 at the park) and upgrade to premium parking. They may have had a shuttle but we preferred to have our rental with us. The rooms were VERY clean and modern. We had a pullout bed which was perfect for my son and rest of the room was spacious. Perfect for the business traveler as well. I will complain that the only downfall is with cool glass doors to the bathroom and shower, when you flick the light on to use the bathroom(s), the entire room was lit up. The complimentary breakfast in the morning was excellent..cereals, waffles and eggs - all the basics nicely presented. We were there at prime time but no waits and lots of tables available. Between this and the no parking fee, it just made it a best bet for one night. We saw lots of families enjoying the pool but we did not get a chance to see it up close. My final verdict was that this was a GREAT fit to our needs for one night. For a week, with a family in tow - the Seaworld package is a great deal but we may have been on top of each other in the room after a week. We have had a chance to stay at one more of these SpringHill suites and they are a nice Marriott branded hotel. For location, CLEANLINESS and Seaworld amenities, cannot be beat!", "Date": "October 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNice and New, but ...\u201d", "Author": "debbiejo", "ReviewID": "UR43960914", "Content": "This hotel is brand new and it is very nice and modern. The room and bathroom were both clean. I ended up with a room with 2 queens which seemed larger than the king I had originally reserved. I don't know if that is the case for all of the king rooms or just the corner one I was first given. The hotel is very close to Seaworld if that is one of your choices of parks to visit. The staff was very nice and polite. They were helpful with directions etc. Now, my few negative remarks. The breakfast area is very small and really is crowded when the hotel is full. It was not a pleasant experience. Although the pool is very nice, it is shared with the Fairfield Inn next door. I imagine it could be quite busy there if both hotels were full. I think the fitness center was also shared, although it was very nice and was not overly busy when I was there. Finally, there are 3 computers, but they are very slow. It's very frustrating to use them. The rate I got was very good and I would possibly stay there again depending on which season I went.", "Date": "September 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wilmington, DE", "Title": "\u201cLovely!!\u201d", "Author": "Karyn01", "ReviewID": "UR39477105", "Content": "All in all, we had a terrific stay @ Springhill Suites.
