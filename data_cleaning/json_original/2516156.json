I am a loyal fan of Hilton, and this property was great. The hotel is very nice, well kept, and quite. The lobby is nice and spacious with a dinning and sitting area. The gym is rather small but has a decent selection of weights and a few treadmills and an elliptical. The hotel also has a nice basketball court and pool. This property is also conveniently located by a large shopping center (within walking distance behind the hotel) The center has a Walmart, gym, and several restaurants. Being on a rather strict diet I was very happy with the rooms. They offer a full kitchen with a large fridge/freezer, dishwasher, stove, and microwave. I was able to purchase all my food at the store and cook my meals in the room. It's often hard to stick to a diet when traveling but Homewood made it simple. If you are not as picky as me, the hotel offers a nice full breakfast in the am until 1030. My boyfriend loved this. They offer everything from fresh fruit to homemade waffles and omelets. They also had a calender in the room for nightly dinners, however we never tried these. Aside from the kitchen, the rooms are very nice, clean, and updated. They offer a small living room area and separate bedroom area. The rooms also offer free internet which was a huge plus. I travel a lot and I am used to paying at least 10 dollars a day for internet. Lastly, I would like to comment on the staff. They were absolutely amazing at this property. They were always friendly and eager to accommodate. When my boyfriend finally had a break, the lady working the front desk spent almost an hour with us going over restaurants and activities we could enjoy locally. They always greeted us warmly and actually remembered us and greeted us by our names(this is always a nice touch at hotels) Overall I was impressed with this hotel and would definitely stay here if I ever find myself in Phoenix again.", "Date": "April 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cOne night of horror and three nights of bliss -hotel puts non-smokers in smoking rooms when at capacity\u201d", "Author": "MichiganTravelhawk", "ReviewID": "UR128026519", "Content": "While on a business trip in Phoenix, I stayed 4 nights at the Homewood Suites Phoenix North -Happy Valley. I booked a non-smoking one bedroom suite at the Homewood Suites Phoenix North Happy Valley hotel. Although my confirmation indicated a non-smoking room, they gave me a smoking room on a smoking floor. And my one night of horror began. I was informed that when the hotel is at capacity they convert smoking rooms into non-smoking rooms. Smoke permeates drapes, carpet, bedding and furniture so there's no way a smoking room can become smoke free overnight. Non-smoking rooms were not available and my business meeting started at 8:00 am the next morning. While in the room, my eyes began to burn, I had difficulty breathing and my nostrils were irritated and sore...it was a miserable sleepless night for this non-smoker. Through the ordeal the staff & managers were sympathetic and promised to find a non-smoking room the next day. The next day, while I was in the business meeting, the hotel staff moved my personal items to a non-smoking room on the non-smoking floor. Ok, so this is when the bliss started. When I returned from the business meeting I entered my wonderful non-smoking room. The one bedroom suite was spacious, clean, everything looked new and the bed was very comfortable. The kitchen had a 2 burner stove (no oven), microwave and a full sized refrigerator. Other perks included free wireless access and breakfast with some hot items such as eggs and sausage. As if that wasn't enough, Mon-Thurs evenings there's a complimentary light meal with beverages. The staff was very friendly and made guests feel very welcome. Two outdoor shopping areas (Happy Valley Towne Center and Norterra Shops) with lots of restaurants are located behind the hotel. Since the hotel is next to Interstate 17, there's just a short drive to reach the Anthem Outlet Mall and the Cave Creek area. My overall rating for the hotel would be higher if it weren't for the one night of horror and what might be a practice of putting non-smokers in smoking rooms.", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cClean, Convenient, and Nice Rooms.\u201d", "Author": "GNAK62", "ReviewID": "UR126808099", "Content": "We are Hilton Diamond Members and we enjoy staying at the Homewood Suites.

The team stayed in a separate hotel while several parents stayed here. We had booked the room ahead, paying in advance for a bit of a discounted rate. We booked a one bedroom suite (which has a bedroom separate from the living/dining/kitchen area.) We arrived on a Saturday (late check in) and stayed through Thursday morning. We were not disappointed. The room was spotlessly clean - the furniture and beds were comfortable. The sofa was a pull out - and both televisions were flat screens. The kitchen and bathroom counters were granite. Tile floors in the bathroom area. The closet was large. Everything was spacious. The kitchenette was clean, new, and well stocked with utensils and dishes. The refrigerator was full sized with an ice maker. The hotel staff and management were very attentive, and the only time we had to call the front desk (needed more toilet tissue) they were very prompt, apologetic, and courteous. The hotel is conveniently located next to a very nice shopping district, and upon check in, the front desk gave us a guide will all local shopping and restaurants near by - several within walking distance. Nearby shops included everything from Walmart to Bath and Body and Dicks Sporting Goods. Restaurants included Logan's Roadhouse, Olive Garden, Smash Burger, Red Robin, and several others including some fast food options as well. Despite being located right off Highway 17, the room was quiet and we noticed no traffic noise. Anthem Outlet Mall was also located just a few miles north of this hotel. The hotel has a complimentary Happy Hour each week night - though the beverages were limited in selection. The food offered at that time however, was more like a meal than Happy Hour snacks and were decent. Breakfast was good (although most things were covered in jalepenos which I personally don't like.) There was an outdoor heated pool. And the second floor of the hotel had a billiard table. I noticed a nice business center on the first floor as well. We did take advantage of the guest laundry on the 2nd floor for baseball uniforms. There were three washers and dryers and seating. In conclusion, we found this hotel to be more than what we expected and we would highly recommend it to everyone.

They did tend to run out of the beer while they were still serving food, so you should get there pretty early if you want a beer. I saw some people asking for beer after they ran out, and some was brought to them. The thing that really impressed me was the service. One of the people who worked in the dining area (his name was Angel, I believe), provided customer service you rarely see. He worked hard and fast to keep up with all the people, and he did so with courtesy and a smile. I think we each commented on him at various points because he was so attentive. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. I had one minimal maintenance issue which was handled immediately by a pleasant man who assured me he would come right back if I had any further issues.
