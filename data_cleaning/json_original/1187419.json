It takes 10 minutes of walk to the commuter station then 15 minutes with the commuter train to Termini, the central station of Roma. But If one needs to fly from Ciampino airport then its good for a night or two but be prepared to put up with the noise of landing and taking off's and the train that passes by the hotel. The personnels are nice, polite and service minded yet I had to raise my voice to make them change my room. The rooms are neat and clean and the breakfast restaurant is fair. The personnel of the restaurant are very nice.", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0", "Location": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oslo, Norway", "Title": "\u201cUnprofessional!\u201d", "Author": "WHO492", "ReviewID": "UR119695200", "Content": "When searching for a hotel close to Ciampino airport with swimming pool, this hotel showed up. I booked a room, but when I arrived in the afternoon, warm and sweathy,and asked for the pool, I was being served a lie: \"I'm so sorry, the pool broke down three days ago\". When looking at the pool area, it was clear that the pool had been out all season, reinforcement bars at the pool side were rusty and weed were growing in the pool itself! The hotel is \"next door\" to both the railway line and the runway, so it's extremely noisy. I have now waited three months for a refund from the hotel, and they keep telling me \"the refund has been made\".", "Date": "October 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cGood but don't forget your earplugs\u201d", "Author": "valevh", "ReviewID": "UR66308601", "Content": "This was a good value hotel for Rome, but it was noisy, due to aircraft noise from the nearby airport.

We asked for a quiet room in advance, but could still hear planes, and were thankful we had our earplugs. The room was clean, the sheets and bed very, very comfortable. The breakfast was Italian style (coffee, cakes etc) but ample for most, I suspect. It is about a 10-15 minute walk to Ciampino rail station and not too hard to find by foot. We didn't use their restaurant, but when I asked about wifi, the receptionist was most helpful and the wifi was free! However, you need to bring your laptop to the foyer - the signal does not extend to most rooms.
