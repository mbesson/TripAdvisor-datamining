I stayed here last year when it was Quality Inn and it was horrible. There are new owners and it looks like most of the renovations are complete. The picture DOES NOT look like the motel. The motel looks better. I had great service and my room was excellent. I guess this place has been a \"work in progress\" over the last year and it has been paying off. Breakfast was good. Only thing that stood out was a waffle machine. Everything else was the usual for motel breakfasts The actual design of the breakfast room was impressive. Internet signal was above par compared to other motels Ive stayed at. Definitely high speed but I did have trouble figuring out how to enter the password. Location is hard to get to off the freeway the first time but still in a good neighborhood. Overall, I am very impressed. I would stay here again.

They kept restocking breakfast during the mornings. Friendly staff. We didn't use the pool. It was small, like one would have at a small house. We never saw anyone using it. Nice residential area.

When we checked in we were told \"if you check out during the stay you still pay for entire stay.\" We thought that was an odd thing to be told but we were there for vacation and for Comic Con, so we had no intention of checking out before our departing date. Well we now know why that was said! It was because our stay would be a nightmare!! We stayed here last year, when it was Quality Inn, and loved it, that's why we came back, but we will NEVER stay here again!! First thing we encountered was ANTS! Tons of them in our room! Every day there was another huge trail of them all up and around the bathroom door!! We called the manager and he came down with an unmarked spray bottle of unknown chemicals and sprayed the ants twice and then wiped them down with a towel! The third time we complained, he handed the spray bottle to my husband and had us spray them down daily, wiping them down with one of our guest towels!!!! The chemical smell triggered my asthma so I ended up missing two days of the con, due to having to get breathing treatments every 4 hours!! The ants were everywhere after we started spraying! You would open your laptop, on the desk by the door, and ants would be crawling across the screen! You would wake up in bed with ants crawling on the sheets! OMG it was AWFUL!!! So was housekeeping! She would take our towels and washclothes and NOT leave clean ones behind!! We had to start leaving notes on the bed for her to bring us towels and my husband even had to go to the front desk for some as well! The hairdryer blew cold air and the last day that we were there, it died completely!! We told the woman at the front desk ALL of this when we were checking out and she just shrugged her shoulders. Her attitude was the same as his!! I reported it to corporate on the way to the airport the morning we checked out, yes I was that upset! I did not even wait to get home to call! Corporate said the manager had 72 hours to respond. Well this morning I got an e-mail offering me 25% off rack rate on our next visit! HA!! Forget that!! We will NEVER stay there again!! If you are looking for a good hotel to stay at on your next visit, we strongly suggest you pass this one by and find some where else!!", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lakeside", "Title": "\u201cRenovating-Lack of concern of inconvenience to business travelor\u201d", "Author": "ssgLakeside", "ReviewID": "UR110734420", "Content": "Older furnishings. What was clean was VERY clean. Few things dirty, refrig, hair dryer cord, phone, and interesting - just one wall behind the desk had mildew and also around the door. The rest of the room was very clean. Refrigerator would not work the first night and when I asked the next morning it magically started working, so it may be controlled at the front desk. Ice machine was out of order the entire stay. It appeared that half the hotel was under renovation-rooms empty with no curtains. The problem came after the first night. In the morning I got in the shower around 9:40 am to get ready to go to an appointment and when I was lathered with soap the water was turned off for repairs. I called the front desk and she said it would be 5 minutes. I called 15 minutes later and she said it would be 15 more minutes. I called again after 15 more minutes and she said just 15 minutes longer. I told her I was going to miss an appointment if they didn't turn the water back on. 10 minutes later I called the desk and asked the woman to be realistic and tell me exactly when I could expect the water back on and she said 30 minutes. I told her that I have dried soap all over me and I will have missed my 11:00 appointment. I told her that I needed to check out and go to a hotel that had water. She told me that I should be more concerned about their problems and that I had already paid for the upcoming night (2 nights) and basically it was a done deal. I advised her that my concern was my own travel and appointment agenda that their problems are not my concern. As I was packing up to leave, the water came on. My 11:00 appointment had been missed, but I had time to make a 1:00 appointment so I did not check out. I was too busy to check out and continued with the rest of my business. The second night I was kept awake until about 2:00 a.m with a rapper type music pounding the wall. This hotel is a low budget hotel, good for those on a tight budget, but not good if you have a demanding schedule. Also, do not expect professional conduct from the hotel management and concern for the customer. The correct thing would have been for the hotel to apologize and offer to only charge for the first night if I needed to check out for lack of water-which is what I was only legally responsible for anyway.

The hotel doesn't have a good appearance on the outside, but it is in a nice residential area very close to the college.

After looking around on the internet, we decided on the Quality Inn near Qualcomm. The hotel is just off of the freeway in a residential neighborhood. There are not many restaurants around there, but that was not a problem for us because we had dinner plans and simply needed a place to sleep. The hotel has a continental breakfast and a small pool available for guests. I'll admit that I was a bit leery when we pulled up to the hotel. It is not fancy at all from the outside. I was using Choice Hotel points to pay for the room and check in was a breeze. Our room was at the end of the parking lot, facing the freeway, under a stairway. I wasn't crazy about the location of the room, but to my pleasant surprise, we didn't hear any noise from the freeway traffic nor any fellow guests outside of our window. When I'd reserved the room, I specifically requested sheets for the hide-a-bed and a crib. They were in the room when we entered and that was great - it was late and it was nice to have the crib ready to go so we didn't have to call for it to be brought down to the room. The room was sufficiently decorated - it appeared to have been updated at some point in the past few years. It was not fancy, but it was clean and cheap - our two criteria for the night. There was a coffee maker, microwave, and refrigerator in the room. The air in the room was stagnant when we entered, but I suspect it's because they don't want the expense of running the AC when no one is there, After about 10 minutes of running the air conditioner, the room was cool and comfortable. The breakfast buffet was a tad bit sparse - waffles, two cereals, juice, coffee, apples, muffins, pastry, bagels and toast. I would have loved to see some more fruit and perhaps boiled eggs or peanut butter, but it was sufficient. Checkout was a breeze. I turned in my key and with a smile I was out the door. If I ever need an inexpensive hotel in this area again, I will consider this hotel. Although I paid with my Choice Hotel points, based on the rates I saw on their website, I think this hotel is fairly priced for what they provide: a clean, quiet facility with a basic breakfast included in the price.", "Date": "August 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cDefinitely a Budget Hotel\u201d", "Author": "sf32640", "ReviewID": "UR36823840", "Content": "We ended up staying here after the Days Inn up the street had no water.

I heard the words \"I don't care\" at least 10 times in the 12 hours we were forced to spend here. Choice Hotels reservations had promised a day-of 6pm cancellation AND a room guarantee. Upon arrival the hotel staff and the 800 reservation agents started blaming me and refused to honor either promise. I'll never believe another word out of Choice Hotels again. We stayed the one night they forced us to pay for - then we left quickly. We wouldn't touch the meager \"breakfast\" in such a dirty hotel - cellophaned muffins and off-brand Cheerios. The mother and daughter checking out before me were complaining that their credit card had been charged twice. After 10 minutes of arguing, the employee finally agreed to credit them back.
