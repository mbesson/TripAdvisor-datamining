The remodeled old house used to be an art gallery and several unique pieces decorated the walls of Hotel Djem. Walking in was a visual delight, with lush colours and a very warm vibe. Our room was the blue walled doubled that overlooked the street. The room albeit small was extremely cozy. I especially liked the art placed above the toilet in the bathroom- everything was so artistically put together. The beds were gorgeous to sleep in- almost made us feel like staying in the whole day. A short walk to the city centre but everything is a short walk in Istanbul- all the great sights seem to be located in the same areas. The host was very attentive and accomodating. One place I recommend to check out is the Rustem Pacha Mosque, a quaint and peaceful mosque tucked away in the city heights that we came about through pure accident- but was one of my favorite experiences in Istanbul.

The hotel is small and charming yet provided first class service. Every day we had yummy, fresh breakfast with hot tea and sweets during day. Mr. Faruk Tekin (the owner) and his team were great and did everything to make us feel at home. After first night of sleeping on a pretty hard mattress, I have asked Mr. Faruk if they have any rooms with softer bed because of my back problems. We even didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t finish our breakfast when the hotel stuff brought to our room an extra thick but soft mattress pad. I am so thankful to them for this special treatment. The hotel is beautifully decorated with the artwork of the owners, who also sell their artwork at two nearby shops. At the end of the trip we have purchased one of the art made by Mr. Faruk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brother, which we really enjoy. The location was perfect. The hotel was on a small back street, very close, just a wall behind to the Blue Mosque. In fact, every morning at dawn, if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sleep too soundly, you can hear a call to prayer, which I loved to listen to. Other old city attractions, like: Hippodrome, Hagia Sofia, Topkapi Palace, Archeological Museum, Yerabatan/Basilica Cistern, Grand Bazaar, and Spice Bazaar, are in a walking distance. A block away from the hotel was small bazaar. The merchandise in the bazaar was similar to the one at the Grand Bazaar.

I requested, and received, room #10 in the annex (only a few doors down from the main hotel), which has a up-close view of the Blue Mosque.

Housekeeping standards were consistently high. The buffet breakfast, served in a nicely decorated area in the main lobby, was by far the best I had during my travels in Turkey. Excellent brewed coffee, lots of fresh juices, perfectly ripe fruits (melons, figs, plums, clementines, pomegranates), vegetables, breads, pastries, cheeses, cold cuts, eggs cooked to order, and marvelous Turkish yogurt (esp. delicious mixed with pine honey and pomegranate seeds). As nice as the amenities are, what I appreciated most about the Djem was the genuine hospitality of Farouk, the owner, and his staff.

We were collected from Ataturk airport in a mini bus and taken to the hotel. My first impression of Istanbul was of a bright, sprawling modern metropolis. We then turned off the main carriageway into the Sultanahmet area where Hotel Djem is situated and were immediately transported into a different world. Hotel Djem is situated in the old town and accessed via fairly narrow cobbled streets with a few shops and a restaurant in the immediate area. The area was clean and had modern amenities but it was echoes of the past that bid us welcome. The hotel looked just like it did online. On arrival we were greeted by Farouk who provided us with Turkish tea and pastries whilst he dealt with the paperwork. The seating was comfortable and everything was clean and tastefully decorated which made us feel relaxed and happy to be there. The hotel is divided into two separate buildings and our room was in the second building about forty metres from the main building and reception. The foyer of this building again was beautiful with large sofas, beautiful rugs and other furnishings that caught the eye. We stayed in room nine which was on the first floor and it was lovely and again, just like the photos online. The room was large, beautifully decorated and had a storage table big enough for three suitcases which stopped them cluttering up the room. There was a large wardrobe and dressing table and a safe for added security. The bathroom was spacious and well stocked with good quality toiletries and towels.Slippers were provided and the beds were comfortable and spacious (I had a large single bed) with good quality linens. There was also a television, a fridge and a good air con system. The 24 hour concierge was also a positive and the internet worked well. Farouk was also kind enough to print certain itineraries when we needed them. The location of Hotel Djem was also a plus. The street was not overly busy during the day and was quiet at night. The old Hippodrome and the Blue Mosque were about a one minute walk away. The Hagia Sofia was about five minutes away and the Grand Bazaar was about ten minutes away. There is also a tramway stop about six minutes away so the location is well serviced in terms of transport and points of interest. Service at Hotel Djem was first class. The breakfasts were lovely and there was a a wide variety from fruit to eggs to local pastries and cut meats and cheese. The butter and the preserves complimented the pastries and a tasty start to the day was rounded off with a nice cup of coffee. Farouk was always on hand to make suggestions as to where to go and how to get there. All our questions were answered in sufficient detail which made our sightseeing run smoothly. Shahin also helped us get front row seats to watch the whirling dervish and also arranged for a car to chauffeur us from the hotel (and back) to one of the delightful fish restaurants nearby-a very enjoyable experience well worth sampling. Shahin was also so helpful when one of my party felt unwell. On the morning of our departure, we were due to be collected early. An alarm call was offered and received and a special breakfast was laid on for us as we were departing before the scheduled one. I really hope to return to Istanbul again and staying at Hotel Djem created the perfect first impression of not only of Istanbul but of Turkey too.TIP-a lot of the rooms can be viewed online and when booking it is possible to find out which room(s) you will be allocated.

But most of all, the quality of the service and the availability of the personal is what made our stay so pleasant. They provided us with valuable tips to visit the city and, when we had some (minor) requests (e.g. a second access card to the rooms, \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6), the general manager just replied: we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll take care of it and then he did\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Istanbul is a great city and we enjoyed all 10 days of our stay.

Location -- The hotel shares its boundary wall with the south western wall of the Blue Mosque. From some of the rooms you get a direct view of the Blue Mosque. It is on a relatively quiet street in Sultanhamet, compared to other streets like Akibiyik Caddessi (which has most of the hotels ) which serves as the tourist ghetto of Sultanhamet. If you have to stay in Sultanhamet -- this hotel is in a very good and convenient location. With a taxi it will cost you about 35-40 lira from the airport. You can also reach the hotel using the railway + tram ( 1.75 + 1.75 lira take the train from the airport level 0, get down at Zeytinburnu, change to the tram station use the Kabatas line and get down at Sultanhamet) alternatively if you are light on luggage you can also reach using just the railway (1.75 lira - take the train from the airport level 0, get down at Cankurtaran, from there the hotel is a 500 metre walk ). Layout -- The main rooms of the hotel are spread across 2 different buildings close to each other. The buildings are former houses which have been turned into a hotel, which adds to the charm of the place. This also means you will not find the typical things you expect in hotels built from the ground up -- like elevators or swimming pools or concierges in uniform opening the door for you. Rooms -- I stayed at the Djem for 5 nights. During my stay I stayed in different rooms. Room 10 has a great view of the blue mosque, Room 1 is on the ground floor and apart from the view it is equally good. The rooms themselves range from compact to fairly large, but they are all impeccably clean and functional. The quality of the furnishings show a lot of thought and taste. The rooms are quiet and provide for very good sleep quality. The bathrooms are all excellently functional custom built units some rooms have a bathtub - others have a shower box. Note that even though the Blue Mosque is right next door -- I did not find the muezzin calls to be a disturbance -- there is a difference between sound and noise, and the muezzin call is part of the ambient sound in Istanbul, it is not loud enough to be called noise. Staff -- The hotel is a complete winner on this count. Starting with Farouk the general manager to Ismael the guy who is most often at the front desk. I have stayed in many hotels where the staff can be impersonal, but these two gentlemen exude genuine friendliness and concern about your well being. They are extremely knowledgable about Istanbul, where to go, what to eat, the history of the place etc. It is a real pleasure and privilege to meet such people. Breakfast -- The breakfast focuses on quality rather than quantity. There is excellent turkish tea, and well made coffee. There is an assortment of tasty fresh fruits (watermelon, kiwi and pineapples), olives, marmalades, cheeses and cold-cuts. Best of all is the cold yogurt which makes a good combo with the marmalades. There is also a selection of breads and pastries. Internet -- fast and free wifi internet in all the rooms.", "Date": "August 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Georgia", "Title": "\u201cVery Comfortable Stay!\u201d", "Author": "scarletlettera", "ReviewID": "UR116393664", "Content": "Stayed here on a return trip for 2 nights.

Due to heavy demand a room in the Hotel was not available for our entire stay, so we were offered a room in their Apart Hotel nearby. We were completely satisfied. It was a brisk 5 minute walk or a 10 minute stroll away from the hotel. Easy walk. We ate breakfast at the Hotel each morning. Our plan is usually to have a heavy breakfast and either a mid afternoon snack and a restaurant supper or a heavy afternoon meal followed by a snack in the evening. Djem breakfast accomodated that strategy. I usually had two eggs- scrambled, fried, boiled or an omelet, whatever requested. Then toast with jam and butter, cereal with milk and strawberries and pomegranite seeds added in. Coffee or tea, and a choice of pomegranite, apple or orange juice. Then a few tablespoons of a variety of olives. Then several quartered tomatoes plus cucumbers. That usually did it for me although cold cuts and a variety of cheeses were available. The room in the apart hotel were tastefully decorated and furnished with what is needed for a family in an apartment- small refrigerator, microwave, knives, forks, spoons, plates, glasses, mugs, bowls, scissors, corkscrew, hair blowdryer, you get the idea. One queensized bed and two regular sized beds. A small table with 4 chairs, a sitting area with 3 chairs. A large closet, ample drawer space to unload your luggage. Then the service: Matin reserved two tickets on the train from Istanbul to Urgup in Cappadocia. He waited until the tickets were discounted. Roundtrip tickets in our private sleeper compartment for two coming and going to Urgup cost about 210 turkish lira, about $140 total for two nights lodging and the trip. Daily recommendations regarding everything from restaurant recommendations to directions to everywhere. I guess, if I were picky, I could find things to complain about during such a long stay, but I just don't feel like doing it considering how much I liked the people at Djem.
