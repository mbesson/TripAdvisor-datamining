For the last 3 weeks I have called accounting, reservations and managment no fewer than propably 10 times (most of which went unreturned), and have been unable to get two erroneous \"no show\" charges removed from my bill. To be clear I paid over $2300.00 for my five night stay at the hotel, so imagine my suprise to find two additional $487.52 charges on my bill appear mysteriously after my stay. I never received any notification or invoice of any sort from the hotel. When I called Tribeca Grand they explained these were \"no show\" charges to which I explained that I \"did show\" and had already been charged for my stay. I explained that when I checked-in the desk clerk spent 30 mintues trying to locate my reservation and could not, she said the system was on the \"blink\". She said she would enter a new reservation into the system for me and reconcile it on the back-end. Tribeca Grand said that this did not make sense and they believed it was actually Expedia's fault for entering a double booking. I had Expedia call them and explain they did not double book, but reservations said there was nothing they could do, since this is not what their records showed. They said I'd need to speak to management. I'm still waiting for the elusive management to call me back, and am in the process of filing a fraud complaint with my credit card company. My company has a corporate relationship with Tribeca Grand, so I've stayed there over the last 5 years, and have been consistently disturbed by the musty and dustry feel of the rooms and overall unresponsive service. That being said, I never imagined I'd experience the type of abusive treatment by staff and management that I have around this issue. I took a look at other negative reviews of this hotel (in particular the one entitle \"Overall Horrible Experience\" on 9/17) and chuckled to find the GM respond that this type of thing never happens, well I'm certainly experiencing it now, so let me assure you it does.

We made reservations very last minute, like driving over the GW last minute. We secured a couple of rooms at a very reasonable price, just under $300, and made our way to the hotel. It takes up a neat triangular end of a block. The valet was exceptionally friendly and helpful, which really was confusing considering. Once inside, reception was well-staffed and was very quick to get champagne in our hands. We were two couples looking for a relaxing night away from the kids, and between the valet's friendliness and the quick and easy champagne we all thought we were in heaven! We were assigned rooms and made our way up. The hotel is one of those 1970s central atrium designs that don't seem to work for a number of reasons, one of which is noise. Especially in a property with healthy nightlife, I was a little apprehensive about getting a good nights sleep. Each room has a white noise speaker over the door to try to drown out any sounds coming from the atrium. So, the rooms are sort of Jetson/Mojave with sleek jet age lines done in browns and oranges. They looked dated and worn. The desk and chair were not very comfortable or usable. The bathroom, too, had a sort of \"I used to be super cool\" vibe to it. Interestingly, we all thought if the hotel stays exactly as it is it will be back at the cutting edge of style in another ten years, sort of retro chic turn of the new century. We went down to the huge lobby lounge and asked for a wine list. The lounge was very quiet and relaxed, and we got very prompt and friendly service. We got a wine list, with the caveat that most everything on it was out of stock. We got an inventory list that we could order from, but it was their only one and couldn't be left with us. We finished up and left for dinner and NYC fun, returning to the lobby lounge later that night. It was completely different, loud and raucus and what you'd expect. We found our same seats, which were on comfortable couches along an elevator tower, tried to order, with one of us wanting some food. With all of the servers running around like maniacs, one of us went to the lounge manager to ask about ordering food. The manager told him to go to the bar as they serve until they close. He went to the bar, but was told the bar doesn't serve food, and the bartender walked away. He went back to the lounge manager who walked with him to the bar. The manager explained to the bartender that she does serve food and left my friend at the bar with the bartender to order. The bartender wandered off and let him stand there for twenty minutes, so out he goes to find the lounge manager again who took the order. An hour later we had everything we ordered, and were nicely sobered up. So we ordered more drinks and stayed until they closed. That'll teach 'em. Overall, the hotel isn't old enough to be cool and isn't new enough to be cool. It's pretty big, and I'm sure it's a struggle to keep rooms occupied so deals like mine aren't rare. The rooms are not the smallest in NYC, but they don't make you feel special, either. And I'm just not a fan of the indoor atrium as the noise coming in when the bar/lounge was really cranking was really annoying. We cranked up the white noise machine until it sounded like we were stuck inside a TV playing snow, but it didn't help with the thump thump of the bass. Some staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, and some were reminders of how surly and obnoxious bad hotel service in NYC was in the '90s. It's a pretty good value for the money paid, but I just can't figure out why you'd stay there. There are so many options in NYC I am sure it's hard for a hotel to find it's niche, and I hope that this one does.", "Date": "December 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reno NV", "Title": "\u201cCool and comfortable\u201d", "Author": "Martini_A_Go_Go", "ReviewID": "UR121840361", "Content": "Spent only one night but found it to be cool & comfortable, with some great food & shopping options nearby.

This hotel is barely in Tribecca, right at Canal and 6th Avenue, heading into one of the tunnels. So, my first night there I spent all night listening to the traffic on 6th. Needless to say I didn't sleep much. I called the desk at 6 am, and asked to be moved. Apparently, this is a common request for rooms on that side, as the person who answered wasn't surprised. I was told the hotel had been full the night before and they would move me that day, but i need to pack everything. Fine, until i went to the front desk to turn in my key. The same nasty woman who I had checked me in the night before, acted like I was a horrible person for expecting them to move me. I think they are horrible for putting me in such an awful room when I was there for three nights. I've NEVER asked to move rooms at a hotel before. and, did i mention I was part of a large group staying at both this and their sister hotel the SoHo grand? I also thought the paint scheme of dark browns was awful. My second night was better, but when I walked up on my third and final night, there were paparazzi everywhere. Apparentlly some c or d list celebrity was gracing the hotel with their presence for an event. The \"excellent\" treatment I received continued when I was asked repeatedly to show my room key. Obviously, my suit gave away the fact I had no business being at the party. The loud music coming from below kept me up until about 2 in the morning. Finally exhaustion set in, rather than a reduction of noise volume.Each room is equipped with a \"noise machine\" in the wall. To me it sounded like static on a TV set and I turned it off. It was as bad as the street noise. My favorite thing about the hotel was the \"drink\" selection on every floor. Instead of the typical in room coffee maker, there was a machine on every floor with a full selection of hot beverages. Not being a coffee drinker, I appreciated the choice. However, if you're like me and expect a shot of caffeine first thing, definitely bring your cutest pajamas and a pair of slippers if you have to wander the halls. I wouldn't stay here again, if my life depeneded on it, and am sad I didn't get to stay at the So Ho Grand. My colleagues there seemed to have a much better experience.

The hotel was kind enough to send up a work table and some chairs. The lighting in the room was a little dark, but it was functional. The hotel was very service oriented. Any time we needed anything, they jumped quickly. One thing I liked is that internet was included and you could print on their printer at the front desk for free, which was very helpful. The staff was very courtious. We ate in the hotel restaurant for the first 3 or 4 meals. My biggest complaint was that I thought the restaurant service was a bit slow and the food was way over priced. After paying $25 for some eggs and coffee, I talked to one of the bell men and they pointed me to a diner around the corner which was fantastic and my choice for breakfast each day. The food at the hotel was very good though, it just was pricey. They had just finished remodeling the bar area while we were there and it it really nice. Drinks are expensive. There are all kinds of great restaurants around the hotel (mostly Italian). Plenty of things within walking distance. My biggest complaint would be the workout facility. It was very small. It had dumbells up to 50 pounds and that was all the weight equipment. It had 2 treadmills (one was broken), a bike and a couple of elipticals. My recommendation would be to expand it a bit and add some better equipment. So, I ended up jogging down to the Hudson most days. The views on those runs are great and makes the time go by quickly.

Soon after, we quickly realized this hotel was anything but the luxury it advertises. The rooms were very small and dusty. There was a musty smell throughout and it was obvious the rooms were not thoroughly cleaned. Instead, they were quickly cleaned on the surface to mistakenly appear fresh. We tried our best to not allow the cleanliness of the hotel to negatively affect our stay. The real problems occurred soon after... During the checkout process I signed the statement to agree to the room charge and all was said and done until four days later.... I notice on our statement that we were charged a $65 parking fee but did not have a car with us!! I called and felt confident the matter would quickly be resolved, boy was I wrong! I was transferred to the \"Accounting Department\". I then left 3 messages that week and finally received a call back. The woman seemed very uninterested and explained she needed an approval from the hotel manager and would call me back - never happened! Fast forward 3 1/2 weeks later, 2 visits to the hotel speaking with the manager, at least 15 phone calls to the accounting department (phone calls go straight to voice mail at any time in the day and NEVER received a call back, not once!!) and numerous calls to the hotel manager (each time was told she was \"interviewing\", never receiving a call back, yet again.. not once!!). At one point, upon one of the two visits to the hotel, the manager was unsure how to refund due to a \"new system\" and printed out a statement which appeared to resolve the matter, although I was not confident. I waited a week and it never appeared on my statement. I was tossed around like a volley ball and no one I spoke with ever attempted to take responsibility or even seem the least bit remorseful. In a desperate plea to the hotel manager I explained I never hear back from the Accounting Department, again receiving the response - \"there is nothing we can do\". The matter was FINALLY resolved a month later and mysteriously appeared on my statement after I called the hotel in tears due to endless frustration. I never received a call back from the manager (was told she would call me within the hour over a week ago), no apology, no acknowledgment of the issue.... nothing!

However this time it was a personal trip and I spend most of my personal time in Downtown, so I decided that I will have to stay in the SoHo/TriBeCa/Lower East Side. I researched a lot of hotels in the area and one thing in common is that they are very pricey compared to the competitive Mid-town hotels. TriBeCa Grand offered the best value for my stay and it is in the area I wanted to stay so I decided for it. Furthermore, the reviews on Tripadvisor have been all positive, even compared to the supposedly more popular & hip sister hotel, SoHo Grand. I still had a concern that the hotel might be all hype with no substance. But I was so pleased that I was proven wrong! From the moment I arrived, the staff were very friendly and helpful, and no pretence. The room feels plush and luxe, and had a beautiful warm homely feel about it while still maintaining a simple minimalist approach. I booked a Superior King Room and it was a large room (definitely for NY standard) on the 6th floor looking out the street and it was very quiet during the day as well as night. The bed was very comfortable with beautiful soft sheets and the pillows are good variety (some softer than the other which give me options to choose). The large floor lamp by the bed has dimmer switch which is great - I know this seems random, but believe me, as someone who appreciates ambiance, I get so frustrated by hotels which only have super bright lights everywhere! -. I also asked for a pet fish to accompany me during my stay and that was certainly a really cute novel touch to my stay at TriBeCa Grand. The location is perfect. I was quite surprised at how close it is to the more hyped up sister hotel, SoHo Grand. It is walking distance to SoHo, NoLiTa etc. And there's subway lines that will take you up town easily. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at TriBeca Grand. I love that it's a sophisticated, hip hotel without the pretence. It's very warm, homely and just simply beautiful and sensuous.

Tribeca itself has wonderful restaurants, and we ate locally most evenings. Definitely go to Bubbys for breakfast and the Tribeca Grill. Also, ask the fantastic and knowledgeable concierge to book you a table at the River Cafe (under the Brooklyn Bridge....with incredible views of Manhattan) The hotel itself was stunning. Immaculately clean, staff brilliant and very helpful, with a real downtown vibe. This hotel is beautiful with stunning decor and architecture. The food fabulous too, and loved the breakfasts here. Our room was comfortable and a good size.We really enjoyed the Church Lounge: plenty going on in the evenings.Perfect to people watch. Bartenders friendly and chatty, and we spent quite a few evenings here. The music was great too. Saturday night was definitely party night, but we didn't hear much noise at all,and we were on the second floor.

My husband has been asleep most of the night (very long day), so I've tried to enjoy the hotel on my own. From where I sit, I have a view of a parking lot. There are 10 mid-level cars parked there. 6th Avenue is empty. The view is dark and dreary. I close the curtains and turn on the television for some laughs. Every time I choose a channel to watch I get a message that reads: \"If you want to view this channel, please call customer support.\" I accidentally turn off the television and can't get it to turn back on again. I decide that, rather than going down to the lounge where I was told earlier that I can't sit on a sofa because it was \"reserved\" for apparently invisible guests (nobody is here), I would write this review because I think if I hear the hostess give me that \"reserved\" BS again, I'll scream into the cavernous, empty lounge \"Nobody is here!\" and my echo will bounce back for eternity. A few other notes: when we arrived I asked about the menu and was told by the gentleman carrying my luggage that a new menu had just been devised for the new types of clients that comprised the majority of the hotel guests here: \"Business travelers\". (Note to management: if your primary client base is business travelers rather than leisure travelers, you are not a luxury hotel and nobody is going to think you are because you put cardboard signs on your table to pretend they are \"reserved\"). Anyway- back to that newly devised menu- 7 entrees are available for dinner: steak, pasta, chicken, fish, lobster, burger ranging from $14 to \"market price\". I feel like I'm eating at TGI Fridays! Wow, how much more elegant and special could this night get?

I'm giving it 3 stars because it wasn't horrible, it just wasn't as nice as we had expected. I'm not the type of person who expects perfection by any means, this was just a let down. - The Staff - was great, very friendly & helpful. We did have some room service mistakenly delivered to our room, however we explained that they must have the wrong room & there was never another issue w/ that. Flowers were supposed to be in the room when we arrived & were not, however they were delivered shortly after we got to the room. - The Room - we had the \"Studio\" room I believe, room 418 w/ a separate living room & bedroom. This was not exactly the case. The \"living room\" was a tiny love seat & table separated from the bed by a closet that didn't go all the way to the ceiling, more of a 3/4 wall. The space around the bed was literally enough room to walk & that's it. We had a hard time figureing out where we could even open our suitcases besides on the bed! The carpet & curtains were stained, the love seat had a tear in the back of one of the cushions where feathers were coming out, the coffe table had drink ring marks all over it. things just looked kind of beat up, like nothing had been maintained or updated since the place 1st opened. The sheets were kind of scratchy, but the bed & pillows themselves were comfortable. The whole room had only 1 air vent which was near the love seat, so during the night the bed area would get very warm.....the 1 a/c vent just isn't enough to circulate & cool the entire room. It was nearly impossible for us to sleep here, the noise was just out of control.....horns honking all night long, people screaming in the streets, faint thumping of music from downstairs. I literally got a couple hours of sleep the 1st night, the second night was slightly better probably from sheer exhaustion. The room had a \"white noise\" machine at the door which could not even be heard at the bed....completely pointless in this room at least! The hotel is surrounded by very busy streets, so the noise is kind of unavoidable I guess. They should have some sort of \"black out\" device on the windows that would muffle some noise. The noise situation was really teh deal breaker for me. Half the fun of a get away is to sleep in & not be woken up all night long which was just not possible here. -The Bathroom - The bathroom was a good size but lacked any place to hang a towel & the water pressure was very weak. The toilet & bathtub were very just normal....looked like the standard thing they would put in an apartment. Not exactly what you expect at a \"high end hotel\" The products were great! So over all it wasn't horrible, it just wasn't very nice. It surely wasn't overly trendy! We saw a very wide range of guests....some in their 60's, some with kids, some younger couples. So, I'm thinking this may have been a super trendy hot spot at one point, but it definately is not that anymore. The decor was strange, it looked like a 1970's motel room....actually from the 70's. Nothing looked nice enough or new enough to come across as being current. I'm sure the \"vintage/modern\" look is what they were going for, which probably would have worked had everything not looked so beat up & shabby. So, I would recommend you look elsewhere for a nice hotel in the Tribeca/Soho area!!!!", "Date": "October 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cHip Hotel\u201d", "Author": "NYstateofmind1968", "ReviewID": "UR84980646", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel for 6 nights in Oct 2010.

As many have stated, this tends to be a loud hotel based on its location. This is true. In a normal room, the sound machine would probably be very helpful, however; in a suite, the sound machine does not extend to the bedroom area. Obviously, this is where you would want the white noise for sleep purposes. It makes no sense why they would put it in the living area. The service is terrible as well. I ordered room service and was told to expect my food in 30 minutes. When I called back after an hour, I was told, \"there are several people in front of you so you'll have to wait\". I ordered a burger....seems like that would be an easy order to handle. I visited the fitness center, and was not able to even work out as the treadmills were in very bad condition.

Two blocks from SoHo, it was a very easy walk into the neighborhood for great shopping and restaurants. The staff at the hotel was very friendly. We enjoyed the staff. The hotel wasn't dirty, but it wasn't clean. It seemed like it was thrown together in a rush and lacked attention to detail. That said, I would stay there again if it wasn't for the noise. The reviews on this site prepared me for the noise. We had a room on the top floor opposite Avenue of the Americas-- the quieter street of the two. so we had minimal noise from either the street or the courtyard area of the interior of the building. The noise we got was from next door. Our neighbor had a coughing attack Saturday night at about 4:00am. It's one thing if the attack was such that she was falling over, banging on the wall in need of help. No, this was the old normal 'I have a cold\" cough that went on for two hours. What was especially disconcerting about it was that it felt like it was coming from within our room. The noise reduction system does drown out noise coming from outside the room, but because it is located near the hotel rom door, it does not drown out noise from neighbors. We could hear-- and follow-- normal conversations the following morning. This all happened the second night of our stay. The first night we were neighborless and going to and from the hotel Friday afternoon and night into Saturday morning and afternoon very excited about the property and looking forward to returning. But after hearing our neighbors clearly the second night of our stay, we had second thoughts. That was a big enough downer to question whether we would return.

It was by no means large, but plenty of room for two people to move around. The bathroom was clean and larger than others I've seen in New York, too. Despite the thumping club on the main floor, the room was very quiet due to a built-in white noise machine. The hotel is generally very stylish, and a great location downtown, close to the city's best bars and restaurants. Cons: I can't think of any deal breakers other than price. We managed to get a great rate, and the hotel will often have specials and package deals. However, it's pricey without one. The Sunday brunch buffet was EXTREMELY expensive and probably not worth the price, but we used our credit. Though, next time, I'd use the credit for afternoon cocktails and get a deli bagel or go to Balthazar for brunch.

What was even more upsetting about this spiritless 'policy' was the management's treatment of it. When someone is presented with a piece of cake with a candle on it for one's birthday then it is customary to sing 'happy birthday', however you are not allowed to do this at the Grand. The manager tried to stop us singing by doing the cut throat action, when she failed she just threw the cake down on the table and swiftly scurried off. When I challenged her on her absolutely terrible management of this situation she simply told me that we were 'disrespecting her by singing'! I literally could not believe my ears considering she was bringing out a piece of cake with a candle on it for a birthday celebration! Ludicrous.

It always surprises me when people comment on room size. People need to understand that in NYC, your room is going to be SMALL compared to rooms in less populated cities. Yes the bathrooms are small, yes you can barely get your suitcases in the room, but that's NYC, deal with it. The decor of the room was modern yet comfy. The white noise maker was GREAT, and blocked out the city street noise. The bed and linens were comfy and the bathroom was small but sufficient. The plasma tv was great and they had a good selection of channels, but you have to pay for internet, which is unfortunate. The doorman was awesome, courteous and friendly, the front desk staff was prompt, friendly and even upgraded us upon check-in. The bags were taken care of, and later transported to our room before we even inquired about them (we arrived before check-in time). The interior is very New York chic, but not intimidating, the restaurant was busy, the bar was full every night. The location of this hotel was phenomenal for anyone who LOVES bargain shopping...a two minute walk to Canal street, 10 minutes from the old cobblestone streets of Soho, about 20 minutes down to the financial district to go to the infamous Century 21. We ate breakfast most morning's in a diner, but if you don't want to sit down and eat, there was a Dunkin' Donuts right on Canal street, so you could always opt to grab a coffee. The restaurants in the area were also to die for: Nobu and Mr. Chow were a 5 minute walk, make sure you make reservations way in advance! We can't wait to return!

I had an interview at the end of June (were put up elsewhere for that) and so I was able to take it all in when we got to the Tribeca Grand. My husband and I booked this hotel through Hotwire (chose the 'boutique' option) and read the reviews. Like all hotels, there are a couple of negative reviews here but they are the exceptions. Having lived in the UK for almost 7 years, I was nervous about the tipping at what markets itself as a posh hotel. The location was great. We do everything the hard way, so took the subway everywhere and walked a lot of the time. The subway stop is just around the corner, there is lots in the local area, and even walking to the 4th of July fireworks near Brooklyn Bridge was not too far. We even took the subway back to JFK for our flight and it was manageable - not recommended though! Must-do's nearby: Canal Street and the nearby shops - nothing like it anywhere!, shops up Broadway (keep walking!), a couple of nice trendy eateries/wine bars nearby (did not partake - too busy) or diners the other direction, and the legendary Bubby's for brunch (120 Hudson St). The door staff at the Tribeca Grand were always courteous and were extremely gracious when we did tip them (for taking our bags for the day when we were leaving, and then when retrieving them). Furthermore, the desk staff were very nice in our brief interactions with them, including getting our keys, info, and leaving our valuables in the safe (there is a small one in the room as well) and finally checking out. They seemed to be bending over backwards for customers, too - I was waiting in the lobby as they helped a bride-to-be who was putting up her bridal party there and had a complicated arrangement of treats to leave in the rooms. The room was small (a standard double) but not overly so. What you would expect for a big city. Large windows and clean lines in the decor helped to make it feel airy and we had plenty of space for all of our things. Nice storage for clothes, etc. The bathroom was chic and in good order. Wonderful toiletries, which the staff replaced entirely each day. Good hairdryer, although a) I brought my own and b) it was so humid that once I stepped outside all styling was undone anyway. There were comments from other reviewers about the noise from the atrium. This wasn't a problem for us, even over the weekend. It made for a great atmosphere during the day and evening. The whole hotel is extremely stylish and if you have the chance, take a peek at the film-screening area downstairs (same level as the gym). You have to pay for the wireless connection, and we didn't need it much so I didn't try it. Everything was excellent but I didn't have any food or drinks there as I got the impression that everything was a bit too expensive. If I'd paid full price for the room, I might not have seen it as so great. (We paid about $200/night.) But the location was excellent too, so perhaps it's worth it?!

Because there was a bit of a savings and a few extra things my business partner and I booked the \"Tryst in Tribeca\" package which included a \"full american breakfast delivered to your room\" along with champagne on arrival (which we never got, maybe you had to ask for it). We ordered the breakfast from the room service menu the first night - when it was delivered the next morning the guy gave us the bill with the full amount charged to it. I told him that we had the \"tryst\" package and the breakfast was included. I gave him our card that listed all of the items that came in our package and he seemed satisfied with that and said he would correct it. Next day we had arrived too late the night before to order from the room service menu. The next morning we called down to the front desk to see if it was too late to order breakfast that was included in our package - the person that answered said it wasn't and to get \"whatever you like\". So we got a hold of room service and got two breakfasts (salmon and whitefish platters - not cheap at $25 each), one fruit salad, two oj's and coffee and tea. They brought it up to us and again gave us the bill ($108), we told them that we had the \"tryst\" package and that it was included. They acted like they knew nothing so we told them to call the front desk and have them explain that it was included.... getting frustrated at this point since our room cost about $400 per night you would think that room service and the front desk could communicate with each other. So.... that morning I go to check out and, of course, the bill has both of our breakfasts on it. Then after I explain about our \"full american breakfasts delivered to our room\" package the desk person brings it back to the manager. Apparently we had a $60 limit for each breakfast. We were supposed to have received a voucher when we checked in that explained that information (never received it). I explain to them that I never received it and didn't know there was a spending limit (which you would think they would explain to you when you check in or even when you book the reservation... in case your voucher isn't in the packet that they give you.) After 15 minutes of waiting around (and the next customer behind me checking out and having their breakfasts on the bill as well) I had to leave. The manager wasn't able to speak right then so he called me while I was in the cab - I explained myself that we never received a voucher. He said he couldn't do anything about it and that we would have to pay the difference in the amount - he was really not nice about it and basically made me feel like crap. I was really disappointed in their customer service which is why I'm writing this review. If he had been a little more flexible and understanding and offered to not charge for that extra $60 or so bucks (which there is about the cost of 2 oj's, coffee tea and a bagel) then I would be writing a much nicer review. The room was pretty - although the tv sound kept getting softer then really loud. The bed was comfy. The food was yummy. I just wish the people had been more accommodating and understanding.

Hotel room Exactly what I expected. Not huge, not small. Lovely king bed, large flat screen TV. Last review said he/she needed 2 controls..huh?? One remote operated the TV, large channel selection, decent movies. Bose clock radio was good. In room safe is secured using the credit card you used to book. Mini bar looked good but as you would expect...expensive. Toiletries, lovely, peppermint and lavender or some such thing...although conditioner was almost too thick to get out of the bottle. Had no need for the white noise in the room......I had no issues with noise form the bar below but was on top floor. Aircon worked well and was fairly quiet Grand Guest I had signed up for this but booked through Priceline so they said it wasn't applicable....I disagreed and asked for a manager, pointed out to her that this being my first visit, I would contend that looking after me now might bring me back; the promise of a foam pillow , cookies and milk on a future stay when booked through their website only (thus paying 50% more) would not....surely repeat business is the point....she agreed...2 glasses of champage, milk, cookies, foam pillows, goldfish (Bruce - lol), continental breakfast each morning and an 8th floor room soon were agreed upon. Services Free internet behind the concierge or WiFi throughout (I think). Didn't eat there so no idea about that but did try to get some cheesecake about 1am on Sunday morning - room service had an answering machine, I went to bed. Bar NYC bar staff can be a bit brusque but these lot added ignorant, slow, inept and unhelpful to the mix. Friday midday, just arrived, meeting others, went to bar. Sat for 20 minutes unserved (was alone). Female bartender was stocking up/ getting ice etc, fair enough...she sees me gives me the fakest smile ever...no words....looks at me and gives a slight upward motion of her head which I took to mean \"Hello sir, how are you today? What can I get you?\"........ Saturday night, midnight - bar closed despite there being about 15 persons there, mostly residents....so this whole nightclub thing that seems to be a problem here certainly wasn't this night. I asked for the bar manager.....never appeared, I then watched the greasy haired Lothario wannabe behind the bar serve 2 young girls a full 15 minutes after I was told the bar was shut. I walked right over there, in his line of sight, prepared to let it go and just get a couple of drinks, to be roundly and completely ignored. I lost it at this point so waved him over and told him that his lack of professionalism was beginning to annoy me and that this was not his personal pick-up joint. He seems a tad nervous as I'm a big man, not that I threatened anyone or anything......some manager arrives to 'deal with me' however, I'm a professional, decent, nice person as is my girlfriend so what started out with him preparing for an arguement dissolved into me being apologised to, told that the senior person present chooses when to close the bar based on number of people there etc. made sense to me and I told him that but also told him what had gone on with the girls and Lothario boy...4 drinks were soon in my hands and off we popped to our room. Sunday night 2am - bar closed prior to my arrival, snotty nosed little runt behind the bar treated me like utter filth, sort of like \"Duh, it's 2am...what,are you stupid\" kind of attitude, with less words. I couldn't be bothered with another fight so we went to bed. Check out They tried to charge me for the cookies and the breakfast (I signed nothing as they were Grand Guest amenities)...this was a different person to the one that I checked in with. Bored with it al now, I asked for another manager, luckily same one came out...nearly had a fit when she saw me again..lol....sorted the problem out. I say all this to highlight that their lack of customer service throughout the property ended up costing them a few $$. A simple \"I'm sorry Sir, we're closed for the night but I'd be happy to connect you to Room Service or send something up with them\" etc etc was all I was looking for. 3 bar staff and not one of them with the knowledge of how to acknowledge a guest or prioritise those standing at it awaiting service. Given the inconvenience that the bar appears to be to many other guests (to the extent that white noise is in every room) I would have to assume that it is the main source of income here or at least a very significant one...if that is the case, get your staff better trained and learn to milk the cash cow. General Good area, nice, clean property, bell staff excellent, managers excellent but working too hard to rectify mistakes by/atitudes of their staff. I doubt I'll go back by choice but if I Priceline it and this comes up I'll be happy with that too.

One of the people I was traveling with wanted their windows open, and had to call someone to open them for him. What a pain! Would be nice it you could open and close the windows yourself. Additionally, all three people in my party had trouble figuring out how to use the TVs in their rooms (there were two controls that had to be used). Finally, they give you a questionnaire to fill out when you check in about your prefereces (what type of pillow, snack, etc.) which gets you all excited about your assumed special treatment, and find out you get none of your preferences on your first stay; they just keep the information on file should you ever stay there again. It would be helpful if this were communicated up front so as to set expectations, as all of the people in my travel party were expecting their preferences (foam pillows, chocolates, etc.)! On the positive side, the bed was very comfy.

The room was quite spacious (we upgraded) and had a good view over Avenue of the Americas. The only noisy night was a Thursday when a DJ played in the bar for a party.

The hotel is ideally situated if you want to shop downtown in the SoHo area, but it is also 5 minutes walk away from Canal Street which has loads of different subway lines to all parts of the city. Getting a cab is very easy too as the hotel is at the intersection of 2 main roads. The hotel staff were incredibly friendly and helpful.

The rooms are very stylish with all the mod cons and a coffee machine is situated on each floor with free fill ups - always helpful for the late nights and early starts!

There is loads to do in the area, Canal St is literally round the block - not my thing but its there all the same! - the shopping in Soho is better than uptown, unless you want the big stores like Macys, but there is a Bloomingdales and pretty much everything else you could want. There are some great restaurants in the area but I would also recommend the Eggs Benedict at the hotel for breakfast and I would recommend you eat there one night during your stay as it really was that good.

The rooms are modern and relaxing. All rooms have a large TV and a Bose CD player/Radio. You can borrow Bose sound docks for ipods as well.

Maybe they are small by American standards (they do not have 2 double beds in them as some American hotel rooms do, the bathrooms are on the smaller side - there are not two sinks - just one!) but it was fine for us! The service in the hotel was generally very good. Our bags were taken care of for us, the hotel doorman flagged down taxis for us, staff were always very courteous and helpful and room service was fairly rapid (took around 20 minutes from ordering - the same amount of time that they said it would take when we ordered). The rooms were cleaned daily and to a good standard. We booked the Tryst in Tribeca package. It is definitely worth booking one of their packages if you can. It actually worked out cheaper than simply booking 3 nights at the hotel and in addition we got an American Breakfast every morning (via room service), champagne and strawberries on arrival, a free cocktail at the bar (they are VERY strong - be warned!) and late checkout on the last day. We felt that by New York Hotel standards, the hotel was very good value for money - as New York is a very expensive place to stay. However, we haven't stayed at other New York hotels so we can't compare to other hotels. The breakfast by the way, was very good - and kept us going until late into the afternoon! Other reviewers have complained about the noise from the bar. Yes the bar can get noisy, but we requested and got a high floor room. We were on the 7th floor (there are 8 floors) and we couldn't hear a thing from the bar even without the white noise. (They have white noise machines in the rooms to mask the noise). Tribeca itself is quite a good location but it depends what you are looking for. There are lots of good restaurants around (We went to Nobu Next Door and would highly recommend it) but for bars, you might want to go to nearby SoHo (about a 10 min walk) as Tribeca is quite quiet at night. SoHo is also excellent for shops! The nearest subway is a 2 minute walk away - and it's about a 10 - 15 minute ride to Fifth Avenue or Times Square when you want to go to bigger department stores or see the sights of New York.

The rooms aren't too spacious, but it's Manhattan -- what else do you expect? The Church Lounge has better-than-average food and it's a great spot to people watch. The location (Tribeca) is perfect; it's a prime neighborhood for foodies and you're not too far from just about every subway line. Plus, cab fares to the major nightclubs and lounges won't break the bank. Speaking of $$$, my only complaint is the hotel's policy of charging $150 extra per night on top of the agreed-upon rate. They say it covers any damages to the room. Therefore, upon checking in for a 4-night stay, you're wallopped for an extra $600 that doesn't get credited back to your account for a few days after check-out. Kinda makes you want to break a lamp.

In the same area that you will find the ice machine, there is a single cup coffee maker where you can make drip coffee, mocha coffee, tea, etc. The area includes sugar, sweet & low and creamer for your use. This is especially nice for those (like me) that need coffee to get going in the morning, but don't want to pay for room service to bring you a pot of coffee. The rooms are quite comfortable. Beds are nice, Bose alarm clocks and a variety of CD's are in the rooms. Work desk with Aeron chair are nice for those of us traveling on business, although thanks to the wireless internet, I usually found myself working while propped up with pillows in bed watching the lovely LCD television. Windows do open a teeny bit if you like fresh air, but they are difficult to open and close. Housekeeping was spotty, but usually quite good. There were occasions where a newspaper I had left behind to read in the evening was thrown out. All in all, a minor issue as usually the service was very good. Room service is definitely over-priced, but the food is good (not great) and usually arrives quite quickly.

There is a great mix of larger stores and small boutiques. So whether the location is good depends on why you're visiting NYC... most 1st timers would probably be better somewhere further up town, but if you want to be in a hip neighbourhood that is good for wandering around and people watching, this one is great. I love some of the restaurants in that area (e.g. Balthazar on Spring Street, Public on Elizabeth St) and being able to walk back via a couple of bars is a great, easy night out. There is a subway station outside the hotel, and really you can walk anywhere - one morning I walked to all the way to Central Park and it only took an hour or so. The staff were OK. Check in, front desk and room service were excellent - helpful, polite and warm. For me the doormen were the only weak spot - in 6 days I think they saw me coming three times, otherwise I was ignored as I entered the building. The only time this really annoyed me was when I was using the pedestrian crossing outside, coming back from a long day's shopping and one of the doormen flagged a car to park on the crossing, nearly running me over. Hmmm. Clearly a man driving a sports car was more important than a girl crossing the road in flip flops.... To be fair, the doorman did look pretty sheepish when he saw me entering the hotel. But to me it shouldn't matter if I was a guest or not - it was still rude. So I could have done without their attitude - this was the low of my stay. The room was nice - not amazing, but a LOT better than the death-by-chintz that is some of the larger hotels in NYC. Inside the room, the linen was good, the TV large, the mini bar overpriced, the bathroom decent and well designed. I had no problem with noise from the bar downstairs, even at the weekend. I had a free continental breakfast included, and I have to say it was great. A basket of banana bread, croissant, Danish, muffin, scone, pain au chocolat, with juice and tea/coffee.... Filling, and a good way to fuel all that walking around. My room was well kept and the cleaning staff followed the \"Busy\" or \"Clean\" door signs so you could sleep in if you wanted. The facilities are good - the gym was OK, pretty standard (2 bikes, 2 x-trainers, 2 runners, 1 weights station), the bar was good (nice mojitos!) and I only ate once at the restaurant. The restaurant decor was a little scrappy (e.g. peeling seats, scuffed floor) but the food was good and the service well-meaning. There is a small business centre, where you can go online and print so I used this rather than lug my laptop onto the plane. Unless you need it for work, I would recommend this facility rather than bringing your own laptop and paying the high room-connection fee. All in all I enjoyed my stay and would probably go back. Other hotels I considered were The Gansevoort, The Bowery and The Mercer, but the Tribeca Grand won out on price Vs value. So glad I didn't go to The Gansevoort, as I was not wowed by the Meat Packing district when I went there (I find the whole \"MePa\" renaissance thing pretty half-assed). The Bowery looks great but the location is not as good as the Tribeca's and The Mercer would have been a little too pricey for 6 nights.

We ordered room service meals for our first night in the hotel and the standard of cooking was disappointing. Far below the levels I expect of a hotel with 4 stars.

We said yes and he then had to go find the 'hostess' who then took us to our seats approx. 3 steps away from where he stopped us!!! The hotel seems to suffer from a lack of confidence from its staff. People don't seem to know what they're doing. There also seems to be too many staff more interested in preening themselves rather than attending to the needs of guests.

The interiors... post-industrial chic - emphasis on chic, exposed iron and metal/wood (very brown...could use some better lighting in the hall/corridors) but stunning atrium.

Towels are small, and a bit rough cotton. The room, bed is comfortable and the noise reduction filter (necessary on a friday night when the atrium bar noise reaches trendy-party crescendo!) worked...thankfully!

Firstly what a fantastic hotel & what a great location this was in. The Hotel itself blends into the surrounding area, no big hotel sign there's just a clock that stands outside the hotel with the name on it - so you would'nt think that there was an hotel here. The hotel staff were brilliant very helpful & friendly, we could'nt have asked for more. The concierge's that worked in the hotel were very good & recommended some great eating places for us, (if you love steak then go to a place called 'The Strip House' it's pricey but it was the best steaked we'd ever had). The hotel room was very simple nothing flashy nice and clean. There was an ambudance of alcohol in the mini bar and nibbles - a choice of cd's to listen to. We had paid extra on booking a room with a view - but in hindsight we need not have bothered as the hotel is in Tribeca and as the receptionist said theres not really much of a view here. After reading much of the reviews about this hotel on this site, we took the advice of a few and went to 'Bubbys' each morning for our breakfast - & what a good choice it was this set us up for the day ahead - Try the sour cream pancakes they were fantastic. On getting around New York we bought a weeks subway pass at around $24 each which was great as we used the subway alot whilst we were there. The hotel is surrounded by some good restaurants there is also a pharmacy over the road & a great little bar called the Tribeca Tavern. This was our second time in New York & we plan to go back soon, the weather was great in the high 80's & it was Memorial weekend when we were there. So the next time we go back we will be staying at the Tribeca Grand without a doubt. This hotel & staying in the Tribeca area met all our needs - if you want to stay somewhere thats not a tourist trap or has the noise levels of Time Square then this hotel & the surrounding area is for you.", "Date": "June 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cFun Time..Great Locale\u201d", "Author": "NYJulie", "ReviewID": "UR5055424", "Content": "Great Location if you dont want the tourist insanity of Times Square.

The rooms are modern, bigger than some in New York, and technically very well equipped -- though it doesn't have a wireless network, so you need a laptop, not a PDA, if you want to work. Like almost all American hotels these days, it is decorated in those shades of fawn and brown that become very depressing on a long business trip. The area around the hotel is bustling and raw, without being threatening. Transport links are very good. Although newly built, the Tribeca Grand is designed to look like an old conversion, with galleried industrial-style open corridors round a central atrium. For British visitors it is very reminiscent of inter-war council estates. The central well is also the bar, which gets very noisy at night because the hotel attracts lots of lively young people. The rooms have special hissing machines (under the guests' control) to cut out the noise of the music and the traffic outside (amazingly, they work). Staff are helpful, if a little consecending to anyone who doesn't fit in to the age/social class profile the hotel is aiming for. The good news is that the public areas are so dark that it's possible to look cooler than you really are. The only downside (shared with its sister hotel, the Soho Grand) is the incredibly mean (yet expensive) breakfast. No buffet, just dishes from a menu that take ages to order, and then ages to arrive. In the meantime you have nothing -- not even a glass of water -- to keep you company, though they will give you tepid coffee from a jug if you can manage to find a waiter -- and grugingly replenish it if you beg. The only quickish option is the continental breakfast. Even that takes ages to come and then turns out to be a bowl of fruit salad, plain bread rolls and a croissant (served ice cold). You can't have butter. Horrible. So get breakfast elsewhere -- it's the meal America does best almost anywhere else, and cheaper too.", "Date": "April 29, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cLove the concept, friendly staff, but subway noise & rattle\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3376346", "Content": "I stayed one sunday night here in their superior room with two double beds with a small dog. Rooms here range superior, deluxe, and up, in that order, making our room the smallest and the most inexpensive of the rooms. I booked through tablet hotels site, for 179. I tend to stay in 4 or more star hotels, and even then I'm extremely squimish and picky about cleanliness and decor. I have previously stayed at Sofitel, Hemsley, and Mariott in NYC, and prefer Sofitel over others for cleanliness, service, and warm and pleasant decor. I was curious to explore the Tribeca and was facinated by the ultra pet friendliness of the hotel, as well as some interesting amenity offerings of bose wave cd players and fax machines in every room, gold fish pet for the pets, ipod and docking stations, power shower, etc. Hotel was never crowded during our stay, there never was any wait by concierge/valet parking/reception desk. Every staff members were friendly, helpful and pleasant. The hotel exterior and lounges were modern and looked well kept or new. There did not seem to be a club scene(the hotel lobby is mainly a lounge for club goers) on sundays, so, minimal noise. The room itself was fine, though led to believe that there is no tub but only a stall shower when booking, it had a full bath. It is decorated in non-descript grays and dark brown tones. The furnishings were all veneer(not wood veener), and looked hagard, but having shopped recently for a city loft with modern decor, I can attest to the lack of quality and durability of most \"modern\" or contemporary\" furnishings. They tend to be inferior at more expensive prices(pay heavily for designs.), so cracks on bathroom floor tiles and peeling veeners didn't surprise nor bother me. What bothered me was: The color scheme of the room was gloomy. Some didn't match at all- dark purple carpet?!? and dark glossy redish brown doors?? And curtains need updating, noticed stains. The WORST issue, unexpectedly, was the noise and physical rattling of the room by the subway trains. The subway either runs directly below the hotel, or below the sideway lining the hotel and runs into extremely late if not all night, it seemed. (noticed subway vents lined along the sidewalk along the hotel(facing a parking lot)). I ended up having a restless night tossing and turning, but finally managed some light sleep in the wee hours with the help of my BOSE noise-cancelling headphone(my own). The room was equipped with what they call a noise cancelling device, but it is not a true noise cancelling device like the headphones that counter with a opposite wave length so that you hear less noise) but a white noise device that you can adjust the loudness of. This proved useless to me as there already were enough white noise in the room(mini refrigerator, computer, etc), and it only aggrevated the noise level by adding to it. Valet parking was about 40, cab fare to south end of the central park costs about 10+tip. I cannot recommend Tribeca Bread or was it Bread Tribeca(italian placed across hotel recommended by concierge), horribly junky food.

Mr. Nicholson, I am sorry to report that my stay and service at the Tribeca Grand Hotel was a lot less than even mediocre. A personal emergency with my fiance's family popped up earlier that day so I called the hotel and requested either a cancellation or a change of date. I also asked if I can pay a cancellation fee. The hotel told me no, they would have to charge the whole amount, I didn't notify the hotel soon enough. I understood. Our check in would have to be late that evening, around 1AM. Besides my Master Card not being validated for the full amount and having to pay cash for the room, the reservations woman denied us access to the mini bar. Therefore, on our walk up to the room, we were followed by a young man with a milk crate that had to empty the mini bar and whatever else was on the counter. Embarrassing for all of us is not the word. We had also requested a non smoking room. Of course when we walk in the room we were hit by a stench similar to an ashtray. The young man with the milk cart of juices and liquor, etc., enlightened us that the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd floors are in fact smoking rooms. The heating/air system was confusing us also. One minute we were cold, the next hot. I think we are both educated enough to figure out the controls of the air system. Maybe not? Unable to sleep at 3,4 AM, maybe we should rent a movie. Nope, couldn't do that either. At this point, we decided to just suck up the $500 something up and try to get some sleep. Morning comes, and we are woken up by a woman in our room, wanting to make the bed. Oh my God, we overslept, we must be late for check out....... Wait a minute, it's earlier than 10:00am. Very rude. We're not sure if we heard a knock. The pressure from the shower nozzle was about the only nice thing that happened to us during our stay. The Moss products, by the way are gross too. We wanted to have brunch downstairs while we were leaving but both agreed to not provide the hotel with more of our business. I know I may sound like a person complaining about everything, but having spent many nights in various hotels throughout the city on top of my office being located in the Waldorf Astoria, I think this has made me somewhat of a hotel savvy person. I know what to expect. From the service to room quality, we both decided to never stay at Grand hotel again. Speaking of room quality, a beyond \"used\" bed covered with a white sheet and terri cloth blanket is NOT up to par or my expectations of a higher end hotel/room. I was truly disappointed and felt like I could've experienced better at a Motel 6. Sleaze, dirt, and low class written all over it. So I am very sorry to report back with an unhappy response, but then again, I am so very sorry that I chose to stay at the Tribeca Grand Hotel. I won't make that mistake again.
