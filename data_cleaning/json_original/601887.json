We booked the weekend package deal which alleged to include transport from the airport, one dinner, a welcome drink and a foot massage. We had been warned about the hotel before we left but we knew, from our previous visit to Bali, that the location was perfect (this is the only positive about the hotel!!).The hotel proved disappointing as soon as we landed in Bali. We waited at the airport for our driver to take us to the hotel where we waited and waited...until we finally called the hotel who informed us that the driver had waited for ten minutes and left. We had to organise our own taxi to take us to the hotel.On arrival, an American couple told us about their horrendous stay at the hotel, which included black water coming out of the shower and v v v bad service from the staff at the hotel. Our room was v disappointing. Full of cockroaches and lizards and v basic! Not what you expect when you are staying in a hotel which is considerably more expensive than the majority of the other hotels in Kuta! When we tried to use our dinner voucher and drink voucher we were given apple juice and a set menu consisting of creamy chicken or mixed fish! (which we refused!) We complained to the manager (who was v unhelpful and dismissive of us). Also, do not expect to sleep well here - a new outdoor Ibiza style club has been built next door!DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL!!!! I can however recommend the Oasis Hotel and Masa Inn which are cheaper and ten times better than this hotel which in my opinion is only deserving of 1 star!", "Date": "Oct 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR503212559", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "anon032"}, {"Content": "Mediocre resort with free mud bath What's great about this hotel is its location, its just opp the Kuta Beach and just minutes walk away from Kuta Square - great for those who love the shopping and evening body massagesWhat's not great would probably be my experience there, perhaps unique to me, it may not happen to you. We arrived in the morning about 10am, we were doubtful they allowed us for early check in, but they did, which was a blessing after an airflight. However, while my friend was taking a warm shower, halfway through, the water turned muddy. And this muddy water ran for quite a while. A staff came to check and returned again to inform us they are working on the pipes or something and this affected all rooms, yes ALL rooms. It was a Sunday afternoon, so i think i was that one unfortunate guest to experience this while the other guests were out enjoying themselves in their day tours. This muddy water only affected hot water, so we used cold water for the rest of our stay there, which was ok, the water was warm in Bali's weather. Our request for a change of room or hotel was not acceded. The reception desk staff did not do much, manager was not around at the time of my complaint and well that's about it. Ok there was a basket of fruits in my room the next day, so i'm not sure if its their way of saying sorry. Well, over all, the facilities are so-so, and keep in mind its a 3 star resort so lower your expectation. And yes, perhaps you should use cold water and not risk having a mud bath.", "Date": "Sep 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR140210605", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Jazzagal"}, {"Content": "vincent chin frm sabah       room", "Date": "Jul 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR414261368", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "9602"}, {"Content": "Not worth the money       TV is partially blocked even after u shift it", "Date": "Jul 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR437747490", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "bobpley"}, {"Content": "will stay there again ....very good location we arrive late but we get our rooms upgrade... is lucky for me cause i got the seaview but got to walk to 3rd floor... room is nice and really got the balinese feel... greeny environment and the breakfast is good. the best things of staying at this hotel is because the location.. next to convenient store and mc donald... horse cart just next to hotel and a wide selection of food in the food court just 3 minutes walk and the beach is beatiful just in front the hotel. you can learn surfing and i recommend a nice balinese guys name ronny..just walk opposite from the hotel restaurant door then you can find there are a lot of surf board here... price is good and the best things is they will teach until you know how to stand up...just 5 minutes walk to left or right hotel is the poppies and you can find a lot small shop with their friendly smile . one things that i dont like is those people that do some massage, foot scrub service or manicure in the kuta beach.. it seem like being forcing and and there charge so high... make sure to ask for the price before they touch your leg. but if you agree with the price then you will feel like king and queen .bali is a really paradise and we will definetly come back again. is a place must visit before you die... beleive me.", "Date": "Jul 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR714569307", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "yuiito"}, {"Content": "dirty!! when we entered the room, the floor was dirty, with mud or something like that. so as the bathroom and the bathtub. the sink was broken. there were a crack and a hole in the sink. and then there was no toilet water, and they said they couldn't fix it until the next day. the mosquito net above the bed was very dirty, full of dust!!the next day, after the room should have been cleaned, we found that nothing had been cleaned at all, still there were hair and also a dead mosquito in the bathtub!", "Date": "Jul 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR830997399", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "iliketravelverymuch"}, {"Content": "Poor service from 1st step Well i like this hotel coz the location,its in centre kuta, just opposite the beach and near to shopping area. i used to stay in this hotel with my family, it was average service that time but we didnt have any complain, coz that time no staffs gave us attitude. then i plan to go back to this hotel and recomended this hotel to my husband, and he said ok. we are honeymooners but coz we both hoteliers so we didnt expect 5 stars service. we just need great location to sleep, at that time it was great idea that we got a room in this hotel. i did all the check in procedures but in the end the lady at the reception said that it was twin bed???? we booked for deluxe double cottage near the swimming pool, then when we tried to complain to them, the lady said that she fax already about the changes to the travel agent and sounds doesnt really care about us, she and the guy at the reception keep saying that they couldnt do anything about that coz hotel full book until our check out day. both of them just stood there waiting for us to solve our own problem, which was nt our problem. i tried to call the travel agent and he said that he tried to solve the problem, my husband was asking to talk to the manager on duty, and had to wait for 1 hr for him to talk to that guy that in charged.

Our travel agent recommended it but the pictures in the travel brochures made it look a little old-fashioned and the pool looked cramped.However, the moment we entered the lobby we knew (for the money we spent) we had a winner. We arrived at night and the gardens were all beautifully lit up. We were really happy with our room. We were on the third floor and the room was spacious and renovated. It had a good sized tv, cupboard space, tea and coffee making facilites and a clean and tidy bathroom. The air-con also worked well and didn't make the room too cold. The best thing about being on the third floor was the view. You have a nice view of Kuta Beach through the palm trees.Breakfast the next morning was pretty good The hotel is only supposed to be three stars but the breakfast was more what you would expect at a four star hotel. After a week it did lack variety though. It is almost the same every day.What I liked best about this hotel was the pool and the resturant. The resturant is one of the best I have eaten at in Bali (mabey a little pricey though if you are on a budget). As part of our stay we got a free dinner (three small courses) and the salad chef came to each table and sang to all the guests . She had a really lovely voice. Its been four months since my stay and I still miss the pool. The hotel is right across from the beach so they play spanish music to cover the sounds from the road. The water is so warm that I could swim in it all day. However, you need to get in early if you want a deck chair. People are allowed to grab a towel at seven and hog the chairs all day even if they leave the hotel for hours without using them.However, I dont think all the rooms are as nice as the one we stayed in. The ones on the upper floors have been renovated. The villas and the rooms on the lower floor look a little run down. Also, by the end of the holiday I was a little sick of climbing three flights of stairs to get to my room. We were pretty far from the pool. It probably did me good though as it was the only real exercise I got.However, I will come back to this hotel. Any bad points are far exceeded by its good points. I didn't even mind the location. Usually I prefer to stay in Legian but it was kind of in the middle of everything and being right across from the beach was a big plus.

We decided to stay @ Kuta Seaview Cottages after an initial reservation at Poppies proved too expensive for our meagre travellers budgets ($79 +21%). We checked out Tripadvisor but being the positive people we are, we decided to give them the benefit of the doubt  booked.When we received our confirmation email they asked us to let them know if we'd be later than our stated arrival time. Our bus from Padangbai (having come from Seniggi on Lombok and ultimately Gili Trawangan) proved late and we arrived an hour later than expected. We were informed by the manager that he had given our room away as we hadn't arrived at the stated time - we then expressed our dissatisfaction with this as we had been on a bus, unable to call and they had not stated in their email that they would have given the room away if we'd not been there at the exact time.The manager then said that we could stay at another hotel (same ownership). This hotel was a 4* hotel and once we'd seen the hotel, we accepted.The following day, we arrived back @ Kuta Seaview. The room was fine for the price, if a bit shabby (cracked toilet seat, stained chair cover). Other issues included only providing the complimentary (we asked for the weekend package) fruit bowl on our last day (leaving us v little time to enjoy), lack of english TV channels as advertised in the room (eg MTV, BBC - To be fair, they did sort us asian MTV after we asked), lack of hot water and variable friendliness of the staff.

My partner and I arrived in Bali and did not book anything. We went to the airport in one of those tourist information and they gave us a very good deal to stay in Seaview. good point : The hotel itself is very nice and clean, it is just opposite the sea and in the middle of kuta centre. Food at the restaurant was a bit pricy comparing with other restaurants around (but obviously cheap compare to the UK). Breakfast is definitely above average with nice fresh fruits, omelettes, pancakes or normal pastries and toasts... Swimming pool is lovely and clean. Fantastic sunsets from the beachBad points : Hotel : We had a bungalow by the swimming pool. None of them actually face the swimming pool and i personally cannot see the point of having them as they are just a big room with a ensuite bathroom (with see through curtains) Restaurant : Part of the restaurant was being refurbished and lets say that the builders were more interested in the girls by the pool than finishing the restaurant as quickly as possible. After the second day, I had already enough and found a corner by the pool were they could not see me as I felt like a piece of meat. TAXI : They provide a taxi service which is awfully expensive compare to the average taxi in town (we thought they would be honest with the customers of the hotel, but it was the complete opposite).As for the location : the hotel is right in the middle of Kuta, which is a very VERY touristic area, the taxis will beep you litterally every 1 min to see if you want a ride somewhere, if you want to go down to the beach and stay quiet... then forget it, as they will try to sell you everything and anything ALL THE TIME.In general, I think it is a shame that the locals are reacting like this, although they are obviously depending 100 % on tourists, but it is too much.
