My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel for a total of 5 days and it was the easiest part of our entire trip in Venice. The hotel is not on the main islands but that is one of its better qualities: it's very easy to find (Lido seems to only have 2 main roads), compared to the rest of our time spent on the main islands where we seemed to get lost every 5 minutes (we felt very sorry for fellow travelers dragging around their suitcases trying to find their hotels). It's also very accessible by the water taxis and they run well into the early hours of the morning so you never have to fear missing the last boat home. The staff were very friendly and very accommodating, as were the people on the island. We were warned by other travelers that Venetians are quite rude, yet everywhere we went people were only more than happy to help us. For the water taxis we were given a discount and metro cards to get into places for cheap because we're under 30 (just go to the kiosk at the taxi stop and ask, they're very friendly). The breakfasts are a little boring, but you can always make it up with lunch and dinner. There's a selection of meat, cheese, bread, jams/spreads, fruit and hard boiled eggs. The room was very clean, and comfy. We had a great view of the beach, and the bathroom was very spacious with a good shower! The mini bar did look like it hadn't been restocked in a while, but then I never eat stuff from the mini bars anyway, we just used it to keep our bottled water cold.

My partner and I arrived at the hotel at approx 23.30 hours to be hold there was a problem with our room as there had been a leak and the room was not fit for use. I enquired if I could view this room as I am only too aware of the stories that are told when in fact the hotel is over booked. The gentleman on duty was polite and said that we could not see the room, I insisted but he would not show the room. I then questioned him about the room being in use and he appeared to get a little agitated. I requested to speak with the manager to be told that she was not on duty. I did speak with the alleged \u00e2\u20ac\u0153restaurant manager\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but he did not want to deal with our dilemma. The night porter then telephoned the hotel manager for me to speak with directly, but all go was a barrage of excuses down the phone and I did not get the opportunity to speak.... I do not believe she came up for air! Having had no success we were packed off to another hotel, of which they kept advising was a 4* and they were paying for a taxi to get there, the same taxi driver that dropped us off, he as was not as polite this time round though. We were then advised that we could check in the next day at 14.00 hours, to which I got angry, as we were supposed to be checked in from the previous day, it meant we had to check out of the other hotel at 10.00 hours and hang around until 14.00 hours to check into our original hotel to which I was not happy at all with. It does make you wonder as to what the problem with our room was if it could be available for use from 14.00 hours the next day.... I will leave that for you to ponder on? Book out policy is that you try to contact the client to advise that there is problem, having booked via a travel agent who had all contact details, they would have been able to contact advising of same. This would have been annoying but we have been able to go directly to the other hotel on arrival as it was late. I would have thought that this would be standard procedure, as a seasoned traveller this is how it should be handled, at least for warned if for armed. When we got back to the hotel on next day the advised that they had given us an upgraded room, it was an adequate 3* double room and could not see how they could call it an upgrade. Given that I the room was very comfortable, clean and the shower room was excellent. The only negative feedback I would give is the TV is not position in suitable place to view it, should you which to watch TV. Breakfast, be ready to get bored as we were there for 7 days and it did not change, with the exception for the first morning where we had breakfast at a different property. There was a real lack of variety. I have always believed that the Italians love their coffee but breakfast coffee leaves a lot to be desired. This did not give us the desire to use their dining facilities again so I am unable to comment on any other facilities. The staff were friendly and polite, with the exception of the very rude manager on the telephone on the arrival night. The hotel is a good 3* property but beware that it is a little remote and in an area that needs a little attention. It is quiet, when the kiosk bar across the road stops playing music, but this only seems to be louder at weekends. A note on general findings about Venice as a location, when dining in restaurants beware that there is cover charge to pay normally \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2 per person and then a service charge of 12.5% to pay on the overall cost of the meal. Buy a Vaporetta ticket from the Kiosk at the airport if planning on travelling by Vaporetta, it really is worth the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac50 per person per week.

We booked this hotel based on Tripadvisor's reviews and it was a total nightmare!! We did not get any sleep during our 4 days/3 nights stay at this hotel. The first night they put us in a \"nonsmoking\" room which was filled with cigaratte smell. Even though we requested to change room right away, they had us wait till the next day. I was 3 months pregnant and had our 22 months old daughter with us. Having to stay in a filthy room with the cigaratte smell was unbearable. On top of this, there were lots of \"big\" mesquitos and spiders that we were trying to fight off through out the night. These mesquitos were so \"big\" that when you smash it, you'll see a lof of blood coming out from previous victims (not a pretty picture). Aftern switching to the new room, we realized the air conditioner doesn't work. We decided not to bother front desk again as they're not that nice/friendly. At night is when we realizd thhe biggest problem in this main building rooms, there is no sound proof for the rooms at all, zero. So, you will hear people who get in late and wants to stay up late talking, people who get up early to go out, you name it. You will hear everything in your neighbor's rooms throughout the night. We didn't get any sleep during our stay here and had a hard time sight seeing during the day due to lack of sleep.

Location The hotel is NOT near central Venice, which some people may find to be a drawback, but is in fact a benefit unless you are trying to see all of Venice in 2 days (which is crazy): by staying here you are away from the noise and the tourists. It is a quiet location, set back from street with very little traffic. Transport to central Venice Unless you are very elderly or very unfit, it will not take more than 12 minutes to walk from the hotel to the vaporetto (water-bus) stop. But there is a bus-stop DIRECTLY outside the hotel, with a bus every 20 minutes, that runs very punctually, so it is very easy to walk out of the hotel, wait a couple of minutes for the bus, and be at the vaporetto 5 mins later. The vaporetto service is also punctual, with several different routes to central Venice and other islands, so if you make a note of the timetables, you should never had to wait more than a few minutes. And if you do? Hey, you;re on vacation, take it easy and watch the locals going about their business! Rooms I visited with two friends -- we all had very nice rooms. They each had a view of the sea, I had a courtyard-facing room with a large balcony with a table, chairs, and sun-loungers. The decor was recent and in good condition throughout. My only complaint was that that I had noisy neighbours one night, and realised that the walls are too thin. Staff We found the reception staff to be helpful (for example they were happy to phone a restaurant for us, to make reservations in Italian). Price Whether or not you think this place is good value will depend on what you pay. I would strongly recommend visiting Venice out-of-season, when there are far fewer tourists, and absolute bargains can be had. The official room-rate was something like 260 Euros per night, but in late November we paid 35 Euros per night!

My experience was not that good, although not too bad either. First of all, if you choose to walk from the vaporetto stop to the hotel, it's not 10 minutes, but a 20. It's true that you have a bus stop in front of the hotel, and you can take the bus every 20 minutes. It takes only about 3 minutes from the hotel to the vaporetto stop by bus. When we arrived to the place, they gave me probably the worst room in the hotel, next to the parking lot! It looked terrible and we felt unsafe being outside. I had to complain and ask for another room. Fortunately, I could get another room that was quite ok. We were there on September 15, 2008. Weather was not bad, but when the sun goes down it's cold in Venice. So when we arrived to our room, we felt it was cold there too. We tried to switch on the heater and it didn't work. We tried then with the air conditioning unit, but it had only the option for cold air. We went to the reception and the man there told us: \"It's September. No heater. If you cold, use the blanket that's inside the closet\". Great answer! After that we tried to watch TV for a while. But there was no remote control. We had to go again to the reception, where the man gave us the control. I have to tell you, the staff is not what you could say \"nice\", but quite rude in general. Breakfast was nothing special, though not really bad. The liquid that they say is orange juice was impossible to drink, it was worse than Tang and the coffee came out of a vending machine! Undrinkable. At least they had tea bags and milk. The day we left the hotel, the clerk asked for the remote control, so we had to go back to the room to give it to him. What did he expect? That I was going to steal it or what? It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even a universal control that you could use everywhere. Then something happened that I think was unacceptable. The clerk asked me: Did you have something from the minibar? I said no. After that, in front of me, he called the cleaning lady and ask her in Italian to check the minibar. I could understand it perfectly because I have studied Italian for two years. So the maid returned and said: \"Everything's there\", and the clerk told to me: \"Ok, have a nice trip\". Very, very inappropriate. So this is my experience. Did I have a bad time there? Not really. Could have been better?

The room was pleasant, clean and had a great shower. However, the negatives outway the positives I`m afraid. We arrived at 11.30 p.m. tired and thirsty only to find that the the guest room free coffee and tea making facilities described in the hotel information did not exist. After going to reception to enquire we were told in broken English that the restaurant was closed and we could only have coffee at breakfast . As we were on a budget being told to use the minibar was not acceptable. They offered us a kettle the next day which did not work. The language proved to be a problem several times and were not sure if the staff were being purposely difficult. They were not friendly in any way. The breakfast was appalling and after the first day we did not avail ourselves of it. The daytime receptionist was a perfect imitation of Basil Faulty and the restaurant in actual fact was a Pizza bar. So rather disappointing. I will say that the nightime receptionist proved invaluable at times and tried his best under difficult circumstances.", "Date": "June 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "York UK", "Title": "\u201cWhat a great hotel\u201d", "Author": "pear17", "ReviewID": "UR16658363", "Content": "This hotel has to be one of the best we have stayed in.

It was very clean and better than i expected. It was rated as a 3 star but we were very suprised as i have stayed in hotels with 4 and 5 star ratings and this was just as nice. The breakfast was okay the usual continental buffet although there was not much choice. There are some nice restuarants, coffee shops, ice cream shops etc on the lido if you did not want to go into Venice everyday. There is a nice beach on the lido but we did not have the weather. would be nice in the summer. We had friends staying in the centre of venice and there hotel was just as nice as ours but they paid double what we did. For the sake of the 10 min walk to the water bus station(there was a bus avaliable) and the 10 min ride into venice on the water bus, it was well worth saving that extra money. Venice itself was nice, so many lovely places to see and also so much nice food to eat. avoid the water taxis as they are very overpriced and you can buy a travel card for the water busses, we had one that lasted 3 days which was te length of our stay.... one tip- stick to the italian food out there- obviously there speciality. we ate chinese one night- Big mistake.

It was quite clean and the bed was of a good modern standard. Restaurant had good decent food at reasonable prices. Breakfast buffet was also good but not great variety.
