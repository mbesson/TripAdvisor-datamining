I can not say enough about how pleasant and helpful the staff were. The management provide excellent customer service and are always ready to give good advice and support. Indeed, they helped us arrange the best tours of the city. We shared a family room which was smaller than expected (a double, a single and a camper bed). However, if we complained I reckon the manager would have changed rooms for us, but the room suited us. The room was small and plain and relatively basic nonetheless, it was comfortable and very affordable despite its location in the heart of a tourist capital. The only real downside was the dim lighting in the room and the lack of mirrors which is important for a group of girls who want to look glam as they hit the streets of Sultanahmet. We found it chilly at night and the air-con was not working however, this was promptly rectified by the management. Room service is basic, towels were changed daily and beds were made, but bedding was not changed. Please note that although there are no lifts (which was not an issue for our group) the staff will always assist you so don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be deterred. The breakfast was lovely and always fresh (cereal, bread, jam, butter, cheese, olives, meat, fruits, cake, milk, tea, coffee). You have to try the apple tea and the cake and bread (actually eat everything and drink the freshly made pomegranate juice. The lady in the kitchen makes you really feel at home she is genuinely sweet, incredibly warm and a real pleasure to see in the morning. The location has to be one of the best in Istanbul which is why we opted for it. It is centrally located in Sultanahment so you are in walking distance to the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sofia, Cistern, Topaki Palace and Grand Bazaar. Additionally, you are 2 minutes away from the Tram and at a cost of 2 TL you can be at the Spice Bazaar in 10 minutes. We could see several restaurants from our room (be prepared to be hounded by the many waiters of these bars when you step out, and if you are a group of females be prepared for the endless attempts to woe you as they seek your custom, albeit in jest and we never felt intimidated once).

The location is excellent - as well as being close to the historic sites in the old city and the Bazaars it is easy to get to the ferry piers. (The ferries are good for a quick look at the harbour and also to get to the Asian side of Istanbul eg Kadikoy ). I walked to and from the pier but the tram line near the hotel also goes there and a tram stop is 2 minutes away. There are dozens of restaurants within 5 minutes of the hotel but they are aimed at tourists. Another option is Kadirga Limani Meydani, a town square about a 10 minute walk away with restaurants where locals eat as well as tourists. I found it when I went on the Lonely Planet Byzantium walk (if interested you could use the Lonely Planet directions to find it, or Googlemaps). I recommend that you AVOID the restaurant on the corner opposite the hotel (KARADENIZ Pide & Kebap Salonu) unless you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in the mood for an argument.

It was about 50AUD per night and had airconditioning (which is completely required in Istanbul in summer - seriously). I had a room on the second floor (205) overlooking the restaurants/cafes below, which was a room that could sleep 4 (I had booked a single room but they were out). The room is very basic. It had a double bed and 2 single beds. The bed/pillows were comfortable. The curtains and bedcover looked old and like they should be replaced. Bathroom was tiny but had a shower, sink, hair dryer and toilet. Airconditioner was great and you need to use it to drown out the voices from the restaurants below. The noise isn't too bad, but without the aircon it really does travel into the room. Breakfast on the rooftop terrace was great - it's a buffet and delicious! Loved the breadrolls and cream cheese and yoghurt. No fridge/mini bar in room. Free wifi internet, but the quality of the connection wasn't great - e.g. I couldn't connect from the double bed easily, but could from the single bed nearest the door. So while these comments aren't overly too positive, for the price in Sultanahmet which is a tourist mecca I think the hotel is great value.

It was a tiny, nondescript building nestled in the corner, among colorful restaurants and cafes in the side streets of Divan Yolu. (Divan Yolu is definitely a great location to be at. Easily walkable from here are the Hagia Sofia, Blue Mosque, Grand Bazaar, and a long line of restaurants and souvenir shops along the quaint, European-like street.) From Atlantis, it is literally a 30 second walk to Divan Yolu, which makes its location excellent, and its rate at about a third or half of the prices of the hotels you'd find on Divan Yolu itself. Just note though that Atlantis is kind of like in the parallel \"back alley\" of Divan Yolu, so don't expect fancy reception areas. And also, the taxis had no idea where it was and we had to go around for quite a bit to find it. this was because taxis weren't allowed on Divan Yolu, and a lot of one way streets. The taxi had to use a back street, then we were just dropped off at a corner and had to lug our suitcases down 200 meters or so of cobblestones (note: cobblestones are much more idyllic in books than in actuality--they kill your feet and make rolling your suitcase murder) before we got to the hotel. The rooms are odd-sized (some are really big, others really cramped, but at least not too tiny), with cheap wood floors, an area rug, decent bed, semi-dusty walls and a tiny tv, and a tiny bathroom with an all-in shower. What you would expect a budget place to have. But all in all, it was safe, the service of the front desk and housekeeping was excellent (very helpful and accommodating and answered all of our stupid touristy questions and helped us change money) and the good news is that they're renovating soon! So if you can ignore the slight discomfort of a hard-to-find address and wheeling your luggage down some pebbles, then the location really makes up for what it lacks in terms of shmanciness. Since you're going to be out for most of the day anyway, location trumps accommodation in this case. It was so easy walking everywhere! and a train station was right where the hotel's area was.

The room we had was a double room, the bed was a little hard for us but was comfortable and well aired. The only slight criticism we have is that the walls are quite thin, and some guests came back very late on the first night (I'm not sure if they were having a party in the canteen or in their room, but it was very loud!) so it was difficult to get asleep. However, on the subsequent nights we had no such issues and we got to sleep nicely. The hotel might do well to encourage guests to shush after 9pm or operate a lights out policy, and encourage those coming back in from town to keep their voices down. The breakfast was a buffet of olives, cheese, bread, cereal, some guests requested omelette, juices, jams, chocolate spreads, cake etc. All looked nice and fresh and well presented. The kitchen staff always were polite and friendly. Additionally, those working on reception always seemed very nice! Only one word of warning, as you are in the centre of town there are many bars and restaurants trying to get your custom and approaching you near the entrance to the hotel. It makes it a bit of a difficult experience to ignore people asking you to join their restaurant everytime you want to go to the hotel. However, I am sure this happens to all of the hotels in the area as it is a very touristy place and in a central location. Another quick thing to add here is that if you have never been to Istanbul, you may not know there is a massive stray dog problem and those strays are not treated very well. It's something all the hotels, restaurants, the government and local authorities should be dealing with. One night in this hotel I could hear a dog howling in pain in the street outside the hotel. It was not a very pleasant experience and I hope people keep this in mind when coming to Istanbul. It's not something mentioned in many of the tourist guides or reviews for the hotels I read before deciding to come here. The bedroom itself was clean and tidy, however, the bathroom could probably do with a little updating. If you are expecting the 3-5 star quality you get in a UK hotel then you might be disappointed. However, the room was more than adequate for our needs and the location of the hotel and the friendliness of staff trumped all of the minors nick picking of the hotel itself. If you want a hotel in the centre of the tourist area of istanbul, that is away from the main road, is nice and quiet, is in walking distance of nearly all major tourist attractions, you really cannot go wrong. I read many other Trip Advisor reviews before deciding on this hotel, and I have to say I was not disappointed and was very happy with the room and service we received.

My family (i.e. he, she and the son of 9 years old) came here for 5 days. We never stayed in the hotel but for night sleep and for breakfast in the morning. It has very convenient location: just next to the city tram station, by which you can travel to numerous places in the town and out of it. Also you can walk very easily to all directions in the old city of Istanbul, Aya Sophia and Blue Mosque standing next to it. For our purposes it suited us almost perfectly: nice location, clean, rather economical (we booked the room a month ahead, by the time we were travelling (beginning of May) the price went 2 or more times up), friendly staff, clean. Rooms are small, and as we lived on the second floor - below on the street we could hear loud taks of nearby numerous restarants visitors. But then after all day long walkings through the city we just have to take off the clothes, have shower and sleep dead ) Two minor drawbacks: 1) the hotel cafe is at the roof, as is tradition here I guess, and this is also very convenient - but there were no great views to the sea from there, only neighbouring roofs 2) breakfast menu was no huge range of choices. Very limited. We asked every day to cook us scrambled eggs, which we received. But then, as a hotel for night stay and all the rest of the time - travelling around - this is a good one! It is an older one, I would suppose, but if you compare it with others, and if in price it will be competitve - take it. Also, the front office manage was very friendly and helped us every time we had questions. Also, there was free internet access in there, but the PC was a little out of order. On the other hand, there is an internet cafe just next door there, very convenient. We used it to drop all our pictures from the camera to the flash memory - several times... we really spent most of the time walking and photo hunting than enjoying hotel life. In the end, I would say this place is a good one to stay in Instabul for the first time. If we come there for the second one, I'd choose a place closer to Eminoenue - more convenient to travel to farther parts of the city.", "Date": "June 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "chicago", "Title": "\u201cSmall charming hotel in the middle of all the hustle and bustle\u201d", "Author": "sineorita00", "ReviewID": "UR66948448", "Content": "pros: 1.
