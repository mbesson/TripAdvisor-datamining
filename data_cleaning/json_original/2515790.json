We went with my 2 children (5 & 3 years old) and my mother & father in-law. We stayed in building #3 in a 3 bedroom/2 bath. The place had basically everything we needed/wanted.

Per the other reviews the beds are very average & the pillows and sheets are nothing close to being as nice as a Hilton (which is where I usually stay when traveling on business or with my wife). The kids really enjoyed the pool. I would definetly recommend renting a car at this resort in order to make quick runs to wal mart for supplies and odds/ends. I was able to get a mini-van for $180 for my 6 day stay. The place was clean when we arrived, however the trash from the previous tenant was still under the sink which I just took out myself. The location to Disney is awesome and very convenient. I never used the shuttle but it is available, however they only have a few set pick up times which doesn't work well with small children. All in all I would say it is a good value for your dollar.

I chose this accomodation due to the supposed free wifi in every room. However this should read \"wifi free\" in every room. The signal strength is appaulling, when I told the reception I could not get the free Wifi as advertised they just shrugged and suggested I call technical support. Gee thanks! Technical support were even less helpful. Suffice to say, DO NOT STAY HERE if you think you're getting in room wifi. As for the rooms themselves, we stayed in a 2 bed apartment in building one. There always seemed to be a stale musty smell eminating from the room and the floors looked liked they could do with a serious steam clean. I suppose the reason is, unless you pay up an additional $30 your rooms don't get cleaned, which brings me onto my other point: HIDDEN CHARGES. After you've booked in a been charged a non-refundable RESORT FEE of $10 a day they charge you extra if you want your room cleaned, evidently, none of the previous occupants of room 1606 had taken up this additional cost! There is a convenience store on site which charge astronimical amounts for everyday items. i.e on my first night there, i was fleeced $40 for a pizza a small bottle of water and a box of cereal and milk. I actually think the assistants were embarrased to take my money! Speaking of overcharging, the onsite bar \"Frankie Farrells\" also charged silly amounts for basic food and had the audacity to automatically include a 15% gratuity to every bill. Which puts you in the awkward position of questioning the waitress upon bill settlement.(I will review the food in a seperate article) The swimming pool is good for kids as it has a walk-in area and fun slide. However, due to the tall buildings surrounding the pool, you will not get a full day of sun and most of the pool is covered in shade which leaves only one small area in the sun in the afternoon. You'll need the sun to warm up too especially as the water is pretty cold, despite the claim it's heated. There is an outlet mall located next door which is pretty bland and not much to write home about so I won't dwell on this. The location is great for Disney which gives it an additional star, however, there are many other like accomodations in the area such as Vistana, Floridays, Blue Heron which I will give a chance if ever staying in the area again over this particular resort.

The unit was in good condition although the carpeting was a bit ill-fitting in places (it was in good condition). Staff was warm and friendly at check-in. Upon entering the suite, problems immediately noted with the air conditioner not operating, period. Required multiple calls to the Front Desk to get Engineering up to look at it; the outcome was the unit had frozen and we had no choice but to wait until the cover ice dissipated (problem due to previous guests 'likely' running the unit set to very cool and having the balcony door open; moisture issues). Engineering fellow said he would be back in the morning to ensure it was operating. While a warm and uncomfortable night for sleeping, not totally horrible (no other suites available, or so I was told). I was offered, and accepted, an appropriate discount on the suite. By next morning, the A/C had cleared and operated fine for the remainder of our stay. This suite was in the building (apologies for not recalling the Building #) that contained the grocery store, Pizza Hut Express (these were in the same space and operated by the same folks), as well as Frankie Farrell's Irish Pub & Grille. Our suite had a 'fireworks view' which placed it at the same building end as Frankie's. Unfortunately, sitting outside on the balcony at any time during opening hours (which means all day, every day) was met with billowing wafts from Frankie's kitchen. Normally, I like the smell of food but this was really the greasy residue that drifted upwards and stayed a while. Quite sickeningly thick at some points. Avoid this location if at all possible. As for 'Fireworks View', well, as has been reported previously, you hear nothing and see only marginally more from EPCOT and Magic Kingdom. Quite a distance away. I'd rather opt for the additional bathroom and forgo the 'view.' The grocery store on the first floor is very pricey for standard staple items, you are better to head down the road to the Supercenters or Publix, all within a few minutes' drive. The Pizza Hut Express served up the basic fare and was decent. Frankie's was ok, too, not great, but not bad. Good place to bring the kids. Speaking of kids, the pool area with pirate ship is quite nice with food and beverage service close at hand. The area surrounding the pool (and the hotel, generally) is a bit sparse and unfinished. Don't expect lush landscaping or exotic foliage. A few seagulls, perhaps. Parking on the property was challenging as the resort was at capacity but a little walk never hurt anyone. The Spa was reasonably priced and provided good service. All in all, a reasonable choice with good value in return for our price-point and accommodation needs.

The hotel was clean, the kitchen was fairly new with granite counters and working appliances, and the furniture, for the most part, was old and fairly comfortable. My only problems were that the rooms we were in (2 bedroom suite) were quite worn. The furniture and carpet were worn out and obviously had not been replace for many years. The pillows were hard and flat, and there were none to replace them. When I asked at the front desk, they said all the pillows were being replace in the months to come, too late for me. The wrong size blanket (a maybe queen size on king bed) with a couple of holes in it was on our bed. There was no maid service at all unless you wanted to pay $30 per day extra. It was nice having a kitchen at our disposal, and there was a convenience store in our building that had just about everything (including a Pizza Hut), but was a bit pricey. There was a nice balcony to sit on, and again, the place was clean. I think this resort is better suited to people with young children who don't want to have to worry about damaging or breaking something in a nicer hotel room.

The shop on site is really expensive, even if you get in late following a long day it would be more advisable to go to Walmart down the road as it is a lot cheaper. It was just over $20 for milk, cereal and a couple of soft drinks, what a rip off.

My wife had booked the 3 bedroom apartment in January of this year and to say we were dissapointed is putting it mildly. A family holiday now meant that we had to share two apartments which weren't connected. Quite frankly the Staff were appalling. The following day I used guest services to book some Sea World tickets, I asked if a discount was available for Military personnel and was told that no discount was available at Sea World. However, we subsequently found out that Sea World do not charge an admission fee for Military. I am certain that Guest Services knew of this but wouldn't turn down a sale.

I would highly recommend staying on Disney if that is the purpose of your trip. This resort is off a very busy road and is often backed up with traffic. We stayed in a spacious 3 bedroom in the newer building #5. We could see the pool from two of the bedrooms. From the balcony we could see the highway, swamp land and the pool from only 1 side. This corner unit was fairly clean though we noted mold on the window and blind of the 2nd bathroom and some on the walls of the en suite shower. The kitchen was modern and well equipped. We appreciated having a washer and dryer in the unit, but the washer was very loud when in use. Our biggest issues were the carpet in the main traffic areas was worn and a bit dirty looking. The sofa was worn and should have been replaced a few years ago. We can not imagine having to use it as a sleeper sofa. The en suite shower had no shelves large enough to hold shampoo etc. There were no room darkening shades/curtains making it difficult to sleep. We were fortunate to have 2 double beds instead of twins in the 3rd bedroom. The elevators were very fast and efficient. The building has 2 levels of parking underneath. The spots were very tight and it was difficult to find a space later at night. We were told by another guest not to park on the 1st level as she had her car vandalized there on a previous visit. There is outlet shopping within walking distance and a very busy Walmart near by. The key card often stopped working and we had to get it fixed at the front desk. The front desk staff were very friendly and helpful which is the biggest plus of this place. My daughter wanted to stay here because of the pirate ship.

The pull out couch was not appropriate to sleep in for long (can feel springs), sample shampoo only in one bath, no sample laundry detergent to get you started. No extra frills basically. 4)The pool side \"restaurant\" was just 2 very unorganized bartenders that were taking drink orders and food orders/preparing food at the bar (no kitchen).

Yes the pool is great, building five /pool view wonderful and the space in a 2 bed unit is just briliant for a family. However the downside is that you really do need a car if you want complete freedom. We used the hotel shuttle bus frequently and found the normal driver, David charming, very helpful and always on time. The only problem is that at peak times the park has already been open for several hours before you arrive and so fastpasts etc have often gone and queues are long. Personally I would be happy to pay a small charge and have more frequnet service.A Taxi to Epcot is $20 each way. Walmart is massive but you cannot walk there. There are no pavements or road crossings and jay walking is just dangerous as it is a very busy 3 lane road. A taxi is $8 each way but still cheaper to do a big shop at the start of your trip and eat in, as hotel shop is expensive and low on fresh goods such as decent bread. The Pizzas from the shop are great though. Disney Gear at Walmart is cheap but the outlet centre has even better prices for small disney gift items, hats etc. Yes pool towels are small, use two! They occasionally ran out but were re stocked quickly each time. The water on the first week of our holiday was lovely but on the second week it was freezing, Did the refill the pool or turn the heating off! The slide is too vicious for under fours! height resriction of 122cm (i think) and I was allowed to go on it once with my daughter who had been really looking forward to it. We both hated it but other kids seeemed to enjoy it. Other than Frankie Farrells ( not impressed) and the food court at the outlet centre and the pool bar there are no restuarants within walking distance. The Ponderosa steakhouse is closed although the concierge staff did not know this when i asked if it was ok to walk up the roadside to it. Went out to eat a couple of times and used taxis which are plentiful. Had a really good Steak at Johnnie Hallidays at The Crossroads shopping centre following a game of crazy golf but expensive and very noisy, felt a bit under dressed in casual clothes although not in shorts! Taxi to hotel from airport cost $45 one way and $50 on return, probably upset the driver by not giving him a tip but decided the overcharging made up for it. Many taxis are not metered. We were still quids in by not hiring a car, but did suffer minor inconvenience as a result. I think next time i would hire a car even if i didn't use it every day. People complained in the reviews about not being able to get rid of rubbish. in our block (5) you could acccess the trash shute from the top floor. The washer drier / hoover etc and the hugh number of towels provided made it unnecessary to use maid service. And yes the sheets did slip off a couple of times, but it took a couple of seconds to sort, not exactly a holiday spoiler! My main gripe was the rubbish television programmes. Millions of channels to chose from, but try and find a weather forecast or decent kids programme for smaller kids- no chance. The disney channel is NOT Disney Junior. Some better assistance in the room on channels and how to use some of the applicances would be good, us English don't have such complicated ovens/air con units etc! Can't really see the fireworks, so don't get stressed about not having that view, pool view is much nicer. All in all a good place to be, particulary if you have a range of age groups to cater for, but sorry to say won't be back. Orlando, been there done that....

Our check in was pleasant and uneventful, and we really did not have much interaction with the front desk the rest of the week. They gave us several coupons for the amenities that the resort offers. We enjoyed the close proximity to the parks. The Disney property is only a mile or two away. Staying in a 3 bedroom condo was also a plus. Splitting the cost with someone, like the grandparents, makes the stay cheaper than lodging on the Disney property. Plus, the kids get their own room, and the adults can hang out in the living room and watch TV, or sit on the balcony, after the kids go to bed. There's a kitchen, so you can keep snacks and breakfast items on hand, which helps control costs, too. We even made a quick spaghetti dinner one night when we were tired of eating out. And finally, there is a washer/dryer in the unit so we could throw in a quick load of laundry as the week wore on. There's a pub on site which a few members of our group visited. The food was good, but somewhat pricey. The kids enjoyed the pool, but we didn't use it much as we focused on getting our time in at the parks. We had planned to celebrate my daughter's birthday with pizza and cake by the pool, but found that outside food is not allowed there. The few complaints we had: The furniture was worn, and we had dresser drawers that stuck badly. The bathroom had too few towels for the number of people staying. There was no clear trash disposal site. We called the front desk, and they weren't sure where to dump it, and finally someone directed us to a room on the floor to throw our trash bags. Some other complaints that might crop up that didn't bother us: The shuttle service is too limited. We knew that ahead of time and planned to drive on our own. Parking is $14 per day and good at all parks, so you don't have to pay each time you hop to another park, or return later in the day. The cleaning service is extra, but as we were staying in a weekly rental we had no expectations that anyone would come in and clean the place for us.

I have stayed in hundreds of hotels and resorts and never been inspired to write a review, although I confess that I use TripAdvisor religiously in my planning. LBV Resort, you got me to write my first review! LBV Resort is not a Ritz or a Waldorf, but that's not what you want in a family trip to Orlando anyway. If you are looking for a user-friendly place where kids can be kids and adults can be adults at the same time (yes, it is possible!), this is the perfect place. The Resort is surrounded by a discount outlet mall (with 2 discount Disney stores with prices that run about 60% off the park prices for merchandise and apparel). The pirate ship water park within the Resort is a blast, especially with the full bar and snack poolside service. Disney is right around the corner. The free shuttles from the Resort to Disney are great, but parking is so cheap and easy at Disney that we found it better to just drive. The rooms at the Resort are huge, updated, and clean and run about 80% less than staying at a Disney hotel for the same features and space. The staff at the Resort almost seem to, or perhaps literally do, enjoy working there and helping people. The Resort is surrounded by restaurants, shops, grocery, and everything that you would need to get on the trip. Staying at Disney pretty much requires that you eat at Disney for every single meal. The fully equipped kitchen in the room at the Resort gave us the option of cooking or just heating frozen stuff, resulting in a limitless menu at a fraction of the cost of staying and eating at Disney. When I researched where to stay on our trip, I must have spent at least two dozen hours looking at all of the options in and around Orlando. Every search that I did came back to this place. I am always skeptical when an option in a research project seems so clear and obvious, so I was at best cautiously optimistic when we arrived. LBV Resort blew away my best hopes. Please let me save you the time, energy, and angst of extensive research to essentially blindly pick a place to stay for such an important family vacation.

After reading numerous articles regarding Lake Buena Vista Resort and Village we decided to forward a request for accomodation in Block 5 with a pool biew. Prior comments suggested that other areas, in particular block 2 were sub standard. When checking in we were allocated a room in block 2 and advised that the accomodation was standard thoughout. After travelling from home in North East England to Manchester and then Orlando the last thing we wanted to hear was that the reception staff had no notification of our request. I advised the person we met on reception that we had specifically requested accomodation in block 5 on account of that we had done some prior research and specifically did not want to be in block 2. I was advised that there was no accomodation in block 5.and that the the resort was fully booked. I agreed to see the room in block 2 to draw my own conclusions. On inspecting the room in block 2 my family and i felt that the room was sub standard, definitely not 2 or 3 star never mind 4 star! The room had an unpleasant odour, it was dour and there were cigarrete end on the balcony of this no smoking room. We returned to reception and voiced our concerns and then met by a female member of the mangement team,who to say the least was one of the most rude and unfriendly/ uncompramising member of hotel staff which i have come across! I outlined our request for a room in block 5 and the fact that my family and i were very tired and frustrated from a long journey. This person was the most unfirendly hotel member of staff i think i have ever met. Her attitude left my wife highly upset in that we were advised that there were no other rooms in the accomodation and either take the room in block 2 or nothing! I hope that the Lake Buena vist resort and village take note of this issue and this unfriendly person and offer her training in people skills! She certainly lack any personality and front of desk attitude! Fortunately our issues was raised to another member of staff, his name ws Chris and he was able to in the first instance offer us accomodation in the more up to date block 3 with the option for to view and move into block 5 the following day. This request was offered and we viewed the room in block 5 and moved the followiung day! In summary we are now in block 5 and enjoying our holiday! the moral of this is that Make sure any requests are acknowldged by your accomodation well in advance of your holiday and some people are helpful and have good people skills to deal with customer issues and others should be either trained or given non people facing roles.

After doing extensive research, we decided to rent two (2) 3 bedroom / 2 or 3 bath condominiums at the Lake Buena Vista Resort Village and Spa. Instead of booking directly with the Resort, I used the website www.vrbo.com in order to book directly with one of the private owners, in this case Sahota Dream Vacations. I have done this at many locations throughout the United States and as a result, generally receive better rates and more personalized service than what is offered by the Resort. After booking the two (2) condominiums with Mr. Sahota, he forwarded me the official reservation confirmations, which included all of the pertinent information. When we arrived, we were truly impressed. Both condominiums were nicely decorated and very clean. The kitchen was modern with a large refrigerator. Two (2) of the bedrooms were master suites, with a large Jacuzzi tub and a separate walk-in shower. The units were on the second floor, which was fine for our family. The grounds around the resort were clean and well maintained. Both pools were very nice. The resort offered a complimentary shuttle to the various theme parks, which we used each day. We were even able to purchase our Walt Disney World tickets with the Expedia concierge, located in the Resort lobby. There is a Walmart Super Store located less than one (1) mile from the resort. They have all of the groceries and other items you would need for your visit to Orlando, FL. Attached to the resort is Frankie Farrell's Irish Pub. We ate there the first night and could not believe the food. The portions were large and prices were very reasonable. The staff was very friendly and attentive. We also ordered food \u201cto go\u201d on another occasion, and found it to be just as good as the first night.

Let me say that there is no comparison in terms of value. Our room at the Lake Buena Vista was far more spacious and much, much more luxurious. The suite was clean and well appointed. My wife and I loved the master bedroom -- the jacuzzi tub was a nice touch. My children were also happy with the two double beds in the second bedroom. The only thing the suite didn't have was laundry soap, but when we called the front desk, they sent it up within about fifteen minutes. The suite was also very convenient for visiting Disney. It was actually quicker to get to Downtown Disney from it than it was from our Disney resort hotel (ten minutes by car as opposed to half an hour on a bus). We also visited Epcot and Animal Kingdom, and the drive in was quick and easy. My children loved the pirate ship pool, begging us to leave the parks early so we could go back for a swim. My only complaint about it was that they kept the water a little too cool, making it difficult to get in once the sun was off the pool area (around 5:00 pm). We made one visit to the outlet mall next door, but I found it kind of creepy. It seemed like one of those places that is built and then no-one shows up. We ate at the food fair there one night, which was a mistake. It seemed really run down and the food was bad and overpriced. I would strongly recommend against going there. We also ate at the Irish restaurant next door. It was much better. Apart from that, however, I had no complaints about this hotel.

However, once we got there and had figured out where we were it was actually a really straight run from the airport. It's very very close to Disney by car, took us no time at all to get to the disney parks. Universal was a little further away but still really handy and easy to get to by car. Check in was easy, gave us a load of coupons which we didn't even use but it was still nice to get them. Staff were all really friendly and helpful when we needed them and that wasn't very often because everything was great. The pool was really good according to the kids and my husband who used it. The appartment was brilliant, we were in building 3 on the 10th floor and it was really great, not the best view ever but we loved it. 3 bedrooms and loads of space, beds were comfy, place was clean and well equipped. Everything was really easy to use and we had absolutly no problems. It was nice an quiet all the time, hardly even ran into other guests, couldn't have been better! It's right next to an outlet mall which was alright but there is a bigger, better outlet mall a short drive away, on the way to universal. We used to Pizza Hut on the first night which was really nice and reasonable (we had a coupon for a free pizza we didn't use d'oh). The onsite shop is ridiculous though, we called it the $5 shop because EVERYTHING was $5. Loaf of bread, carton of milk, juice...$5! A bar of chocolate was ridiculously expensive! Save your cash and go to the walmart 5 minutes away! Really can't fault the place (apart from the $5 shop!)

There was plenty of room for the 5 of us, 2 adults and 3 kids with a King size bed in the master bedroom, 2 twins in the second bedroom and a hide-a-bed couch. I loved the jacuzzi tub with the glowing flourescent lights after a long day of walking. The seperate shower and two bathrooms were appreciated as well. Walmart was close by which was a great savings for food/drinks. We prepared lunch to take with us to the parks most days and occasionally came back for dinner as well. We enjoyed one dinner at the Irish Pub, a bit pricey but good food. The pool was great and enjoyed by both the adults and kids. The waterslide is only available when there is an attendant which is a great safety factor. We took advantage of the free shuttle to the parks each day. You just had to make sure to book with the Expedia clerk the day/evening before. The outlet mall behind the resort had a few good deals and was open quite late in the evening. The only disappointment was that we left bathings suits and a sarong (that had special meaning to my daughter) in the dryer when we left. We phoned the resort from the airport and were told to phone the housekeeping department as they were seperate.....left a message and no one returned our call.

I had contacted Daryl the manager prior to my arrival as I have a son with acute autism and he cannot be on high floors or in a dirty environment. Daryl was helpful and put us in a low floor apartment in building 5. The building was in need of renovation but the apartments were roomy and reasonably clean. It was nice for my son to have a room to himself with a TV - we booked a two bed apartment. The sofas in the apartment are in need to replacement and due to the state of the sofa I had to request a cover for it as it made my son feel ill. During out stay we had a full clean at a cost of $30 - I requested that this be done while we were out. However, upon our return it had not been cleaned. I went to reception and they said it would be done in the next 1hr. We went for a drink in the coffee shop at the shopping outlet next to the hotel. We then made out way back to the apartment - my son went running up to the door to find it open! The cleaner had left the door to the apartment open and the spa tub was still dirty - the beds had not been made (the bottom sheet was on the bed then it was covered by what they call a comforter- there was no top sheet and blanket on the bed it had been left on the chairs in the bedrooms. - I went to the reception and Jason the assistant manager said he would meet me at the apartment - he came with the housekeeper who instucted the cleaner to sort things out. Again we went out - when we came back the tub had been cleaned but the beds still not sorted - I did it myself - however, when I rang and spoke to Jason he was abrupt and said that he thought he had rectified my issues and that this was the third time he had spoken to me that week! (The first time was with regards to the sofa cover I requested). I am not sure that he even apologised for the cleaner leaving the apartment door open - we were lucky nothing was taken. The reception staff were very helpful especially Trish, Tyler and Jean. We kept getting lost around the disney area and they kindly printed us google maps to all our destinations and I cannot thank them enough. We then went on a cruise for a week and then returned to Lake Buena Vista for 5 nights before returning home. On the second occassion we stayed we were allocated by Trish building 4 which in my opinion is better than building 5. Everyone on trip advisor says to ask for building 5 but I am not sure why. Apartments in building 4 have nicer covers on the beds but apartment from that are the same. Again the sofa was old and dirty and I just put a blanket on it to cover it up. It was just the feel of building 4 that I like better given that it was in the main reception building. It was also more secure as you needed your room key to use the lift. This was not the case in building 5. We did not use the pool or the pub therefore, I cannot comment on these facilities. They did however, appear to be popular I even saw people in the pool at 7.30am! All things taken into consideration I would return to this property due to its location etc. and I would request a room in building 4.

We were happy with the decision! We were in a suite in Building One facing the front office. We asked for a room in Building Five when we checked in but were told there would be an additional charge. Building One was fine. It was in the same building as the Irish Pub and store so that was convenient. We could see the Disney fireworks from our balcony. Parking (although not covered) was available right outside the elevator doors. It's not fancy but if you are looking for a place for kids with a nice pool this is worth checking out. PROS: - Short drive to Disney (10 min). We saw a shuttle bus picking up and dropping off at the hotel, too, but we didn't use it. - Master bedroom big enough for a pack n play for our 4 month old with pleny of space to get around. - Master bedroom bath's jacuzzi tub was a big hit for the 3 year old. - Deck had lots of room and was shaded. Great place to have breakfast and a glass of wine when the kids are asleep! - TV in living room was big and had tons of channels. - Kitchen was well equipped with dishes, coffee maker, etc. They give you a starter roll of paper towels, little bottle of dish washing soap and one pack of clothes washing detergent. - Washer/Dryer! It was great to be able to wash our own stuff all during the trip! - Irish pub had good food for takeout. - POOL! The pool area had some shady spots to hang out with the 4 month old and the 3 year old loved the pool! You can get towels poolside. Lots of families with kids so be aware if you aren't into lots of kids. However, it wasn't loud and crazy. Just lots of families making use of the pool. We didn't eat at the pool side restaurant but looked like they had some good snacks and drinks. They were open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. CONS: - The bed and pillows were hard as a rock and the blankets are not soft. I wasn't excited to snuggle into my bed at night. - We couldn't figure out how to use the AC/fan. It was either really cold or started to get warm in the room. However, we didn't call the front desk to ask how to use it so maybe there's a trick that we didn't try to regulate the temp in the room. - The Irish pub was the only restaurant within walking distance. We got delivery from a local pizza place one night but that was it for variety. Of course, you can get in the car and find more but with two little kids we were hoping for more places close by. There is a Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts about a 2 mile drive down the street. - The store has lots of variety but is really expensive.. as you would expect. Try to go to a grocery store at the start of your trip to get everything you need to avoid having to use the store. - The pack n plays were delivered with a standard twin sheet so if you want to have sheets made specifically for a pack n play you need to bring your own. Also, make sure you have them reserved. When we arrived, they told us we got the last two. - The second lock on the door is really low. My three year old could reach it to get out of the room. This is why we chose for him to be in a pack n play instead of possibly being able to open the door in the middle of the night. - We didn't see any outdoor space for the 3 year old to be able to run around.

Check in was fine. Nice staff, friendly, etc. we were in a 3 bed 2 bath in building 3, on the 6 th floor. The suite had an odd smell when we opened the door. Kind of a chemical type smell which we decided was cleaner? It was a good size with full kitchen. The furniture was definitely due for replacement (stained and threadbare in spots). The fridge and oven were very clean, which was a nice surprise as overall we felt we needed to clean the rest of it (counters were dirty, utensils needed a wash). Carpets were stained, albeit clean (no dirt on my kids white socks). Tile in bathrooms were also stained, had paint drips, etc. we also scrubbed the air return vent for the a/c as it was completely coated with dirt. I don't think it gets any attention. Overall, it is due for a reno and needs a bit more attention by the cleaning crew but was otherwise comfortable. The sheets didnt fit the king bed and the pillows were awful but the mattresses were new and clean so that made up for a lot. Be prepared to buy supplies (cleaning, dishwasher soap, toilet paper) as there isn't any provided (1 roll of tp per bathroom). Pool was nice, the Irish pub just so so (I won't eat there again) and it is central to everything. Walmart is 5 minutes up the road, disney parks are 5 minutes and sea world, universal are both within 10 minutes. A great selection of restaurants are a quick 5 minutes as well. There is a small outlet \"attached\" and a huge premium outlet mall 5 minutes up the road. I would recommend with warnings to book in a newer building and book directly rathet than via expedia or the like. I believe any place is going to be more prepared to please if you aren't all paid up prior to arrival. Overall, not bad.

Food and service was very good as was the beer. Good on a Saturday for watching the English Premier League football..Never tried the take away pizza. The minor problems. It would appear that either the sheets have shrunk or the wrong size was purchased as they do not fit the king size beds.

When we came back, they had run out of 3br suites so they upgraded us to a 3br 3ba suite for free to our surprise . They were very friendly and helpful and very kid oriented while keeping the elegance of a resort property. Our room was huge, and I mean HUGE with two of the bedrooms having their own master suites. HUGE Jacuzzi tubs, great sized full kitchen, and large balcony along with your own laundry in-room. We had an Irish pub and a convenience store/pizza hut express in our building. The main building had a bar/grill poolside at the waterpark which had a big pirate ship slide. Both open early and close late but have no fear, you can't hear anything once you close your slider door. There is also a separate, more quiet pool in another building. All buildings were within walking distance, as in across the street from one another. Concierge was outstanding and had discount tickets and package deals for dinner after. Cab rides averaged 15-20 to get to the Parks, and were also friendly, honest and clean. The convenience store is very expensive, but worth it being open till 1am and you need cold medicine! If not, the Walmart and CVS are about a Mile away. Hammocks by the pools and breakfast By the pirate ship and beautiful landscaping to walk through really focus on relaxing and enjoying yourself. One tip - make your spa reservations the minute you check in. We had a spa credit and couldn't use it because they were booked solid the last two days of our trip. There is also no housekeeping unless you request it, which even with the in room safe makes one feel better about no one coming into the room.

I booked it via American Express Travel but later found out they actually used Travelocity. This place is more of a cross between an hotel and apartment because there's no housekeeping during the stay (pay extra if you want it), no one opening the door, valeting your car, no Coast Guard or towel kiosk at the pool, nor a bar inside the hotel. If you keep this in mind, you'll know what to expect. But if you ask you can get a Pack n Play for free to use and extra toilet paper. The hotel exterior and interior was clean. We had a 3 bedroom apartment in building 5 and had a view of Disney Magic Kingdom's fireworks from the side of the balcony. Each bedroom was clean, beds were firm, and the 2 bathrooms were clean and had shampoo, soap, conditioner, and small hairdryer. There were plenty of towels and extra bedding was available in the closets. The kitchen had a full size refrigerator, sink, stove, and dishwasher. There were enough dishes and a few basic pots and pans for the one morning we decided to make breakfast (went to the nearby Walmart where it had decently priced for water, bread, etc). If you're not into cooking, nearby Waffle House is a great budget friendly and pretty good place for breakfast or lunch. Our apartment was quiet except the one night someone decided to practice their race car driving skills outside. As for the service, front desk was very friendly and they had two computers with printer for guests to print their boarding pass. The only point I would take away is that if you need something from housekeeping, it will take some time so don't expect it immediately. Location is great. Disney resorts were 15-20 minutes away, Universal 20 mins, and there were plenty of chain and fast food restaurants. If you decide to eat the chain restaurants, be sure to call ahead to find out the wait time. You're in the midst of tourist town so there are plenty of people eating out. Parking wasn't an issue for us since I knew that if the garage was full, I could park on the street. It's right next to the parking lot.

I could see where some people complained of the pillows as they are hard and small, but we prefer hard over soft and they worked for us. Overall we were super happy with our room and LBV. We cooked in it 2 nights and it really is just a 5 minute drive to Disney. It was perfect with a toddler, we just drove back for naps and then back in the evening. The pool looked so fun, but as we were coming off swimmers ear this trip, we didn't get to enjoy it.

We entered the lobby excited and ready to begin our vacation. We were a little early, but decided to attempt to check in anyway. Although our room was not ready to be occupied, the front desk clerk gave us coupons to eat at the nearby pub while we waited, we were very pleased with his service and hospitality. Finally, 4 o clock came and we were ready to check in, sadly we were greeted by a line of other guest waiting to check in, not a big deal as the front desk staff worked vigorously to get the many guest checked in. When we got to the desk we checked in. We entered our condo #2305, to find that the television had to be programmed to find channels, but even more disturbing, in two out of the three bathrooms had hair in both the sinks and tubs, as if they had not been cleaned after the previous guest had departed, and we also found an empty potato chip bag and a piece of starburst wrapper in one of the dresser drawers, how this happened is beyond us. Though this was very unpleasant, we did not get angry, but instead just wanted them to be cleaned properly so we could enjoy our vacation. We called the front desk, who quickly sent up two staff members. While I was away at the store, the men started cleaning, however when I returned one of the tubs was still dirty, and my fiance informed me that the cleaning staff said, and I quote, \" We are not professional cleaners, and this tub is not dirty, and therefore does not need to be cleaned.\" We cleaned the tub ourselves, and this gave reason for my first of five attempts to contact the \"Manager on Duty\", named Darryl. This was the biggest disappointment of our vacation. Even if the cleaning staff did not believe the tub was dirty, it would have been very pleasing if they would have cleaned it, because it was soiled with toothpaste residue as well as hair. I attempted multiple times to speak with Darryl, but at no success. I did speak with his secretary who said that she would ensure that he contacted me. It has been more than a week since the first attempt to contact him, but still he has not returned any of my messages, I starting to wonder if Darryl actually exist. Despite what the lobby sign reads, Darryl seemed to never be on duty, rather at lunch, or out doing property inspections; whatever that means. We are not pleased with Darryl's consideration for his guest, or the cleaning staff. Other than those experiences the front desk staff were very understanding and accommodating. We enjoyed the nearby outlet malls, and the pools at the resort. Most staff were very friendly and considerate. However, because of the Manager's inconsideration we will probably seek accommodations elsewhere for out summer 12 vacation to Orlando.

Couldn't have asked for more and it made our stay! It was a great suite with lots of room to relax. The kids LOVED the giant tub in the master suite. Room was very clean and well maintained. The tv in the master bedroom didn't get all the channels so when we called maintenance they responded within 5 minutes. After trying to resolve the issue unsuccessfully, they swapped the tv out - problem solved! The only quibble was the size of the kitchen meant little counterspace.

I was happy to have the choice of how frequently we chose to have maid service rather than having the cost bundled into the room price.

Check in was a breeze and the first impression of the 2 bedroom unit (#4404) was very favorable. The kitchen was reasonably stocked - although a sponge for dishes would've been nice to have. The washer/dryer is a stacked unit that is of small to medium sized capacity and is located just next to the kitchen area. We did not use the appliances during our stay, but made use of the washer/dryer on a daily basis. The bathroom facilities are fine and included a jacuzzi tub in the master, but it would be nice to have had some shelving or seating area within the master shower which could be used for storing of toiletries. The only issue that we encountered in the bathrooms was a poorly installed towel rack, which came off the wall easily. The living area was good-sized and included a wall mounted flat-screen. There are also flat screens in the bedrooms, but the one in the secondary room was smallish - not a big deal for us, since we had small children in that room. Oddly, there is no garbage chute or receptacles in or near the room, so we had to leave trash outside of the room and call the front desk in order to arrange for someone to come and retrieve. The single worst part of the room is the bed sheets and pillows! The bed itself was reasonably comfortable, but the sheets and comforter seem to be about a half-size too small and the pillows are the type that you would use for decorative shams, but they are not comfortable for sleeping. We bought some cheap pillows at the local Wal Mart and left them when we checked out. This was a big disappointment - especially for a place that uses the word \"Resort\" in it's name, and hopes to sell you on time sharing. The staff at the facility were all friendly and the pool is very kid friendly. There are limited food options on-site, but we made use of the pool-side bar and Frankie Farrell's, which is a nice Irish pub which is located in building #2. The pool-side offerings are basic and on the pricey side ($6 for a hot dog and bag of chips; the chiken strips were doughy and should be avoided). Frankie's is a nice room and the food is certainly better, but not great. If you plan to go there, you can get coupons at the front desk for $5 off of a $30 bill. I had asked for menus from other local eateries for take-out, but the concierge had a very limited inventory. One of the pizza shops that had been referred informed that the resort imposes a pretty steep charge to them for delivery, and that the charge was passed along to the tenant. It turned out to be easier to go pick up the food on my own. You might be better served by ordering from the Pizza Hut Express (building 2), which we did not use. Parking is alright - so long as you are back to the facility by 6 or 7pm. Thereafter, it gets quite crowded and there are lots of cars parked in the street and in other areas that are not intended for parking. Overall, the facility has the feel of someplace that is not fully completed. The area behind the pool appears to have been cleared in advance of additional construction, but there are no signs of activity. Additionally, the road that runs near to buildings 4 and 5 dead-ends and looks as if it is designed to be finished at a later date. We have not stayed at any other hotels/resorts in the area, so do not have a basis for comparison. In the end, the resort met our needs and we would certainly consider re-visiting.", "Date": "March 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa, Florida", "Title": "\u201cAll that Glitters is not Gold\u201d", "Author": "TravelinFam74", "ReviewID": "UR125554018", "Content": "The LBV offers many of the amenities that are comparable to many of the finer Disney or Loew's resorts.

We stayed in unit 3510 (Bldg #3, 5th floor). We had minor issues at check in, a key that didn't work, and a squeaky fan in the master bathroom, both were resolved in a reasonable amount of time. Things were great the first 2 nights. Then the 3rd night we decided to stay out at the Disney parks later, got back around midnight. There was ZERO parking. We went to the front desk to ask where to park, the lady working the counter just kept saying they were 100% booked and if there wasn't any spots in the garage, lot, or street (yes the street) that she didn't know what to tell us. We got the \"pleasure of parking essentially 2 city blocks away in the adjacent strip mall. We had a similar issue the following night. Thankfully we didn't have our kids with us this time, because after walking miles upon miles at the theme parks the last thing sleeping toddlers want to do at night is walk more. Well, Monday I contacted the manager on duty who tried to help by pointing out some places to park that were \"almost always open\". The problem with these spots is they are still a good distance from the units and on an unlit street. So if you want your car to be somewhere safe, there is not really a lot of options for parking at night here. We continued to have this problem almost every night and were told parking is, \"First come, first served\". So basically, come back early or don't complain. On one of my morning trips to retrieve my vehicle and move it to a more secure location, I ran into a family switching hotels because of the parking, and noise issues (more on that later). In the elevator was a person that I can only assume is a resident (I guess some people actually live here in purchased units?) While the mother of the other family and my self were complaining in the elevator about the parking and the noise, the resident says, \"You think it's bad visiting, try living here.\" Next is the internet, long story short the issue is always your computer, not their lousy wireless bridge setup. Even if the same issue was occurring on My laptop, my wife's laptop, my work laptop, and my wife's work laptop. All of which worked fine when we got home by the way. They also worked fine if I just tethered from my smartphone. The only solution that was offered to me was to spend my time on the phone with a third party tech support that could help me diagnose the issues with my computer(s). Last is the noise. Starting on Friday when they were 100% booked, we started having issues with people in the hallways, yelling, banging and running, well past 3am. Then it would start back up around 7am. Several times I went out and asked them to quiet down (Usually different folks each time). This continued all week. The last few days we had a family check in across the hall from us. They spoke Spanish, very loudly into the very late hours. You could hear them all the way in the master bedroom, and we were woken up several times. Thursday night there were several groups of Spanish speaking folks in the hallway at 1:30 a.m. yelling at the top of their lungs. We called the front desk, and they assured us they would send security to check it out. Sure enough we heard security breaking it up 15-20 minutes later. It got quiet for about 30 minutes, then started right back up. They finally stopped around 4 a.m. Then the noise started back up around 7 a.m. We wound up deciding to cut our stay two days short. We had to eat the cost on one of those days even with all of the issues. It is not all negative, if you can deal with the inadequate parking, under trained staff, bad internet, and excessive noise, the rooms are a great size, the full kitchen is nice, location is good, the in unit Jacuzzi tubs are awesome.

Our 2 bedroom suite was clean and welcoming, we even had a view of the fireworks (which we hadn't requested, so that was a nice treat). The bathtub in the master suite was delightful. Unfortunately, 2 of our 3 room keys wouldn't work, so we had to go back to the front desk to have those replaced and the toilet in the second bath kept stopping up easily. What was with the very very old projection TVs? Awful picture! The beds were horribly uncomfortable, even my 5 year old had trouble sleeping. The walls were paper thin as well, I could hear our neighbor snoring as if he was in the bed next to me. The wi-fi was unusable, kept dropping off and not connecting.

We also had 3 large bathrooms which was a plus. Two of the bathrooms had huge showers and whirlpool tube which we did use. The only gripe I had about the room was a balcony view of the parking lot and the outlet shopping mall which is right next door. I had called last fall requesting a good view and got stuck with a pretty ugly one but I got past that. One thing we did to save some money was we went to Walmart which is just blocks down the road and stocked up for the week bringing it back to our room. With 4 kids eating out every day wasn't an option. The pool is great and heated. The giant pirate ship was a hit with my kids and they loved going down the water slide. A bar is also by the pool if needed. There is also 3 hot tubs which I could see. Just remember this resort does not have housecleaning unless you pay for it. We did not care and just treated the room like our house and cleaned ourselves. It worked out great. In our building there was also a Irish Pub restaurant, kids arcade, and a mini store with Pizzz hut. We used all of these except the Irish Pub. Overall this resort was perfect for us and our needs. You are only mins from Disney and all the other parks and attractions in the area.

At the mere thought of needing a little vacation, time away from home, work and the mundane day-to-day ... Lake Buena Vista Resort Village & Spa is our destination! The staff is always superb, and the suites provide just what you need to relax and enjoy. We stay with these fine folks several times a year and look forward to many more visits. I am thankful for the knowledgeable staff for all their help, Caitlyn and Matt especially, they are the best ever. A few things I feel deserve a mention: Although our room was lacking the Guest Services binder, I wonder if it would be worthwhile to place a notice within the Guest Services information regarding the advertisements that so often find their way under the doors in the middle of the night. I know that most reputable hotels & resorts do not approve of this method of advertising from local pizza shops/take out spots but there is little to be done to combat the issue. That being said, we have been told on a few occasions that these places should be avoided as some of them are scams. They offer great deals at attractive pricing, but once your order is placed and they have your credit card information- your pizza never comes. Calling them back only gets you a million excuses why YOU are at fault for not getting your food. We have had two such flyers under our door with different names of the pizza shop but the same phone number...hmmm.... The staff has always been spot-on in recommending a great eatery. They are, after all, locals and frequent these establishments themselves. Building 2 needs some upgrades to the rooms. The televisions are very old, and the large one in the living area is near impossible to watch during daylight, even with the blinds closed. Reflections spa- I've had a gift certificate for the Spa for almost a year now and each time I've called to inquire about services, I've gotten a less than pleasant reception, an off-putting attitude, and have never been able to make an appointment. Either they \"don't have time\" or are not properly staffed to accommodate the services they offer. I have the feeling my gift certificate will go to waste, sadly. I have joined the \"Sky Guest Reward Program\" more times than I can count, yet nothing ever comes of it. I've never gotten a 'your email is already registered with us' response when I re-join, never received special notices in my email, or points, or well- any kind of reward whatsoever. When I ask about this \"reward\" program during the reservation process, no one seems to know.

One of the comforters had large yellow stains. We had to put an extra bed sheet on the couch as it was so dirty. There was leftover food crust on the stove burner. The dish towels were dingy and dirty. A sunbeam was shining in the family room from the window and I was horrified a the dust dancing around. My mother took out the vacuum cleaner and sucked up a good amound of dust and dirt from the carpet and from the couch. Note to management--don't believe me, we were in 3802. Got a call asking if everything was OK--My mother in law said everything looked ok--but that was before we really had a chance to look around as we were exhausted. I called reception afterwards and mentioned the bedsheets and this horrible musty smell and the dirty stove. The lovely employee said they would send someone up to disinfect and take care of the problems. We went out for the afternoon, came back a few hours later and nothing was done. I called back and at this point said there's no point in cleaning the stove--we cleaned ourselves because we had to eat and couldn't wait for someone to come and that we vacuumed. She sent up housekeeping with fresh bedding for all the beds as I was too grossed out to spend another night like that. Guys came replaced everything--a manager came up to make sure the bedding was ok. The smell was gone because we had food cooking, but really it was disappointing. I would have loved to change rooms but at this point with 2 kids, having already unpacked everything, vacuuming etc etc I really couldn't be bothered.

We were originally booked in building 1 with a view of the outlet mall parking lot and we were able to change that to building 3 to be closer to the pirate pool but I honestly don't think that the room we were checked into has been used in years. I wouldn't say don't stay here because a lot of people were happy, but please if you get a room that is as dirty and gross as the one I had--please address it to management and I'm sure they will make it right--but ask for what you want.

If you continue to drive straight on Apopka and avoid the highway, within 15 minutes you are on West Sand Lake right by \"restaurant row\" near Dr Philips Drive. Continue driving straight and within a couple of minutes you are passing universal blvd and international drive. So within 15-20 min of non-highway driving you can access Disney, Universal, dozens of fine restaurants, international drive, 2 premium outlets, mall at the millenia, florida mall, etc. This time can be cut in half if you take I4, which has a ramp a couple of minutes from the hotel. Also, of note to shoppers, if you take a left when leaving the resort and get on Osceola Parkway, within 5 minutes you are at a great shopping area called The Loop. Its a quiet, new shopping development with nice restaurants, a theatre, a huge babies r us and many of big box stores. There are outlets adjacent to this hotel, and although they have vastly improved since our last visit, they still do not compare to the premium outlets a few minutes away. Travel tip, avoid the coffee house at this outlet, they sell expired food! it happened to us twice!", "Date": "February 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cExcellent, relaxing stay\u201d", "Author": "Mitz15", "ReviewID": "UR124225115", "Content": "Stayed for 4 nights on a two bedroom unit.

First off they provided a coffee maker, coffee pockets that had coffee cream sugar stirrers and NO coffee filters! Really?! Then one of the main reasons we booked this location is because it states that they shuttle to the Disney parks!

When we arrived we had a three bedroom apartment with kitchen, laundry area, two bathrooms, balcony etc, the room was clean, although a little bit dated, that was the only bad remark I can make. The hotel is right next door to a shopping centre which has some great bargains for adults and kids, there is a walmart supermarket down the road which took is 5 mins to walk to and then $6 back in a taxi with the shopping, the walmart is very cheap it offers everything you could imagine and also has a subway in it, may i recommend the hot food counter which was excellent (oh and the cupcakes !!) The hotel offers a shuttle service to parks which compared to shuttles at previous places we have stayed such as doubletree, quality inn and international palms is by far better, you dont pick up a million other hotels and also the return journey was often by taxi just for our party of 6 which was great. The reception staff were very helpful and answered every question we had and we cannot fault them at all. Downtown disney was close by and cost $15 ish in a taxi which was great for evenings and meals. We didnt use the hotel bar, and only visited the shop once. Both pools were excellent, spotless and plenty of loungers etc. I can only compliment this hotel and it was that great that we are looking into buying an apartment there !! The only slightly bad comment I can make is that the rooms are slightly dated but I do believe they are being refurbished and also the hotel shop was very overpriced ($7 for 6 waters - walmart was $1 for 6 !!), I think if it was priced more reasonable more people would use it and wouldnt go to walmart and they would still make a profit.

Parking gets busy later in the evening, but we always got somewhere within a short enough walk of our building.

As like most guests I did request a room in block 5 but did not get it. This was not a problem as the room we were given was very nice (block where reception is located) I agree with the comments about the jacuzzi bath that unfortunately the jets do spray out alot of dirt. I realised this after my first bath and was horrified to think initially all this dirt came off me! However, the rest of the apartment was great and I found the washer/dryer really handy (no returning home with a case of dirty clothes). Also it was nice that the children had their own bathroom too. Didn't really cook in the kitchen as we tend to eat out on holiday, but it was very well equipped should you want to. Tip: Do not use the onsite shop, it is very ridiculously expensive for example a small bottle of water is $2.99. It is open very late though which can come in handy. Walmart is literally just up the road and so cheap and even sells all the Disney merchandise at a fraction of the price of the parks My children enjoyed going to the onsite games room and we did eat at Franky Farrells pub a few times and had very nice meals. Convenient when you really have had enough of driving and just want to walk to a pub and as my husband drove all holiday I think he was glad we had somewhere walking distance so he could have a pint of Stella! The pool are was nice and they do provide towels so no need to bring your own from home. Ate from the bar menu a couple of times and to be honest, not that great and drinks etc again expensive. We also were awoken in the early hours of January 2nd to the sound of an alarm and someone speaking over a tannoy. We got rather concerned when we went out on to the balcony and saw about 4 fire engines approaching the hotel. I rang reception and the receptionist told me that it was not our block that had the fire. However, we still felt quite uneasy seeing all the people outside in the night clothes and the fire engines approaching, so my husband dressed and went outside to see what was going on. The lack of sleep we could of done without as we were heading to Magic Kingdom early in the morning. And as other guests commented , there did not seem to be any sort of procedure in place.

This was followed up twice again during the year(once by phone to hotel reservations) when we checked in we were told there was no request on our file and as the firework views had already been paid for by other guests we were out of luck(we were never once told we could pay extra as we would have done it) our first apartments were on floor 13 when we got in the two bedroom apartment smelt really bad and the three bedroom had hole in the bath and a broken blind in one of the rooms. I rang the front desk and was advised 'not to worry as we wouldnt be charged for making the hole!) it took another two calls to the front desk for them to move us. During one of the calls we were even told if we used the toilet before we moved we would be charged cleaning fees! The first lady we spoke to was very unpleasant and very unhelpful but eventually the matter was taken over by a lovely young man called Tyler. He showed us round rooms on the fifth floor in building three and we moved there. My son was sick one night and whilst we managed to wash the sheets on his bed the blanket and bedspread were far too big. I called the next morning before 8 am and was told they would be replaced when housekeeping came in at 9. By late afternoon it still wasnt there and the bedding covered in sick was still in our apartment so i called front desk again, they advised they would get someone right up. we went out and didnt get back till 1.30 am and surprise surprise the dirty bed clothes were still there and still no clean ones so i rang the front desk again. they offered to send security up with a blanket but given fact they hadnt stuck to any arrangements so far i had to put my son in with us as i couldnt keep him up any later. the following morning i called the desk again and housekeeping arrived with a blanket, it was soaking wet and they still left the dirty bedding. after another visit it was sorted. as mentioned in previous reviews the sheets do not stay on the beds and the pillows are not great, the wireless internet was patchy in the two bed and non existing in the three and the bath in our two bedroom apartment could not be used due to scum from the spa jets but if im honest i wouldnt even mention any of this had it not been for what happened next. One of the party in our three bed got up to use the toilet in around 4.10am and heard a muffled recording which seemed to be evacuation alarm. he woke us and i went out to hall but message was still muffled so i called from desk, they said we had to evacuate, we rang the two bed and they hadnt heard a thing but we all went to evacuate. My parents are both 72 and both disabled, mum was using an electric scooter but we had to get them down the stairs. when we got down it was pure chaos, nobody knew where to go, people were struggling and there wasnt a member of staff to be seen. we were left outside(it was only building three evacuated) no blankets, no roll call, no organisation and no consideration from the hotel staff(wherever they were!) the fire brigade asked if we were ok and told us when to go back into the building. there was no structured evacuation procedure and given the size of this place its a disaster waiting to happen. i had put comments on the Facebook page which can still be seen(posted 31st December originally under my name Lynda Jones) the hotel did not respond until we checked out! We cant fault the size of the apartments but thats about it. we wouldnt dream of giving a negative review but when safety is an issue we have no choice.

I notice a lot of people complain about stuff that, if only they read the website, would not be a problem. For example, this is a condo hotel, so there is not housekeeping every day. You have to schedule and pay for housekeeping. If you think this is a rip off, then I recommed you go someplace else and pay twice as much for a smaller room. You will get your housekeeping there. If you have a large group, want to stay together, but still have privacy, this is the place for you. The 4br suite has two Master suites on each end. You can close them off and have your own private suite. Outside the door of each private suite, is another BR for the kiddo's to stay in. Across the hall from that is their own private bath.

Our holiday was booked as a package through Virgin Holidays. The unit was very spacious and could easily have accomodated 8. The unit was very clean, we could not find anything negative to say about it. We did not use the maid service as we kept the room clean and tidy ourselves (as you would do where ever you were). The washer and dryer are a great plus, if we'd have know how good this was before we went we would have taken half as many clothes as my lot didn't wear half of what they took. We shopped on the mall next to the hotel and also at the Orlando Premium Outlet, both were fantastic we bought loads of bargains back, so make sure your well under weight on your luggage on the way out to accomodate for the bargains you will buy. .... We didn't have a car, I'm the only driver and to be honest the thought of driving in America was just to frightening for me.... We used the shuttle to get to the parks, however we didn't return on the shuttle as we preffered the flexability of returning when we pleased, a taxi from Epcot to the hotel would cost us approx $13, a taxi from Universal or Wet 'n' wild would cost about $20-25. When you want to go to Disney the shuttle will take you to Epcot, from there you will either need to get the Monorail or Disney bus to the Disney Park of your choice, its really simple and everything is clearly sign posted, there are also loads of Disney people around to ask if your not sure. The hotel also runs a shuttle to Universal which also stops at Sea World, if you want to go to Wet 'n' Wild you should get the shuttle to Universal, and then jump into one of the many taxis, a taxi from Universal to Wet n wild will cost about $5. If you want to go to Aquatica you should get the shuttle to Sea World, there are free shuttle buses that run between Sea World, Aquatica and Discovery Cove (as these are all the same park owners). Remember when booking the shuttle to do so the night before and to arrive at about 20 minutes before the shuttle is due to leave as you will need to collect your shuttle voucher which they will not give to you until the morning of the shuttle. The hotel reception staff would order a taxi for us, but to be honest every taxi driver you have will give you a card and offer you a discount on future trips.. As we were often very tiered after full days at the park, we used the Pizza Hut and Irish bar on a couple of occasions, both were fine, the irish bar also deliver to the room which is fantastic. We did do a main shop at Walmar (about $5 each way in a taxi) and used the supermarket which is also the Pizza Hut for small items (its not worth paying for a taxi if you only want a bottle of milk), but it is expensive but very convenint if you only want a couple of items. Top Tip We took our spending money on a Travelex cash passport which was fab, however if you need to get cash off this type of card the cashpoint in the hotel will charge you (ALOT), believe it or not the cash points in the Universal, Sea World and Wet n Wild parks whilst they still charge its only small ($2.50 compared to $18 at the hotel)..

The other 2 bedrooms were spacious, and kept our kids happy. The kitchen was modern and well equipped. It was great for cooking meals and making snacks in the evening. The store carried pretty much everything you needed to live, and the Walmart (a very short drive) carried everything else. Our kids loved the pirate ship pool, and spent the cool evenings in the hot tubs. The in-room laundry meant that we could pack light. The staff were always courteous. My only complaint would be the wireless internet \u2013 it was mediocre at the best of times. I had read this somewhere else, and brought my router from home. After a little finagling with their wired system, I managed to set up my own wireless network that worked fantastic. I think the best part of the resort is the location \u2013 we could be at any of the Disney parks, Seaworld, or the Premium Outlet Mall within a couple of minutes - and without having to travel on I-4. The only attraction that was any distance was Universal, which was still only 10 minutes in good traffic.

Overall, it was a wonderful experience and we would definitely not hesitate to stay there again. The rooms are spacious and clean. We stayed in a 2 bedroom hotel, complete with living room, dining room, full kitchen, 2 bathrooms and a washer and dryer. The master bedroom contains a large whirlpool spa tub and a separate shower which came in handy for quick showers after all-day treks to the resorts in the humid Florida weather. Four of us stayed comfortably in this room - me, my husband and our 18 and 23 year old kids. We loved the fact that we did not have to eat out all of the time due to the full kitchen. There are grocery stores nearby where you can stop for groceries and prepare your own meals, which we did quite often. The kitchen is fully equiped with a refrigerator (complete with icemaker), coffee pot, toaster, oven/stove, pots, pans, dishes and utensils. (My only suggestion would be that if you are going to shop at the nearby Walmart for your groceries, you avoid going there on Sunday evenings. The place is packed to the point where you are cart to cart and shoulder to shoulder with other customers. The lines are huge and it's worse than shopping during Black Friday Christmas sales, if you can believe that. Apparently, from what we were told, that's because all of the tour buses and the like come into town on Sundays and everyone has the same idea about grocery shopping on Sunday evenings. You are much better off getting necessities at the nearby Walgreens or Publix which are much less crowded if you absolutely have to shop on Sunday night.) The washer and dryer was compact but big enough if you wanted to wash clothes every other night or so. The resort provided enough detergent to do 1-2 loads, but after that, you had to purchase your own detergent which was no big deal. It was a nice convenience having our own washer and dryer. Since there were 4 of us on the trip and we packed lightly, we washed clothes every other day. There is a large pool at the resort where we spent many mornings and evenings in between visiting the area attractions. We loved it. There is a bar area near the pool that serves refreshments and beverages. In addition, we took advantage of the day spa that is located at the resort. I had the pedicure and my kids had the pedicures and full body massages. We enjoyed being pampered on our trip. The resort staff were friendly and helpful. A great experience!

Our boys are 5, 3 and 1, so I did extensive research to ensure that i pick the perfect accommodation for our family. After several calls to Disney World and soliciting opinions and feedback from friends and family who had traveled to Orlando ..... the jury was out and I couldn't decide on whether to stay on the resort at Disney or nearby off the resort. I ended up booking 3 nights at the Lake Buena Vista Resort Village & Spa and 3 nights at the Carribean Beach Hotel at Disney World. Firstly, I have to say that the value for the price we paid at Lake Buena Vista was amazing. We had a beautiful 2-bedroom, 2 bathroom condo style suite with a kitchen, laundry in the unit, a large bathroom in the master bedroom and a balcony overlooking the pool. The pool is very well maintained, amazing for children with a great shallow end and deep end for older kids and adults. It also features two hot tubs, towel service and an outdoor restaurant and bar. After enjoying 4 days at Lake Buena Vista (did I mention that there are 3 amazing brand name shopping outlets within a 15-minute drive)? And then there's every Mother's necessity - Walmart is a 5-minute drive up the road! Anyways, after enjoying 4 days at Lake Buena vista, we were excited to move over to Disney and start exploring the parks. The minute we entered our room at Carribean Beach Resort, my heart sank. It was a small, dark room with two double beds. I knew that the room would not be huge, however on the phone, I was told that there would be enough room for a playpen for our infant son ..... not the case at all. My husband and I quickly realized what a mistake we had made and after enjoying a day at the park we called Lake Buena Vista and were lucky enough to get another suite for the remainder of our trip. We were only a short 7-minute drive to Disney and we had the luxury of cooking in the unit when we didn't feel like eating out, doing our laundry as needed and had more than enough space for our family to be comfortable after a long day at the parks.

Wish I had found this sooner! I read a lot of reviews on any hotels we stay in; if there are a few negative reviews, it's no big deal -- we'll give it a try. Like most, we found that parking was not the best -- but, that's because they allow you to have as many cars as you need and don't charge you anything. We never had to park on the road, though. We were able to always find a spot in the garage. We typically have 7-10 family members traveling with us most of the time; we normally get 3 separate rooms.

A bonus was to also have complimentary washing powder, washing up liquid, dish washer tablets.

The view as requested over looked (albeit at a distance of a few miles the Disney Park so that it was possible to see the firework displays). The staff were all very helpful and be advised to not buy postage stamps at the Pizza Hut local to the resort as they charge $1.15 per stamp to send cards home to England. Buy them for 80 cents at the Supermarkets such as Walmart which is literally just around the corner from the resort. The resort for us was perfectly distanced from the hussle and bustle of Down Town Disney. The only cautionary observation was that the room overlooked a busy main road but quite honestly the slight noise is not an issue as generally speaking the doors and windows would be shut to maintain the air conditioning.

It's only 15 minute drive to any of the Disney parks. There is a restaurant-pub (2-star at best), a convenience store, and a pirate-themed pool area on the property. A 24-hour Walmart five minutes down the highway makes it easy to lay in supplies when you want to get away from all the Disney. The units are clean, comfortable and well-appointed. Furnishings are a little old and faded but who cares? A full size fridge and stove made it possible to have most dinners at home. Some people want to go all-Disney-all-the-time. We don't. By the end of a long day at the parks, being able to come home and have a light supper of soup, eggs, pasta, or the like, made it possible for us to get up and start over again the next morning. Important to note that rooms are not serviced on a daily basis. We liked that as we could just live in the unit for the week without anyone traipsing in. It was no problem to empty the garbage in the hallway, and the en-suite washer and dryer meant you could wash your own linens and towels if you wanted to. You can pay extra for cleaning services if you want. The resort is right beside a lower-end outlet mall. Handy if you find out you forgot to pack a bathing suit, or the weather changes suddenly. The staff is very courteous and helpful. I complained about a ceiling fan that rattled and they came to fix it right away. The concierge staff could be a bit more conscientious. You kinda have to push them to help and they can make some pretty colossal errors. I asked for a printed out map of directions to a theme restaurant and they sent me totally the wrong way. We realized later that they inputted the wrong address into Google Maps. Thank goodness for iPhone's GPS. We toured a Disney resort and came out absolutely confirmed that we made the right choice. While the resort was much higher end and right in the park, all that Disney was too much. The food at the resort was grim, and the pool area nowhere near as good for kids.

They were a little hesitant to give it a try but after much convincing and pricing..they gave in. For the deals you can find on this hotel, you get a great deal. We had the 3 bedroom 3 bath in building 2. Both king size bedrooms have a whirlpool jacuzzi in it. Very spacious, kitchen, washer, dryer,..etc. The description says it all. Upon arriving..very warm friendly check in...absolutely NO bugs..including a Bed Bug inspection because they are in lots of hotels now a days, clean rooms and a nice feel. I saw some people complain about the rugs but what can you do?? I have a 2 year old and they spill things..it happens. They are not the worst rugs and I'm sure you've seen worse. I don't understand why people are complaining about the beds since everyone in my party had amazing sleeps. Anything you need is at the walmart down the block...enough said. I'm writing this review because everyone in my party was not on board at all for this resort and upon checkout...everyone thanked me and LOVED this place. My parents are coming back and staying here, we will be here again and my brother will be using it also. The only regret we have is not having enough time there to take advantage of the pirate pool this time. Too many parks to squeeze in this trip in a short time.

My parents had a two bed room, and my sister had a two bedroom also. So that's 9 in total. Sure the carpet may need to be upgraded in the halls, but so what. That's the only issue we had. But guess what, we spent all of our time offsite, enjoying Disney not the Condo. The condo itself however, was well maintained, and had everything we needed. We had a big family dinner, with only 6 settings and nobody died. We are all okay. There were no swings or play area for the kids, but I never saw that on the website.

In the past ten years we have been to Orlando around 10 times and we have stayed at a lot of hotels -Boardwalk, Yacht & Beach, JW Marriott, Port Orleans, to name a few. I\u2019ve always said that if we were paying ourselves I would not stay at a Disney or high end property as there are lots of deals to be had. I booked The Buena Vista Resort for a long weekend, with the criteria being that I was looking for a great pool and a 2 bedroom unit at a good price. After reading lots of reviews I booked the 2 bedroom unit with a fireworks view at a great price, I watched the price on line and it was reduced, I called the hotel and they were happy to reduce my price so the deal even got better. As our trip approached some of the reviews were very critical and I was a bit worried. I\u2019m not sure what those people were complaining about!!! It\u2019s not perfect but for the price\u2026.I could not have been happier. The pool was great, not crowded, and 3 hot tubs so if one were busy it seemed that there was always one free. Bar right at the pool to have a drink and some snacks- the food is not great but if your hungry they have a few things. We had a room on the 14th floor so we have the extended balcony- everyone loved the room, the kids enjoyed having their own room and TV, my husband and I enjoyed the hot tub in our room after a long day in the park. Our 2 bedroom unit had 3 TV\u2019s and 2 baths, a full kitchen with unexpected equipment like a blender, electric can opener and such. The kitchen had everything you would need to make a simple meal. The only thing we could have used would be coffee filters- but we did not request any. One thing I read on tripadvisor is the sheet issue- for the king bed the sheets did not fit. I find this point a bit frustrating as its been reported on tripadvisor numerous times, management must be aware of it. I called the front desk and they promptly brought up new sheets that fit, so they do HAVE sheets that fit. The front desk acted as if they had never heard this issue with the sheets before which I found a little strange but, whatever, the issue was taken care of quickly. The beds were not the softest, but adequate. The shower in the master bath had terrible water pressure, I took a shower in the second bathroom which had very good pressure so it was not an issue. We did not use the cleaning service and did not miss it. Parking was ample all day, we had no issues. The pool was open until 10pm which I appreciated after getting back from the parks. One thing I would advise is not to pay extra for the \u201cfireworks\u201d view- the fireworks are really far in the distance, you probably will not be in your room at the exact time the fireworks are going off and honestly I did not appreciate the view or sound of the highway which is the \u2018view\u2019 you will see most of the time, next time I would probably prefer a pool view. Critical reviewers mentioned wear and tear- I did not think it excessive, the hallways could use some new carpet- but in our room I felt the carpet was in reasonable shape. One thing I should mention is the wireless signal is terrible, if you have work to do and rely on a steady computer signal you will be frustrated as it keeps dropping off. I went to the lobby and tried to use the computers offered but they wanted to charge me something like $2.95 per minute which I did not appreciate. They do allow you use of the computer and printer for free when checking in with your airline and printing barding passes. So it was not perfect but I think a great hotel for the price. We have paid double the amount at Disney hotels for one room with 2 double beds. At Buena Vista we were able to spread out and relax in our room. I would recommend this hotel, for families I suggest requesting buildings 3, 4 or 5 which are close to the pirate ship pool. Buildings 1 and 2 are across the parking lot and near the quiet pool which might be better for guests without children.

We had a great time. This is our 3rd visit to Orlando and we have previously stayed in Villa's so this was something new for us. We decided to stay here as it was more of a resort style and with our eldest son being 9, we thought he would appreciate some interaction with other kids his age. Also on our last visit we also decided we wanted somewhere more central rather than having a half hour drive to the parks. So firstly the good. The location really is fantastic. Expect no more than a 10 minute drive to any of the parks (other than Busch gardens obviously) Sea World, Wet N Wild, Aquatica, Universal and Disney can all be reached with a very quick hop in the car. There are also 2 large discount malls - one within a short walking distance, the other a 5 minute drive. The pool area is great. My youngest can't quite swim yet and there was plenty of paddling areas for her to splash in and a surprisingly fast slide in the pirate ship to keep my son occupied for hours. The pool is warm and clean. The Jacuzzi\u2019s (of which there are three) were a bit too hot! The pool area is a great place to finish off a hard day at the parks and my kids were always playing with other kids. The rooms are perfectly adequate. The bedrooms are big and the pictures available on this site accurately reflect exactly what you get. There are washing machines, dryers, dishwashers, a well equipped kitchen, a very big spa bath and probably the biggest shower I have ever been in. The balcony will also sit 4 people comfortably. We were only awoken once, at 3 am with a very noisy party above us. We phoned reception to complain and the party finished 5 minutes later. The front desk were very helpful on each occasion that we sought their advice. Secondly the average. We stayed on the 5th floor of building 5 (which I understand is the newest of the blocks) I thought it looked a little tired. Having previously stayed in Villa's that have had the 'wow' factor our apartment did not. I would also like to have seen a parental lock on the door to the balcony. With a resort that will attract parents with young children we were surprised that this was not a standard feature.

We went to Magic Kingdom, Universal Studios and Downtown Disney during our trip and they were all easy to get to and not too far.

Upon our arrival, after driving 17 hours, we were told OUR room wasn't ready. I emphasize OUR because the second half of our party, who had driven down as well, got in their room immediately. We had asked for early check-in, however, the front desk didn't have any record of our request..oh well. This extra time allowed us to visit the pool bar, very nice. The drinks were well poured and the bartender, I believe his name was Steven, was very accommodating and friendly. Added bonus for the pool area...all Jimmy Buffett all the time. Upon a third check to see if our room was ready we were again told no....but wait...one of the other front desk folks whose name alludes me, intervened and found not one, but several rooms we could have. The girl who was working with us (the same girl who had informed us our room wasn't ready before) finished our check-in and sent us on our way. Again, I don't recall her name, however, she looks like Madison Pettis (Sophie) of Cory in the House. Anyway, once we arrived at our room, bags in hand, we inserted the key, got a green light, turned the handle, and......the thingy that prevents the door from opening all the way stopped us in our tracks. At this point the person actually occupying the room rushed to the door, visibly shaken, informing us in a loud voice that someone was already in the room. Needless to say my wife, my mother, my sister, my daughter, and I were beyond embarrassed. I immediately went to the front desk and asked for the manager. The manager, a very nice young man with a very thin beard(?) immediately went to work to rectify the situation. He apologized over and over and insisted on accompanying me back to my family with keys to another room. I am happy to say that this room was guest-free. The room itself was very nice. It was clean and spacious and a welcomed comfort for weary travelers. The rest or our stay was nice, and event free until the last morning. The morning of our check-out was going along just fine until I made the mistake of asking the woman behind the bar at the pool for some ketchup. We had made breakfast in our room that morning and my daughter wanted some ketchup for her potatoes. I went downstairs to the pool bar, where I believe they serve breakfast every morning, and asked for some ketchup. The woman behind the bar's reaction went like this.....\"we're not supposed to give this stuff out\" (this stuff being ketchup packets) and very rudely slammed ONE packet of ketchup down on the bar in front of me. As she slammed the packet down she immediately turned and walked away before I had a chance to thank her for the ONE packet of ketchup. All-in-all this hotel is very nice and the staff very accommodating, however, based on the two not so small hiccups I couldn't give it higher rating. Will we return? I don't know.

My party consisted of 4 adults and 2 children. We stayed in a 3 bed apartment on the 15th floor. I was slightly concerned prior to arrival as some reviews has reported mould and worn / damaged furniture. I am pleased to say that I didn\u2019t encounter any of these. The actual suite had the air of a well used holiday let. The carpets were well trodden, there were marks on the walls, the lounge area coffee table was chipped round the edges were I suspect it had been used as a footstall by previous guests. That said the suite was clean and the towels and bed linen were clean and fresh. On the subject of bed linen, on the two double beds the fitted sheet was too small and did keep pinging off during the night, which is undesirable. I didn\u2019t report it to reception so there is no way of knowing whether they could have provided larger bed sheets had I asked. The master suite was of an open plan design, including the toilet area which offered no privacy if you needed the facility during the night! Definitely not ideal! This could be because we were staying in an adapted apartment for disabled guests. There was the family bathroom that could be used as an alternative, but does somewhat defeat the idea of an en-suite. It may be worth clarifying with reception when you check in. The kitchen area is reasonable. It does not seem designed for guests to cook an evening meal, more to prepare a light breakfast. It lacked work surface space. It was stocked with pots pans and all the basic kitchen equipment you would expect to find. The balcony offered a reasonable view, and patio furniture was provided. The communal areas of the hotel are cleaned daily and are spotlessly clean, if a little shabby in places. This is excluding the reception which is immaculate and belies the rest of the hotel somewhat. The hotel reception and the concierge staff were polite and knowledgeable. I personally did not go in the main pool, but I did accompany my party to poolside. The main pool is open from 7am to 10 pm daily. The pool is definitely designed for a children / family perspective, which suited us, but might not suit couples. The galleon ship is actually a single water slide. There is a much smaller second pool. All pool facilities were clean and well maintained. The pool bar provides drinks and refreshments, but is rather costly, and you are not permitted to take your own refreshments to poolside. The hotel offers free Wi-Fi which you have to register for at reception. While this facility is there is is sometimes hard to to get a signal on the 15th floor of the 3rd block. From a location perspective, this hotel is ideally suited if you have a family with impatient children as you are literally 5 minute drive from the main Disney road network, and only about a 10 \u2013 12 minute drive from the Seaworld area and International Drive. There is a main shopping outlet area immediately over the road which you can walk through to from the hotel. Wal-mart is a 3 \u2013 4 minute drive away. There is a resturant, Frankie Farrells opposite which serves Irish / british style food - with an American take on it. Its a bit pricey but good quality, though the resturant does lack atmosphere. The shuttle bus service only operates at limited times to selected parks, so it not ideal as the only transportation link. It is however easy to book and arrives and departs punctually. Ideally you do need your own hire car. Overall I would probably recommend this hotel for families, but probably not for couples. However it is fairly expensive, and you can get better facilities for less money, but this can be offset against time spent travelling to and from attractions.

Upon check-in we were very pleased. We stayed in building 5 on the 6th floor. Our patio view was a wood area and we could see some of the outlets at an angle. The condo was clean and appealing to the eye. The kitchen was spacious and had granite-like tops and like new appliances. The fridge and freezer were very clean and ice cold. The bedrooms were great. The master bedroom was gorgeous! It included a king size bed, jacuzzi tub, walk in shower, private toilet area, large dresser, and double sinks. There was also a walk-in closet. The blinds were modern white wood blinds in both rooms. It was nice because it kept the light out in the morning. The second bedroom had two twin/full beds a closet and a dresser draw. Each room had a decent sized television, night stand, and lamps. The washer and dryer was perfect. They also provided a complimentary Tide detergent. We declined room service so we washed our own towels and kept the place tidy. The bath towels could use improvement. Although they were soft the quality was poor and would shed cotton as you were drying off your skin. Which really isn't a big deal it is just an observation. The dining room area was spacious and the chairs and table were in excellent condition. I liked the pineapple dining table since pineapples represent hospitality. The living room had a sleep sofa and two large comfortable chairs. The second bathroom would be your standard hotel bathroom. It was clean and neither bathroom had any mildew or mold issues which is hard to stay away from since it is Florida. The pool area was so much fun. There is a pirate ship and the kids had a great time. The pool smelled like chlorine which is always a good sign. There is a pub/restaurant on-site and also a Pizza Hut. The Lake Buena Vista Outlet is in walking distance since it is in the same loop as the resort. There was more than enough parking and there was also a parking garage which was great since it was raining when we were there. The resort fee is very low compared to other hotels in the Downtown Disney/LBV area. Is there a little wear and tear in our condo? Yes, but it would not hinder me from returning to this resort because it is not anything out of the ordinary. It is close to Wal-Mart and Target and many restaurants.

The rooms and corridors were not dirty but they definitely needed a Sping clean. The paintwork and carpets looked tired and faded and definitely needed freshening up. The room we were allocated was designed for disabled guests and was on the 15th floor of block 3. None of my party was disabled. I have to ask why disabled accommodation is on the highest floor of a building. The main bedroom was open plan. The bed was large and comfortable though my wife complained that the bedclothes were too small for the size of the bed. I see there have been others who have made the same criticism. The ensuite shower was an open wet room and the shower Had barely any pressure. It was as if you turned the tap on and relied on the force of gravity to get the water to fall out of the shower head. The toilet was also open plan and offered no privacy whatsoever. Moving on: the apartment was described as self contained. One would expect there be facilities to fall within that description. There perfectly good washing machine and tumble dryer which was utilised. There was an excellent fridge/freezer. But there was no work surface on which one could prepare a meal. There was no cupboard space to put shopping. The limited amount of cupboad space in the kitchen area was full of glasses, crockery and saucepans. There was a very small bottle of wasing up liquid but no wash cloth provided. There was just one small tea towel. The message was clear, the idea was for you not to self cater but use the affiliated restaurant Frankie O'Farrels. Frankie O'Farrels, what a disappointment that place was. The place lacked atmosphere. I went there on two occasions. The first time was on a Sunday. There was no more than 12 people in the place. I then went again on a Friday mainly because I had a discount voucher given to me when I checked into the resort and which I had not used on my first visit. Again the place was virtually empty. The food was at best average but was expensive. Part of the problem methinks. The pool area was OK. I have seen better pools but I have seen a lot worse. My grandchildren enjoyed it however, so that was alright. I don't want to appear to be a whinging tourist because I'm not. This is the first time I've ever written a review.

Wal Mart is close by but quite busy road to walk too so we got taxi. The local shop is very very expensive so dont go in. Ate in the Irish bar a few times on the evening and a couple of times for breakfast. Was very nice, do advise that on the evening you take a jacket or something as the air con is very high and I would freeze.

THe layed on buses had to be booked 24 hours before and only at set times. we ended up having to pay for taxis alot of the time and spent an absolute fortune.

This was a family trip including Disney World, Sea World, the Kennedy Space Center, Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure. The location here is absolutely ideal. It's close to and easy to get to all of the parks. Minutes away from the 4 Disney Parks and only a few minutes more to the others as well as a very reasonable drive to the Atlantic coast. It's easy to get to the hotel from the airport too. We had the St. Lucia suite and it was unbelievably spacious. We had only our family of 5 in the suite. Our son met some other people at the pool who had two families staying comfortably in a same-size suite. It was fabulous to come back from a long day of family fun at the crowded parks and to be able to relax, spread out, and have some breathing room! The kitchen in the suite was all we needed and it was a great plus to have a washer and dryer right in the room. The suite was very clean and there is a vacuum cleaner in one of the closets for you to use if you are not paying for extra housekeeping. We enjoyed the two pools as well, even though we often were not back to the hotel until evening. The pirate-themed pool was cute, but the kids actually preferred going in the smaller pool near the convenience store. The outlet mall next door had some good sales and deals even though, again, we didn't have a lot of time to shop. But, if not for the outlet mall, we wouldn't have gotten any non- gift shop shopping in at all! We also liked the pub downstairs and enjoyed a meal there our first night in. One other night we got take out pizza from the Pizza Hut right downstairs. The convenience store downstairs is quite expensive. Better to go to the Walmart which is only a few blocks away for supplies like cold drinks, snack and breakfast items and toilet paper (!) (Because the housekeeping is not included, you will not have toilet paper restocked for you and it's expensive downstairs). Do NOT use the ATM in the lobby if you can help it at all. It charges an outrageous user fee. The jacuzzi tub in our suite didn't work at first. We mentioned this to the office and it was fixed by the time we got back that night. Our only real complaint is that the sheets did not fit the king size beds or twin size beds very well, and we all found that the sheets kept coming off the beds all night for all of us.

We chose not to have Maid service as we felt it not neccessary. We got loads of Leaflets under our door for Pizza etc, the outside doors were open for ANYONE to enter by even though they should have been Card/Key entry only! The Pirate Pool was good & relaxing but the Bar was expensive for everything as they have the monopoly on site as there is only them & the 'Irish Bar'!! we could not believe how LBV is perfectly central for all the Theme Parks, We had car hire so did not use their Transport.The local shopping mall was roughly the same price as everywhere else as we went to a few. There is a Walmart 2 minutes down the road, The on site supermarket was expensive. Also Walmart was the cheapest for Disney Tickets etc if you had not already pre-booked yours. Be warned that all theme parks go on finger recognition so be careful when buying from resale tickets. .

I got a good price thru VRBO and I paid in full 2 weeks before our trip for a 3 bedroom 2 bath unit. We were horribly delayed by United Airlines and did not arrive to the property until 3:30am on July 21. I had tried calling the hotels reservation line twice while we were delayed in LAX in order to inform them of our delay, however the call was dropped and did not go thru. So, since I had paid in advance for my unit anyway, I figured our unit would be held. That was not the case. We got there exhausted from over 24 hours of travel and a 1 1/2 hour car trip from Tampa to find the hotel was pretty booked. I was also chastised for not calling to inform them how late I was going to be. They then informed me that my room had been given away! Luckily for me, they had a 3 bedroom 3 bath available and thankfully they did not charge me for the difference. Because my original unit was paid in full, they should not have had the option of giving it to another guest. Room Condition: Overall the room was nice and very large. The furniture has the \"sat-in\" look to it. The rugs were pretty warn though. The stackable washer and dryer worked great. The Central AC is AWESOME!! We had two jetted tubs in each of the master bedrooms. My sister had a tub with lights, she felt like she was in a dance club and loved it whenever she took a bath. My tub did not work well. It took us 10 mintues of pressing all the buttons until it finally kicked on. I got into bed after my bath and the darn tub kicked back on twice by itself. Very weird, so I ended up never using the jets. The tubs are extemely deep and wonderful after all the walking we did at the parks. You can also watch tv right from the tub! The bathrooms were nice and the shower was large and I never ran out of hot water. Each unit has its own large water heater! The kitchen was great. I was really hoping that each unit would have items left behind like condiments and laundry soap from previous guests. Unfortunantly, the condo's are completely empty so you will have to purchase EVERYTHING. There was only one extra roll of toilet paper so we had to purchase that the very next day along with paper towels. They did leave a mini bottle of dish soap to hand wash dishes and 1 extra garbage bag. Note to the resort: You should keep all of the unused portions of laundry soaps, TP, paper towels etc. for future guests. I know when I checked out, I left almost a full bottle of laundry soap and fabric softener, half a package of TP and an extra roll of paper towels. The worst issue I had with our room was the bed. It was not very comfortable and it was bowed in the middle from all of the use. Had I stayed at the hotel a little longer, I would have purchased a mattress topper! The pillows were pretty lousy too, just your basic pillow. We were able to sleep because of how exhausted we were from all of the walking. The beds were the same in all rooms. The rooms also were not very sound proof. My sister was woken up one night to country music being played at 3am. I also heard the neighbors yelling at their kids accross the hall one morning. Parking: The parking lot was always full but I was able to find parking on the street right in front of our condo most nights. If you come back really late at night, like we did once, parking could be a challenge. And one time, I parked on the street and some jerk reversed his car really close to mine so I got pinned in the stall. Took me some maneuvering to get out. Location: The hotel is in a great location. You are right next to the outlet mall. Walmart is very close along with many restaurants and there were a few miniture golf places near it. It took about 10 minutes to make it to each park. Overall, my stay was okay but the bed was a real deal breaker for me. Parking was not the best either and the room was a little noisy. On the plus side, the rooms were very large, clean and safe. Out of 10, I would give my stay a 6.", "Date": "August 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Whitburn, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201c3rd time at this resort and still loved it\u201d", "Author": "alangr40", "ReviewID": "UR116275708", "Content": "Right from the start of our holiday the staff were very welcoming and helpful especially Trish.

The apartment that we had was fine, all the furniture was nice, everything was clean and worked. The only downside was that the apartment smelled of smoke and being non-smokers this was unpleasant. The aircon worked very well and kept the apartment very cool as it was very hot when we were there. The washer and dryer were excellent. The pirate ship in the pool was fun for the children, although you could only go on it at certain times and you could only use it as a slide and not to play on the boat itself. The pool itself was lovely as was the hot tub in the corner. The poolside bar was very expensive - buy your stuff in Wal-mart as it is so much cheaper. The nearest shop is a small mini market and although has general supplies it is very expensive. It does have a pizza hut cafe, which is ok. There was a small gym on site, which looked quite good but we didn't use it. There was also a games room with a pool table etc. There is a Wal-mart down the road which is excellent and it is worth going and stocking up. Only problem going to Wal-mart is if you are walking is that there are no footpaths and you are walking right next to the very busy interstate and it seemed very dangerous. We would get a taxi to and from Wal-mart which was approx $6 each way. The bus came to take you to Disney twice a day, this had to be booked 24 hours in advance and to be honest was always a daily drama! One bus broke down one day and that was it to be honest, the service was very hit and miss!! The bus times were not that convenient and when you returned there were only two times that you could come home. The fireworks at the Disney parks tended to end at about 9pm so you had to hang around for an hour and a half to get the bus back, and that was if it showed up on time. With young children this was not ideal. The bus service was free. There is an outlet village right next to the apartments which was fine, they had some good disney stuff which was half the price! Wal-mart was excellent for all Disney items and very good value for money. Don't buy anything at the hotel (eg poncho's) as they are only 99c at Wal-mart and the hotel charged about $6!! The only thing I would say that if you are staying here you do need a car to get around as there is not much near by and you half to walk by the very busy interstate which with young children is not ideal. There are not many eating places nearby. We had problems with the company that the hotel uses for it's taxi's as they do not turn up on time and we missed a very expensive trip that we had booked.

One of the highlights of this resort is the pool. It's an easy walk on a path behind the units to this family friendly area. There's an enormous pirate ship with slides, they do hair braiding and wraps, they have a separate area for little ones with those mushroom-tree water features, and their pool bar and grille is uber convenient and good. I have also enjoyed the onsite SPA. First, you won't believe the size of it - it's big! They offer mani/pedis and a variety of body treatments. The treatment rooms are lovely, too. Sit in the relaxation area and enjoy the saltwater fish tanks and soothing lighting. Ahh. Loved it. Gift shop onsite as well, found some cute trinkets that I haven't seen anywhere else. Location! Walk right across the parking lot to the Outlet shops. Can't beat that - even get a discount coupon book at check-in. Want pizza late at night?

Sadly, they are all gone! We only recognized one clerk from last time, and when we asked what happened to everyone, we were told that a change in management caused everyone to leave! Well, as our stay progressed, we found this to be true. We had an issue with the cleanliness of our room, and left word for the manager to call us... three times. Nobody ever did. The entire attitude of the staff and management has changed since our last visit. The front clerks are apathetic and poorly trained, they let the phones ring off the walls, and when we finally did speak with TWO managers at check-out, neither of them seemed to know what was going on. We spoke with the \"Guest Service\" Manager, and she wasn't even interested. We stopped a young man, the \"Assistant General\" Manager, and he looked like a deer caught in headlights when we tried to talk to him.

The second bedroom had two double beds, a TV, and storage with a separate larger bathroom next to that with full tub and shower, sink, and toilet. There was a compact washer/dryer combo in a closet/pantry off of the kitchen, which we used to do all of our laundry before going home in between eating dinner, swimming, getting ready for bed, and watching fireworks. It worked awesome. The kitchen included everything you could need to make any meals such as full stove, full fridge with great ice maker, microwave, coffee maker, pots, pans, lots of silverware, knives, glasses, can opener, etc.; however, I think it depends on what room you get on what the extras are included.

We started our trip off with a pirate theme at Pirate's League at Magic Kingdom and the pirate ship sitting in the middle of the pool on our last night made a perfect end to this. Our younger son liked splashing around in the shallow end most of the time and our older one loved the pirate slide into the deeper side of the pool. We sat at a table right behind the ship and could see both playing at the same time. The staff were great at the pools and really watched the kiddos, especially on the slide.

Didn't really go down to the pool much, as children were older but it seemed a very limited food menu from pool side bar. It certainly didn't entice me to try breakfast there. If we wanted a pool day we went to Aquatica which the kids loved. We didn't use the new spa facilties/book any massage/beauty treatments so I can't comment but overall it seems incongruous that it should have a new upmarket spa facility but no on-site decent restaurants (we never went to the Irish pub on site). I completely objected to paying for room cleaning-we were there for two weeks so I would have liked at least a weekly clean in the price. Location was convenient for several theme parks eg Aquatica, Sea world, Disney etc. . It was an easyish drive to Universal too. You do need your own car though. Outlet centre next door pretty poor but okay for an hour or so if you have time to spare. Would I stay again -no but it was fine for the time we were there and perhaps we were lucky with our apartment.", "Date": "July 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Chester, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cOkay.

To make this review user-friendly I will point out the pros and cons: Pros. 1) Price was good. Plus we were upgraded from a small 4-bedroom suite to the large 4-bedroom suite. 2) Suite was huge! 3) Location to park was pretty convenient IF you had your own transportation. 4) Drinks from the poolside snack bar were gooood! 5) Free towels were supplied at the pirate pool. 5) Nice kitchen in suite. 6) Walmart close by to purchase food \u2013 good prices if you are used to Northeast pricing like we are \u2013 but must have own transportation. 7) The Irish Pub in the resort compound had good food and was decently priced. Cons. 1) Decor and furniture very tired and borderline outdated. Our furniture was dirty, a little ripped, and the drawers stuck on our dresser, so I kept my clothes in my suitcase. 2) Shuttle to parks was very inconvenient \u2013 only ran twice a day and you had to reserve it 24 hours in advance. 3) The elevator in our building backed up to our bedroom and made noise throughout the night. When we complained about it, they said we just had to deal with it or they would move us to another room. There were 8 of us, so we dealt with it. 4) Funky smell in hallways and suite. 5) The overall maintenance was lacking. The \u2018resort\u2019 could use a little TLC. 6) Our room keys intermittently worked. 7) Snack bar food was horrendous and criminally overpriced. 8) TVs were pretty old. 9) You had to pay extra for maid service - so we didn't.

We chose this accomodation as we were holidaying with friends who were staying on Disney and this was only 5 mins drive from where they were. We were staying at this hotel as a party of 4 adults & 2 children therfore we had booked a 3 bedroom apt. When we arrived the check in was quick & smooth & the lady on check in was very friendly and advised us we had been given a room on a high floor as you get great view of the fireworks from Disney which was great for the children however as we were so high we didnt use the balcony as I didnt like being so high with young children and in future would choose a lower floor over the view of the fireworks. Having read some of the reviews before we came I was slightly worried as to what the standard of the room would be and as we went up to the room I was still concerned as the communal areas are quite dated and could do with a redecoration but this is purely cosmetic it is still nice and clean. When we arrived at our room we were delighted, our apartment was FAB, it had a lovely modern kitchen with a big oven, hob, microwave and fridge freezer. The dining area had a lovely big dining table, it is open plan with the comfortable lounge area and 3 spacious bedrooms all with plasma tvs and a family bathroom with shower. The master bedroom had a large shower, jaquzzi bath and a seperate toliet. It also had a walk in wardrobe. As were were only staying here for 8 nights we didnt really use the pool area apart from once for about 20 mins just to let the children have a swim before we went out on the evening but from what we saw it was great for kids and has a pirate ship with waterslide. The hotel is in a great location it was 5-10 minsdrive from all the Disney parks making it easy to return to the hotel to get changed and go back on the night. It is about 15 mins from international drive & universal studios. The bar / resturant next to the hotel \"Frankie O Farrells\" is typical pub food but tasty and good value for money and if you ask at the hotel reception they will give you discount vouchers. There is a small supermarket on the complex which has a pizza hut takeaway inside but for basics like milk etc it is very expensive you are much better going to Walmart which is 5 mins away. It is really easy to find you turn left at the traffic lights as you leave the hotel then it is a straight drive 5 mins (max) up on the right hand side. If I was to find a fault, the only one I could find with this hotel was when we checked in we asked if there was a cot in the room as we had requested this as an extra when booking for our 2 year old as they only come as standard for under 2s. The lady said that there wasn't but She would arrange for one to be sent up straight away. We then went to our room unpacked and went out for dinner however when we returned to the room 2 hours later there was still no cot this was not ideal at 9pm when we had a tried 2 year old who had been on a long flight, without much sleep and awake for nearly 20 hours ! We rang the reception to complain and they promised they would have a cot to us within half an hour but we said as we were so tired just to leave it until the morning and the baby would sleep in our bed, we then when we had got everyone settled and went to bed however we woken an hour later with the arrival of the cot !!!!

Where to begin... The grounds are beautiful and the pools are fantastic. Our third floor balcony overlooked the small pool and that was very nice. ALL the kids teenages and six year old LOVED the bigger pool/splash area and slide on the pirate ship side. The pools were a lot of fun.. The condo however... well... Carpet is very dirty.. You can see the stains on it everywhere. Furniture in living room looks old dirty and VERY worn out. Air vent in bedroom in of the bedrooms wasn't working or wasn't working well (not sure they were too high to tell) but one of the bedrooms stayed hot unless the rest of the unit was freezing. Stocked kitchen was anything but. As far as the cookware.. You got one skillet a small pot and a large pot.. that's it.. There was no baking sheet for biscuits, no spatula, the toaster pops up sometimes. The worst is the first two days we drank really icky tasting coffee. We thought it was just the water wasn't the greatest there. We bought gallon of spring water and it was still bad.. Come to find out the coffee pot had MOLD in it.. Once I cleaned it and ran some vinegar few it a few times the coffee was fine but my family drank mold water for two days.. When you pay around 1300 for a week it should at least be clean and updated, we could have got a place like this for much less money but we wanted something nice.. Oh the TVS are not the flat screen they are the older big projection tv in the living room and two older smaller tvs in the bedrooms. . Oh and while I am on bedrooms.. The beds are hard, the bedspreads weren't clean and I bet reused because they are the old fashioned motel type bedspreads. We put them in the closet. The pillows were the hardest I ever felt. We went to walmart and bought the 4.00 pillows and then slept much better. Oh some nights we couldn't find a place to park and had to park at the other end of the block or leave car on street because the lot was full. They were also struck by lightening and the internet was not working or messed up most of the week. Oh one more positive is there is a hot tub in the master. The hot tub in the master bedroom has cool lights in it and is very nice and relaxing after a long day at the parks..

When I first arrived I should have known better as I held the elevator door open for 2 twenty something guys using the luggage cart to roll in several cases of beer. Although there are many families staying here, there are also alot of partiers and non families using the inexpensive prices and suite sizes to have a cheap, party vacation. Its basically spring break to alot of these people. So lets go through the good and the bad. The good: good location. Close to Walmart, gas station, route 4 both to Tampa and Orlando. Lots of places to eat within a close driving range. The suites have kitchens & washer/dryer. The bad: the suite needs a renovation. the sofa was gross. I wouldn't let my son sit on it. Mystery stains on the carpet in several places as well as mystery splatters on the walls in all the rooms. I had to use soap& water to clean the outside patio furniture so we could use it. Parking is bad. Not enough spaces. The Pool is fine during the week but on the weekends it is pure chaos. Wall to wall people saving the seats with towels. The pool water was a slick of sun tan lotion floating ontop of it. The first night was fine & quiet but Sunday night was a different story. A family checked in above me & their kids would run across the floor until 2am. I thought ok they are excited &it's their first night in Disney. But no this lasted every single night for the next 7 nights. They would start up their jet tub between 1 and 2am which sounds like a boat motor running above my bedroom. I called the front desk every night starting at midnight & they claimed the family was portugesse & didn't understand english yet the management never offered to move me. I spent every night of my vacation suffering underneath this ignorant family. At one point I resorted to banging the ceiling with the ironing board at 2:30am to try &make the kids stop running. Again, Management did nothing except say they were sorry. On the last night, the same thing from the family above me heightened with a new twist-a balcony party from the room a floor down. 5 guys drinking and shouting on the balcony until 4am. Again, Management couldnt stop them. In fact they claimed security couldnt figure out what room it was. Excuse me? Hello walk outside, look up and there they are-5 guys drunk off their butts at 2am screaming on the balcony. How can you not tell who was doing it. I got got two hours of sleep before I had to get up to catch my plane. My son who is only 11 was kept up every night as was I. We were both so tired from a week of ignorant people and spineless management. I actually couldnt believe I actually paid money for this. Even when I checked out, not one offer to compensate me or any offer to have a manager speak to me. I really cant recommend this place to any family. Management should be ashamed of themselves for letting their hotel be so out of control. One last comment is in reference to the on site Irish Pub-went in on the second night. Arrived at 4pm. hardly anyone in the place yet the floor was filthy. My shoes were sticking the floor under our table and I actually had to push food to the side with my foot that was on the floor. Food was ok. Not bad not great. Ok. As we were leaving I noticed the back of my son's shirt was covered with ketchup. I went back to the booth and saw that the booth seat had ketchup all over it. it was not from him as it was half dry and smeared all over the booth seat and backing to the seat. So I cant even recommend the restaurant. I normally do not leave comments at all when I have a bad experience but I stayed here based on the reviews from trip advisor people and did alot of research on the best family place to stay and really thought this was it. It wasnt.

We used hotel transport to and from the parks, this really was our only gripe, the bus was usually full and you do have to stand, but a 2nd bus would also turn up (which was empty) pick up those who could not get on the 1st bus and then still go to the same destination!! This we did no understand! apart from that, it as always on time both to pick up and drop off and was daily. The parks are very near and the bus drops you at epcot/univeral/sea world.

Lots of stains and pulled threads. Extremely dirty showers and bathrooms. We took photos of the mold and dirt that could easily be removed with some Clorox Clean Up. There's a $5 charge for fresh towels and trash removal. I guess times are tough. Bring your one Purex 3-in-1 laundry detergent to do your own towels. The minimal kitchenware available was dirty and over used. Extremely dirty carpet and tile (the kids' feet were black in minutes). Very long check-in line and long wait time.

One thing to watch out for here was the Hotel Resort fee of $9.50 per day? We booked through Thomas Cook and were told nothing of this, this to be fair is not the Hotels fault but Thomas Cook's and have taken it up with them, we still had to pay the Hotel on departure though and claim the money back in the UK. We requested building 5, was told this was the newest building, not too high up as the hotel has 15 floors! and a view of the nightime fireworks....we were given the lot. Level 8 which was perfect and a great view of the fireworks at night, this was thanks to Daryl the General Manager of the hotel, thank you very much. Rooms were fabulous, spacious and clean. We had a three bedroom apartment and had TV's in each of the rooms together with a larger TV in the living/ dining/ kitchen area. Our appartment had Air-Con which worked well at night and wasn't noisey and our room had a Spa which I have to say is worthwhile using after the Theme Parks. Every room had a double bed which my kids thought were great and ample space to hang up clothes etc. There was no room service but to fair we only slept in our appartment, we were out from 0900 till 9pm. Pool was fun and fairly quiet, we used this around 3 times to chill out. Pool temp was a little cold but to you soon got used to it and the beach effect is great for small kids. There is one flume which is situated in the boat and fairly tame. Pool loungers were comfortable and they also offer pool towels, albeit a little small but useful, you just help yourself to as many as you need. Pool Bar was good, served lager, soft drinks, snacks etc and charged $4.70 for a Bud/ Bud light which was reasonable. The pool bar stayed open to around 10-11pm. Minor point to note here was that after 5pm the pool is shaded, which may suit some people if they have been by the pool all day, however if you have been at the parks all day and want to lie by the pool in the evening sun, forget it! Although the pool is open until 10pm so the kids can play all night. There is a small shop on site which is open untill 1am so fairly handy for bits and pieces, however v expensive - example milk, water and bread came to $19. If you have a car and I would suggest that you do have one if you are staying at this hotel, drive out of the hotel turn left and you have all the major supermarkets you need - Target etc, there is also a Wallgreens which is a chemist, out of the hotel, turn right which is handy for bits and bobs. To top this there are also outlet stores within walking distance - Nike/Timberland/ Gap to name a few which are open from 10am-9pm. Driving to all of the Disney Resorts takes no more than 20mins, this hotel is the perfect location - Magic Kingdom, Animal Kingdom, Typhoon Lagon - great place to go with the kids, they have a huge wave pool and every 2 mins send a 6ft wave which is great to ride on! Blizzard Beach is the other Water Park and is fab, this is better for younger kids as they have a Training area, up to 12yrs only, and has some great areas for the kids. The Hotel does provide free transport to the Theme Parks however we used our own car, be aware that Magic Kingdom, Animal Kingdom all charge $14 to park you car! If you are heading to Florida and need somewhere to stay near the Theme Parks this is the place to stay.....only 5 -8miles away from Disney Resorts!

Floor 7 The appartment was huge, and spotless Great facilities, including full kitchen, lots of cooking utensils, massive fridge with ice maker - Brilliant Cant understand why anyone would want to moan about the appartments, and I disagree with everything that has been said about them being dirty. Housekeeping is extra if you wanted to pay for it, but we managed fine as there is a large washer & dryer, hoover, iron etc. The bed sheets also fitted fine lol The convenience store, located near building 1 is handy for bread and milk, but prices are scary. Walmart is a short taxi ride away, as is publix. We just got everything there that we needed. Frankie Farrels, irish pub on site is also good for meals, and we ate there several times, and catered for ourselves in the appartment most evenings. There is also a pizza hut situated in the convenience store, and several leaflets for room delivery, Frankies also provide a room service, which was great The hotel taxis are a complete rip off and will charge you at least $10-$15 over and above the actual cost of the yellow metered cabs to take you to disney world etc eg. we were charged $28 to get to Hollywood Studios from the appartment, but took a yellow cab home at a cost of $13 The hotel offers free shuttles to and from Epcot (where you can pick up Disneys own shuttles around the rest of Walt Disney) Universal, Sea World Times can be a bit restrictive, but we managed ok. A car would definitely be ideal and recommended, as all major attractions are only around 10-20minutes away Blizzard Beach is highly recommended, especially with younger children Dont miss the Fantasmic Show at Hollywood Studios - definitely the best show - we made the mistake of queing for 2 hours, as we were told that it is very popular (which it is) but, you can quite easily get good seats in the ampitheatre just before the start of the show, as you will be able to see everything from wherever you are. The only downside of the parks for us was the extreme heat, it was very very hot & humid, with queues for the most popular rides taking up to 90 minutes in some cases in the extreme heat. So it is advisable to get there early to avoid the longer queues, as the parks were extemely busy The pool was a great feature to return to after a hot day in the parks, yes it is cold to initially get into, but once you`re in it is fab.

Stayed in the 3BR, and were placed in Building 2. I have no complaints about cleanliness - everything in our unit seemed clean, no mold or dust anywhere. The kitchen is well stocked with dishware, but a little lean on pots and pans. We're very glad we brought our own pans, since nothing was nonstick. There also was not a flat pan, which I brought my own for pancakes. Coffee maker worked well, and there was a set of bowls that came in handy for fruit and salad and for mixing ingredients. NO MEASURING UTENSILS or CUPS, so bring your own if you need them for anything. Note to all: Don't forget any food if you're bringing your own, because the \"convenience store\" on property is like $5 and up for EVERYTHING (items that would have been about $2 or less at Walmart). If you have time, run to Walmart just down the road. The whirlpool tub in the master bathroom was lovely. Ended up using it every night, and even gave 4 kids a bath in it. Master shower was spacious enough to add a couple kids, too. No blackout shades or even curtains in the bedrooms - just wood blinds. Worked better than most to block out the light, but if your kids need absolute dark, you will be disappointed. Bedrooms were roomy. We managed to squeeze 4 kids in the twin bedroom, including a floor air mattress and a pack n' play. I rarely heard other guests while in our unit. Sometimes heard some noises, but in general I was barely aware of our neighbors. Check-in took awhile. It was past 4 o'clock, and just ONE person behind the front desk with a mounting line of guests. I was 3rd in line and it took 20 minutes. Seems like they should have had more than one person helping for CHECK-IN! Also request more towels if you have a large group. I think we had 4 bath towels in our 3 BR unit. The proximity to Disney is awesome. My daughter actually said, and I quote, \"Wow! Our hotel is REALLY close to Disney!\" upon passing the gateways to the kingdom after only a few minutes in the car. By far my biggest complaint is the comfort of the beds. I noticed a lot of people complaining about the bedsheets not fitting, so we checked ours before sleeping and tucked them in nice and tight, and never had a problem during our stay. However, the PILLOWS are like bricks. I have heard people talk about hard pillows before, but honestly have never had truly hard pillows until now. I meant to take a picture of them, but forgot. If you press your hand into them, nothing moves. Your hand will not press into the pillow, it just stays there on top. Imagine sleeping on that. After a sleepless night I asked the front desk if they had any softer pillows, but the skeptical look on the clerk's face told me this was it. The 2nd night we all took the pillows from the couches, covered them with spare bedsheets, and slept much better. For the price, this is a really great place to stay, so long as you're prepared to bring a few extra items. Things that were there: paper towels, dish soap and sponge, dishwasher detergent, coffee, shampoo conditioner bar soap lotion, teapot, blender, can opener, saucepans, skillet, nesting set of plastic bowls, service for 8. BRING: Wipes to clean off surfaces, since there's no housekeeping during your stay Soft pillows, since I'm pretty certain the 3rd little pig used these for his house Extra cooking supplies and measuring cups if you plan to cook while there Clothespins or clips to attach blanket to windows if you need complete black in the bedroom Coffee filters (coffee provided, but no filters - we used paper towels and it seemed to work okay)", "Date": "May 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "East Setauket, New York", "Title": "\u201cExcellent alternative to staying at expensive Disney resorts!\u201d", "Author": "jntsuperstars", "ReviewID": "UR109342773", "Content": "My party consisted of 5 adults and 1 toddler. We stayed in a 3 bedroom, 3 bathroom (St. Lucia) suite in Building 2. The set-up of the suite was spacious and had a nice patio space on the balconey. The suite was relatively clean but I did wipe down the counters and tables before using them. There were definitely a lot of crumbs on the floor and under the appliances from prior guests and I believe that is why tiny little bugs were roaming around the kitchen (but once I bleached the counters they were gone). Two annoyances come to mind. One was that the mattress pads did not fit any of the beds and kept coming undone while you slept or laid in bed: this occured for both king beds and both twin beds so seemingly the resort is using the wrong sizes or they shrunk over the years of use. Annoying but not a deal-breaker for me. The other annoyance was that the blinds in the bedrooms were not room-darkening which would have helped naptime for our toddler. Our solution was to use an unused comforter to block the window which made a huge difference. Again, not a deal-breaker. We were on the 7th floor and it was quiet at night which we appreciated. We never had to wait long for an elevator or to check-in/out and parking was not an issue for us (we were usually back at the resort by 9pm). The pub is convenient and the food was decent. The pool was clean and has a pirate ship with a slide going through it but please note this is not meant for toddlers and young children. The lobby conveniently allows its guests to print out their flight boarding passes for free and guest services made good recommendations on restaurants and places to go. All the Disney parks are within 15 mins of the resort and the outlets are right next store (walking distance).

Don't know how you could install it wrong, moreover leave it wrong. All of the drawers in every room were difficult to open due to bent hinges.

We ended up not getting to any parks on those days in time. Plus the one day the park charged our free shuttle $14 because the bus went in ahead and after our driver argued with the lady, he finally paid and of course we all chipped in - what a joke! Not the drivers fault but still it was horrible. Would not stay at this hotel again just because of that, many others offer more reliable transportation from what I have heard! We spent well over $1000.00 on taxi's to get to the parks on time thanks to the shuttle service!", "Date": "May 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Frankfurt, Germany", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay, Perfect to see Disneyworld, SeaWorld, Universal.\u201d", "Author": "NicTravelsAround", "ReviewID": "UR107678831", "Content": "Good to stay for the attractions of Orlando.

As described in other reviews the apartments are big, well kitted out and ours was certainly very clean on arrival. The drive to the hotel from Orlando airport was very straight forward via the South Access Rd and the 417 (2 toll booths). Walt Disney World and SeaWorld parks are around 10 minutes easy drive and if you come out of the hotel and turn left onto the 535 within half a mile there is a Walmart on the right and a Publix supermarket on the left; so 10 out of 10 for convenience for us (we didn\u2019t visit Universal, however, looking at a map it looks like on the I4 (no tolls!) it\u2019s just a few miles past the SeaWorld exit. The hotel\u2019s free gym, while not flash, is certainly more than adequate with running, biking, cross-training and resistance machines. There is 24 hour access using your room key and complimentary sweat towels. Free wired room internet access generally worked well (I didn\u2019t try the Wi-Fi by the pool or in reception). On a couple of occasions I couldn\u2019t get on-line on my first attempt\u2013 I\u2019m guessing the router hit its maximum capacity. However, this didn\u2019t prove to be a problem as in both instances I was able to connect a few minutes latter and I never had a connection dropped. In reception there are a couple of pay to use PCs with a printer. What is a nice touch, however, is these PCs have been configured with free access to airline websites so you can check-in online and print boarding passes all for free. This certainly saved us some time at the airport on the way home where the Virgin check-in desks had a fair size queue but no wait at the bag drop (unlike Gatwick \u2013 but that\u2019s another story!). In summary we were very happy with stay at the hotel The only negatives I can think of are the on-site convenience store is expensive (but it is convenient) and the room have blinds rather than curtains/drapes so it\u2019s not easy black-out all the light.

But I guess no one had stayed in the room we received. We were put in Bldg. 1 and had the worst room I have ever seen for a 4 star hotel. The first thing we noticed was the thick layer of dust on the TV and the next the carpeting as I had tripped and was laying on the floor. The carpet was rolling all over and completely stretched out and stained. The tables are all marked up, the bed was hard and the sheets did not fit and the living room furniture was stained. The tub in the 2nd bath would not drain, we stopped at the front desk and it was fixed that day. The kitchen was ok, the ice maker worked great. But the stove was a disaster. It was hanging by an edge of the lip and was so slanted it was difficult to cook on and worried that the frying pan would slide off. The parking is also bad for building 1 there is not enough. If you have to park in the back, there is no entrance into the building. You have to walk all the way around to get in and I felt very unsafe doing that one night at 2am. It says that you have to have a card key to enter the building after 10:30pm, but that is a lie it is always open so no security. Did I mention the view, we had a lovely view of the roof of the shopping center. Did you want to sleep in? Forget it!! Every morning we were awaken by either garbage trucks emptying the dumpster or the best was the beer delivery truck at 7am banging empty kegs in the parking lot under our windows. Or it was the kitchen help washing mats or taking a break, smoking cigarettes so we couldn't enjoy our breakfast on the balcony. Whatever you do....don't go to the garbage room!!!!! It was so disgusting, it was like walking into a rotting dumpster, I needed to shower after that visit. On day one they said they were booked solid and could not change our room but we could check back the next day. Well we decided that we didn't want to go through the hassle of repacking everything and change rooms. As the week went on, I wish we had.

I am a hotel snob and this did not meet my standards for several reasons. First, we stayed in building 5, which is supposedly the new building and which has only been open for a year. However, the couch was old and sagging, the beds were hard and the pillows flat. My husband said he felt like he was falling off the bed. The bedspreads were thin and dated and were certainly only for decoration, but that left us with only a sheet and a thin blanket. The bathroom fans were obnoxiously loud (I didn't think that would bother me but it did) and this was a problem in the master because the bathroom opened into the bedroom. There were no room darkening shades at all and so we all woke bright and early with the sun beating in. On the positive side, it suited our needs. We were barely in the room, so I didn't really mind these small quirks. There was a washer dryer which was awesome for me and we cooked and ate breakfast every morning in the condo. The price was EXCELLENT for being this close to the parks (Disney AND SeaWorld) and during the very busiest season of the year. My 8 year old twin boys loved the pool with the slide off the pirate ship, wading entrance, and 3 hot tubs. I should have got the bartenders names, they were really terrific. We received a reminder call everyday that the poolside restaurant was open for breakfast (annoying) and we finally made it down there on the last day. It wasn't very good at all. We did like the restaurant Freddie Farrells (I think) which was on property. Ate there twice, both good meals with no waiting.

We went on a Disney vacation in April 2011 and in spite of some good Disney discount hotel deals we decided to stay here in stead mainly because of the extra rooms that would allow us extra comfort after the kids were sleeping + the other benefits an apartment has to offer (as a comparison the cost of this 2 bath 2 bedroom apartment + 7 day disney park tickets and rental car was about the same than the cost of just staying in the Caribbean Beach Resort for the same time). This 2 bedroom 2 bath apartment was excellent in each and every way. First of all everything looked new, fresh and clean. Very spacious with a full kitchen, washer, dryer, 3 TVs (the 42\" living room TV also supports external video input), a spacious terrace with tables/chairs, excellent and quiet central AC etc... everything in the apartment was there to enjoy a great vacation and everything was also very clean. Besides the room the hotel facilities were also great with the nice pirate ship pool and bar area, a small store, free indoor parking, a pizza hut and Irish pub on site etc... after our stay here we went on to a 4 star resort in Fort Lauderdale only to find out this was a lot more buck for a lot less... next time I pass through the region I will definitely stay here again. There were not many negatives that I can think off. Maybe the only suggestion for improvement would be to add extra darkened curtains in the bedrooms as these get very bright very early in the morning. I want to end with some feedback on other reviews here: we stayed in a room with a view of the Disney fireworks but this is not really worth asking for in my opinion as the hotel is too far away to really enjoy this (about 4-5 miles).

Check in was very smooth and we were in building 5 with an awesome view of the pool from our balcony. The unit itself was very large. We expected twin size beds in the girl's room, but were pleasantly surprised to see 2 full size beds.

This is our 3rd trip to Orlando, the first 2 times we stayed at a Disney property. The pros: There were several very appealing aspects of the LBV Resort. For one, the price. We had a 2 bed/2bath with a fully furnished kitchen and washer and dryer for under $150 per night. Compare this to about $300 per night for Disney's value resorts (which are like a Motel 6 with Mickey bedspreads). The location was great, about a 12 minute drive to WDW, many great restaurants within 10 minutes and a great outlet mall right next door. When staying at a Disney property we always drive to the parks as the Disney transportation system is time consuming and frustrating, so the drive time did not bother us. The complex was clean and well cared for. Though it was spring break and the resort was full, it never felt crowded. We never had to wait for an elevator, and our room was quiet. The pools were nice, although the \"adult\" pool is mostly shaded by 2:00 in the afternoon. The pirate pool was much more crowded, but the snack bar was convenient and the food was OK. The in-room washer and dryer were fabulous and allowed us to pack light for the trip. The cons: While the name suggests the property is a resort, I feel this is a stretch. I did not get the feeling that this was a resort. I would call it more of a condominium hotel. When I think of a resort, I think of great service and picturesque scenery, which was not the case here. The hotel is located on a swamp next to an outlet mall, hardly a \"resort-like\" setting. Yes, the property does have some resort-like amenities, but it really is not set up to feel like a resort. Another con was the service - if you want great service, don't stay here. It is not set up to be a service oriented facility. For example, the first night of our stay we returned from WDW after midnight and opened out the pullout bed, which was not made up. We searched for sheets and could not find them, so we called the desk and were told that we would have to come down to the office and get them. The property is very large - 4 buildings - so I was pretty frustrated by having to take a hike to the office after midnight. But, for $149.00 per night, I was not expecting the Hyatt. Speaking of the \"beds\" - ugh!!! The beds were terrible. The mattresses were rock-hard. The sheets were cheap, thin (nearly thread-bare), and did not stay on the beds. The first morning, 2 of my kids woke up on bare mattresses because the sheets were so small they would pop off. The same happened to the king bed that I was sleeping on. What could be worse than waking up on bare mattress at a hotel? We ended up getting some extra twin sheets (another hike to the office) and doing some nifty bed making to make sure the mattresses stayed covered. The pillows were hard foam in the shape of pancakes - not good. Also a con was the parking, the garage and lots tended to fill by 10 pm, so we would have to search for on-street parking if arriving back late/ This was not a big deal as we were with teens, but if you had to pack small children who are tired from a day at the parks, it would be problematic. Overall, I would say that if you are looking for a full service resort, this is not it. You are not going to get the Disney magic, but then again, you don't pay for the Disney magic. However, for us it worked out well. However, if you desire a spacious set-up at a great price, this would be a good fit. For us, the pros outweighed the cons, and I would return.", "Date": "March 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, TX", "Title": "\u201cspacious condos only a short drive from Disney - Bldg 5 (newer bulding)\u201d", "Author": "cmllana", "ReviewID": "UR101765608", "Content": "We stayed in a 2 bed 2 bath condo at LBV Resort Village and Spa during our Spring Break trip to Disney and loved it! We even tried to stay an extra night just to relax and hang out at the hotel pool but the hotel was booked solid. The entire condo was spacious and clean - everything worked fine. We stayed in Bldg 5 which is the newer building and I would recommend it. The condo has all of the comforts of home such as washer/dryer, kitchen, bathtubs etc. I would have liked to have some basic cleaning supplies such as windex or some sort of anti-bacterial spray to wipe the glass table with after we ate. The placemats did not do much to keep the table clean with a 3yr and 7yr old eating. I would also have liked a few extra pouches of detergent for the washing machine. Since we drive, I had bought my own detergent expecting this to happen. I also bought my own toilet paper and was very pleased. The tp provided is your typical cheap single ply toilet paper. We all enjoyed the balcony that overlooked the pirate ship pool. The interet was only available via cable that we got from the front desk but that was not a huge concern for us since we were there for a vacation and not work. The pool was great for my 7 year old but too cold for us parents and the 3 year old. The pool towels are smaller and thinner than your average bath towel. I had read this in a previous review so we bought our beach towels from home. My hubby and I enjoyed the pool bar. We did not interact with the front desk staff beyond check in/out but when we did they seemed very nice and helpful. We never witnessed anyone having a problem during the 2 times we were in the lobby. The shuttle service is so limited that it is practically useless. We has hoped to use it to avoid paying for parking and dealing with the parking lot traffic. It took us about 10-15 minutes to drive to the parking lots of each Disney park. I am not sure how LBV Resort Village and Spa determined they were 2 miles away. My odometer said it was more like 8 miles from the hotel parking lot to the parking lot of each Dinsey park.

We even had a washing machine and dryer which meant that we didn't need to go back with smelly clothes in our case. The complex was good, it had an Irish themed pub on sight - food was okay at it. There was also a store which as you would expect was pricey - a huge Walmart is 2 minutes drive away, so bear this in mind. The store though did have its own Pizza Hut takeaway - so comfort food was right on your doorstep. The outdoor swimming pool wasn't the biggest or the brashest but it kept me and the kids happy. The complex also had a spa which my wife visited and she raved about it - so it must have been good. There was a teen area with some pool tables and arcade games, so really the complex had something for everyone. A great bonus of this complex is that you also have a discounted brand shopping outlet as part of the complex - we certainly spent a few dollars there. Negatives were that you really need a car when staying here as it is not served by public transport well which I think is a general problem in most resort areas in Orlando.

We were provided with four room keys for our party and a bunch of coupons for the outlet mall next door. Two of the key cards did not work.

There is some parking in front of the entrance of the building available but most of the times we had to parallel park in the street which was also okay.

Furnishings was exactly as it looked on the pictures in the internet including the old-fashioned (non flat screen) TV in living room. There also TV sets in all bedrooms. Bathrooms were okay. The bath rooms in master bedrooms had jacuzzi tubs which was very nice. There were three sets of towles in the master bathrooms which are not replaced for free during your stay. Towel exchange is $5 and full clean for our three bedrooms suite was $40. We did not have our suite cleaned during our stay so I cannot comment on this service. There is a washer/dryer combo in the suites but the dryer is no good. We were better off airdrying our towles on the balcony.

Some basic items (toilet rolls, kitchen roll, dishwasher powder etc) were provided but we needed to stock up on some of these items during the stay. The facilities allowed us to fully self cater during our stay - highly recommended especially if you have small children - finding healthy food in American eateries is a challenge. A Publix supermarket is only 5 mins drive away and is far better than the closer Walmart. Disney parks and other attractions are only a 10 - 15 minute drive away and the resort is right next to a fairly decent outlet area (although there are better outlets within a short drive - Orlando Premium Outlets for example). Minor gripes - I don't think the swimming area is heated as is advertised - maybe by the sun but the water temperature was very cool. As a result, we didn't spend as much time by the pool as we would have liked. Also the pirate ship is just a slide and not suitable for young children. Own food/drinks are not allowed by the pool which doesn't sit well with the self-catering facilities. Also, there isn't much in the way of service - concierge was not well up on the local area and there was always a long queue at the Expedia service desk. Advertised as buy tickets here to avoid queues but I think you'd be better off buying the tickest at the parks - certainly in off peak season.

We chose the hotel based on the location, advertisement of a complimentary shuttle to Disney and Universal, and the spacious rooms, that were apartment style living. We checked into the hotel and the guy at the front desk congratulated us on our marriage and gave us a room with the view of the Disney fireworks so we were off to a good start. Unfortuantely, this was the end of our excitement with this hotel. The rooms were spacious with the comforts of home, like a fridge, stove, etc. We brought lots of food with us knowing we could save some money by cooking in our room. We unpacked everywhere and had dinner reservations at a Disney restaurant and so called the front desk to arrange to get on the \"complimentary shuttle''. We were quickly told that the shuttle only leaves for Disney at 8:55 am and 11:30 am and ONLY to Epcot, none of the other parks. So obviously we had missed those since check in wasn't until 3pm. We then asked if we could take the shuttle back from Disney to at least save half of a cab fare, and they said no, they needed 24 hour notice to pick us up. So we called the shuttle service ourselves and they said they could accomodate us for sure and to tell the hotel to give us vouchers. We argued with the hotel for hours and they would not help us and so my husband called the shuttle service and the manager agreed to let us ride even though the hotel refused to help us. We spent $30 on a cab to get there, though, and thought it was very odd to advertise a shuttle service with such meager hours. (Note pick up was either 6:20 or 10:20, neither convenient times. So we get back to the room after the dinner and are exhausted and are woken up periodically throughout the night from people screaming above us. We took the shuttle the next morning, but had to pay another $30 to get back since we didn't want to be at the park from 8:55 to 6:20. When we got back we heard the screaming again and could hear a woman getting abused by her husband and we heard the kids in the room screaming so we called security at the front desk who did nothing. We witnessed the abuse for several more minutes before telling the hotel we just were going to check out as the last thing we wanted on our honeymoon was to be stressed and sleep deprived.

(the st lucia) The first unit they gave me had quite a few problems and was unexceptable. They quickly put me in a second unit that was near perfect. As for comfort, it was very comfortable and very clean. the space was perfect having 3 teenagers with us and our oldest child stayed in the 2nd master bedroom with her husband and our 2 yr old grandson. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook a wonderful meal. (wish they had more roasting pans) and the utensils needed changing due to burned tips. however, the resort itself was great! I recommend this place to anyone with children or teenagers, nice game room, gym and frankies restaurant has great food!!!! I had the fish and chips the first night and she ordered the sampler. the kids ordered pizza from pizza hut they are located on site. I have already booked my next weekend for April. This resort is also very close to the attractions, Disney is 10 minutes away and downtown disney only 5 minutes away. shopping is also right next to the resort. this place had everything we needed. they also have a nice computer room in the main building. the lobby also has a nice fireplace and a great place to relax and read.

Travelling to Florida as a party of 8, with 3 Disabled wheelchair using Teenagers could have been a nightmare. 2 years ago we did the same trip, with the same kids, but stayed in the Quality Inn Plaza on I-Drive, which was very basic, almost like a Motel. This year, we went upmarket to LBV Resort Village & Spa. RECEPTION We arrived on Saturday tea-time after a full days travelling and were given two Wheelchair Accessible rooms, in Building 5, as requested! ROOMS WOW!!! What can I say? The apartment (3 bed) on the 3rd Floor (5301) was simply stunning. Plenty of room to move about (very important when you've got a Teenager in a Power Wheelchair!) and the Kitchen..well it hadn't been used! Seemed totally brand new. The Roll-in shower was huge, plenty of space in the bedrooms and the Jacuzzi bath in the Master Bedroom was massive. A nice balcony would have been improved by not having a 3\" lip on the door (Disabled Access??!) but this is a very minor point. Huge TV in the Living Area and one in each bedroom..just Top-Notch. The washing machine and drier were a GODSEND, so much so, we didn't need Room Service at all! EATING OUT Right..Frankie Farrells Irish Pub, on the site across the road literally one minute away, was superb. A great selection of beers, cracking food reasonably priced and nice staff too. Problem is, that was it! There are no other Restaurants withing walking distance. There IS a \"Food Court\" at the excellent LBV Factory Outlets shopping centre (which is right next door and excellent!) but this is more like a collection of take-aways with a few seats in the middle..and none of the big guns (MacD's/BK/Taco Bell/KFC) are here. We found Frankies great..but it needs some competition! There is a Pizza Hut take-away in the Mini-Supermarket too, which was nice once or twice. SURROUNDING AREA For me, LBV was a bit isolated. Apart from Frankies and the Outlet, there was nothing else within walking distance. The huge Walmart was in fact only 5 minutes walk away, but there was no road crossing over a very busy highway. You COULD get across at quiet times, but it's probably safer to get a cab, get stocked up, and live to tell the tale. It was only 3 dollars cab ride! SHUTTLES There was bound to be a negative, and here it comes. We booked this holiday through Co-Operative Travel, and obviously when planning a trip with 3 kids in Wheelchairs, the transport has GOT to be right. Two of our party can't transfer at all, they are stuck in their chairs. The transport from Orlando Airport was spot-on. Two vast wheelchair mini-bus cabs, top-notch. Sadly when we went to book the first day's shuttle to Universal, we were told that no accessible transport was available! Endof, a flat great-big no. Sadly no Manager was around but the next morning the situation was QUICKLY reversed. The hotel would pay for 2 taxis every day (as long as they were at the shuttle times) which was great. Luckily the first taxi that arrived was City Cabs number 653, driven by Brian, from Mitcham in Surrey!! Thanks to Brians promptness, reliability and patience we managed with him and one or two others to get around really well. There WAS one glitch mid-holiday when the Petty Cash ran out so they couldn't pay Brian but again, that was sorted the next day. THE POOL Magic!!! Really well heated, good bar/snacks and a lovely way to relax. Brilliant for kids (the Pirate Slide! Wow!) and a real asset to LBV. T'INTERWEB THINGY Patchy! No wireless in the rooms and patchy in the lobby..kids I-pod touches worked but my lappy struggled.

I don't consider myself to be a picky traveler and I consider the hotel, just a place to stay when you are not out having fun. I tried to ignore the short falls of the hotel but in the end there were just way too many!! We arrived late at night on Feb. 20th. They put us in a corner room in building five and everything seemed great. As we start unpacking (11:30 pm) we notice that we are in a 3 bedroom 2 bath instead of a 3 bedroom, 3 bath. We called downstairs to find out what was going on and then found out that they had no 3 bedroom 3 baths open, and that we would have to wait until the next day after checkout (9am - 11am) to move. I couldn't believe they wouldn't have told us that at the desk when we checked in???!!!! They just put us in the wrong room and acted like nothing was wrong. So the next morning we had to then repack everything and delay our kids from going to Disney. We hung out in the lobby for an hour waiting for word on our room. Finally at 11 they told us to go to Disney and that they would move our belongings to our new room and everything would be ready when we came back. Lie #2 Nothing had been done when we returned back to the hotel. We had to move all of our things to tower one, a dirty room overlooking the parking lot of the Factory outlet. Lie #3 They then told us how sorry they were and that they would comp our room the first night. (Read Below - this was another lie) Lie#3 My husband was in Orlando on business and had to have the internet. He called the hotel ahead of time to make sure they had wifi. Needless to say, we were never able to get any internet connection in our room. He went out and purchased a cable and we were still never able to get any access. The hotel then lied again to say usually they do have access but it was down. When we finally moved into our room in tower one at 9:30 pm my young kids were worn out and ready for bed. We went to make up the couch bed only to find the sheets were the wrong size. We called to get sheets and they told us they would be right up(Lie #4). 35 minutes later still no sheets. I had to get dressed and go down to the lobby to get them to send sheets up to our room. We wore flip flops in our room because it was so dirty. We stopped using the kitchen because there were small spider looking bugs everywhere. We didn't notice them at first, but they got into our cereal boxes. So we threw everything away and ate at Dunkin Donuts for breakfast and the Irish pub for dinner. The burger there was delicious! We spent no time out on our balcony because it overlooked a parking lot - very disappointing. The kids did enjoy getting in the tubs in the bathroom every night and relaxing after a long day in the parks. My kids complained a few times that they had bites behind their knees and underarms. I ignored it thinking maybe mosquitoes. After reading reviews since I returned from my trip I see many people have complained about bed bugs. I am wincing in disgust hoping that I did not bring any home with me. If I did there will be a major PROBLEM! The swimming pool was great. The kids loved the slide and the hot tubs were very relaxing. The life guard had to leave the slide closed several times to constantly get more towels, that was kind a bummer for my boys. Also, plan well, because as the sun goes down the pool is shaded and cold. They told us they were not going to charge us for the first night. At checkout they then told my husband they were not going to charge us for two nights because of the problems with the room and internet. Upon getting our bill we noticed that they only discounted our bill for the resort fee for two nights - that's 20 dollars. Careful with the taxi drivers at the hotel they wanted to charge us 30 dollars to bring us to the parks and 65 to the airport. Sadly we paid that not knowing we could get it a lot cheaper. Shame on them for taking advantage and shame on the hotel for letting them. We rented a van so my husband could get back and forth to his class. Parking was very limited and sometimes you just had to park on the road or park far away from your tower. In conclusion ( after reading reviews about this hotel for the last year) it seems like the hotel is going downhill rapidly!!! There may still be some good rooms left in the newer towers. If you are staying here you may want to contact those people who wrote good reviews and ask what their room number was. I was in building one on the 7th floor - I would stay away from this whole tower! Good Luck If my bill is not resolved I am considering reporting this hotel to the better business bureau. I am definitely following up on the bed bug investigation someone mentioned in their post.", "Date": "February 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Port Saint Lucie, Florida", "Title": "\u201cThis is our vacation home away from home.\u201d", "Author": "humfrey5000", "ReviewID": "UR98396841", "Content": "I love this resort.

Had room # 31302. We had booked our reservation online about 2 months in advance and paid the lower internet rate. Booked a room in building 5 that would give us a view of the Disney fireworks. Upon arrival, the employee attempted to give us a rom in building 5, but only on the 5th floor. I told him that that would not be high enough to see the fireworks. He responded with, \"Oh, I am sorry sir, you need to have a reservation to enjoy one of those rooms.\" From there I gave him my confirmation letter clearly stating that I had one of these rooms. From there, he spent about 10 minutes punching away at his computer. From there, he informed me that someone had overridden my reservation, and there were no 2 bed/2 bath rooms available with the fireworks view. Not a good way to start the vacation! I told him that we had a problem. I told him to bump whomever was in my room. From there, he spent another 10 minutes or so upgrading our reservation. We ended up in a 3 bed / 2 bath room. While we could not see the Disney fireworks, we could see the EPCOT version. The room was nice. 2 of the 3 bedrooms had King sized beds. The 3rd bedroom and 2 twins. Kitchen was nice. Sure, not a ton of utensils, but certainly plenty to get by. Master bedroom was nice, as was the bathroom. Washer/Dryer were very handy. Also, being on the 13th floor provided some very nice views of the Disney grounds, specifically, Downtown Disney. If I had 1 major complaint about the room, it was the carpet. At first glance, everything appeared clean. However, after walking around the room for about 10 minutes, our white sox were completely black on the bottom. That was a tad disturbing, but we lived with it. Just wore shoes/sandals in the room. 1 minor complaint had to do with the master bed. While it was King, it was very old. Very uncomfortable bed, but with pillows, I got around it. The Pirate Pool was very cool. We hung out there for 3 of our 7 days. Very clean, very safe. The pool lounge was a popular spot as well. Enjoyed many of the drinks there, and we had lunch there 2x. Each experience was great. The convenience store was exceptional. This place really had everything. Only problem I had was that the employees working there did not speak the language well. Had trouble when I had to ask questions. Also, whenever I was in the back of the store, I felt as if they were watching me like I was a thief. My son dragged me to the game room daily. Good enough for what is needed. Games are a bit old, but they work fine. The irish pub was very nice. I was pleasantly surprised there. We ate there 2x, and both times the food was great. Good enough beer selection. Kind of a Hard Rock atmosphere, as they have Rock pictures on the wall- most of which are for sale. We went to Disney on Wednesday, so that morning I went to the concierge to purchase tickets. The employee was very quick to try and sell me some other package deals (Arabian Knights and some sort of pirate themed event). I will give the employee credit- she would not give up in trying to sell me. Problem is, I did not want to be sold. I just wanted tickets to Disney. After about 3-4 minutes of haggling, I could sell that she was mad. She closed with, \"Sir, I can sell you Disney tickets, but you are actually going to pay more here.\" To be honest, this really pissed me off. The outlet mall next door was nice. We spent 1 afternoon there and actually found some pretty good deals. All in all, we would probably stay here again. With a nightly room rate of $160, I felt the value was there.

I do have to admit from reading all negative reviews I was trying to change hotels days before arrival but decided to stay with this one. The pros of this hotel is that the staff were very nice. Especially Bill who did the activites with the children, the concierge (male - did not get name) and also Matt at the front desk. The restaurant was nice and handy and the bartender (with glasses) was great and always smiling. It was great to have all of the space in the condo. The Cons of this hotel is the cleanliness. Not so much the bathrooms etc but the carpets were badly stained so much that we wore our flip flops around the condo even at night and I had my 3 year old wear her socks the whole time in condo. The furniture in the sitting area was also badly stained. So first impression was not great and when initially walked into condo wanted to walk back out. Also word of advice if you do not have a rental car and need to cab it do not take the cabs at the hotel. They will rip you off. The first three days we took them and just paid what they said and then returned to locations towards the end of the week with metered cabs and were charged less than half. So they were charging us double. So lesson learned is to always take a metered cab (Yellow cab was great) and DO NOT take the ones outside hotel. The staff being so friendly made up for the CONS but we would not stay here again due to the cleanliness.", "Date": "February 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Delray Beach, Florida", "Title": "\u201cAffordable, convenient, well appointed.\u201d", "Author": "travelgirluk2010", "ReviewID": "UR97807435", "Content": "This was our second stay at this property for a high school gal friend reunion.

The room was very clean and the staff very friendly. I would have given five stars except for one thing... We ordered drinks at the pool bar, the bartender automatically adds in a 15% tip but does not tell you. My husband paid by cash the first time so we did not notice, we just thought the rum-runners were over-priced and they did not even come with a floater. He left a cash tip. The second time we paid by credit card. We were presented with a check (by a different bartender) with a space for a tip. When we got home I went through the receipts, that's when I noticed the tip had already been added on and so with our additional tips both bartenders made about 30% off us. We were so upset we called the resort. We were told the pool bar is owned by a different company. Tipping is an option and I don't even think the bartender deserved the 15% he added on since it was almost $3.00 for making two drinks. And then we unknowingly tipped more. We told him we were from South Carolina and used to live in Florida so he knew we know how to tip. This upsets me because I used to work in a hotel and I'm pretty sure it is illegal, It's stealing. Other than that we loved the resort and will definitely come back. PS- the Irish Pub does not add on a tip but beware there are no prices for beer and a draft beer will run you $4.95.

It exceeded all our expectations. Tjhe condo's are very spacious and absoluely spotlessly clean. we stayed in a 2 bedroom condo on the 8th floor in block five with a view of the pirate pool. The kitchen was fantastic, our only complaint was the lack of utensils to cook food in the oven. We bought foil disposable bakeware from ther local Walmart. Saves on washing up although there was a full size dishwaher installed that we made good use of. The fridge was huge and had a very spacious freezer compartment. It took a while to navigate the cooker controls for the oven but we managed to cook a variety of meals. Food has increased in price since our last visit to Florida in march 2010 but the local Golden Corral has not increased their prices so was still a good option for breakfast and lunch. $7.99 pays for the breakfast buffet which is very extensive and would cater for everyones taste. if you arrive just before 11 am you still pay the breakfast price but also have access to the lunch menu. A great place to eat for a special event was the rainForest cafe. There is one at the animal kingdom and one in Downtown Disney. Great food and amazing decor. The kids will love it., it even has its own tropical storm every half an hour. Average cost is about $25 - 30 dollars a person but is well worth it. During our stay at the lake Buena vist resort village we twice booked the full clean service for $30 dollars, this was definately worth the money and the cleaning standard was superb. This service includes a change of sheets and towels, all the kitchen equipment washed and put away and a general clean, hoover dust and polish.. We found reception very helpful and polite. I have read some reviews that state the reception service was not very good but this was not our experience. Both the pools were heated. The whirlpools were a little too hot for my taste but none the less were very popular til late into the evening. You are not allowed to take your own food and drink into the pool area. There is a bar there but prices are pretty high. There is both indoor and outdoor parking. we never had a problem finding a space although it does get very busy at weekends when all the locals flock to Orlando. There is a outlet centre right next to the resort village but we found the Premium outlet village about half a mile away much better. The disney store there sells disney items at a really good reduced price. Much cheaper than the parks. The only negative thing we can say is that the advertised wirefree internet was mainly non existant. Reception gave us a wire so that we could connect to the internet that way but it was not really very sucessful. We had to go down to the reception area and use the wifi there or use the hotels computers which cost about $8.00 dollars an hour. This is just a small moan but we would still give this accomodation full marks. cannot praise it enough. In all we had a fab holiday and would definately recommend The lake Buena vista Resort village to anyone that wanted luxury accommodation - the bathroom was fab-. we were only a short Drive from the parks and when we return to Orlando in 2012 we will definately be booking this accomodation again.

I suggest they put an extra jack close to the table so guests can use it as a desk Overall experience was great", "Date": "January 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay!\u201d", "Author": "travelwithfamily8", "ReviewID": "UR93977390", "Content": "Great hotel, great location and great resort amenities.

Our room was a three bedroom apartment. Rooms were large with plenty of space. Had a couple of issues with air conditioning, TVs and cleanliness. Some of our concerns were dealt with eventually and after reminders but not all issues. We gave up on some which was disappointing, especially as we were in low season and there was virtually nobody else staying in the block we were in. Check in/Check Out (or just an enquiry) should be planned carefully as the peak times provide a significant dent into your day. The staff were pleasant to deal with just a bit under the pump at times. Kitchen was functional but would greatly benefit from some additional basic kitchen equipment. It would be a challenge if you were planning on feeding the family each day using the facilities available in the kitchen. (In reality, you probably won\u2019t try to do this given the amount of food available within a short drive. There is a faux Irish pub opposite which serves a good selection of drinks but the food is faux Irish pub - don\u2019t expect much (and check the bill). Go to \u201cSweet Tomatoes\u201d for healthy food. Do NOT go to Johnnie\u2019s Hideaway for Dinner.) Swimming Pool area has a bar and in the pool is a pirate ship with a slide which the kids enjoyed. The pool is properly heated so swimming was possible despite the lower than usual temperatures. Don\u2019t be fooled by \u201cthe join us for breakfast at the pool\u201d invites - it is not what most on holiday would call breakfast - very limited basic selection available but better than nothing and the guy there was happy to have a chat. The surrounding area is either a shopping factory outlet complex right next door (but we\u2019re not shoppers so no idea on price or quality - sorry), some wasteland (when we made enough money from these condo\u2019s we\u2019ll build on the next block?) and the main road, so you are not staying here for the views or general ambience. Overall, the main positives here are the location in relation to Disney (in a car) and the price. It was very cheap for the size and overall facilities. So, if you get a good deal and if you are doing the theme parks and do not need to (or more likely will not have enough energy) wander along International Drive then I would happily stay here again.

Even though we had planned the trip since February, there's still the uncertainty about whether or not the correct research was done to find the best place to stay. We were not disappointed. Our trip was specifically focused around Disney, so we liked the hotel's proximity to the parks. 5-10 minutes in the car, and you're where you want to be. Walmart is about 1/2 a mile away, and another grocery store is a few miles past that. That's good because the convenience store in the hotel, while very well stocked, is pricey. The location had one drawback, though. The area around the hotel did not have a lot of offerings for eating out. We went out to dinner a couple of times and had a hard time finding a place. We ended up finding another major road, which had more variety. The room was very spacious, and fit our needs well. We liked the kitchen and the washer/dryer. The hotel in general was very quiet. The sofa in the room was pretty worn, and the beds were not comfortable at all. While we didn't spend much time in the room, it would have been nice to get better sleep when we were there. One other thing that bothered me was the internet in the room. While every room has internet access, an ethernet cable, which the hotel will provide for free, is required. However, I went to the office each of three successive mornings to ask about availability of the cables, and was told that they didn't have any, but I should check back after checkout around 11:00 AM. I planned to be enjoying my vacation at 11:00 AM not sitting around the hotel waiting for an ethernet cable. I finally just went to Walmart and bought one there. Once I was able to hook up, access was quick and readily available. We didn't use the pool since the weather was a little cool for us. However, the pool must be heated because other people were using it. It looks like fun, so if we go back when it's warmer we will try to check it out. All in all, this hotel was very nice. We got a great rate on a very spacious room that had a lot of nice features. The parking garage at the bottom of the building we stayed in was convenient, and we were usually able to find a spot. The spots are kind of narrow, though, since they have to fit them in between the buidling's support columns. The best bet is parking in one of the middle spots.

The shops make half of the hotel grounds look nice enough, but the other half (buildings 3,4,5) have grounds that are pretty abandoned, like a vacant lot or something. The location of the hotel was not ideal. Not that it was far away, but there are so many other hotels for the same price that are much closer to all the parks. We had a rental car and used it the entire time. So, long story short. The hotel didn't blow us away.

The pool with the pirate ship was great, it is heated, however not much so, we did go swimming at 9:00 at night and it was about 65 degrees and it was comfortable in the pool. I will say that thought the waterslide in the pirate ship is cool, it is pitch black in there and scary at first, be prepared for this. You must be 50\" tall to ride by yourself, otherwise an adult can go down with a child, the landing area in the pool for the slide is 4 feet deep, so small children would not be able to touch the bottom. Some things that I did not like were the hard pillows and the thin walls. When you take a trip to disney it is extremely exhausting, alot of walking and alot to see so you need to have a good place to sleep and recharge your system, I found this place a little lacking in this department.

The resort is approximately 5-15 minutes away from everything (Seaworld, Universal Studios & Disney) which made for a quick drive home each evening.

The restaurant onsite is ok, not great, and was overpriced. I wouldn't eat there again. Staff was professional and friendly at all times. It was very clean. The beds were comfortable. We never heard a single sound from anyone in our building (2). There was not enough parking for our building though and sometimes found ourselves parking on the other side of the building and having to walk a ways. I called a few weeks before arrival and requested a ground floor room being that we have small children and they run around. I didn't want to keep yelling at them to not run(yeah right) LOL so I thought let them do it where there isn't anyone below us! So luckily my request was granted. 1 major problem being on the ground floor in Building 2.......there is a smaller rectangular window right above the regular window. The regular window has blinds. The small window does have a curtain but it does not go all the way to the sill and it has an awning outside but both of these things only partially cover the view. Notice I said partially covers(the site is not accepting my photo, something about it being too big, or I would show you) My husband and I were shocked while undressing the first night and getting into the awesome jetted tub when we realized that we could see a couple of the upper floors of the building across the way and if we could see them they could see into our room!!!!! We took about 20 minutes to strategically place some of our towels up in the window sill filling the extra space and preventing anybody seeing in. I can't believe that no one else has complained about this. We did not bring this up with management because they obviously have to know about it, it's their hotel and design, they should be aware there is this issue, right??? It could simply be fixed with a longer curtain. The ground floor is the only one with this smaller rectangular window so none of the other floors are affected.

Perhaps it's official rating is harsh, but I wouldn't rate it a 4 1/2 star either. There are some pro's and con's with the hotel: Pros Proximity to Disney - short drive to enter Disney grounds. FYI easiest way out of the parks is to follow the Epcot and then route 536 exit. Shopping - Walmart is a few minutes away and literally within walking distance of outlets Room Size - we had a 3br (King/King or Queen/2twin) /2bath. Overall good size although the layout of the 2nd bedroom with the Queen or King was a tad small and awkwardly laid out. Although a corner unit, there is only 1 window in each bedroom so natural light is limited. Room also had a good size balcony with a plastic table and 4 chairs. Pool - Great zero entry pool for kids including a pirate ship with a slide. Cons - Kitchen Size - Great for 1 person cooking. But the galley shape kitchen does not bode well if trying to have more than 1 in that kitchen corridor. Kitchen Inclusions - the Kitchen does come with dishes, utensils, etc. However considering that this was a 3br unit and obviously meant to hold more than 2 people, upon arrival we had only a 5\" pot to boil water. Definitely not big enough for a family of 6 to cook pasta. Also they didn't have any spatulas. We called the front desk to advise them of both items and they did bring up a huge pot, but only a spoon style spatula. Luckily I was only making scrambled eggs, but this wouldn't have worked with pancakes. Pool Towels - If you're planning on using the pool or visiting the water parks, you may want to bring along your own towel. The hotel does supply towels, and they are plentiful, but they are only 2' wide x3' long in size. Great for toddlers, but not for adults or older kids. Housekeeping - Part of the lower cost is that you do not get housekeeping included in the basic hotel rate. Althought I can understand not getting the beds made, I would have expected at least to have fresh towels daily as well as my garbage emptied. This is left up to the guests. So we did a load of towels in the laundry almost daily and the kids bring the garbage to the drop location at the end of each hallway. Garbage drops - As mentioned above, they are at the end of the hallways. Well, conveniently enough so are most (if not all) of the 3 br units. So we constantly heard the door opening up and people going in and dropping their garbage down the chute. Solicitations - Although you do need a key to access the buildings, each night we would have 2-3 local businesses push menus thru the door. Spa Hours - My sister in law wanted to get a massage or pedicure, but the spa closed at 6pm each night. Knowing that people are typically out all day long you'd think they'd keep the spa at least open to 8pm. Internet - This hotel didn't offer wifi service. I originally was thinking of giving this hotel a 4-star rating, but being that the cons tended to outweigh the pros, I knocked it down to a 3-star. Some of the items under cons are what you would expect with a 4-star resort. So I feel it's necessary to remember that this is a condo style hotel, not a resort complex.

I wanted to share my experience before I left so I could remember everything. The issue that I had read that other people reviewing this hotel had was that we couldn't find it from the airport. The address that the hotel has on their website about the GPS location we couldn't find it on our GPS or on google maps so we got a little bit lost. Eventually we did find it. The service at the front desk was very good, I forgot the girl's name that checked us in but she was very kind. She went over the hotel (we stayed on the 7th floor of building 2) layout, gave us a bunch of coupons for the outlet mall, and let us know about the maid service and the shuttle to Disney. I do wish that the hotel had bigger signs for the building numbers because we got here when it was dark and had a hard time finding everything, they signs are pretty low to the ground and kind of blend in with the surroundings. The inside of the hotel is nice and secure (you need your room key to get into each building was a very nice feature). Our room looks exactly the way that it does on the website (we are in the Antigua two bedroom/bath). The suite needs a little bit of updating, the TV is pretty old (but who cares we are in DISNEY), the carpet is a little worn and on our balcony we had a bunch of bees nests. We are facing the outlet mall and not Disney, I was going to ask to be moved so we could see the fireworks but didn't which was good because Disney wasn't open long enough for fireworks and teh one day that they had them we were there. The parking was a little bit hard at night but we always found a spot. We didn't use the shuttle but we always say it running to the park. I also read that you could walk to Wal Mart, it is close but I woudln't walk it is on a really busy street. They gave us everything, pots/pans, dishes, cookware, etc even detergent for the dishes. I read that people got detergent for the washing machine, but we didn't. It wasn't a big deal we went to Wal Mart and got a small bottle for $4. We didn't use the maid service but there are a few packages that you can get, you need to call the front desk and make a reservation the day before. The prices weren't that bad, I think the cheapest was just new towels and it was $5.

It is a great balance between the privacy of one's own home and the luxuries of a hotel. We did not hire the daily cleaning service, so were left undisturbed while \"at home\", but appreciated having a front desk and concierge who were professional and sincerely friendly. We rented our 3-bedroom condo through its owner - see: www.vrbo.com listing number 224137 or the owner's website: www.krbdisneycondo.com It is clean, and very spacious. There was plenty of space in the master suite for a pack 'n' play. (The hotel had the pack 'n' play and a highchair ready for us in the condo upon request.) Suitcases disappeared into the large walk in closet. The beds were comfortable. The upright chairs in the living room, which look a little stiff in the photos, are padded and cozy. The kitchen is well-equipped, and the laundry was a great benefit. Tip: The hotel provided starter samples of dish and laundry detergent, soap, shampoo and hand cream. If you want to avoid buying large containers from a grocery store, and you have room in your luggage, bring your own detergent for sink, dishwasher and laundry; bring coffee filters, salt and pepper, sugar, etc. This condo, in particular, has a view of a lush Florida forest which displays enchanting layers of mist in the early morning as the sun rises over it. We didn't hear any of our neighbours through the walls, nor were we disturbed by any sounds from outside. The pool is perfect for all ages. The little ones who can't swim benefitted from the shallow entry, and the oldest one couldn't keep off the waterslide. The location is perfect for tourists of Disney, Universal and Sea World which are minutes away. There is a fantastic Marian shrine with a phenomenal choir just up the road next to the Prime Outlet Mall which has a greater variety of stores than the mall by the hotel. In addition to Walmart, there is a Publix close by for groceries. We had done a lot of browsing for accomodations in the area, and it was interesting to see many of the properties we had become familiar with on-line as we drove around the area. But nothing appealed to us more than this resort. Usually, despite the fact that I am pleased with an hotel, I prefer to try something else when next time in the area just to have a new experience. However, I would stick with this resort. Going back here would be like coming home.

The downside of this hotel was you didn't get any maid service changing your bedding, towelling or room cleaned, this was an optional extra which you had to pay for however, their was a hoover to clean the carpets along with an ironing board and iron.

As we were 4 adults we felt it was important to have plenty of space to chill and relax at the end of the day and we were not dissapointed. We had a 3 bedroom appartment and were extremely happy with the size and cleanliness of it .We were in block 5 on the 10th floor and had a great view of the fireworks on the odd occasion when we were in around 9.30 - 10pm. We used Frankie Farrells Bar on several occasions,it was handy to call in after a hectic day for a cold beer or a bite to eat (huge portions so starters were often enough!) As you would expect it was a bit pricey being the only bar/restaurant within the complex but it was convienient.The on site store was also expensive but again convienient to get a few essentials when we first arrived or ran short of something.Wallmart is just 5 minutes drive for everything else you could need.The'Pirate' pool was mainly used by familys with younger children as would be expected, we found the smaller pool between blocks 1 & 2 better for us (quieter) but did try the main pool a couple of times early in the day and was able to have a swim & read the paper before it got busy. If anything could be improved I would say a larger freeform swimming pool would be a great additon to the complex.We did have a car for our stay and really don't hink we could have done without it, we visited all the Disney Parks, Universal Studios, I.O.A, Seaworld , Busch Gardens and did an Airboat tour,plus went out most evenings either to Downtown Disney or City Walk, none of these were too far with a car,I doubt we could have done so much using the transportion system. However one night we got a taxi to Downtown Disney costing around 15 dollars,and had no problem getting one back later. The staff in the reception were always pleasant and helpful, but if you take travellers cheques they only have limited cash to exchange them, you can just use the cheques as cash in the shops but need to have ID with you. (By the way there was safe in the master bedroom free of charge & great for keeping all your vauables safe) The outlet shops right next door were handy to do some shopping, and there was a nice coffee and cake shop, but our son & his friend preferred the main outlet stores on International drive.Like most other reviewers I really can't fault this place for it's location and for the size and comfort of the appartment inparticular.We booked through Virgin Holidays and got a few extras like a daily paper,some discount vouchers and a free takeaway Pizza, which was fine, but we do have a major gripe with Virgin Holidays who changed our return flight home to an earlier one without informing us at all, it was only when checking in at Downtown Disney that we found out we were on the earlier flight and although luckily we were still in time for that flight, this ruined our plans for our last day. Apparently it had happened to a family the day before,so be wary if you have booked through Virgin Holidays.", "Date": "September 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Elstree, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Place To Stay - A+++!\u201d", "Author": "AmandaAZN", "ReviewID": "UR78157550", "Content": "This place is absolutely brilliant.

But on the the SR536 (the road the hotel sits on), there are shops galore, a fab dining/shopping area called Crossroads with a dozen restaurants (our family fave was Sweet Tomatoes).

We have previously stayed in a hotel on I Drive, and also in a townhouse in Kissimmee. We found Kissimmee too far out, too much time travelling to and from Orlando, but we wanted our own space and not just a hotel room. LBV Resort & Spa was the perfect location. It was 5 mins from Disney, and about 15 from Universal. The rooms are very spacious, myself and my husband had a huge room, with jacuzzi bath (which we all loved!), double sink, walk in closet and a huge walk in shower. The girls (aged 13 and 16) had their own room with twin beds with their own TV, plus they had their own bathroom (thank goodness!) The kitchen and lounge area were also spacious, with comfy sofa and chairs and a huge TV with plenty of channels. There was internet access but via a cable which you can get from the front desk at no charge. We used the laptop every day and although the connection was slow at times, we were really pleased we had that facilty. The kitchen was okay - all mod cons including dishwasher/microwave, and also a washing machine and dryer, but what let it down was the lack of cooking utensils. There was only one saucepan and one frying pan, and no wine glasses. When we stayed at the condo in Kissimmee (also 4 star) it was much better equipped. We stayed in Building 3, on the 13th floor. We did not have a view of the pool. We did ask for one at check in but they were fully booked. However, our view was fantastic. We were looking out over the LBV outlet mall, over towards Walmart. We watched a massive thunderstorm develop one evening from our balcony. Our room was clean - I was really nervous before we checked in as I had read some reports on here saying that the condos were dirty. I have to say ours was very clean, the sheets and bedding were spotless and smelled lovely. Some people have commented that there was no maid service. I would not expect maid service in a condo hotel, and was quite happy to wash/dry towels as necessary. You can opt to pay for this service but we couldn't see the point. The kids loved emptying the trash down the shute at the end of the hallway! We did our shopping at Walmart (check out the rotisserie chickens and the carribean boneless chicken wings - they are amazing!) but the girls did use the onsite convenience store for crisps and chocolate. Whilst you wouldn't do all your shopping there, it wasn't too badly priced. We didn't use the Pizza Hut - both our girls are coeliac and cannot eat gluten so pizza was off the menu for us. We did try out Frankie Farrells Irish Bar on two occasions. The first was the night we arrived. We were jetlagged and it was 10pm so we wanted somewhere close. We had a round of starters and it was really good. We went for a second time as our main evening meal and the service was terrible. The waitress was unhelpful when we told them about our daughters food allergies and when I asked for a wine list the waitress said they didn't have one. I ended up ordering a glass of wine but had no idea what I was drinking. She was just quite rude with us. The food was only adequate and the cost was high. We wouldn't go there again when there are so many other good places to eat nearby. One place we would highly recommend was Longhorns Steak House. Great atmosphere, very helpful waitresses (especially with the food allergies, they had a seperate gluten free menu) and they could not do enough for us. The food was superb (my husband had steak and I had shrimp). The cost was also reasonable. We were sad we found this place at the end of our holiday as we would definitely have gone there a few more times. We hired a car and would highly recommend doing this. Driving here is no problem - much slower than in England! We would hate to have to rely on public transport or shuttle buses. A car is just so convenient. We always found a parking space outside of our Building, bar one night when we didn't get home until very late and we had to park outside the adjacent Building, but it wasn't really a problem. Finally, the pool was great. The pirate ship is a great feature and our youngest daughter loved the slide. It was always busy but not to the point that we couldn't get sunbeds. We didn't use the spa - we were too busy! All in all, we loved LBV Resort and Spa. Location was perfect and accommodation excellent. The only thing that we would have loved to have seen onsite was a coffee shop. It would have been lovely to have been able to grab a latte in the morning or on the way home.", "Date": "August 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moreno Valley, California", "Title": "\u201cVery Nice Resort\u201d", "Author": "motown1868", "ReviewID": "UR75696633", "Content": "I stayed at this resort from August 1 to August 8.

My daughter absolutely loved the swimming pool. I had read about the exspensive prices at the pool bar. The reason that drinks seem exspensive is because they automatically charge you the gratuity (tip). It is 15%. So if you are not careful, you will actuall tip the bartender twice. I do not have a problem with the included gratuity, but they could at least let you know about it up front. If you stay at this resort, it would be wise to have a rental car. The resort does have a shuttle to the parks, but it restricts you as far as coming and going from the parks on your own timetable. Plus, you will need to drive to Walmart right down the street where you can stock up the kitchen, instead of buying from the store on the resort property.

There are many reports on here that give great detail of the LBV Resort, but I'll just state the main points that we liked: 1. The apartments are huge, we were a family of 5 in a 2 bedroomed apartment and there was more than enough room. I use the word 'apartment' because the size of the pad feels very much like they are apartments. 2. When we read about the washing machine & tumble drier we thought \"nice idea, but we wont use them\", we're on holiday after all. However, because of the heat, we used them every day - a very useful addition! 2. It has a fantastic pool that the kids loved - right down to our 18 month old. Admittedly the much lauded Pirate ship is more show than actual entertainment vessel. There is one slide in the whole boat! However id did provide welcome shade from the searing sun. 3. Its in a great location for many reasons - if you intend doing most of the theme parks, your right on the doorstep, there's a huge Wallmart virtually round the corner and there's a shopping outlet on site if you like your shopping. 4. There's an Irish bar called Frankie Farrell's on site that is far better than you'd give it credit. We had many of our best meals in here, wonderful Irish Stews, Shepherds Pies, Bangers and Mash, etc. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for eating local cuisine, but lets be honest, the Americans aren't renowned for their 'haute cuisine' - you very quickly tire of eating fried foods, burgers, chicken, ribs, etc... They also do a reasonable pint of Boddingtons (at $6.50 a pint - ouch), however if you fancy a local beer try the Blue Moon, its rather good (and cheaper). 5. They don't advertise the fact that they have free WIFI in the reception lobby, that reached right down to the pool side. Useful for checking email, Facebook, the web, etc... There's very little to criticise about the LBV Resort, however our only gripe was regarding a cot/crib that we booked and paid for with Thomas Cook - when we arrived at LBV Resort they stated that they knew nothing about the cot as they had never had any on site, so we quickly had to drive to the afore mentioned Wallmart and buy one. We later noticed in the 'Welcome Folder' that it stated that they provided cribs for free use on request. We didn't bother complaining because what was done was done, and being typical Brits we don't like complaining. Overall our experience with the LBV Resort was a very positive one and we definitely would stay here again. However one thing I would not do again is go to Florida in July/August - the heat was so overpowering (averaged 105 degrees most days! topping out at 115 degrees on several days). You could live with this if you were just lounging round the pool, but not when your walking for many hours round theme parks - it knocks you out.", "Date": "August 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Grimsby", "Title": "\u201cWe couldnt have asked for any more\u201d", "Author": "DorisDayGrimsby", "ReviewID": "UR75492222", "Content": "What a fantastic hotel this was.

The apartment was everything we could have hoped for and more - fully equipped, loads of space even for seven of us! Beds were really comfortable - even the sofa bed. Lifts in the hotels are really quick, and even though we stayed at what is probably one of the busiest times there was always carparking space available by our building entrance. Hotel Staff were really friendly and helpful. Pool was great - stayed open until 11pm on an evening which was great cus we could come back after the parks and still get an hour of fun.

Firstly I do not like complaining I am a fair person with good values, so please read this carefully. Before I went on my holiday with my wife and three children together with my daughter and her two children,I read the reviews and although there was a couple of bad ones I thought you will always get a few, so I continued anyway. TWO MONTHS BEFORE MY ARRIVAL I EMAILED AND CALLED THE HOTEL TO REQUEST A FIREWORK VIEW AS I WAS RE-NEWING MY WEDDING VOWELS AND I FELT THIS WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA. DAY 1- Arrived and was greeted in a very friendly manner, I asked if I had the firework view and was told No, even though I was told before hand it would be ok. The friendly lady did not like being questioned. I was then advised in a robotic like manner what the rules of the hotel were and what was available to us as guests, I was given two sets of rooms One for my wife and children and the other for my daughter and her family. We went to our rooms which were in the same block, our room was very nice apart from the worn and dirty looking carpet, anyway I decided to have a bath only to be hit in the face by the bath tap and covered in HOT water. The tap was held on by one small screw and was worn. I reported this and was told I would be contacted by a Manager,this never happened so I chased it up, only to be told that I would be contacted the next day. I met up with mu daughter who informed me that in her room one of the electric rings for the cooker was just laying on the top and the bath towel holder was on the floor. Not a good start so I went to the front desk to report this as I felt that if the ring for the cooker was not connected surely that meant that the live connection below would be uncovered, and a towel holder on the floor is not its normal place. I went to the front desk and was advised again that the Manager would contact us the next day, and that maintenance would attend to all the problems. The next day we went out and came back in the evening to find none of the faults had been repaired, so I went and spoke to the Manager who said he would look into it and call us back he never did. To cap it of I returned to my room to find the toilet flooding and marched back to speak with the Manager. I was moved to another room and compensated by my travel company for one nights stay, which I felt was a very poor offering after being covered in Hot water and being hit in the face with force by the tap, thankfully it was not my young son. By the way I had to jump through hoops to get this refund. I was advised that this was sufficient and compensated me fairly. I am now making calls to deal with this. My daughters room remained in the same state of disrepair for FOUR days, until after constant calls and reports to the travel company rep, was it eventually sorted and I was told the cooker was perfectly safe ? Not sure so I won't comment In short the pool is over crowded and shaded from all surrounding buildings, So if you fancy sunbathing by the main pool, which is the one shown in the pictures of the Hotel you wont get much of a tan. The other hotel blocks all have there own pools but they probably wouldn't hold more than twenty people each. I would summarise as, Management a joke no one comes back to you, carpets dirty. But to cap it off no one was bothered about my initial requests for a firework view I suppose it sums up the, I DONT REALLY CARE ATTITUDE. Sorry, but save your money this accommodation is awful, and although my review is rather long winded I hope it shows that this is how you can be treated at this hotel.", "Date": "August 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jersey, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cWrong Location\u201d", "Author": "sueleb18", "ReviewID": "UR74355610", "Content": "This hotel is fantastic with very large rooms and brilliant facilities but limited eating facilities with just a poolside bar serving limited food and an 'Irish Pub' selling quiet expensive food. We didn't have a car so found getting around anywhere very difficault and expensive. We had to get a taxi anywhere we wanted to go and whilst the hotel was happy to arrange a taxi for us we realised after leaving this hotel and going to another one with easier access to places, that we had been paying more than we should for taxi's as they had arranged a private hire company rather than the cheaper Yellow Cabs, We found staff on reception a bit off and the lady taking bookings for the free shuttle service was very off hand almost to the point of being rude. The hotel advertised free shuttle services to all the major parks but in fact only went to Epcot and none of the other Disney parks and the departure time from the Hotel was at 9:40am making it quite late to arrive at any of the parks. The two pool areas were also quite small taking into account the number of rooms there were in the hotel, and the larger of the two pools was always very crowded and you could never get anywhere to sit or lie as either there were not enough sunbeds or chairs or all of the bed and chairs were bagged by people early in the morning and who weren't actually at the pool.

We are advising everyone going to that hotel, to take just 15min to walk down the road, perfectly safe, although no zebra crossing, just wait til the lights turn red at either end and run. and you will find lovely friendly ticket agents that will help you out, and meet any ticket prices you have looked at (as i had preordered, my friends came with me to collec the tickets and also to see if they could get their tickets at same price - which the agents kindly did). Also they offer discount for those paying by cash or travellers checks and do most dinner shows except polynesian resort at disney world one.

The shopping mall, which is only a few steps from the resort is one of the smaller outlets but still has many top brands. Aswith all resort shops, this one was expensive but walmart is only a few minutes away. the pizza was the best we had tasted, from the pizza shop on site. The shuttle works quite well, we did not want to drive due to a previous incident of getting lost so we used the shuttle every day.

Three tv's, one in kids room, living room, and master bedroom. Master bathroom was awesome with jetted tub and separate shower. It was convenient to Disneyworld (10-15 min drive with traffic). The hotel offered a shuttle but we opted to take rent car and budgeted for parking every day at the parks. Hotel parking is free. We saved money by eating some meals (mainly breakfast) because the room has kitchen and dining room. It's really more like a condo than hotel. Negatives: carpets a little dingy/stained for my liking in rooms and hallways of resort. Parking a bit of a problem. Had to park near Irish pub and on street a couple of nights. Kitchen is sparse on utensils, and no cleaning products so you will have to go to walmart or grocery store to get a few basic things to wipe off counters, etc. All in all, it was a great hotel. These were all minor issues overall. We stayed a week and I don't know if our family could have survived in a typical hotel room of two double beds like on most affordable Disney resorts. Plus it would have cost a lot more money staying on property. For a family of 4 for hotel, airline tickets, and rent car (Honda Civic), it was $1900. Pirate ship pool was great for my 7 yr old.

Booked 3 bed 2 bath and were allocated 3 bed 3 bath at no extra cost. That gave us two massive spa bath ensuite rooms and a double room with separate bath. Huge apartment, clean, fully equipped and well maintained. Have no idea what previous reviewer is complaining about with regard to linens as it's quite clear on their web site that you have to pay for housekeeping and linen changes, just book it at reception. Plenty of towels provided and easily washed and dried ourselves, didn't bother with paying for towel changes. Washing/drying facilities were great, came home with no dirty laundry! Bins are provided adjacent to the lifts on each floor to empty your rubbish and recycling bins were on the ground and 4th floors of our block. Without a car the shuttle service was essential. Book it the day before and coach or appropriate number of 10 seaters sent for each park (only had to wait once when too few cars turned up and then it was only a 15 min delay - no worries). No you can't split your day between Universal and Disney on the shuttle, but then it's not a private chauffeur service, and of course within Disney you can use the Disney transportation to park hop. On site shop is very expensive, but Walmart is just a 2 min ride away. Without a car you need to walk out of the rear of blocks 1 or 2 and across the outlet stores carpark. You come to a large dual carriage type road which looks a little daunting but is in fact quite easy to cross. There is no pedestrian crossing but there are traffic lights at both ends of this section, so you just need to wait in the middle until the traffic stops the other way. Not much in the way of pavements so wear closed in shoes to walk along the grass verges - all in all about a 15 min walk from apartments. Costs about 10 dollars each way for a cab if you have shopping too heavy to carry. Was initially disappointed at the lack of restaurants in walking distance although the Irish pub and Pizza Hut on site were great. However, found lots of restaurants ie: Ruby Tuesdays, TGI's, rib shacks, oriental buffets, italian and chinese places on I 192. Cabs cost between 7 and 10 dollars each way, but walkable if you take the road directly alongside Walmart garden centre.

Housekeeping is available but at a hefty price. Also, there is internet service but it's wired not wireless. Of course, I didn't have the cord I needed. We did have a problem the first night. The air conditioning went out and after 6 hours, they switched us to a different room. We had no choice with the room but it was similar to the original room.

We did do laundry once and had the room cleaned mid-week of our one-week stay, which worked for us. It was confusing finding our room after we checked in and figuring out which building was ours and the wait to check in was a bit long (not enough staff at that time of day.)

Too expensive and the drinks were not even all that. The bartender took it upon himself to pour my drinks into these soveniur cups from the hotel without asking me, the cups themselves made my drinks more costly, anyways I had no choice but to take the drinks because there were people waiting behind us. So after all that, I went back to check in and my room was still not ready, at this point I am a little upset because I was tired and I just wanted to freashen up before I proceeded with my day. I had to raise my voice a little and tell them to find me another room because I was no longer going to wait for the room that they had assigned me. So finally they got me a room just like the one that I had reserved, I walk in and it was a very nice room, with all the perks inside like the granite counter tops, jacuzzi tub, etc. The only thing that didnt work in the room was the phones. None of the three phones I had in my room worked at all. I called for them to come and fix the problem and they came fast, however nothing was done about it. I stayed here for a week and the phones were never fixed. I had to call guest services from my cell phone and that alone was frustrating because no one ever answers the phones at the front desk. All in all I love Florida, and this resort is nice but it seems that it could use better customer service, more than one main entrance to the building you are in, because after hours if you cant find parking by your building you have to walk all the way around to the main entrance of the building to get the elevator and that is a long walk especially when you have young kids traveling with you. Another bad thing is that if your room overlooks the pool area you will have people in the pool making loud noises waking you up in the middle of the night or early in the morning. Not something to look forward to if you came home late for a good nites sleep.

I looked at every hotel (even Disney). This hotel caught my eye for value and for quality. I read the poor reviews for this hotel and I was a little leary as there were some. However, the good review far exceeded the poor ones. Let's just say, that I had nothing negative to say about my stay. We arrived late, and the staff was so helpful and friendly. When we asked staff members for restaurant choices, they were glad to help (and sometimes even game us coupons for them), The services get a BIG thumbs up. The bar staff at the pool was especially friendly. Now for the rooms, they were AMAZIING. We stayed in Building 5 (per someone's recommendation) and it did not disappoint. It was right by the pool and the rooms were very nice and appeared to be new. The Jetted tub was an awesome addition (our kids were in it more than we were). Having 3 TV's was bonus (very nice 42 inch plasma in the living room). We ate supper on the balcony one night and watched the fireworks for Sea World (very nice). Simply put, the nicest hotel room I have ever stayed in. We will never look at another hotel room the same way. We had friends staying at Disney and their room was 1/8 the size of ours and they payed about $70 more a night for theirs. The ONLY negative to the rooms were the beds were a bit hard for my tastes, although with a Disney hangover every night, I barely noticed! You all know about the cleaning. It never bothered us. We washed our own towels when we did laundry (washer & dryer in room was great!). I took trash to the shoot twice (we brough trash bags). I liked not having to worry about being out so housekeeping could come in. The pool was just awesome. My boys (4 and 8) could have stayed there all day (not to mention their love of the ice cream sandwhiches they sold at the poolside bar!!). The slide, the pirate ship, the 0 entry...perfect for families. Area was amazing. Literally 3 minutes from about 20 chain restaurants and Downtown Disney. Easy 8-10 minute drive from Disney. I would recommend renting a car. Although it close to a lot of things, driving makes things much easier. Parking was never a problem for us, although I did notice some cars parked along the road that must have belong to the night owls (even though we returned several night after midnight and never had a problem). I would recommend Bahama Breeze (great restaurant down the road). Awesome food. Also, we ordered Pizza from Flipper's per the suggestion of the hotel. Get pizza from here if you order out...so good!!! Overall, it was an awesome hotel experience for our family. My wife and I figured after 7 nights away from home with our 4 and 8 year old boys, we would be ready to come home. WRONG! We could have stayed at LBVRV for another week. The amount of space in the ENORMOUS room (we had a 2 Bedroom Antiqua) gave us more room than we probably have in the downstairs of home. This was key to everyone having their own space to avoid annoyances. When we return, we will certainly stay here. I can't say enough about this hotel. Absolutely fabulous!!!!", "Date": "June 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boise, Idaho", "Title": "\u201c2 weeks in Orlando and wouldn't have stayed anywhere else!\u201d", "Author": "IdahoTravelers", "ReviewID": "UR68683823", "Content": "We stayed at the Lake Buena Vista Resort and Spa from June 4th through June 18th and it was a really REALLY great place to stay. Keep in mind that every resort/hotel has it's problems... NOTHING is perfect, even in the town that boasts to be the \"Happiest Place on Earth.\" Yes the power went out, but come-on people....the resort had no control over that, it was a city wide power outage. They did the best they could running minimal lights on generators, which is actually more than I would have thought a resort would do in that situation. We even had one night at the pool where a family of around 15 decided it was appropriate to swim in next to nothing (underwear, bras, etc.) As offended as I was, this was not the fault of the resort. They can't hand-pick their clientele. Had I or anyone else in the pool area chosen to take this up with management, I am sure something would have been done immediately. Honestly, I think we were all in shock at the sight, and by the time any of us came to our senses enough to complain, the family was leaving the pool area. We stayed in building 3 on the 11th floor in a two bedroom suite overlooking the pirate ship pool (very COOL!) If you are looking into staying, and want a room with a view of the pool, these rooms were great. Our balcony faced north, with Universal Studios and Sea World in the distance. You can (barely) see Universal's fireworks at 10pm every night. If you want a room with a view of the Epcot and/or Magic Kingdom fireworks, you will need to be in a different building (not sure, but I think it's building 5 on the north side.) Either way, I don't think its possible to have a room with both a pirate pool view and the Disney fireworks. The pool and hot tubs were great. (There is a smaller pool on the other side of the resort, but we only visited the \"pirate\" pool.) It's zero entry from one end, and gradual steps on the other. It's refreshing after a day at the parks. The pirate ship has a water slide in it... a lot of people, kids in particular, seemed to like this. The bar at the pool is well equipped, beer/wine is around $6 and a \"fruity\" drink will cost you $12 (I think it was) for your first one in their \"Lani's Luau\" plastic drink cup, and then $8 for each one after that (just keep bringing the cup with you every night.) There are signs that no outside food or drink is allowed in pool area, but it was never enforced, at least not that I experienced. The pool area also has free wifi, so that was really nice for those of us who can't live without our laptops. The condos are large - dining area, sitting area (couch and chair) fully equipped kitchen, two bedroom, (one with two twins, the other with a king) two bathrooms, (master suite has jetted tub and separate shower) and a balcony. The condo was clean and definitely served its purpose. The jetted tub was fabulous after a long HOT day at the parks. Our room had a wired internet connection. Sometimes I could get a very weak wireless signal, but being on the 11th floor, it was not enough to gain wireless internet access. We went through VRBO.com and dealt only with the owner until we checked into the resort. I highly recommend this, as the price was considerably cheaper. Our room rate per night was $100.00 - that included all taxes and the \"resort\" fees. I am HUGE on service... service can make or break it for me. I will say that the front desk staff was neither friendly or rude... they were just,... well... there. It wasn't all smiles and niceties, but they got the job done in a very timely manner and always answered our questions. Parking, for us, was always sufficient. We always parked in our building's parking garage... never once had problems finding a spot. We were never at the parks until very late though, so I assume that might be a problem for some. Someone else here posted that there was only one luggage carts per building... from what I saw this is simply not true. There were times that I saw as many as 4 at the elevators in the parking garage in our building. For those of you who will do what we did and buy a bunch of groceries, there is a Wal-Mart about 1/4 - 1/3 mile away... very convenient! I would definitely stay here again if we ever venture back to Disney World! Huge bang for your buck!

We arrived shortly after 2:00PM, we waited in a short line (15 minutes) and the young man at the front desk was very rude in telling us that we couldn't get our room until 4:00PM even though we just saw other customers getting their rooms early. We went to the Irish Pub on the property which was very nice and came back about 3:30PM as we were very tired and wanted to get to our room to rest after our long drive. This time there was more of a line and we waited 20 minutes and got the same young man. He was still rude, he told us the room still wasn't ready, it wasn't 4:00PM yet, and they were very busy and it may not be ready until sometime later that night. I told him I wasn't going to continue to stand in line. I shouldn't have to stand in line when I already have done so twice. He didn't have an answer to that. My family sat in the lobby until 4:01PM and then stood in line again. It seems the family that was waiting behind us in line was going through the same kind of thing from the same same young man even though we saw other people getting their rooms. I dreaded getting this young man again, but I could see this young man was \"slow walking\" the customer in front of him so he would not have to wait on us, luckly for all of us we got someone else. The young lady we got said the room was not ready but then contiuned on to see if she could get us in another room. She talked to the manager (he was working next to her) about this and he did some checking and got us a room and he also explained that there was a power outage the night before and not all rooms were electrically checked to make sure everything was working, especially the A/C. The Resort (if you want to call it that, I don't) looks very nice from the outside. The room, 2bed/2bath appeared nice and clean, but looking deeper, carpets dirty and furniture was worn. The TV in the second bedroom could be a bit larger, you can't watch it laying in bed, way too small. The bathroom in the master bedroom could use a door for some privacy (a very poor setup). The internet is NOT wireless, YOU have to have your own cable and it can only be used in the living area (not bedrooms). Nothing tells you this you have to figure that out on your own and then after midnight it is hit or miss if you can get on as the internet ran very slowly after that to the point that it wasn't even worth trying. The phones did not work. Reported it and they finally came the last day of our stay and said they would have to replace a phone as it did not work, they never did so we had no land phone available to us our entire stay. Also, one of our hair dryers was missing from the room and we called immediately so we wouldn't be charged for it as they have a list of items that the resort would charge if these items were missing from your room after your stay (I thought that was in bad taste....if you steal it you should be expected to pay for it). A new hair dryer didn't show up for 2 days. I have stayed in nearly a hundred motels/hotels/resorts over the years and there have been a handful that do not have maid/cleaning service unless you paid extra for it, but this place did not even change the towels or dump the trash (you are kidding me) We washed our towels every day to have clean ones and dumped our own trash nightly. Some residents just threw their trash out of their doors, very disquesting and smelly. Where are the vending machines?....there were none. The convenience store was a joke (things you could get from a dollar store that are priced at $10). The pirate ship was neat to see but it took up way too much room in the pool and the surrounding deck as the pool was packed every day an no where to sit (use the smaller pool, no crowds and more relaxing...isn't that why people go on vacation to relax). Forget parking at night if you come in late, you probably will have to park behind the the outlet mall next door (the outlet mall being next door was nice...that was a good idea if you just wanted to stay around the hotel area for a day). The Irish Pub (Frankie's) was excellent. The family loved it and a few of the Bartenders/Waiters were very good and made you feel at home. When the day came to check out I searched for a luggage cart, none to be found. My family and myself made numerous trips down the elevator/stairs to the car none of the service people knew where any carts were nor did they really care. Check-out time is 11:00AM, at 9:30AM we got a knock on our door from the maid service asking us when we would be leaving so they could clean our room for the next customer. Are you kidding me??? After what we had gone thorugh in getting our room you wanted us out of our room early, come on, where is the customer service at this place? The price was right, that is why we stayed at this place but will not stay here again until they get the little things taken care of, far too many of them and there are way too many other places to stay in Orlando.

This was the first time in Orlando for any of us so I spent some significant time up front reviewing options for accomodation and after a very detailed analysis I finally selected the LBV Resort Village and Spa. I am delighted to say I was not dissappointed with my selection. This is an excellent resort with very spacious and comfortable rooms offering great value for money. We took a 2 bedroom condo with living area, dining area and kitchen and gave us more than enough room for the 4 of us on the trip, with each room well furnished and plenty of amenties. There are 3 and 4 bedroom units available as well. I especially liked the large whirlpool baths in the main bedrooms and the fact that there was free internet access. One point I would highlight is the pool area and in particular the large pirate ship offered. This area is very nice with plenty of beds available to relax on. However from my initial research the Pirate Ship looked like an excellent play area for the kids and would be something they could spend many hours in enjoying themselves. The reality is that the (very large) ship is nothing more that an enclosure for a fully enclosed water slide into the pool, which as it transpired was not suitable for either of my young children. This was my only (slight) dissappointment with the resort. The biggest recommendation I would offer for this resort is the location within Orlando. If you are planning to do Disney then there would be no better place. After leaving the car garage, 60 seconds and 2 turns takes you onto the 536 and literally 4 minutes later you are passing the welcoming entrance sign for Walt Disney World. Just perfect. We had an absolutely fantastic time in Orlando and our accomodation had a lot to do with that. This is a great resort and a perfect place to stay, especially if travelling with family or in a large group.

Full disclosure - one of our children has participated twice in the Disney College Program\u2019s paid internships, and we have racked-up over 20 nights at the LBVR. Lengthy waits on-hold to book reservations are typical, but we bargain hard and ask for fees to be waived, and we stay in the 2BR/2BA Antigua suites for around a Benjamin plus tax per night and, depending on the season, sometimes we also pay a small, one-time service/housekeeping fee.

While the excellent construction and insulation of the LBVR towers muffle most of the noise, the hallways and elevators always seem to have a very faint odor of baby wipes and lately have not been cleaned to the previously high standards. Unfortunately this possibly reassuring odor for some (?) is often accompanied by \u2013 at least the inference - of that which was wiped. So, despite the slightly soiled carpets (no correlation to the smell of baby wipes I hope); the noticeable decline in the previously perfect housekeeping standards of the interiors as well as the exterior grounds; the lack of a reliable shuttle; and the crazy patchwork of HDTV channels; it is unlikely that the amenities of LBVR\u2019s suites would not please even the most jaded, 3-star pilgrim \u2013 especially with the 10-foot ceilings. All this being said though, every pilgrim should park their car for a night or two and stay at least once on-site at one of the meccas such as Portofino in the \u201cU\u201d (highly recommended) or at the Lodge at Disney.

This was a big change for us from previous vacations where we have always been a fan of staying at Disney and taking their transportation around. We couldn't have been more pleased with our decision. I searched around and found the Lake Buena Vista Resort and Spa on Travelocity and booked a 2 bedroom suite for pennies compared to a standard Disney room. The hotel is brand new and minutes from Disney and Sea World, and a quick drive to Universal. With the savings on the room we rented a car this time to get around, the hotel was a 15-20 min drive from the airport. Upon arrival at the hotel front desk person offered us a room upgrade for $20 a night to the 3 bedroom which we took... we have 2 teenage boys and this way they each got their own room. The room has a full kitchen and tons of space and i mean TONS, the room was the size of a small house. The hotel has a pool with a pirate ship and bar, restaurants and walking to the adjacent mall. Having the car this time we took the opportunity to venture outside of Disney this time which the boys loved, spending a day each at Universal and Sea World. We also saved a ton of money not eating only on Disney property, we inquired at the desk where to eat and the staff couldn't have been more helpful giving us close places with good food and reasonable prices. The food outside of Disney is much better and the service was much better. I can not tell you the number of lackluster dining experiences we have had in the recent years eating at Disney restaurants.

There were 8 of us from our family traveling together and needed to find a suite that could accomodate us. We were thrilled to find the 4-bedroom Grand Bahama available and affordable for our trip. The on-line reservation process was a bit \"clunky\" but manageable. Upon our arrival and check-in we were informed that the 4-bedroom unit that we had reserved was not available and that we would would have to stay in (2) two bedroom units for the night. We were told that there had been a plumbing problem as the reason why it was not available yet while we were waiting to speak with a manager overheard another associate on the phone telling someone that they were overbooked. We called the front desk the next morning to check on the timing of our move to the correct room and was told it would be after 4:00pm. I left my cell phone number with the associate and was assured they would call when it was ready. At 4:30 we still hadn't received a call so I went to the front desk. This time we were told it would be after 5:00pm. Finally at 6:00pm and another visit to the front desk we were given our keys. No offer to help move our luggage was made even though we were moved to a new building on the 15th floor. While the suite was large the furnishings were \"cheap\". Beds were not comfortable, linens and bedding were thin. Coffee table had legs that were broken and propped back in place and only wired internet service in rooms. Wireless only available in area of the lobby. The balcony area was nice as we spent many nights having a drink taking in the sights. The on-site convenience store has just about everything but you pay for it. The Pizza Hut Express was quick but the food below average. The game room was decent as our younger family members used it a lot. The Irish Pub on-site was neat to visit however the food is average at best. The pool side bar makes decent drinks with an average price of $10.00 each and the Pirates Pool was nicely done again very attractive for the younger kids in our group.

The master suite had a jet tub and a large walk in shower and double sink vanity. All furniture was nice and well kept up. It also had an apartment size washer and dryer off the kitchen and a balcony with a table and 4 chairs. It was great for saving money eating in with the kitchen too. We asked to be able to see the fireworks from Disney at night from our balcony, and they were great at accomodating us. Staff were very friendly and even held doors for you if they were around. The pool with the pirate ship is huge and heated. It was also open until 10:00 which was nice. Some hotels had earlier pool hours, and it is nice to come back from the parks at night and be able to swim. I thought for how beautiful and nice the rooms were, it was a great value. However, it is no frills as far as housekeeping. You have to pay to have a midweek room service, but it is available. Also, we stayed a week, and they gave us 2 extra garbage bags, 4 rolls of toilet paper and 3 packets of dishwasher detergent. There was no laundry detergent. and no shampoo. You will need to buy more of those things if you need them. Maybe they would supply them midweek if you ask, we just bought our own. Wal-Mart is very close by and not at all hard to get to. The hotel was easy to get to and only about 20 minutes from the airport. It is right behind a factory outlet center and the entrance sign had their name on it. I saw one review that said it was hard to get to, and that is just crazy! It is close to all the Disney attractions and about 15-20 minutes from Universal. There are also eating places all over in the area and a restaurant next to the hotel, The store they advertise is VERY expensive as is the bar by the pool. It was $5 for a beer by the pool. They ask that you don't bring in outside food and drinks by the pool, but I saw people doing it without being stopped. The configuration of the pool near the tall buildings also makes the pirate ship pool have shade by 5:00 or so in March. I'm sure in the summer that is a great thing though! It was also a nonsmoking hotel, but they allowed smoking by the pool. I didn't care for that, but I'm sure smokers appreciated it. If you have young children, you need to watch them because it is a zero depth entry with lots of space for the little ones and water umbrellas, but it is not roped off where the pool starts to get deeper. All in all, the great things about the hotel outweighed any negatives. It is a great value, with great staff and very nice,comfortable clean suites. I would recommend staying there, and we would definitely stay there again.", "Date": "April 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Windsor, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cI would definitely stay there again!\u201d", "Author": "par1022", "ReviewID": "UR59741077", "Content": "My family of myself, my husband, my 25-year-old son, 20-year-old daughter and their girlfriend and boyfriend thought our room was beautiful.

Price:amazing value. We would have spent 2-3 times as much to stay on Disney property without having all the benefits we found in the LBV resort/spa. For the cost of a night at an average Orlando hotel we had a 2 bedroom condo 2. Accomodations: Very spacious 2 BR condo with nice sized kitchen and dining area. The two full baths were great for a family with one male (me) and 3 girls and my wife. Tons of space, we were never in each other's way which usually happens at your average hotel. Very Clean. Full size fridge, stove, oven. 3. Service: This may be the only place that is sub optimal. There is typically only one (sometimes two) front desk attendants. There are 4 buildings full of people and the front desk people are constantly over worked. They were always pleasant with me, but could be short with guests at times. Other than that, however, I thought everyone at the property from the maintenance to the front desk and especially Bob (the bartender at the pool) were very nice, efficient, and eager to please. 3. Cleaning: There is no cleaning included with the room rate. Room cleaning and towel service are available for a charge at your request. Change of towels $5, Towels/vacuum/trash $10 and Full Clean I think $30. 4. Pool- Great 5-restaurant- Frankie Farrells- good food, pricey...but what isn't in Orlando. 6. Location- Easy to get to from the airport (about 15-20min) and great location for Disney. A short car ride to all the parks as well as Sea World/International Drive. You need a car as there is not any real efficient shuttle or public transportation from this area. Orlando is notoriously hard to navigate due to numerous numbered highways which don't run north/south/east/west. Get a good map. Also, tons of tolls throughout Orlando so make sure you have cash and some change when you leave the airport on one of the toll roads. 7.Parking- Not good. Limited lot space near the entrance and some street parking but often had to park behind the hotel and for some reason you cannot enter from that side...so you have to walk all the way around to the front. 8. Internet- free wired internet in the rooms and wi-fi in the lobby and pool area. Overall, I would highly recommend it for a family traveling to Orlando.

The beds are pretty comfortable as far as hotels go and the room seemed clean enough. If you wear white socks you will notice that it isn't the case though. The pool is large which is good because the complex includes five buildings, two of which are 15 stories and 3 are around eight. We went during Canadian March break and there were many people there, mostly Canadian. The week we went it was extremely cold for Florida and very windy at the hotel, maybe because of the two towers being so close together and the air had no where to travel. The shuttle to the parks...MAKE SURE YOU MAKE A RESERVATION! You have to make hte reservation a day in advance and must tell the front desk which time (if you are going to Disney) Something like 8:15 or 10:45. Sea world and Universal were about 9:30. The Disney shuttle goes to Epcot. We went to the Magic Kingdom and had to take two different monerails, wait in two different lines and get our bags checked twice to do so. A pain, and about an hour from the time you get dropped off by the shuttle to the time you get to the entrance of Magic Kindgom. If you are going to Hollywood Studios or Animal Kingdom I would imagine there would be a bus there, I'm not sure though. The front desk staff is understaffed at all times. If you call the front desk from your room it takes minutes for them to answer. They are friendly and provide a good service yes, I just wish there were more of them. Didn't use the spa but prices seemed comparable to many others in that area and even back home in Canada. There is a WalMart just down the street and a Publix up International drive (10 mins). All the restaurants you would ever want to eat at are within 15 mins. 20 to Universal, 15 to Sea World and 15 to Disney. The outlet mall beside the hotel is not as large or has the same calibre of stores as the Premium outlets and Prime outlets both off of I-4 , 15-20 mins away. But they give you a coupon book at check in and we found that this mall had the best deals. We bought our Disney tickets at WalMart so we wouldn't have to wait in line at the park...it was about 40 cents more expensive but worth it since you didn't have to wait. They have a little booth within the Disney clothes in the middle of the store. If you wish to be close to the pirate ship pool, ask for Building 3 or 5. There is a small pool, more for adults between buildings 1 and 2 if you wish to use that. There is a gym and a convienence store in building 1 along with a Pub which we did not attend to. All in all, the hotel was good as was the vacation. The rooms are fantastic and the location is pretty good. Bring a bottle of Lysol wipes to wipe everything down if you feel more comfortable.

I think the name is somewhat deceiving. This 'Resort' would be better named as an apartment or condo. There was nothing 'resort' or 'spa' aout it. We had a 3 bedroom/ 2 bath unit for 4 adults & 4 kids. Our unit was very spacious and the bathrooms were in very good condition. No mold & all appliances were newer and worked without problems. The kitchen had only basics (no serving spoons or vegetable peeler etc). It was fine for fixing breakfast and snacks or cold meals but I wouldn't want to prepare an actual dinner. There is not daily housekeeping unless you pay for and book it in advance which could be the reason things are starting to look a little 'tired'. The carpets & furniture need a good cleaning although they were in pretty good shape other than being soiled. When we arrived we had only one roll of toilet paper in each bathroom and one roll of paper towel in the dispenser in the kitchen. There was NO dishclothes or kitchen towels and not a cleaning product in sight to wipe down the kitchen table or counters. The hallway and unit had a bit of an odour but we got used to it. The pool area was very nice. The location was very good (10-20 minutes from all parks & downtown Disney) But not much for good restaurants close by. Walmart 5 minutes away. I wouldn't want to be without a car if I was staying for longer than a week. (although Hotel wasn't very busy and the parking lot seemed full every night) Front staff not bad but not great. Had an issue with a party in the unit next to us. Had to call front desk several times which was of no help. Using the tub for an ice bath for beer in adjoining bedroom followed by drunk person barfing in tub made for LONG night. Could hear word for word conversations in unit next door although some noise to be expected. The biggest issue we had was the Bedding & pillows. This may seem minor in print, but believe me we are talking MOTELl 6 quality!! NASTY! The bedspreads STUNK (don't think they have ever been washed), The sheets were paper thin and a bit grungy and the pillows were so flat you may as well not have used one. At the end of our stay my sister reminded me that someone on trip advisor suggested going to Walmart and picking up a comforter and I couldn't agree more! If this 'resort' changed the linens including towels (which we saw housekeeping folding on the hallway floor!) I would give them a 4.5 stars. But after 14 days of dreading crawling into bed, I give it a 3 star. If you have already booked your trip, don't panic but bring your own bedding & a few cleaning products and you'll be fine.

Having a full kitchen meant we could easily go to Walmart (less than 1 mile away) or Publix for some groceries. We saved a lot of money by not going out to restaurants for breakfast & supper.

First I would like to say IF the week we went was not the busiest of the year we may have had a better time. Do not go during Mid winter break February 10 - 25. Unless you like standing in lines for hours and not having any options for food. Of course the weather was 40 degrees on a good day so it was not that good of weather either. Sunny but cold. But we tried to make the best of it. Also if you do plan to go during a busy week MAKE RESERVATIONS for meals inside the parks. All restaurants during this week were fully booked for both lunch and dinner. They took no walk ins so you were relegated to standing in line for 30 minutes to get a pretzel, popcorn and water or soda. We were not aware this would be an issue until we were there. And if you don't stay in a Disney Resort the concierge can not help you book as Disney wants only their facilities to book for you. The Hotel/Condo was only $129 per night for a two bedroom complete with washer and dryer and full kitchen. I had called ahead and spoke with the conceirge about shopping in the area for groceries. She stated we could walk to Walmart just across the street. They also stated on the website and when I called they had daily shuttles to Disney World and other parks in the area. Walmart is about 1.5 miles down the 6 lanes of traffic with no sidewalk or cross walks. You would need to get a cab if you were going to go there. There is a very expensive little store in the condo complex that is very over priced. A crappybottle of wine was about $20 but by the end of the week you were willing to pay that price. They have a little bit of everthing there but again very pricey. The Shuttles: You must be at the lobby by 8 am to catch the only shuttle to the Disney area and 9:40 for the Universal Studios area. There are not other runs in the morning. You must make your reservation for this shuttle by 9 PM the night before or you are out of luck. The only return options are 6:15 OR 10:20 and you must indicate which you will take upon boarding for the morning shuttle. You may not change your decision unless you call ahead of time during the day and at that point it will depend if there are any open seats. However, please keep in mind you are NOT dropped off at the entrance to any park. You are dropped off at the \"Transportation and Guest Services\" area. From there you must take a monorail, bus or ferry to the parks. So by the time you get there you are ready for lunch. When you return most of the parades are over by 9 PM so you have an hour and a half waiting in the \"Transportation and Guest Services\" parking lot. By the second day we went with taxi cabs. About $25 per trip for three people one way. The rooms were less than comfortable. The king bed is a very bad mattress with very cheap and shoddy bedding. We had to keep getting up through out the night to fix the fitted sheets as they kept coming off of the bed. The mattress cover was very thin and really was a sorry excuse for a mattress cover. Our sinks were slow draining and never got fixed. We had asked for the sinks to be dealt with and the lock to the door that you swing over on the inside was broken and also was never fixed depsite repeated requests to do so. The couch needed to be replaced. It was soiled with apparent body sweat and was very worn in the middle. There was food along the halls through out the complex that stayed there the entire time we stayed. 7 days. The trash cans through out the complex were very full daily. You must pay for extra housekeeping if you want daily service or new linens or towels. There was also a very strong smell of baby powder an apparent \"cover up\" of the old smokey smell as they do allow smokers and charge them $250 so you get to have that aroma each time you walk out of your room or elevator. The only restuarant is \"Frankie Farrells\" which is just next door to the complex. Very good French Onion soup, Shepherds Pie, Fish and chips, Hot Wings. Definetly the high light of the week to have someone actually care about your needs. Very affordable if you have a big family and just need a bed for sleeping. Even with the $50 a day for transportation it still came out to less than $200 a night for a two bedroom / 2 bth with a sleeper sofa condo as compared to one of the Disney Resorts that are just a room with two beds and no cooking options or washer and dryer. The resorts come out to anywhere between $300 and $500 a night. The master suite has a king bed and the other bedroom has two full beds and then the sleeper. The only thing I can say is it would have been nice not to have to think about transportation daily and a perk to staying in the resort is the early admission to the parks. Most lines this week were 60 - 140 minutes of wait time. Lots of strollers and scooters so be patient. Next time we are going on a cruise. I hear the Disney Cruises are great for families and focus on parents getting some time away from it all and keeping the kids occupied every minute.

One thing which is not the fault of the hotel but the booking agent hotelopia. On arrival which was at midnight I was informed that the hotel had been told my booking was cancelled at my request. He let me use the phone to contact Hotelopia and the agent was very rude and kept screaming down the phone that I cancelled the booking giving the time of my \"request\" as being the time I was at 30,000ft over the ocean on the plane. I was close to tears I was that angry with her and so tired so I slammed the phone down on her.n The guy on reception was very good and gave us the apartment and told us to get the kids into bed, have a good nights sleep and he would have everything sorted by the morning. When I came down to the desk next morning he indeed had everything sorted out and was apologising profusely for the mix up and advised he had complained to the agents manager who also apologised. A month after the holiday when the credit card statement arrived I had been billed $250 even though the stay was fully paid in advance. I called the hotel to find out why and the manager couldn't have been nicer. Again he sorted everyting and I was refunded immediately. Turned out hotelopia told the hotel in error that I owed the $250 and so their accounting people billed me. The great thing was that Alan, the manager, acknowledged the drop in the exchange rate between the dollar/euro in the month since the holiday and refunded me at the higher rate. This was great because the \u20ac250 refundable deposit we had to put on the rental car was refunded at the lesser rate. So this was a sure sign that the hotel treated me more than fairly. So the moral of the story is this place is fantastic but book through anyone except hotelopia.", "Date": "February 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "vero beach, fl", "Title": "\u201cstayed in 09, ging back 2010 with another set of grandkids.\u201d", "Author": "mimi_linna", "ReviewID": "UR56673106", "Content": "We stayed here with two of our children and spouses, 3 grand kids ages 7 months/ 3 yrs/4yrs in a three bedroom unit. two masters and a bedroom with two twin.. mimi and papa scott got this room.

Our room was cleaned and spotless when we arrived they supply you with just enough for a few days, we rented a car and loaded up with all sorts of goods from walmart.

The ONLY complaint we have is DONT order from a place called ROMINOS , every morning there are a ton of fast food booklets under the door and one night my boys wanted pizza so we decided to order from rominos and long sad story short, they delivered our food and our sandwiches were all wrong we called back they said they would redeliver and after 45 mins nothing, we called back the guys said he didn't remember talking to us he said they would redeliver and the same thing nothing finally at 1 am we just went to sleep.

Looks like all is the same. We have 2 kids, 5 and 2, and when we stayed here in a 2BR it is was just about perfect. Overall you can believe everything you hear for this hotel. Rooms are huge, perfect location, great pool, apathetic counter staff, very difficult to find even with a GPS. VERY reasonable price, no great deal, but you fell like you really got your money's worth. Have to walk across a street to get to the pool depending on where you stay. Its all true. Oh yah, and I did have to get a cord for internet in my room, which worked flawlessly all week and was free. Parking was easy for us. I could see it getting worse during busy season, but for us we pretty much parked in front of our door everytime. I am looking forward to going again and my kids cant wait to swim (we hope). No big deal going to the pool, I think others are exaggerating the distance. We are lazy, so having a fresh made pizza ready for us at the pizza place on site (we called on our way home from the parking lot) made us feel even more lazy, but could not have been any easier. If you are more motivated of course Wal-mart is a drive around the corner. We stayed for 5 nights and got a full room cleaning once which was worth it. Who cares if the counter staff fall head over heels in love with you, they do their job. We eventually found the place and after that it is a breeze to find. The only problem we had was getting a luggage trolly when we were leaving. Not easy. Please invest in about 5 more of these things. The other negative which is a personal annoyance for me and I am only reporting because it is literally criminal and should stop immediately, was that the person at check out told me I had to pay the \"resort fee\" which was clearly laid out in my reservation that the \"resort fee\" was covered in my total I had already paid. He made me go back to my van, dig through paperwork, and present him with evidence. After which, there was no further questions asked and he simply said that all the different reservation systems do it different. Not sure he would have let it go if I didnt bring paperwork. I got my paperwork ready this time, but really wish I didnt have to bring \"evidence\" with me when I check out of a hotel.

People out there are really friendly and the weather was superb, about 83-84 most days. we got talking to some people out there and you can get you tickets cheaper out there 9 times out of 10, can save \u00a350/60 on park tickets etc, the same for swimming with the dolphins, That was amazing, well worth every penny, everthing is inc, food,drinks,towles,snorkel,suncream.Just bring yourself and your cosie. Universal was ok, once you have been there a few times you get a bit bored, not much there, islands of adventure is better. also tipping is arond 15% of the total of your dinner as well, but some do already put it on.Invest in a sat nav, you wont get lost. pre order if you can as it cost us 184 dollars for 2 wks. most restraunts are fab out there, but we found the golden corral fab, worked out about \u00a325 for a family of 4 all you can eat.....just make sure you try the steaks they are to die for. dont forget to do shoppin, its well cheap there, you have one on your door step and loads scattered about, the prime outlet is better than the premier.

So, we had to go down stairs and get some laundry powder. I guess this was a plus; considering this wasn\u2019t an item that we packed. They didn\u2019t have wireless internet in the room, but if you wanted internet you had to get a plug from down stairs. The parking lot space was very limited and we had to drive around several times to find a spot, which was actually farther than our room building. They can definitely improve their parking arrangements. There weren\u2019t any rollers available for us to transport our items on when we arrived, so we had to carry everything up.

We were told this was free even though we didn't have maid service but it was just so hard to get them to do the job and at the end of the holiday they tried to charge us $42 for a full clean which we never had nor asked for.

As we are a family of four, with a 15 and an 11 year old, we enjoyed not all being stuck in the same room and greatly appreciated having two seperate bathrooms. The hotel staff were mostly all very friendly and the service was prettty good. The location was very central and was very near to disney. The hotel offers a free shuttle service to Disney, Universal and Seaworld which should be very useful, but we experienced a problem returning back from disney on our last day. Coaches are sent out to the parks in the morning, but in the evenings these are replaced by small mini-buses, which sometimes leave not enough room for all the guests returning to LBV. We would advise that you should pick up youre shuttle voucher the day before and get to the bus stop promptly, to get priority of seats in the shuttle. The restaurant on site 'Frankie Farrells', was handy to have, as they catered for a wide variety of tastes, service was quick and friendly and food was mostly quite good.

First, I had a room reserved at the Hawthorne Suites a couple of miles away - breakfast was included - because of its location. I was relying on relatives (not from Orlando area) for transportation & wanted to be close to where they were staying. The Hawthorne was overbooked & I was sent to the LBV Resort Village. Check-in was efficient, but I didn't feel very welcome. The map to my building was photocopied & not especially clear. Also listed were fees charged for housekeeping services. So if you are staying for several days & wanted housekeeping, remember to add in $5-$20 per day. There is a two level parking garage for building 5 & I was dropped off at the elevator - which required a keycard for entry. When I opened the door to my room, I was in awe. The intial quick look through showed a gorgeous 2 bedroom suite. A closer inspection later, proved otherwise. Pros: Pizza Hut Express on the property. Key required to gain access to the elevator from the parking garage. Washer/dryer in kitchen area. Kitchen also included several appliances I didn't expect - like a hand mixer, rather than just basic dinnerware & pots & pans. Two bedroom suite divided by living/kitchen area, with 2 separate baths. TVs in bedrooms & living area. Balcony off living area. Cons: Difficult to find at night if unfamilar with the area. Several different addresses listed for this resort. (Had I planned to stay here, I certainly would have had my own maps & directions.) Some basic features inside (lack of towel bars, slippery shower floor, one small soap dish-with no place to put shampoo, etc, except on the floor). Housekeeping services are extra. Public areas not checked for cleanliness (someone had vomited in one of the elevators-great way to start your morning). No complimentary coffee in lobby. In room coffee pot with 2 packs of terrible decaff (2 sips & I dumped it out). In short, I doubt I would stay here again - and probably wouldn't recommend it to others. Depending on the rates when you book, it might be very economical for a family of 6. But make sure you check on the extra daily costs (housekeeping, parking). Three & four bedroom condos are also available - keep in mind, they are also in the business of selling these condos. For a single person, staying only one night & relying on others for transportation, it was not an especially enjoyable experience.", "Date": "October 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Devon", "Title": "\u201cwhat a wonderful resort to stay in Orlando\u201d", "Author": "FloridacrazyDevon", "ReviewID": "UR47034757", "Content": "From the minute we arrived to the minute we left everything was perfect here.

I cannot even say how many times I have been to the parks. I have stayed in dozens of hotels in the area, from hotels in downtown Disney, to hotels in each Disney category, hotels near Universal and Sea World. The list is endless. As an experienced Orlando traveler (trust me, I don't even need directions to get around), I enjoy staying at new hotels every visit, whether it\u2019s better than the last hotel or not, it\u2019s just for the experience of seeing something new. I came across the LBV resort last year and decided to book. It was just my boyfriend and I, however, we got a 2-bedroom suite because it was cheaper than a one-bedroom (there was a promotion on the site we booked through). When we got there, they asked us if we wanted a pool view or a firework view. We decided on the pool view. We were just there for a weekend; however, we were extremely comfortable. We were amazed on how much space we had. The prices on the rooms are unbeatable to other hotels. The hotel is close to all the parks (about 10 minutes), the rooms are huge and they are fully equipped. You could stay at a \"regular\" hotel with two double beds and pay more for less space. On the other hand, you could stay at a similar condo-type hotel like LBV, but the location is far from all the attractions. I have stayed in several condo-type hotels before LBV, one of which was a 2-story, 2-bedroom resort villa (which was gorgeous), but not as conveniently located and nearly $400 a night. Also, there are a several other hotels close to the parks, in the same price range as LBV, and spacious with all the same amenities, but LBV seems to be the newest, best kept, and has better decorated rooms (more modern). I enjoyed my stay so much that I have an upcoming trip at the LBV in December 2009. I spend a long time researching hotels for the trip (because I like to stay in hotels I have never been to in the past), but I have decided to go back to LBV because of the unbeatable price and how much you get for that price. This hotel is not in the middle of the Disney scene. If you are looking for the full Disney experience from the moment you wake up to the moment you go to bed, which can be a lot of fun, stay at one of the Disney resorts.

My (now) wife and I were joined by several freinds and family as we were here to get married. The wedding was perfect, we got married at 11am in leu gardens, what a place! It was absoluetly stunning. We chose a morning wedding because of the heat but more importantly the humidity, ive never sweat so much! The gardens were fantastic and if you visit florida it will make a nice change from the usual manic tourist attractions. The complex was fantastic, our room was awesome very big and very well furnished, my favourite part was the huge spa bath, im a big lad and could have fit in it twice over! Coming back to the room was a joy, relaxing in the bath with a bottle of wine and watching tv was the perfect remedy to the often hectic days. The location was brilliant if you wanted to go to the disney parks, literally a 5 minute drive away, the other parks such as universal were only a 10 minute drive down the I4. The only criticism I have about the location is the fact you needed to get a taxi everywhere, which although pretty good value would start to add up as the holiday went on. Of course if you dont drink then driving would solve this problem, I however like a drink! I spoke to one of the bar staff and asked him where the locals go, where is cheap etc etc. He told me about a place called ale house, brilliant! The complex is just of the sr535, along which you can find the ale house, about a $12 taxi ride. I was paying $4.5 for a beer by the pool, in here you could get a pitcher for $5 or a pint of fosters for $2. Just beware anywhere in florida baileys is extortionate! The ale house does get busy with locals who go there to watch one of the many sports being broadcasted, there must be at least 50 plasma tv's! Driving in florida may seem daunting to begin with, but trust me it is very simple. The roads are very good and undertaking is allowed, makes it much easier! The signs are a little interesting because in the US everything is done by blocks, you may see the same street sign over and over. If you are a panicker you might have some issues driving, if an american tells you its just around the corner, it could be as far as 30 miles! Trust me, I drove there for 3 weeks, the key is dont panic and you must realise the place is huge and very spread out. Although on the whole america is good value, some places are riduculously expensive! When you go to the parks do your research, some places will allow you to take food in but alcohol is generally a no no. Food/drink in the parks is expensive, seems obvious I know but we realised this and still spent a fortune in the parks, ah well it was our honeymoon after all! Walmart is brilliant! so much choice and so very cheap. I like a drop of wine and found a bottle of wine for $3 and it was stunning! The meat in the supermarket is both cheap and gorgeous, buy a new york strip steak in walmart for $8, cook it right and it will be one of the best steaks you have there. All the parks are great, the water parks are my favourite. Typhoon lagoon has an amazing wave pool that is not for the light hearted. Sea world is so much more than just the whale, manta was possibly the best ride I went on. Busch gardens is worth a visit, great rides and stunning animals, got some amazing photos. We also went to cocoa beach (dissapointing) and clearwater beach (stunning) unfortunately we missed out on daytona beach, incredibily we ran out of time. In our final week we were alone, friends and family had left after 2 weeks and we decided to explore a bit more. Many of our friends had been to miami on a day trip and raved about the day. We wanted to go to miami but also the florida keys but no travel company did a trip which appealed to us. We decided to drive ourselves and after 3 hours arrived in miami, it was huge, kind of like driving into a sunny good looking london, but bigger I think. We drove to south beach and god was it hot! However, my wife and I didnt like miami, it was too busy and summed up america, full of exteremes. You would see the richest people, the poorest (not nice), thin, fat etc etc. We wanted a city tour but missed out (time again!) and so left for the keys. The journey was very bad! We listened to instructions from a local who said it was just down the road, thanks mate! Anyway we eventually arrived at key largo and checked in to the hilton, just in time for the sunset, what a beauty! Had a great night and fantastic meal and left early for key west. When we arrived we were in for a shock, it was bikers weekend! They estimate that 30,000 bikers turn up, quite a lot seeing key west is only 7.5 miles by 1.5 miles! We managed to escape it by going for a sunset cruise, $50 each, free food (average) and drinks (champagne was awful) and the sunset was out of this world, my wife and I were nearly in tears, beautiful. Next day I drove the 6 hours back (somehow!) and we had our last night in the fantastic lake buena vista resort village and spa, altough the keys were fanstastic we both missed our 'home'.

Bus back from universal is 7.15 it then picks up at seaworl at 7.45 We planned on spending at least $250 on taxis but spent about $50 Do a big shop at Walmart when you arrive.A taxi was $7 each way. I was amazed how close we were to the parks 10 min to EPCOT 15 to Seaworld and 20 to Universal on the bus. The hotel shop is expensive.pack of coke in walmart $1 in the hotel shop \u00a33.99!!! There is also a Ponderosa just down the road. The Frankie o 'Farrells bar food was nice also the take away pizza hut on site was nice and not too expensive.

I made this point to the resort manager on leaving that he has a great team working with him in the resort. Apartment - spacious, clean, all mod cons- fantastic jacuzzi bath in main bedroom, with extremely large walk in shower and his/hers handbasins.

New , clean, spacious 2 bed apartment with new equipment. I read the other reveiws and was concerned about service and houskeeping. I reserved through Virgin Holidays and expected an apartment for 14 nights not a hotel room, there is a difference. Housekeeping is available at an extra charge for those who expect clean towels, toilet tissue replacement and bins emptied every day (basic hotel services). We were looking for an apartment that provided privacy, two bedrooms and basic cooking facilities. The resort exceeded my expections in all these areas. As it is only a couple of years old all the equipment was new (washer / tumble drier, dishwasher, huge fridge, oven, hob, microwave, 42\" plasma TV, iron and board, TVs in bedrooms and excellent air conditioning). Pool was great. Turn left out of the resort and there is a Walmart Superstore about 1/4 mile on the right. We stocked up with quality toilet tissue, kitchen roll, milk, bread, butter, cereals, bottled water , washing powder etc and never looked back. There was a garbage chute at the end of the corrider for disposing of trash. Again if this is bit difficult you can always pay housekeeping to do it for you. You are provided with towels (we washed them when necessary), a small bottle of washing up liquid, small amount of dishwasher tabs, toilet and face tissues, bin liners, standard hotel small bottles of shampoos, soaps, etc. It was like walking into a hotel room. This is not restocked unless you purchase the housekeeping options. I took cables for connecting my laptop to the internet and the plasma TV so we could review the days pictures and movies we had taken. I also used my IP phone on the laptop. Cups, glasses, plates, bowls, cutlerly were all spotless. Beds were comfortable. Luggage trollies were available when needed. I would recommend a hire car as the shuttle buses are not frequent. With a car the location is great for Disney and Sea World. Placed midway between Crossroads and the 192 it is ideal for restaurants. We stayed one night in Tampa in the Hyatt Place Busch Gardens.

Having the convenience of the plates, etc. plus the dishwasher saved us SO much money on food. We went to the nearby Walmart and loaded up! All of the decor in here is Tommy Bahama. The second bathroom had a nice linen closet and was really big. The balcony access is through the living room, and was spacious with a table and chairs. We requested a pool view so we could watch the kids from our balcony! The balcony is the only area in the resort where smoking is allowed, other than the pool which some tables are equipped with ashtrays. There are 2 pools, the smaller one almost no one goes to, but I recommend it if you are seeking privacy. The larger pool has a pirate ship with a water slide in it that kids love, a food/drink place, and an elevated sun deck. There are also a couple of hot tubs. Even when the pool was crowded, it was still spacious. There is also a gym near the smaller pool, as well as a bar and a pizza hut. There are premium outlets right across from the hotel! (You can walk there) Arby's, Wendy's, McDonalds and Golden Corral are all very close by. They have shuttles to Disney too in case you don't feel like renting a car. The first time we stayed here in 2006, they were still building. There was no second pool, or places to eat. Now there are at least 3 buildings to stay in, but you can request to stay in the building near the smaller pool and eateries, or near the large pool. The only problems we encountered while here was that the slider on the shower door was broken, and it took maintenance days to fix it. The towel rod in the 2nd bathroom was broke and fell on my daughters toe-they didn\u2019t have much to say about that other than they would have it fixed. Also, our coffee pot broke one morning, they were sending housekeeping over to fix it and it took the guy more than an hour and a half to walk over! How far was he coming? They say there is security here, but honestly other than cleaning/maintenance/front desk people I did not see any security. Parking is free, there are spaces in front of the resort as well as a parking lot. Housekeeping is optional, you can pay an additional fee if you require this service- we didn\u2019t, we washed our towels and took the trash out to the chute in the hallway. There is a spa here, which looked really nice but I did not try. Also, the main lobby has pamphlets about stuff in Orlando, make sure to take some. They also have menus of different buffets and restaurants. You are right by I-4 so this place is convenient to Universal, Sea World and Old Town as well. My advice, stay here, just make sure you inspect the room before you unpack! For the value you get here, it is SO worth it. Even if you came here not for Disney or but just to relax. I would def. stay here again, and hope to be able to do so soon!

The facilities were excellent. The pool was great. Always towels available and it never seemed to fill up (although a lot of people would be too tired to avail of it after an all day excursion to a theme park!). The Irish Pub across the way was also excellent. We went 3 times. Sean was an excellent host and the food was some of the best we had during our stay. The mini-market/Pizza place was handy but a little pricey (pizza's good though!) so ask for directions to the Walmart for your larger shop. The Walmart is a 2 mins drive away (don't try to walk it as there are no footpaths along the way). All the hotel staff were very helpful and we were left to our own devices. The location is pretty much ideal if you like a quiet retreat after a hectic day at a theme park. It's only a couple of miles from Disney and right on the main road that brings you to Universal Studios. There is a free shuttle that runs a couple of times a day but if you can hire a car, do. Everywhere is far away (not the fault of the hotel!) so if you want to go to Walmart or one of the Outlets realistically you need your own transport. There is a small outlet place right beside the hotel but for anything bigger you need to drive there. As someone who had never driven an automatic and is used to driving on the left side of the road it didn't take long to get used to it as the layout of most of the roads make it difficult to go on the wrong side.

Our 3 bed/2 bath apartment in building 2 was very tidy, clean and spacious. Our only real gripe was that the spa bath broke after the first use and despite two requests for maintenance to take a look they never did but it didnt spoil our holiday by any means and we still had two showers to use. We also couldnt find anywhere to dispose of our rubbish sacks but as we were leaving our apartment on the last day the cleaner told us to leave them outside our room and she would take care of them. The washing machine/tumble dryer came in very useful during our stay also. The accommodation is situated around 10/20 mins from Universal and Epcot. We used the shuttle bus regularily from directly outside reception (you have to book the day before but there is no charge) which ran at 8.20 or 11.20 in the morning to Epcot returning 6.15 or 10.30 p.m. and leaving at 10.40 a.m. returning early evening if you wanted to go to Universal. We found this perfectly adequate as we found 7/8 hours in the parks was quite long enough especially when it was hot and we didnt mind a few early starts. We took the later shuttle if we wanted to stay to see the fireworks in the Disney parks. Although the shuttle only took you to Epcot the bus service from there is very very efficient running every 20 minutes to Animal Kingdom and Hollywood Studios and for Magic Kingdom you take a monorail. Not having our own transport did not create an issue for us at all. A couple of times we needed a taxi which we took from outside the reception which was $30 to Seaworld/Discovery Cove and around the same to Florida Mall but drivers do expect a tip of around $1 per traveller as do the shuttle drivers. We walked to Walmart for provisions the first day which took around 10 minutes (although it is across a busy highway which is quite scary) and got a taxi back which cost around $9 as the grocery store on site is very expensive. The teenagers in our party used both on site pools which were clean and towels were provided.

Only problem we had was our dryer broke the 2nd to last day - maintenance came and looked at it, no joy, so were told we should be able to use a dryer in an empty room (going home the next day and had loads of wet cloths) - however this didn't happen and we left a message for the duty manager who never got back to us - hard to believe not one empty room in a hotel of that size!

The apartment was huge, not \"oh this is roomy\" kind of huge, I mean \"you could happily move in for an extended stay\" large. There is a risk you may loose children in wardrobes!

The shower cubicle was the size of most UK bathrooms. \"His and her\" sinks ensured plenty of mirror space and I'm reliably informed that the hair dryer(s), whilst not the best were more than adequate. The furniture was comfortable and perfect after a long day wandering round theme parks. The balcony / patio had views for miles, although all you could see of interest was the theme park(s) and fireworks of an evening (usually from Sea World). The Kitchen was well kitted out with a fridge, microwave, cooker / hob, kettle(!!), dishwasher and food waste disposal system. The washer / dryer wasn't the best but certainly did its job. More than anything the place was spotlessly clean. The underground car parks ensured a cool car during the day, otherwise the temps might be a little aggravating. The room air conditioning worked so well it made us too cold on occasion, something due mainly to my tinkering with the temps in oF, not oC. If you go with the expectation of a hotel you may be disappointed. For me the optional room service was great. Please note on check out you will have to pay a \"resort fee\". For two weeks this worked out to be about \u00a370, payable either by cash or credit card. The hotel is next door to a reasonable shopping center, and five minutes drive from the Orlando premium outlets, a Mecca for any shop-a-holic.

Our tour/travel company (GTC Travel...AMAZING FOLKS BTW, Marie Sperling contact) suggested staying in Condos. When all was said and done, GREAT CHOICE!!!!! OK, now on to the property: Rooms were awesome and all suites were very nice...ten of my students shared the 4 bedroom, 4 bathroom 2600 SQ Ft. Condo on the 15th floor. It was literally the size of a GIANT home and took up half the floor. Furnishings were nice, Dining room table was able to accomodate 12 of us (felt like the knights of the roundtable), TV's were LCD and HUGE, and 2 master suites. One of our tour assistants actually did cartwheels up and down the living room floor area (HUGE) and Absolutely beautiful. My room was a 3 bedroom condo with a large master suite with king bed. Mini walk in closet, Nice size, bathroom was amazing and one of the largest bathrooms I have seen at any condo...and if my wife traveled with me (she did not) it would have been very romantic - hot tub was close to the bed and very pretty room! The POOL WAS TO DIE FOR! The Pirate ship slide was amazing and my students literally asked to give up 1/2 a day at a Disney Park to hang by the pool. PARENTS, I think your kids would love this place...as an adult, I also loved the slide and whirlpool/jacuzzis...BTW, Someone else who rated this hotel actually wrote to say the pool was not that big...I have to say that person was 100% wrong. There was room for many of my 70 students and scores of other people, and no one complained one bit. Also, they have a nice poolside \"tiki bar\" with lunch/snack area that was useful! Tons of tables and chairs too, as well as lounge/deck chairs to sunbathe. There were many jacuzzi's as well around the pool, not sure how many, but I do remember at least 4. Although I did not use the pool area behind the Pirate ship, I did notice many people over on that side as well. Personally, I utilized the Spa portion of this resort and was EXTREMELY satisfied. The folks there were very nice, and the Spa was truly exquisite, though a bit empty, as I was the only one using the Spa...(not a bad thing mind you). GREAT massage and pedicure (note my students \"teased me\" endlessly for the latter).

Take the elevator to the 7th floor only to discover that our room, door open, was yet to be serviced, the housekeeper was still working on another room and not yet started on this one. Of course there was no house phone on any floor except the lobby, I called the front desk only to be told that I was wrong and the room was showing as being serviced, after a heated discussion we were told to come back to reception for another room. 4. Of course there were now 10+ people in the queue, I made eye contact to the guy that checked in who signalled me to him, as soon as I approached the front desk the nasty supervisor yelled at me, \"excuse me, you can't push in\", the guy tried to explain to her what was happening and she yelled at me again to return to the back of the line.

Several lights blown throughout suite and fluro lights in the kitchen blinking on and off. 8. When we were next at the front desk we asked for the free voucher booklet we should have received at check in, only to be given blank looks by the 3 counter staff.

We caught a taxi to Sea World, according to the hotel website is only 4.5 miles away, in taxi turned out to be 18 mins away in no traffic and was $26, that was not the bad thing, on our return we asked several taxi drivers to take us to the resort and none of them knew where it was. When we gave one of the address's I wrote down from the hotel it was not even in the drivers GPS. Overall I was disappointed with the resort, especially the service or lack there of. Lack of security, strange people walking in and out of the place, non resort people in the pool area, but that's another story.", "Date": "July 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Georgia", "Title": "\u201cOh so comfy...\u201d", "Author": "Georgiagirl1980", "ReviewID": "UR33413611", "Content": "The suite was magnificent.

For us, the best thing about this hotel was that we were able to all stay together in one 3-bedroom, 3 bathroom suite. This was so convenient and fun - much nicer and a much better value than having separate, adjoining hotel rooms. Two bedrooms each had a king bed, one bedroom had two twin beds, and there was a couch in the living room. One negative thing about the sleeping arrangement is that in the king bedrooms there is no wall between the glass shower area and the bed - so if you have a child sharing your king bed with you, you have to wait until the child wakes up and leaves the room before you can take a shower, unless you don't mind taking a shower right in front of them. We did have some problems with the furnishings: refrigerator leaked, getting water on a lot of our food; dryer knob kept falling off; air conditioner didn't work. When we checked out, there was a large charge for a long-distance phone call - about $250 - which was made midday, which we didn't make. The clerk said the only people who have keys to the room are maintenence and housekeeping, so she didn't see how it could be a mistake. But it was, because we were always at Disney World every day. She believed us and removed the charge without a problem, but it made us check our wallets and luggage to make sure no credit cards etc. were missing. So overall, a great place to stay with a group, but it's not perfect.", "Date": "June 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lawrenceville, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cREALLY Great place, just needs upgrade on little things!\u201d", "Author": "EllicasMom", "ReviewID": "UR33018126", "Content": "I am a hotel snob...i will say that first and foremost, so take my review as you will. Me, my husband and two girls 4 and 6 were traveling with two coupoles, one who had 3 small boys, aged 1, 4 and 5. One couple stayed in a one bedrooom, and the rest of us stayed in the 4 bedroom suite room 2803 in building 2. CHECKIN was fast, which is always wonderful, but it was straight up 4pm b/c the hotel was full, no problem. ROOM: Upon entering the room, we were very excited about the cleanliness, roominess and the wondeful layout. 2 master suites flank each end, complete with jacuzzi tubs, large stall shower and sliding glass doors to a balcony that stretches the full length of the suite. (which had two tables and 8 chairs outside). There were two additional full bathrooms, and two additional bedrooms, both with two twin beds. All of the bedrooms were very roomy and had dressers and closets, tvs. Living room in the center of the suite had one sofa and two chairs, large tv, sliding doors to balcony. Our room was carpeted throughout, except baths and kitchen had tile. (The neightbors across the hall from us had ceramic tile throughout except bedrooms). Master bedrooms had great blackout curtains, but the two twin bedrooms DID NOT only had slat blinds, which insured the little ones to be wide awake at the crack of dawn b/c those windows faced east! Be aware! There were plenty of extra blankets and pillows in the closets though, and that was great! Also an iron and ironing board. The pictures online did not do the rooms justice, we were very pleased. NOW for the negatives in the room: Upon beginning to cook our first meal (spaghetti) we realized the refrigerator was not getting cold so someone ended up having to come up to \"reset\" it twice in two days. Eventually the second day it got cold and started making ice as well. The toaster was missing some knobs, our blender (which we just wanted to use as a pitcher b/c there are no pitchers available) leaked and we had to get a new one, no cookie/baking sheets, the wine corkscrew was broken, and no frying type pans whatsoever, only saucepans. These were all little inconveniences that added up to a poorly stocked kitchen. The washer and dryer were fabulous in the rooms, just be aware that this is a hotel that runs more like a condo, as you do not get daily housekeeping service, change of sheets and new towels. You wash your own towels, etc. You do have the option for cleaning services for an additional fee. Oh, and theres no vaccuum cleaner or broom, just FYI. And our dryer took 4 cycles to dry a load of towels, bummer, but no biggie. NOW THE POOL!!! As i mentioned above, we were traveling with 5 small children and so keeping them happy is priority number one. This pool delivered! The pictures online DO NOT do this pool justice. It was awesome! The kiddie area is very large and so much fun! It's zero-entry pool with water mushrooms and a large ledge around the edge for ease of entrance and exit along the sides. The pool bottom was kinda rough, so make sure to bring water shoes! We had a baby with blisters on day two, so be aware! There are several tables with umbrellas near the water, as well as many lounge chairs. They also have the perfect low tables and chairs for sitting in the water while watching your kiddies. We moms loved these! There was a hottub and shower nearby as well as full towel service. (the towels are just kind of small). The opposite end of the pool seemed to be much quieter and away from all the little kids, it was a nice spot near two more hot tubs and a shower. BUT, the main attraction of course is the pirate ship waterslide! It was so much fun, i think we parents loved it more than our kids! It was quite a thrill that was not expected! They will let parents take their kids down on laps, so no worries, but by the end of the week, our 4, 5 and 6 year olds were doing it all by themselves! And it's even more fun at night! OH, and another main attraction, at least for us moms was the pool bar. Apparently, it is not in conjunction with the hotel, it is ran as a restaurant on the premesis, but no matter. The drinks werent cheap, of course, but the Lani's Lua Punch was fabulous for $8 with tip. And the 15% gratuity is already added to each drink, so dont throw another buck down on the bar! (One waiter , Bob, told me that I should come back later to check all my tab charges to the room, and also bring an additional tip back with me since i obviously didnt have any cash on me at the time! Whatever, not NOW buddy!) Which reminds me, there are no coolers allowed in the pool area, so do what we did and hide it under a towel! I mean come on...it was 98 degrees one day and our kids wanted cold water, we were not about to buy it from the bar! FOOD: There is a Pizza Hut on the premesis, in the bottom of building 2, across the parking lot from the pool. You can pick it up, it was $14 per medium pizza, and they DONT take Amex, btw. The bar also has wings, and personal pizzas, ice cream and other bar food that was good. My husband was the most excited about the Irish Pub that is at the hotel! It was typical American-Irish faire, but lots of beer! It was good food and best of all, close and never overcrowded. We had 12 total and never had to wait for a table. Servers were a little cooky, but overall quick, good service. Apparently, there is also this fabulous SPA but as a mom with small kids, i didnt even get to see it with my own two eyes. CRAZY: (I always seem to have a crazy category) We did have this crazy fiasco on our last day where we got locked out of our room for 4 hours, and countless members of the hotel staff were involved in fixing a broken lock on our door, but the management and maintenance staff were so friendly, helpful and just plain wonderul that they really went the extra mile to make us comfortable and compensate for our missed dinner reservations at Rainforest Cafe! They actually reimbursed us for clothes we had to buy our kids (all they had were wet bathing suits!) treated us to dinner at the pub, and then arranged for a shuttle to take us to and from Rainforest Cafe for breakast the next morning! It all worked out! LOCATION: this hotel sits in the same parking lot as a pretty great outlet mall. Came in handy when our carkeys were locked in the room and we had to walk to Old Navy to buy our kids underwear and clothes!! DOWNTOWN DISNEY is very close, only a couple of miles away. Traffic is crazy all the time, but its Disney! Expect it! WALMART is almost within walking distance, (busy highway though!) just down the road not even 1/4 mile. Liquor store in the same parking lot, too! All in all, I would DEF stay here again, the price was just fantastic as long as you dont mind huffing it to the pool a little jog, and doing your own towels and sheet! So, for a hotel snob, i was pretty impressed and overall happy with this hotel!! We all had a blast and just out and out loved it!", "Date": "June 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "chicago", "Title": "\u201cGreat value in an overpriced vacation spot\u201d", "Author": "ptc712", "ReviewID": "UR33011744", "Content": "We stayed for four nights in a three-bedroom condo -- two adults, two teens, one young adult.

We had a huge problem with our Hilton reservations at the last minute and in a scramble to find different accommodations, I found the Lake Buena Vista Resort Village and Spa. The value was incredible for a two bedroom condo and full kitchen. The resort was clean, the property beautiful and my daughter ADORED the swimming pool. She even gave up a whole day at the parks just because she wanted to swim all day! I cant say enough about the incredible value it was for us. The resort is located about five miles away from Disney World and its location to the parks allowed for quick, no traffic driving. We were down there on one of the busiest weeks of the year and not once ran into traffic to or from the parks! We had a wonderful stay and many memories of our daughters first trip to Disney! If I HAD to complain about anything ... one would be the shuttle service. It runs only twice in the morning and twice in the evening. The morning shuttle times are fine, BUT the evening ones both leave the parks before the fireworks so if you want to see a show, you have to drive and also if you decide to leave the park early for some reason, you have take a cab to the hotel. One other strange complaint is about the pizza advertisements. We would get pizza advertisements under our door at LEAST four times a day. I am sure it is not the idea of the resort, but they should try to limit the access of the pizza place to the buildings. We ended up leaving a pile on the floor outside our room... that way they stopped putting more under our door. Those would be my two complaints!

The condos were very nice, big flat screen TV's, big jacuzzi tub in the master bath. The kitchen has all new appliances, granite counter tops. I will say they have the basic cooking items, so if you have kids you may want to pick up a pizza pan and cutter while at the store getting groceries, that is my only complaint about the place. We went to walmart, which is 1 mile down the road and got stuff for breakfast and lunch, and we ate out at night. My in-laws who have traveled all over the world and stayed in many places, loved this place, they thought it was very clean and nice. The pool was great and the pirate ship was so cool, all the kids loved and it the slide that goes through the ship. Mind you we have a 14 yr old son and a 16 yr old girl, so if they liked it, it must be cool. They had a great time hanging out by the pool, in the sun with the family. Amanda the bartender at the Tiki Lounge by the pool was very nice, the kids loved the Fruit, cheese and cracker trays, and the nachos. now the drinks I thought were a little exspensive, $9 for a pina colada was a bit much, that was my only complaint about that, but still had a great time. I have to say that the staff works very hard here and it is very apparent in the grounds, they are very well manicured, and clean. We had everything that we needed and it was so nice to not have housekeeping, no one in your room everyday and there is a washer and dryer in the condo, so it was nice to throw n a load of laundry and have what you needed cleaned right there, great for kids and their messes. We rented a car, which I highly recommend, this place is off international drive by sea world, we went to universal and city walk, which is always fun, great food, great for people watching, a band was playing there in the open they are just starting out, so that was cool. We drove one day over to the Gulf side about an hour or so away, we went to Honeymoon Island state park and took a boat to Calidesi Island $10 , which we love. It is beautiful, white sand beach, clear water, we have been there the last 2 yrs and love it and the kids went kayaking in the ocean (I was nervous, but Dad thought they could handle it, they were fine) my in laws loved it, they didnt want to leave. It was an adventure, there were a few sting rays in the water and fish and it was cool. I think a vacation is what YOU make of it, if you relax and let go a little and enjoy yourself everything else falls into place, if you are negative and whiny then you will pick apart everything. This place was great and we would definatly go back. We had a great time, this place has a lot to offer.

I have to say I agree with bits of most of the other reviews: both negative and positive. The staff were rude and rigid: we got the 'our computer's are down so we can't check you in until 4pm' and magically they worked at 4pm!!! I did wonder if this was a ploy, clearly it is, it would be better if they said 'Your room isn't ready yet'. We'd driven up from Miami having flown in from Heathrow and it was 3pm, I don't think that it's unreasonable to expect to be able to get into your room. I agree too that the 'absolutely no late check outs' smacks of lack of care for the customer, and all the stuff about stealing is way over the top. Whilst we enjoyed the pirate ship, we feel that they could've made it so much more: more water slides, or allow the children to climb on it as an adventure play ground. It is true, the pool area was VERY busy. There was not enough parking for everyone, every night there were cars on the road. It is disappointing that there wasn't a midstay clean: after 7 nights, most places like this do do a clean after 7 nights. It wouldn't be so bad if there was a hoover/cleaning stuff in the apartment but we only had a large broom, no dustpan and brush and the security latch was broken and the lights didn't work in all the rooms. Some initial dishwasher packets/washing stuff would be a nice touch. We were in building 5 and could see the Disney fireworks which was lovely. One day the cleaner of the apartment above us, chucked water over the balcony over us sitting on the balcony below!! I rang the front desk, they said she was cleaning it, I said it was unacceptable to chuck chemicals over us: they weren't really interested.

This is not a resort. My family stayed at this location April 4 - 10, 2009. I chose this resort based on previous reivews and the price was good. I normally stay at The Marriott Grande Vista every year. Based on the reviews, it was suggested to stay in one of the newer buildings. I called the resort and specifically requested a newer building (building 3 or 4). When I arrived, I was given Building 1, which is one of their older buildings. Luggage carriers/racks are hard to locate and it was very difficult for persons who weren't able to carry their baggage to the room. THE GROUNDS: First, the property consists of 4 \"condo-like\" buildings with no scenery and very little greenery. In my pinion, scenery and greenery is what makes a resort a resort. Of course, you do have the scenery choice of the outlet mall, the pool or the parking lot. The greenery can be found along the walls of the buildings. Don't get me wrong, this is not a \"Bad\" place it's just that if you 're looking for a \"resort\" feel this isn't the place. THE ROOM: The decor was average. The carpet was not clean. There was a big problem with the linen. The linen on the bed in the master bedroom had obvious stains on it (I won't even tell you what it looked like). The towels also had stains on them. I immediately went to the front desk and told them this was unacceptable. After speaking with the sarcastic front desk person for nearly 10 minutes, I got the direct number for the manager. I was finally able to reach the manager and he did have housekeeping come (with a supervisor) to fully clean the entire room at no additional charge. If you're traveling with older people or young children, the bathtub was extremely slippery. They need to put handrails in the bathtubs or at least put better grips on the bottom of the tub. We had to put a towel down in the tub to make sure no one slipped and hurt themselves. The Good News: The food at the on-site restaurant was good. The pools are nice. There is a small grocery there with a Pizza Hut inside that's really nice and convenient. The grocery prices are high (as expected) and the pizza was great. The staff in there is great. Aside from the housekeeping issues, the rooms are nice (we had a 3 bedroom). Nice outlet mall. Disney and Universal are close. Good location. The No So Good News: They need to pay more attention to people with handicaps. Customer Service people need a few more classes in \"customer service\". Housekeeping needs to step it up a few notches.

We were told that it would be a $10/night charge which we were happy to pay...in the end they gave us a complementary upgrade. This was unexpected...but welcome. Our room was outstanding. I knew what to expect based on reading reviews and looking at the website....and yes I do travel with an ethernet cable because sometimes wireless networks are down. This wasn't a problem. I also knew the layout of the master bedroom and although I too would have like a door I wasn't shocked. As far as the customer service...wow it was outstanding from our check-in (Terrell was so friendly) to a couple of calls we made in need of a couple of items. Then some people complained about having to wait to have things brought to their rooms, I say get up, take a walk and give these hard workers a break. I bet these same whiners wouldn't even tip someone for bringing supplies to their rooms. OK the pool...wow how could you complain about the water slide. Our kids (8 and 12) both loved it. They would have rather skipped the park and stayed all day at the pool. We loved the washer and dryer. We went home with very few items. That is a mother's dream. The location is fantastic. We were never in the car more than 30 minutes and traveld throughout Orlando. We were at the airport in 30 minutes.

The fact that these people could gain access to a \"secure\" building was disturbing. We talked to the manager and owner about this concern and they said they were taking legal action to prevent this from continuing. 4) The securing doors weren't locked once while we were there..in other words we didn't have to use our room card to gain entry to the building.

I had spent considerable time researching our accommodations, and based on the positive reviews, had high expectations. The resort is located conveniently off I-4 and is pretty and new looking when you first drive onto the property. The land surrounding the 5 buildings is cleared and ready for development, so the surroundings are not that attractive and present a decidedly unfinished feeling. We arrived a few minutes before 4:00 and I attempted to check in at the front desk. A very rude clerk at the front desk scolded me, telling me that check-in was \"technically at 4:00\" and all the computers were down. It literally was 3 minutes before 4 and there was no one else in the lobby! I waited 3 minutes and magically the computers started working! I got a clue right away about customer service at this \"resort\". We did get a room in one of the newer buildings and when we first saw it we were quite happy. Not huge, but the kitchen was adequate and the flat screen TV in the living area was nice. The secondary bedroom had 2 full sized beds (we were expecting twin sized, so this was a bonus). The master had a king bed and a large jetted tub. We did find the layout of the master bath awkward - the tub and shower are not private from the rest of the bedroom. The only privacy is a pocket door to the toilet. There is no private area to dress and with 3 teens wandering around, the master bedroom door had to be locked to assure not having an audience while showering or dressing! We hated having to kick people out of the room to take care of things that would have been easily accomplished if there had been a door for the bathroom! No one else has commented on this, so maybe we are overly picky about privacy. The pirate pool is cool to look at, but from a practical standpoint, it really misses the mark. The days we were there were very crowded, you had to fight for a chair and guard it if you wanted a place to sit - not my idea of relaxing. The pirate ship takes up so much space both in the actual pool as well as the pool decking, it seems like a most unfortunate waste of real estate. I kept imagining how much better it would have been to eliminate most of the ship and trade it for more linear footage around the pool. My teens did not appreciate the pirate theme - seemed a bit babyish for anyone over 10 years old. The ship does serve as a backdrop for a water slide, but its main purpose is decoration - they would have been better off without it! There are plans for 5 more buildings and no more pools - the crowd at this pool was already overwhelming- it will be unworkable with 2xs as many people! There is a pool bar which is handy for snacks and frozen drinks. The service here was disorganized, but at least they tried to be friendly! It was nice to eat right there by the pool. We were busy visiting theme parks 2 of the days, and we came home tired. Unfortunately the mattresses were so hard none of us slept well. My husband thought the beds were suitable to torture hostages or death row inmates. We sleep on somewhat firm mattresses at home but these were way too hard. You know it's bad when the kids are fighting over the pullout sofa bed because it is (by comparison) the most comfortable bed available. We finally went out and bought some air mattresses for the bigger teens to sleep on. Again, maybe we are just too picky! And yes, within 5 minutes of checking in, you will have a dozen pizza coupons under your door, which speaks of a lack of security. Did not eat at the Irish Pub so cannot comment. The convenience store is outrageously overpriced, almost to the point of being amusing, but not really. I guess it's like when you're at the airport - you're paying for having it on location. There is a WalMart right down the street, so shop there instead. The outlet \"mall\" is actually an open shopping center and was a nice diversion. Overall, I would not stay here again. We stayed at the Hilton Grand Vacation Club in March and loved it - much better service and more of a resort. They did not have availability but next year I will book early. In summary Pros : Great location for Disney and Seaworld, Universal was a bit further. Good space for families.

The rooms are great, we had the 3 bedroom suite which was ideal for our purpose: traveling with family for my brother's graduation. I would have given it 4 stars for the room which was immaculately clean, everything looked new, and had two jacuzzis. I would give it 1 star though for everything else. This is NOT a resort, so don't come to this property expecting hotel amenities. There is no room service, no daily cleaning, no bell hop to help with your luggage, not even vending machines so if you need a drink get ready to drive. I found the attitude OFFENSIVE to say the least. We arrived expecting a resort but were greeted by signs saying we would be charged for cleaning if we opted to have the apartment cleaned or the beds made, and that if we stole the coffee maker, towels, sheets (who steals sheets?), or blow dryer we would be charged. OBVIOUSLY if you steal something from any hotel room you will be charged for it, but to leave a sign in the room stating this matter is simply offensive. I wonder what kind of people stay in this place that they need to leave these nasty signs? Plus, to stay 3 nights and not even get access to clean towels if ridiculous. It would have been fine if they had notified us we were renting an apartment, not a resort. Internet: we stayed in a 3 bedroom apartment which fit 6 people. However, there was no wireless internet, only WIRED internet available for 1 computer at a time. Even worse than that: there was no cable in the room. When I called front desk the guy asked me bewildered if I didn't carry my own cable (No sir, we are living in the 21st century, everything is wireless). So then he told me they don't leave cables in the room because they might be stolen. Again with the stealing. I guess they are very paranoid with this issue, which is fine, but I don't need to know they think I'm a crook. They couldn't send the cable up, I had to go get it. There was NOTHING in the room. We arrived at 2am to find no water, no sodas, no crackers... nothing at all. And no vending machines or restaurants open in the area. So we had to drive out to buy stuff. Again, not a big deal if they had notified us it was not a resort but an apartment, then we could have arrived prepared with groceries, detergent and so forth. There is also a sign in the room (lots of signs in the room...) saying to not even bother asking for late check out.

The condos are spacious and the master bedrooms are very nice. However there are two distinct sets of building arrangements on the property. Two bldgs are on one side and they share a very small pool, have NO good view and look directly down on the Outlet Mall next door. That was disappointing. The other 3 are located around a very nice pool with pool bar. They are buildings 3, 4 5. The pool has a pirate ship in it with slide and a shallow end you can sit your chairs in. We rented two condos and they put one family in one section and us in another across the way. It was a hassle. We did rent from a private owner and not the resort directly. So I would be careful as I think this is pretty common. Whoever owns the condo is looking to fill it and I am not sure the needs of the renters are their priority. Building #1 and #2 are the lesser bldgs across the street from the good pool. They do have a pool and hot tub but they are really tiny. Staff at front desk seemed not that organized and I agree with previous reviews that keys seem to stop working. We replaced ours at least twice. No ID required which I found a little worrisome frankly. Good Irish bar on premises and a great pool bar with a good bartender Bob. We drove to the parks everyday as we had a rental car. Heard the bus shuttle was booked most days and has a very limited schedule. Parks are no more than 10 min away and easy to find. Restaurants around and good shopping but mostly chain dining.

The holiday was organised by a local travel agent and I paid in full before the holiday and received my bed vouchers which guaranteed our beds. I want to say more about what happened when we returned but I would echo what others have said about the staff being hard to find and not particularly helpful. Specifically we arrived at midnight - after 24 hours of travelling and a bad experience in the bus from the Airport in that the driver could not find Lake Buena Visa Resort and Spa. It took an extra hour to eventually get to our destination. After booking in, presenting our bed vouchers and my debit card details being taken we were directed to another building and in the pouring rain found what we thought was the correct room. The electronic key failed to open the bedroom door. After a very indifferent security woman (only staff available at night are security and one man on the desk) also failed to get in we were allocated another room. This took another hour. No apology but by default or design we were given an upgrade. The general standard of the furnishings and the equipment, TVs, washing machine is high. If you do not have a car buying food is not that easy \u2013 there is no public transport system and the Wall-mart is a 20 minute and somewhat dangerous walk away. Some four months after we returned I received a series of automated phone calls from Nationwide Building Society saying I was \u00a31200 overdrawn. I do not use my Nationwide account much and I thought my card must have been cloned. I discovered, however, that it was Lake Buena Vista who had, without any reference to me, debited my card three times on the 26th February. Eventually, after numerous phone calls (including over an hour to Lake Buena Vista hanging on and being passed from one person to another and being told to ring back) I was told that while Lake Buena Vista knew I had paid for my holiday a company who I now know as \u201cWelcome USA\u201d who are based in America and are agents for a company called Bedbank had not paid (though Welcome dispute this) so Lake Buena Vista had decided they needed their money and had simply made three (why three?) deductions from my card. They hoped this was not \u201cinconvenient\u201d. No; not inconvenient for me to pay again for my holiday (except I hadn\u2019t because the accommodation charge for my holiday was \u00a3459 and Lake Buena Vista debited more than double at \u00a31,195.01), not out of way for me to make long distance phone calls to find out why they treated me this way and a veritable pleasure to pay Nationwide charges on an unauthorised overdraft. My advice; any management that treats their customers in this discreditable way does not deserve custom \u2013 stay somewhere else. Do not expect Nationwide Building Society to protect your interest (my overdraft was \u00a350 - 24 times less than the amount they allowed to leave my account).

As a matter of fact, everyone that we encountered there - from the maids to the front desk to the workers straightening up at the pool - were all very friendly and helpful!

We were not looking for umbrellas yet! There was plenty to do in the area. Many restaurants, etc. We took a cab to CityWalk because we were planning on having a few! It was a bit expensive ($28/one way without tip). If I had to post any cons: As other posters have said, there was not enough toilet paper in the bathroom, but we found a maid in the hallway and she was happy to give us more. They could buy a little better quality towels at the pool, but they were typical of most resorts. The times for the shuttles are a little \"weird\". I suppose if you have really little kids it would be useful, but, for example, the shuttle to Universal only departed one time in the morning and then the return was at 7:15pm. Even if I had brought my teenage kids, this wouldn't have worked for us.

Hotel shuttle Buses to disney ran at 820 and 1120 pick up 615 and 845 seaworld at 940 pick up at 745 universal/islands of adventure 940 pick up at 715 don't be fooled, alot of guests who had stayed at a disney property thought transport was continous. you have to be organized and decide the day before. you have to book with reception day before. when you board the shuttle you have to tell the driver what time pick up you want. you need to get a timetable from reception when you arrive. HAVE A PLAN!!! disney drops off and picks up at epcot only as its the closest park to entrance of disney world. you get buses or monorail to all other hotels parks, waterparks or downtown disney from here. you may have to get 2 buses to hotels or downtown disney but everything in disneyworld is connected by this free transport, if in doubt ask at the information window in bus park or one of the disney bus drivers- they always know how to get everywhere. shuttle pick up does not allow for firework viewing, so you may have to get a cab, if so there are always yellow cabs waiting outside all the parks waterparks downtown disney. one bit of advice i'd give is to get a disney bus back to epcot if possible n get a cab from there it was only usually around 14 dollars to the hotel from epcot. from seaworld a cab was about 24 dollars. we tipped the shuttle drivers a dollar per person in our group and were polite to them (alot of people really were rude ) and we usually got on the buses first, and were treated really well, especially when it got busy at half term and there were lots of people waiting- treat people nice n you get rewarded!! this is our third non driving visit to orlando and we love it. its great not to have the stress of driving abroad. if that's your thing- good for you, but we found that we didn't spend more than around 250 dollars in 3 weeks on cabs, and we went to walmart, target, florida mall, we got cabs home from parks when we were exhausted or had stayed for fireworks or if we changed our plans or had missed the shuttle. If we had taken advantage of the so- called free car hire included in our package, insurance would have been approx \u00a3300 anyway so we saved money. taxis are plentiful and everywhere and if you just use the one guy for all your trip you can negotiate prices too. one word of warning-only had one bad experience with a cab driver who pretended not to know where resort was. keep a note in your purse of resort's address then there are no problems. another piece of advice i would give non drivers is get a free map of orlando (or look online)and look at the places where you want to go and see if you can take advantage of the free buses eg we went shopping on i drive and we got free hotel shuttle to seaworld and i drive trolley bus (approx a dollar each kids free,) to the places on i drive. you can get to wet and wild this way. to get to aquatica get free shuttle to seaworld then a seaworld free bus comes and takes you to aquatica. i used to brits guide to orlando when planning all my trips to disney as it tells you what days to avoid parks and has maps and tips. i always make a plan beforehand of what we're gonna do when, that way we can just go with it when we get there, i know that sounds a bit mad but orlando can be a daunting place, even to a repeat visitor, esp if you're travelling with kids like we were. one final bit of random advice if you want to do the new toy story midway mania at hollywood studios is be at the park when it opens leave hubby n the kids on a bench and race down to fastpass as they run out quick!! there were people running just to get to fastpass and there was a 20 minute wait in line just for fastpass. it was heartbreaking to see little kids crying when there were no fastpass left (about 2 hours after park opens) and the standby line was 180 minutes!!! we waited 25 mins even with fastpass!!!! we were one of the first to do american idol as it opened while we were there and we loved it. it's cheesey but fun and the warm up guy is really funny. i am more than happy to give advice to anyone planning a trip. ps will end with a word of warning. under no circumstances visit hotel shop, half the stuff in there is not priced and i think they just think of a bizarre number of dollars when you pay. we paid 37 dollars for bread, butter, water and diet coke on our first night there. would rather walk on my hands all the way to walmart and i'm no acrobat!!!", "Date": "March 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "4", "Value": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "NJ", "Title": "\u201cNice room, Great Value\u201d", "Author": "NjEve", "ReviewID": "UR25535323", "Content": "We stayed feb 12-18 and I would recommend it for large families. we had a 3 bed/2bath with a full kitchen.

Our holiday was brilliant, I would recommend this resort to others and would love to go back again. Only downsides are the prices in the resort shop, some difficulty parking late at night and perhaps the differing quality in standards of accommodation throughout the resort. We had a two bedroom apartment, which was huge, very comfortable and well equipped. The jacuzzi in the master bedroom was great after a day walking around Disney, and I had no issues with the water pressure in the shower. Most of our stay was in an eleventh floor apartment in Building 5 (built most recently), with a great view of the pirate pool. However, our first night was spent in Building 2, and we had to be moved due to a problem with the air conditioning. I have to say that this building seemed much older and a bit scruffier. I have no doubt we would still have enjoyed our stay had we spent our entire holiday there, but Building 5 was far superior and my review and rating is based on our the standard in that building. We found the staff polite and helpful throughout our stay, but they were unobtrusive, allowing us to feel very independent. We intended to use the cleaning service, which is reasonably priced, on one occasion but the hours didn't suit us and in the end we just made use of the washer dryer for the bedding and kept the apartment clean ourselves. I didn't get a chance to use the spa, but they had some well priced treatments on offer. The pool is lovely, and was well used during our stay. The neighbouring outlet stores are nothing special - okay if you want to see some shops without getting in the car, but the food court didn't look very attractive. We really liked both the food options at the resort. The Pizza Hut takeaway was very good, and Frankie Farrell's was great. Both were quite expensive compared to some of the very cheap food available in Orlando, but comparable to the price you would pay in the UK. Frankie Farrell's have a kid's menu (huge portions) & offer a smaller room service menu until 11pm. The resort shop is to be avoided - the prices are extortionate. My husband went to get some basics on our arrival, and was scarred by the experience! Most notable was the $19.99 price tag for a bottle of wine that we found for less than $6 elsewhere. There is a Wal Mart very nearby (turn left on leaving the hotel and it is around 2 blocks drive on highway 535 at Poinciana Boulevard. There is also a well stocked 7/11 two blocks in the other direction at the corner of World Centre Drive, which is handy for essential shopping on the way back from Disney. Get good driving directions before you set off from the airport - we got very lost, and I find that Orlando's maps and roads don't really match up! Once I got my bearings I found the location very good. Here are some directions which I would have found very helpful before I went (don't read on if you're easily bored!) Turn right on leaving the hotel, drive for a couple of blocks and take a left on to World Centre Drive. This route gets you to the Disney parks in 5 to 10 minutes. A right turn at the same junction takes you on to international drive. From here it takes around 20 minutes to get the busy section of International drive, and about 30 minutes to Universal. There are lots of restaurants at Lake Buena Vista - continue on 535 past World Centre Drive for a few blocks - there are clusters of restaurants and shops on the right hand side, and the turn off for Downtown Disney is on the left. Highway 192/Kissimmee is easily reached in about 5 minutes - turn left on leaving and then turn right onto either Poinciana Boulevard or Polynesian something or other. Highway 192 is lined with huge restaurants, diners and shops, and will also take you to Disney.

The resort is located behind the Lake Buena Vista Outlet Mall which is very nice. All theme parks, downtown Disney, Wal-Mart, restaurants and gas stations are all within a 10 minutes drive. The resort has a daily schedule shuttle service for most of the theme parks but only to EPCOT for the Disney parks. What you see in the pictures is what you get. The place appears to be fairly new construction. Everything was clean and well kept. The property is very big. There are four apartment buildings and two large pools. The pools are great. The pirate ship in the main pool is very nice and very fun for the kids. Pool and Jacuzzi areas were very clean. There is a restaurant bar at the main pirate ship pool with great service. As I opened the apartment door, my first impression was a good one. The apartment was large enough to accommodate the whole family. There are two bedrooms with king size beds, a third bedroom with 2 twin beds and a full size sleeping sofa. The master bedroom has a large bathroom with a Jacuzzi and there is a 2nd bathroom next to the other two bedrooms. Apartment amenities include a fully equipped kitchen with granite top and anything you would need if you desire to cook. A blender, a coffee maker, etc, etc, etc. you get the idea.

After reading the reviews, I was really excited about our trip. Upon arriving, the hotel looked great from the outside as well as the lobby. I realize now it was because the building that the lobby is in was just recently finished unlike buildings 1 and 2. I read a few reviews where travelers received a fireworks view, so when I checked in, I requested one. I was told that since I booked through Hotwire, I was not able to receive the special view. I also realize now that since I booked with Hotwire I probably got a older, dirtier room. So after we checked in, I already wasn't feeling so great about our stay. Our room was in building 2, like I said earlier, this building is one of the older buildings, but it's only 2-3 years old. By looking at the carpet and furinture, it seemed as if the building was at least 8-10 years old. The carpet was worn and stained. The couch was not in good shape either. The tile throughout the condo was dirty and didn't looked like it had been mopped recently. I was not happy to find hair on the shower walls and the shower floor dirty. Don't look at the A/C vents or A/C return - you'll just get grossed out. They haven't been cleaned in a little while. Also, don't get excited about the \"big screen TV\". It's the older type that you have to be seated directly in front of to see anything. If you are getting a condo with twin beds, you might want to know that they aren't big enough for the average size adult. I'm 5 feet 2 inches and my feet just about touched the bottom of the bed. When we first arrived, I went to put bottled water in the refrigerator and found water in the crisper bins and on the shelves. I called the front desk and they told me that they would have maintenance stop by. After waiting 45 mins, we left for Disney. When we got back after 11 that night, we expected to see a note from maintenance regarding the refrigerator. I called the front desk and he couldn't find any notes about the call. He told me someone could come up. At this point we are very tired from walking through Disney and now we have to stay up and wait for maintenance to fix the refrigerator. He came by close to midnight and fixed the issue. I considered seeing if the front desk would give me a different room that was a little cleaner and maybe a little newer, but after my experience with the unfriendly clerk at check-in, I decided to not waste my time since I probably wouldn't have helped anyway. Remember, I booked through Hotwire, which meant I didn't really matter. All in all, the condo was okay. It certainly was okay for the price I paid on Hotwire, but I wouldn't pay the standard rates for the condo I received. It was okay to sleep and shower (hair and all), but we really weren't in the condo much more than that. I just can't seem to understand the condition of the condos for only being 2-3 years old. Maybe they simply aren't maintained properly. Alot of my issues could have been avoided if housekeeping did a more thorough job cleaning the condo before my arrival.", "Date": "January 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stockport, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat Accommodation but a couple of things you need to be aware of\u201d", "Author": "joetopps", "ReviewID": "UR23082142", "Content": "We stayed here for 16 nights from 6th to 22nd December 08.

There were 5 adults in the party and the apartment was fantastic, the washer and dryer were a real god send and meant virtually no washing to be done when we arrived home. This is great accommodation for families of all ages and is close to all the parks. Now a few pointers for you: 1} The Irish Bar (not part of the hotel) is expensive and the prices aren't helped by the fact that they decide whether they have given good service or not and automatically add 15% tip to every bill (even if they just pull you a pint.!!) I may be the odd one out here but I like to think the size of a tip (if any) should be down to the customer. If paying by card they even leave a line for additional gratuity.... the cheek of it. 2} If you need a cab do not order one from reception, they clearly receive back handers and order cars from a limo company, they do not order metered cabs. Walk across to the mall you can always get a metered cab there. Example downtown disney with car ordered at reception $20 plus tip, same journey in a metered cab $13 plus tip. Very disappointing when hotel staff take advantage in this way and leaves a bit of a bad taste. 3} As with most places the on site Shop isn't cheap, Walmart is a 5 to 10 minute walk up the road.

This is the third time we've stayed on the property and each time we've been happy with the stay. The rooms are actually like a condo and not a hotel and include kitchen, dining area, living room along with the bedrooms and baths. If you visit the sites website, you can pull up actual floor plans. We took my son and our 5 grandchildren to Orlando for a one night stay and stayed in the St. Lucia 3 bedroom, 3 bath model. This model has two large king bed master suites, with jetted tubs, and separate showers. The third bedroom has two twin beds - but the beds were pretty small. They easily fit the kids, but my 28 year old son's feet would not fit on the bed. He opted for the sofa bed in the living room. He survived, but the mattress in the sofa bed was pretty marginal. The mattresses on the beds were fine and we all slept well. There were not enough extra pillows and blankets when we arrived - but they were delivered quickly after our call. The third bathroom was standard and is right next to the twin bedroom. Towels were soft and clean. Each bedroom had a TV and there was a big screen TV (not flat screen) in the living room. The condos are very nicely appointed, but do not expect luxury. I think the quaility is good - to very good. You get a very nice place for a very reasonable price. Building selection. We were in building 2 on the ground floor. If you are staying longer, I would recommend trying to get in a different building. #2 is older and right next to the shopping mall. We had a lovely view of the outlet mall parking lot from our patio. But - we didn't care one bit, because we really only used the room to sleep and have breakfast before going home the next day. I'd brought the breakfast things with us on check-in. But on our previous trip we shopped at the Wal-Mart and the Publix down the road.

The resort has five buildings and two pools; also there is a onsite restaurant that was very good and reasonable. Landscaping was good and they kept the place very clean.

You get all sorts of junk mail posted into your appartments Wifi, yes, however, you need to either pay BIG bucks to use theirs, or with our own laptop we had to pay $25 to 'loan' a connection line - for wifi in our appartment!! WHAT!!! Parking a disaster if they have a function there. When we were moved to the palacial sized 4 bed unit, we were thrilled. HOWEVER, it was actually quite daunting, when there were only 3 of us. My 5 yr old was scared of the 'other end'. It is designed so as 2 families could live togehter but far enough apart that they wouldn't be all over each other. Excellent, for large parties, but not for us little lot :-) Pics uploaded of the huge place/balcony, etc. the main NAG for me was the spa ....... I booked an appt for my daughter to have her hair cut. She is 5 and it was a real treat to have a cut and dry in a hotel spa/salon, etc. She enjoyed it, but I did NOT enjoy the attitude of the lady on Spa reception (who, as it turned out was actually the spa manager). She made it clear how 'inconvenient' it was to have a customer and she huffed and puffed on the phone to her friend about it and then to the stylist to get him from his break to meet with his next appt with us!! the spa was EMPTY, not one customer, why he needed a tea break? not sure!) I booked an appt for my 1st treatment (with intention of having 2 more) ... I changed the time (with the required notice) as 'we are on vacation' and weather/plans change, etc. I am not about to make excuses to some pumped up lady in a spa as to why I am changing my plans!! When I called to rebook a day or so later, she made a point of mentioning 'she remembered me, I had cancelled on her!!' and also that I would need to be sure of my plans this time as it is inconvenient for them, etc. and they get busy .......... WHEN? Everytime I entered that spa there was noone there and I mean ..... most times I wandered around on my own and didn't see even a staff member! SUmmary, she is rude, not the standard I would expect from a 'resort spa' and quite frankly I am not surprised that it has no clients. I NEVER DID rebook a treatment with them. They lost out on $350 worth of treatments there!!", "Date": "November 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Staffordshire", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Fantastic Fantastic!\u201d", "Author": "annie2156", "ReviewID": "UR21703095", "Content": "Stayed here for 2 weeks in August.

There is also a game room with pool tables and a little grocery store with lots of good selection. We cooked one night and that was the best after a long day at the parks. The Irish Pub that is part of the hotel is very nice (but over priced again). There is no housekeeping unless you pay a fee of about $18-40 depending on how much cleaning you want done. There is a washer/dryer in each unit which was great! There is a free shuttle to the parks but they only run 1-3 times in the morning and evening depending on which park it is (there is only one shuttle to Sea World in the morning and one that returns at night and a few for Disney) - and you have to make reservations ahead of time to use the shuttle - first come first serve.

The master bedroom was huge with large drawers, TV, king bed, huge spa bath, separate shower, sink, and separate toilet. The second bedroom had two beds that appeared to be doubles - my two large teenagers appreciated that and having their own TV. The second bathroom had shower over the bath, sink and toilet - all very nice. The kitchen was well equipped with full stove/oven, huge micromave and fridge, dishwasher and to the side a very large washer and dryer. The living area had a sofa, two arm chairs, side tables/lamps, flat screen tv and dining table with six chairs. We were in building 5 and our room on level 7 overlooked the new pirate ship pool facilities but was next to the building that housed the lobby. The room and buildings all appeared to be new and were in excellent condition. We checked in at 10pm at night and the clerk was very nice. All of the staff were nice the entire stay and we talked to them every day to put our names down for the free shuttles to the various parks. Nothing was too much trouble. The shuttles leave at set times every day and pick up at set times so Disney parks 8.20am and come back 6.15pm or 8.45pm. Universal/Seaworld leave later 9.20 I think from memory and come back 6.45pm. All free with small tip daily. We used the shuttles nearly every day and they saved us a fortune. Occasionally we caught taxi back - cost $17 including tip from Disney Epcot and from Seaworld about $35 with tip. Resort is next to the Lake Buena vista shops - right next door so that was fabulous as could get all shopping there. We did catch taxi to Florida mall which is a big place $35 each way but found that the factory shops had most of what we were looking for. Walmart costs about $7 including tip by taxi and has all the supplies you could need including groceries so went there several times. You can use the shuttle service but that is a fixed rate of $8 plus tip. We walked to factory shops and got taxis from there. There is no housekeeping but that didn't worry us as we were out a lot during the day and we are reasonably tidy family. If you want housekeeping you can book a light clean for $15 or a full clean for $30. The pirate pool complex is wonderful and very relaxing.

The apartment was very spacious and had 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms and was equipped with everything we needed including a jacuzzi and walk in shower in the main bedroom. It was great to have your own laundry facilities and also nice to have 3 separate bedrooms especially for our older children. We were only in the apartment for 10 days so we went without the extra cleaning but it seemed a reasonable price to pay if needed. The apartments also have free internet and all you need is the extra connection lead which you can borrow from the reception desk. The parking is a little limited depending on what time you return to your apartment but we always found a parking space. We used the small supermarket which was reasonable priced as well as the Irish pub which had decent food and friendly staff. We did not use the pool as it was small and very crowded sometimes and seemed to be situated in the wrong place and out of the sun most of the time, which would be our only criticism but there is new pool built and has now opened just after we left so this should solve this major problem. The complex is in an excellent location to get to Disney, Universal and Sea World as well as Aquatica Water Park. Also the Lake Buena Vista Outlet Mall is next door which was very useful, it is also close to a Walmart and other stores on the 535 as well as being close to Kissimmee on the 192.

This was our fourth visit to Orlando in the last five years and we could compare our stay to our holidays in a villa with pool, in resort at the Portofino Bay Hotel and at the Crowne Plaza. The blocks are impressive from the outside and the complex is very well located. Check in was quick, easy & friendly and we were allocated to Building 5. Our room on the fifth floor was virtually brand new and when we walked in we all smiled - until we looked over the balcony and saw the cement mixers, cranes and other construction materials surrounding the unfinished Pirates pool. Our friends had already arrived in the resort earlier in the week and when we contacted them to say we'd arrived and which room we were in, they let us know that they had been allocated to the exact same room on arrival and had complained on the second morning because of the construction work going at all hours (our friend has video footage of work being done at 4am!!). We asked to be moved but were told that there were no other rooms available because it was the weekend and the hotel was at full capacity. Other guests who had checked in at the same time as us and who had been allocated to the same building had been a bit quicker and were moved straight away so it wasn't that we were being overly picky. We were given an alternative room overlooking the smaller pool the following evening. Our second condo in building 2 was not as new but it was clean and tidy. Everything was in working order and there was everything we needed. There was a lively buzz of children playing at the pool each day which is exactly what we expected but what was less pleasant was the noise from the pool in the middle of the night (3am!) on a couple of occasions from adults. The pool was very small and the Pirate Pool was far from finished on our arrival - though closer to completion when we left! We found some good places to eat close by (five minutes or less in the car) including Perkins for breakfast, Red Lobster (our favourite this time), Chilis, Lone Star and Pizzeria Uno for dinner. A tiny bit further afield we enjoyed Tony Roma's and The Outback. What did we like best? The location, being able to do the washing & drying (sad but necessary with two teenagers!), approachable & professional staff. What did we like least? the unfinished Pirates Pool.

The irish pub is well worth a visit too, the food is lovely and the staff are really friendly with a great atmosphere.

Don't let me forget, it had a balcony too! This place was awesome, we had four adults and four children occupying this condo and it was well worth it. There was plenty of room, we never felt as if we were disturbing anyone with our noise and no one ever disturbed us. Each room had a TV, the master rooms had a big hot tub in it, plus separate shower area and a dual sink, it worked great. The complex is spread out, but we were in building 1 (where the bar is at) and up on the 7th floor and never had any problems with our room. Our views were of the LBV Outlet Mall and was not bad. The building was secured by having the doors lock after 10p, although we noticed after a couple of days that it was changed for all day. The only way to get into the building was with your room key. The elevators were a bit slow, since it only had two and plenty of people moving in and out of them, especially when checking in or out. The biggest problem we had was after coming back in the evenings after being at the parks all day, we were always struggling to find parking in the 'safe' areas. There was always plenty of parking in the back of the building which was on the same side as the LBV Outlet Stores, but you were looking at the rear of the outlet stores and there was no entry from the back of the building to get to the elevators, you had to walk around and wasn't always lit up very well to feel too comfortable. The other disappointment was the pool. We read everything that said the big pool would be opened by end of May 2008 and we were there the 2nd week of June and still not complete. It didn't really matter as we hit the beach, SeaWorld and all the Disney World parks during our stay so there was never really a chance to take a dip anyway. We will definitely return if the prices remain the same. It is conveniently located near shopping areas, to include Walmart and Target for groceries, plus it is right down the road from Disney.

I am not used to reserving a room this way so was a little anxious about not seeing the room in person before booking for such a long stay. WE WERE NOT DISAPPOINTED!

There were plenty of towels and tissues/toilet paper etc. However there was washer/dryer. We had planned on going to one or two theme parks but only ended up going to one because we preferred to just \"chill\" in the room because we were so comfortable. The pool area was a little small with not quite enough lounge chairs. However, they are in the process of building a HUGE new pool area.

We found the 'resort' to be just average - there were both positives and negatives. The 'resort' (if you can call it that) is located within a short driving distance of Disney and the International Drive area. You really do need a car if you stay here, as the only thing really within walking distance are the factory shops next-door. Our apartment was located in building 2 (one of the older buildings, although I believe only a couple of years old). I will start with the good points....... It was spacious - especially the master bedroom/bathroom. The wardrobes are a good size. There is a large safe. 3 TV's. Large fridge. Good location. Balcony (although it overlooked a building site and busy road). And the bad points........ The tiled floors were very dirty when we 'moved in'. Although the kitchen has a large oven, we were unable to use it because there were no ovenproof dishes or baking trays. The general finish of the apartments is below average - the drawers didn't close properly and kept getting jammed, some lightbulbs did not work, the sealant around the shower was missing. The TV made a very loud constant humming noise - even when turned off! We couldn't unplug the TV to get rid of the noise, because the plug was directly behind it (and the TV is far to big to move). The air conditioning was so so noisy (the noisiest we've ever heard). Also, the noise from other apartments was very easy to hear, as the walls and ceilings are so thin. When the people above us had the jacuzzi bath on, it was very loud in our bedroom. One evening, one of our neighbours could be clearly heard being sick in their toilet - not very nice when you are trying to relax in the evening. The bedrooms didn't have curtains (only venetian blinds) which meant you woke up when the sun did. That's if you weren't already awake by the sound of the lawnmowers - which started at 7.30 am!! The swimming pool is tiny (maybe 10 metres long) and it was unheated when we were there. As the pool is situated between 2 high rise buildings, it is often in the shade, and therefore was ICY cold. The rubbish chutes were locked off - this meant us having 12 days worth of rubbish in our apartment - despite calling reception to collect it (they never did). And to top it off, our car was badly scratched one night, in the car park (this was not caused by another car, but by a person or object) - luckily our insurance covered the damage. No security - anyone could have walked up to our apartment door, or go in the pool. We did not use the spa or restaurant facilities. We tried to buy stamps from the resort - but this seemed impossible. reception didn't sell stamps, and the on-site store had a broken stamp machine. Taking everything into consideration, I think we will probably go back to the Sheraton Vistana Villages next time - the service is way better and the swimming pool and general surroundings are much nicer there. We only stayed here as it was slightly less expensive - but I think at the end of the day you get wat you pay for.", "Date": "June 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Georgia", "Title": "\u201cVery Elegant\u201d", "Author": "Jurzgurl19", "ReviewID": "UR16500522", "Content": "The condo was beautiful!

Kitchens with every possible convenience and tableware and chairs for 6. Controllable air conditioning. Washer/Dryer Negatives The suites are only serviced when empty unless you pay for a full ($30) or a basic ($15) service. We were given 7 sets of towels however. Some of the cleaning staff did not speak English. Our suite was starting to look a little shabby despite it being pretty new. E.g. Furniture is clearly pretty low quality since there is peeling veneer on bedside cabinets and some drawers cannot be easily opened and closed. There were screw holes on the wall where something had been removed. There are no mattress covers on the beds just a bottom sheet (yuck!) Pillows were thin. Bathroom/toilet room fans are very noisy. Master shower pressure was the lowest I have ever had in America. The pool gets minimum sun and when we were there appeared to have little heating. The new pool/pirate ship was advertised as opening in May on the resorts website, as at 17 May 2008 there was piping and conduit, but no tile or paving - and no builders at work....The expected opening date has since been revised to June 2008 which will remain to be seen! Convenience store was expensive. Avoid rooms in Building One and Two that overlook the Outlet Mall, the row of dumpsters are emptied early most mornings - you will hear them. Although there is plenty of parking at the rear of Buildings one and Two, there is no entrance to the suites, so you will have to walk around the front to gain access Avoid rooms 1203/1303 and upwards since these not only look over the mall but also overlook the air conditioning systems and kitchen outlet to the pub. During our stay a routine clean of the kitchen outlet grease trap was carried out at midnight. Three maintenance men equiped with a searchlight took an hour and a half to complete the job the problem being that they were only 4 foot away from the bedroom window . We did of course complain about the disruption but were told they could only carry out the clean whilst the kitchen was closed hence the advice to avoid room 1203. To sum up I suspect I paid a lot less than similar suites in Orlando, the room had every convenience, but often the niggles outweighed the benefits. I would have preferred a few less facilities, the room be less noisy, have better finish, be serviced daily and have a better pool. Would I return?

We felt that it would be more secure if you were required to use your room card to gain access to the building. As it is currently set up, anyone off the street can walk into the resort buildings and pool area. Depending on how you feel about security, this may be somewhat of a minor complaint. We were very happy with our stay and found it to be nice and quiet. We stayed in building 5 on the 14th floor with great views of the nightly fireworks at Disney. The resort is located very close to all the Disney parks as well as a Wal Mart SuperCenter just 2 minutes down the road. We found this great for stocking up on groceries. As a side note, we rented our vehicle with Budget Car Rental at the Orlando airport and everthing was handled smoothly. We recommend that you enroll in the Budget RapidRez Program before you go.

Having said all that - this resort was comfortable, in a good location and the price was great. However, we did not receive any of the special requests that we had emailed and called ahead for - top floor, end unit (due to being late sleepers) - and the front desk staff was not accomodating - period! We experienced several bouts of power surging - this would occur at all hours - I was awakened several times throughout the night by the surges as the alarm clock buzzed - after the first night I just unplugged it. Overall it is an average hotel - view was of the parking lot - building 5, eighth floor (right next to the elevator! - do much for requesting an end unit!!!). I personnally will not stay here again - I would much rather pay another $50 per night and stay in luxury and a gated hotel. During our stay we had several pizza and chinese restaurant menus tucked under our door - therefore people are allowed to roam freely. The pool was a joke - just one small pool for 5 buildings!!! Although a larger, themed pool is in the process of being built - no construction while we were there however!

Convenient for Disney - our tip for navigating back to the complex is to always follow the signs for Downtown Disney until you get to the road which takes you to I-4 and SR535. If you try to follow a map you'll probably get lost! Not too far to Universal parks either. Definitely do not use the convenience store on site - we referred to it as the inconvenience store.

The walmart supercentre is so close - turn left out of the site, turn right at the next set of lights, head over to the left lane and turn left into a shopping area - Walmart is at the rear. and there's a Western Union just round the back for stamps - airmail is 90cents.

Nearly everything in our apartment was great - fantastic supply of towels and pretty much all you could want for a nice relaxing place to unwind. But don't expect to do much cooking - though there's a nice cooker and dishwasher, there's a lack of utensils / pots & pans / baking trays so you are kind of expected to eat out - or buy what you need at Walmarts!

Overall, our family of two adults and two small children enjoyed the modern two-bedroom, two-bath suite during our four-night stay. Things like the marble countertops, terrace, and comfortable furnishings really added to the experience. HOWEVER, there were problems in the details that might suggest that there could be trouble looming for this brand new property. We had lights that didn't work and lamps with missing bulbs. One of the toilets didn't flush properly the whole time we were there and clogged completely the day we left. There wasn't nearly enough hot water for the spa tub (very frustrating!). The Internet, provided through a cable in the living room, was totally unreliable. It was slow or didn't work at all (and the problem was not our computer, as our next hotel showed).

She had to be bathed in the spa tub, instead. Also, no dish soap was provided. We have stayed at suites like this in the past and they always provide dish soap and often detergent for the dishwasher. I don't mind buying it, but I also don't like having dirty dishes sitting around the first night I arrive. To be fair, we didn't bother complaining about any of these things during our stay, so I can't say how the staff would have responded. I did find the staff to be extremely helpful the one time I did need them, but in general, you don't get the impression that it's a full-service, customer-care type of place, like you would in a regular hotel. Again, we had a pleasant stay. And for about the same amount of money we could have been crammed into a single tiny room at Disney's Pop Century about a mile or two away, so I'd probably stay here again. But if they're having these kind of problems now, what's this place going to be like in a couple of years?", "Date": "March 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cLake Buena Vista Resort Village Resort and Spa\u201d", "Author": "SplashNottm", "ReviewID": "UR14631021", "Content": "Lake Buena Vista Resort and Spa was absolutely fantastic, we holiday as a family or with groups of friends nearly every year and often stay in houses along the US27. I have to say we will never stay in a house again. These apartments are ideally located within 5 minutes drive of Disney and 7 minutes from Seaworld. You spend minimal time driving to get to attractions ( sitting in traffic on the 192 or I4 as you would with a house). We stayed in a 3 bed condo, which had excellent facilties, were spacious and well equipped. Plasma TV in the living room, jacuzzi in main SuperKingsize bedroom which was massive!! Another king size room and twin room located at the opposite end of the apartment, so great if you were a family as parents and kids room could be next door with friends feeling like they had their own space, Plus with tvs in each room they weren't woken by the kids early in the mornings!! Only disappointment would be the pool, which given the size of the complex was extremely small. Not a problem for us as we had annual waterpark passes, but I imagine would not be ideal if on a two week vacation and you wanted chill out lazy days by your pool, only must improve for me. Location right next to a shopping mall is great for those of you who like to shop!! Reebok, Gap, Tommy Hilfigger, Nike etc. Whilst there is an Irish pub serving food breakfast lunch and dinner, you have to drive to restaurants, although this might improve over time as more developments underway. Check in was seamless even though young was training and all staff were courteous and helpful. People didn't like keeping the apartment clean but if you're used to renting houses, not a problem.

We also liked the fact it had a free shuttle to Disneyworld and Universal/Seaworld. We were told that there would be a wheelchair shuttle available for us everyday. The shuttle company that LBV uses never had a wheelchair van available for us. In fact they don't even own one! The staff at the hotel and the drivers of the shuttle did not care at all. We ended up folding my nieces wheelchair up every time and my brother-in-law lifted her up into a seat. She is 20 years old so you can imagine that this was not easy. If we had caught a wheelchair taxi it would have cost us at least $40 a day. We know this because we caught a taxi a few times because the shuttle times are also inconvenient.. They only go to Disneyworld at 8:20 or 11:20 and pick up is at 8:45 (before the fireworks!). The shuttles usually were not on time and they would have one van come to the hotel first to see how many people were waiting and then they would call for more. So much for getting to the parks early. The vans can only hold about 13 and there were times that they had 14 or 15 people inside. Even if they weren't over filled they never had enough seat belts because they were broken or not even available. This put a definite damper on our view of this hotel but the staff could have tried to fix this for us. Oh and don't let me forget about the fact there is no spa at the hotel either.

Check in was efficient and friendly, and the condo - wow. So much space, very clean and obviously new. Only slight problem was that the condo smelt strongly of smoke - and the whole resort is supposed to be non-smoking. I did report this to reception who said that they would get somekind of machine to \"de-contaminate\" the condo, which didnt arrive, but a can of air freshener later and I hardly noticed. The fittings are good quality, but be aware there are no curtains only blinds in the bedrooms, so if you need to sleep in the the dark take eyeshades! There were loads of towels and toilet rolls and soap for the dishwasher to get you started. It was Presidents week when we visited so the start of our holiday was quite busy. As the pool is very small it did get a little busy, but the new on eis due to open next month and should be great. We did visit Frankie Farrells on two occasions. Both times the food was OK and cetainly ideal if you can't be bothered to go further afield after a hard day at the parks. My only issue was the apparent lack of security. There is no main gate that you eneter to get into the resort and the buildings are not accessed using keys. Meaning that anyone can get up to the door of your condo without challenge. My husband was not at all bothered by this, but having seen other resorts with gated entrances and security staff I personally felt a little exposed. However, we have been burgled on a previous holiday (no here) and so security is something that I now consider important. The acid test is would I go back? Definately.

Check-in was quick and the crib we requested was delivered quickly to the room. The condo itself was a 3 bedroom 2 bath unit and was very nice. Several features of the condo made it superior to a number of others we've stayed in. First, the dining table was larger and could seat more people that most. Second, instead of the usually 8 place settings this kitchen had 12-16 - better for large families. Also, the kitchen had more drinking glasses than we were used to. The master bedroom had an over-sized California king. The second bedroom is listed as a queen, but my husband and I both believe it to be a normal-sized king - it was the same size as our king bed at home. The third bedroom where our children slept was very roomy - lots of area for them to spread out their toys. Like many condo hotels, this one has a convenience store on the property. Unlike most others, this one was really a mini grocery store and had almost anything you'd need to prepare quick meals in your condo. We also liked the on-property restaurant - an Irish Pub.

Also, the hotel adjoins an outlet mall - the Lake Buena Vista Factory Stores.

My husband happened to call two days before our stay and the resort no longer had the reservation for one of our condos and stated that we had booked this room for Jan 1-2. The employee on the phone was somewhat rude and reluctant to help us. However, we still had our confirmation email with the dates we had booked and the resort was eventually helpful. We had to bring our credit card statement to prove that the room was already booked and paid for. Regardless, when we arrived at the resort, they had our rooms. Half of our group arrived a day after the rest of us. We had requested the rooms be on the same floor but when they arrived they were told there were no more rooms on our floor and had the staff known earlier they could have accomodated us. ???

You can't beat the price, $150/night for a 2 bedroom condo. The Irish pub at the resort stated it had breakfast starting at 7am, however, when we arrived at 8:30 there was no one in the place and the waitress had to be fetched from upstairs. The staff trickled in as we were eating and began sweeping and mopping the floors. The food was ok, however, it took at least 45 minutes for us to get it.

At least it was free internet, unlike Disney at $10/day. Our AC didn't work, it took 4 attempts to reach someone at the front desk before they answered. I told them about the problem and assured me that it would be fixed that night... That was about 4pm in the afternoon... It is now 8am the next morning they still haven't shown and it's still rather humid in here, even after the night. I am feeling a bit frustrated at the moment. We typically rent a home for our family, but this time it was just my husband and I, so we wanted something \"special\" and this isn't it. The large screen TV is nice, but our DVD player won't connect (there isn't one provided, so we brought our own).

My family rented a 2 bed/2 bath condo. The rates at this hotel were more reasonable than the Hilton Resort where our family normally stays, but the reasons for the affordability became evident (keep reading). My primary reason for choosing this resort/condo was that is was new , the price was reasonable, and it's convenient to the Disney theme parks. I've passed by the hotel/condo on a previous visit to Orlando. The outlet mall next door to the resort was also a plus, however it is small compared to most outlets. What didn't I like about the hotel? First the walls were thin and there were no darkening window treaments in the bedroom, so if you are a light sleeper this could be a problem. Secondly, you must pay extra for cleaning, which means the sheers are not changed, no new towels, no trash pickp-up unless you pay an additional fee .... not a major problem for a short visit. I ended up washing my own towels since there is a washer/dryer in the unit. Continuing with the negatives, the air conditioner unit was LOUD and the shower and tub leaked in both bathrooms (also some evidence of mildew), another traveler mentioned the mildew and leaks also. The units should be clearner since this is a new hotel. The impact of non-inclusive dailiy room cleaning is already starting to show. Oh I almost forget, the fridge was not positioned well, everytime we opend the door it slammed against the wall making a loud bang! If you don't plan on spending a lot of time in your hotel room, then the negatives may not be a big problem for you. If you are on a budget and need the space this is hotel maybe a good value. However if you are planning an extended trip, or will be spending time relaxing by the pool ( it was small compared to most), or if you are a clean freak you may want to consider spending a little more money and staying somewhere else. P.S. If you bring a laptop be sure to ask for a cable at the front desk. They do not keep them in the room and you have to sign a paper stating you will pay $25 if not returned at checkout.

Kitchen had new appliences ( stove/frig/micro/dishwasher/garbage disposal/coffee maker/4 slice toaster and all utensals to cook with. Kitchen was fully stocked with everthing you needed. Second bedroom had 2 double beds and closet as well as a new flat screen tv. The second bathroom had double sink as well and shower/toilet. Every room has a balcony with table and chairs and the A/C worked great. Lets not forget the washer and dryer in the room! That was a life saver! We had 5 people in the room and could have fit more! Did many loads of laundry. Chris at the front desk was very nice and fast to get us into are room ( three hours early!) The room was spotless on are arrival with plenty of towels. The room was almost brand new, and they are building plenty more. The construction did not bother us at all, very rarely did we hear them. There is a general store type place near the main office which has everything(pricey though). and an outlet mall behind the condo's.

Directions to Disney- right out of condo lot to red light , take left at that light and straight into Disney entrance . Universal studios is approx. 15/20 minutes away and easy to get to.(Right out of the condo's onto 535 and approx 5 minutes to route 4 east exit and 10 minutes on route 4 till the universal exit! also route 192 is just up the road past walmart, with numerous places of interest and places to eat.
