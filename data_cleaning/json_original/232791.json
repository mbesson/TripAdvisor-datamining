The area of the hotel has a lot of nice restaurants and some small convenience stores. Advantage of this area is that you are away from the touristic hassle and noise. Disadvantage of the location of the hotel is that the neareast metro station and Turistic Bus stop is about 15-20 min. walk. But if you want to explore the area this is a good opportunity. A taxi will take your for about 8-10 euro to Plaza Catalunya (20 min walk) and 35 euro from the airport.

Check in was simple and swift, and there is a lift to all floors. The room was lovely. Were allocated a twin, and the beds did tend to drift apart, as mentioned in another review. It wasn't a massive problem though, as when we went it was VERY hot and quite nice to have your own space. The rooms are air conditioned, and this was welcome relief after long, hot days. The housekeeping staff were excellent, and we had clean sheets put on our bed each day, aswell as clean towels. (If you are very environment aware, this may not strike you as fantastic, but you can request that this doesn't happen). The room was always tidied when we returned at the end of the day. The hotel is in a good location. It may seem like it isn't, but it won't take five minutes to get on the tube (Urgell or Hospital Clinic) and get to the location you want to go to. My fianc\u00e9 and I used the Barcelona card for this, which I would reccomend if you are going. The metro is nothing to be worried about. Very clean and air conditioned. I would reccomend though, that wherever you are in Barcelona, you keep your wits about you, and don't fall into tourist traps! Carry a small bag, and keep it with you at all times.

However, she didn't understand the room number, so we had to point it out. I find it quite unacceptable to have non-English speaking staff at the breakfast in an international hotel. Regarding the room then. In the bathroom there was a tile with a huge crack that housed some form of bugs. During the first night there I noticed one bug in the bathroom, but just assumed that it got there by accident. The next day I however noticed that there was more than one. Next to this, the room was also very noisy. Apart from having paper walls between different rooms, during the night I could constantly hear the elevator moving, closets opening, curtains being drawn in other rooms etc. Furthermore, the window constantly shivering due to the traffic outside, which caused a lot of noise as well. Needless to say, sleeping was made quite hard due to all of this noise. Last, the hotel is quite far from the center. Although Casa Mila and Casa Battlo are quite nearby.

We arrived very late and were given a very small room (which for a night or two, would be ok), we came straight back down and were moved the following day...no problems. The staff were fantastic, the guys on recepton could'nt do enough for us - very friendly. The hotel is a little further back, from the very centre of Barcelona, but is no more than a pleasant 20 min stroll, or just round the corner was a tube stop. This is only a small hotel so has quiet a nice feel to it, there is a bar but was not always open. FAB hotel for people that will be out exploring Barcelona. When we went this hotel was much better value than other similar standard hotels.", "Date": "June 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris", "Title": "\u201cLovely hotel - shame about the beds\u201d", "Author": "jeanrelle", "ReviewID": "UR11209654", "Content": "Stayed 4 nights at NH Master in Barcelona. Was very new looking and reception were very pleasant and helpful. Some staff had limited english. The room was very modern - had a window that opened onto a central light area with no views at all. Did not worry us. Airconditioning was hard to work out, so spent a few nights quite hot. The worse was the bed situation - as they were singles pushed together. With no clasp to keep the beds together it was not very romantic! I will email and complain to the NH group (as there are many hotels) but will want to double check this next time. Towels and linen were all clean and new - would recommend highly but watch for the bed situation. Location was ok...although next time I would pick a hotel near the metro Jaume - as we walked down that way for all the better restaurants.", "Date": "December 2, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "NH Master", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d232791-Reviews-NH_Master-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "$92 - $171*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Valencia 105-107</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">08011</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Barcelona</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "232791", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/e9/68/e968cdd0fb65cc4888217a77cec9af415large.jpg"}}
