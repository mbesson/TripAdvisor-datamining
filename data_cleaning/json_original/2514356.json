After finally arriving at the Grant Hotel, or should I say, the Alexandar as it is named above the door, our nightmare begun! First thoughts were, small, quiet and strange smell. We made our way to the tiny lift which looked ready to collapse to get to our 2nd floor appartment. Our room, well our box, was awful! the bed was rock hard and linnen was itchy. As we opened the blinds, we were face to face with a brick wall. On further inspection we found bare wires from plug sockets and light fittings. the bathroom was in the room next door to us and was shared with the rest of the people on our floor whom seemed to be permanent residents at the dive. There were more bare wires to be found next to the mirror, above the sink. We were disturbed each night with the noisy heating system, We were told it would only last a few minutes, however 20 minutes later it was still going. When we originally booked our holiday we planned to stay 3nights, however we later extended it to 4, On returning to the hotel on the 4th night, we were surprised to find our room had been completely emptied. Our stuff had all been thrown into black bags and put into a cupboard downstairs. Cleaners had not been informed we were staying an extra night so had removed our belongings. Thankfully the wonderful city 'New York' made up for the appalling conditions we slept in. We will definately be returning to New York, however we will not be visiting The Grant Hotel, and advise anyone, even those with a low budget to stay well clear!!!", "Date": "September 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portsmouth UK", "Title": "\u201cWould never stay here again\u201d", "Author": "jastelem", "ReviewID": "UR6330216", "Content": "We have just returned from our 5th visit to NYC on 1st December, having stayed at the Grant for the first time as the hotel we normally stay in was full. Our otherwise enjoyable visit was marred by our terrible experience in this hotel. Upon arrival we were informed that the hotel would require photocopies of our photo ID and credit card details (the former we were aware of but the latter we were not told about in the confirmation email we had received in advance). We were reluctant to provide these as they were stored (along with everyone else's details) in a plastic box on the front desk where, potentially, anyone could just lean across and take them. The receptionist stated that he had no secure location (safe, office, drawer) in which to store the paperwork and we were told to leave if we didn't like it! The 'security manager' then appeared and involved himself in the argument which culminated in him telling us that he didn't like us and we should go and sleep on the streets. We asked to see the manager and were told that he wasn't in and no-one knew when he was due back on duty. Given that it was Thanksgiving Day, we had little choice but to stay at the hotel as we had nowhere else to go. The room itself was too warm with no way of controlling the heat, the air-con was too noisy to have on for too long and there were exposed wires all over the place, including the hallways and bathrooms. Both my friend and I developed curious rashes after a few days of staying at the hotel..I would not like to hazard a guess as to the cause! The final horror was when we had two brand new pairs of childrens' trainers (still in their boxes) stolen from our locked hotel room the day before we left and the response from the receptionist was 'call 911.' Again we asked for the manager; again we were told that he wasn't in and no-one knew when he would be back on duty. I love NYC and am determined that this experience will not put me off but, rest assured, that any future stays will certainly not involve the Grant Hotel.", "Date": "December 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cGreat value!\u201d", "Author": "MarkInSF", "ReviewID": "UR6321292", "Content": "I was afraid to stay here because of the mixed reviews, but the throwaway price ($190 with tax for 3 nights) convinced me to give it a try. My fear was misplaced. The Grant (also known as The Devon) is one of the best travel bargains I have ever gotten. The room was clean and reasonably appointed (about the quality of an older \"motel\"). I hate hotel room odors of any sort, and my room ranked way better than average, with only a very slight 'small room' smell that blew off as soon as I cracked the window. The shared bath was modern (more than the room), fully tiled, and well cleaned at least twice daily (again with no smell). The guests seem to consist of mostly young bargain travellers.

There are also some nice restaurants a short walk up broadway (especially recommended is Regional, just a short walk up broadway for a lovely Italian) The bathrooms were also cleaned regularly and rarely had to wait at all. Unfourtunately this was all let down by the bed bugs. Having read through the reviews on this site it seems several people have experienced this as well and quite a few havent so seems to me this is not a hotel wide issue. We were in room 319 initially and when I complained to the reception they were more than happy to move us and didn't seem phased at all, so it seemed to me something they were rather used to. We were moved to room 510, and I think the bugs were in there too as i ended up with an arm and upper body covered in bites which become quite inflamed and required me to visit a doctor after leaving New York for treatment. My advice overall would be to avoid this hotel just incase, and if you are offered room 319 or 510 make sure you change straight away - the staff didn't seem like they were going to do anything about getting rid of them in our first room!", "Date": "November 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "arizona", "Title": "\u201cworth the price especially if you book through expedia\u201d", "Author": "JennyJen2009", "ReviewID": "UR6164813", "Content": "My boyfriend and I stayed here for one night and it was great.

I went with my two friends and my boyfriend. We got two double beds in one room for $148/night. I tried to lower their expectations, I had read mixed reviews on this website. I told them we would have to share a bathroom in the hallway and they all thought we were staying in a hostel. Anyway, we arrived...the front lobby kind of smells \"old\" but not gross or anything, just old. It was an old building and reminded me of my grandma's apartment in Chicago. The elevator is pretty small but really, that is one of the only complaints I have! The room was clean, the AC worked great, the tv had a bunch of channels but really, we only wanted a place to sleep, we spent most of our time out shopping or on the town. We brought extra sheets, but I didn't use mine. I did bring a towel though, make sure you do that, the towels they provide are very small. Overall, everyone praised my decision, said I did such a good job finding a cheap hotel that was clean, and comfortable. I would absolutely stay there again. And no, I don't work for the hotel (my friends all said the good reviews on this website probably came from the people that work there) but I disagree since the staff doesn't really speak English that well. If you want an affordable place to stay choose here. It's about a 10 minute cab ride from Times Square or about 15 min on the subway, which is right up the street.

They've got one comp with internet access down by the lobby $10c a minute I think, and if you've got a laptop + network cable you can get net access directly in you room for $10 midday to midday. Negatives - they don't take cash, so if you want to pay for the net, book an extra night or whatever, it's all gotta go on a credit card.

The bedside lamp would've brightened up the room, however, it wasn't working. TV has basic cable channels but I think someone had made off with the remote control or it was misplaced somewhere. I couldn't find it. The shared bathroom was clean. If the one closest to the room was occupied, there was another across the hallway that was open.
