{"Reviews": [{"Content": "What a find!! Returned last week from 10 days staying at Pondok Ayu.This was our ninth visit to beautiful Bali and I think this hotel was by far the best we have encountered ( we have stayed at the 5star resorts in Nusa Dua).The hotel was spotlessly clean and the grounds and pool immaculately cared for by the staff. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff and the local knowledge of the area was a real bonus.We enjoyed the intimacy of the place - having breakfast and getting to meet the other guests was a treat - We enjoyed the hotel so much the first thing we did on our return was to book again for next year!", "Date": "Dec 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR445142359", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "CanberraClaire"}, {"Content": "Best Hotel In Bali ! Pondok is your home away from home, I have stayed there many times and should have submitted this review a long time ago, its the best personel service you will come across, fantastic rooms, lovely food and so clean and tidy. Gede and his beautiful wife Made will make you feel welcome the minute you meet them and the other staff have been there a long time they are a happy Pondok family, The restaurant on the beach BENNOS is great as well you can get all types of food to suit anyone. I would recommend this hotel to anyone !!", "Date": "Dec 11, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR464088537", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "MichelleW"}, {"Content": "Never stayed anywhere better... We're just back from Pondok Ayu, and we can honestly say that we've never had a better holiday! It's a beautiful place, spotless and the service was great.

There is absolutely nothing to fault. Having travelled extensively and stayed in many top rated hotels I feel this is the most imprssive hotel I haev ever stayed. The room rate is deceptive, how can you pay so little for such a fantastic holiday? Even when you stay everything extra is so reasonable, So much so that you can afford to come home from holidays with all your laundry done, I recommend asking Made to cook for you one night, the traditional Balinese food is the best you will get. Cant wait to go back (again)", "Date": "Sep 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR409069758", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "concepttraveller"}, {"Content": "A fantastic find! We just returned from a lovely holiday in Bali staying at Pondok Ayu. We had a fantastic time and will be definatly be returning again next year. The staff were so friendly and helpful and nothing was a problem for them. Pondok Ayu was perfect for us having small children (2 and 4) and we are telling all our friends they have to go and see for themselves! There were only 5 rooms in total so it was very quiet and we had the pool to ourselves most of the time. The rooms were quite large, very clean and the gardens beautiful. Our room was cleaned every morning and every evening our beds were turned down, the curtains closed and a lolly left on each pillow, which the children thought was fantastic. The would always wait for the lolly lady to come!! I highly recommend Pondok Ayu for families with small children.", "Date": "Aug 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR638498231", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "vaitecat"}, {"Content": "Beautiful! Just had 4 wonderful days in Bali at the Pondok Ayu en route to visit our family in a somewhat rainy Brisbane.I cannot speak highly enough of this beautiful little place, the fact that it is a 15 minute walk from the beach is not a problems as Gede will run you there or anywhere in Sanur for free. (we walked due to excessive intake of Balinese food!) He met us at the airport and on the way back even stopped at the McDonald's drive through as our 2 teenage girls were starving. Nothing is too much trouble for any of the staff. The rooms were lovely and the bedding gorgeous white cotton (sorry, but nice bedding is a must in a hot climate). The pool area was great and very private. We also enjoyed the location, as we were greeted by big hellos from the local children each time we walked down the road. I would advise anyone going to Sanur to stay here, and we are seriously considering coming for a longer stay next year. Pondok Ayu really is a little gem.", "Date": "Jul 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR431382252", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Suttons"}, {"Content": "Pondok Ayu Have just spent the last 10 days at this amazing place, What can I say the whole experience was wonderful, the staff are so friendly and can't do enough for you.

Made especially great by the beautiful people at our Villa style accomodation - Pondok Ayu in Sanur. A little paradise hidden in the back streets. Managed by a Balinese family, this is a special place to stay. Immaculate gardens, 5 star style rooms, perfect pool, magnificent banana pancakes for breakfast..........BLISS.

Gede the manger was there to meet us at the airport. He does not need a sign just look for the guy with the biggest smile. This time we booked the whole hotel out to accommodate three families, What a great feeling to know that you do not have to fight with tourists for the sun loungers or have to endure the crowds you meet at the big hotels. What makes this place special above the excellent standard of accommodation is the staff, nothing is too much trouble , whether you want to go on a day trip or just be pampered. The staff make you feel part of the Pondok family. Do not be put off by the pricing you are truley getting a five star place and service to match. We will definitely be going back in the not too distant future, a home away from home.

What a wonderful find. A boutiqe hotel with just four rooms. What we found was a little gem offerring modern 5* rooms with 5* service. If you want a large anonimous hotel with bags of plastic and false smiles do not come here. No plastic just first class accommodation a genuine warm and friendly service. It is not on the beach which is about a pleasant 15/20 minute walk or just ask the manager and he will gladly run you there. he will also run you to the restaurant of your choice in the evening. Nothing is to much trouble. The owner also owns a restaurant on the beach (Bennos) and you have a choice of breakast at the villa or on the beach.I have stayed in many 4 and 5 star hotels around the world and this hotel ranks amonst the best. Different but better, the Pondok is not a hotel more a second home after a couple days.. Even better the price is not 4/5* either.", "Date": "Nov 20, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR876946372", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "santamed"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297700-d783737-r22768664-Pondok_Ayu-Sanur_Bali.html", "HotelID": "783737", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
