We booked the Relais Santa Croce after winning a bid at Luxury Link and could not have been more pleased. The hotel itself is gorgeous - a perfect balance of Florentine architecture, old world touches and modern amenities. The main lobby lounge is a dream come true with its beautifully embellished ceiling and walls. The pictures simply do not do it justice. While the hotel seemed very quiet during our stay (we were often the only guests in the lounge, the breakfast room and the restaurant), we didn't mind this very much given the incredibly attentive and gracious service. Everything from the e-mail correspondence leading up to the trip to the calm and efficient reaction to our small fire debacle (due to an accident with our hair dryer) was handled professionally and with care. Marina, in particular, was especially friendly and helpful. The rooms themselves were very comfortable, and with the exception of having somewhat slower drains, we could not have asked for anything more. Even the hotel breakfast was perfectly suited to us - a somewhat light offering was included with the room (cereals, yogurts, pastries, antipasti), but hot items such as eggs were offered for an additional cost. These dishes, as well as the food at the hotel's restaurant, Guelfi e Ghibellini, were prepared very well and were generally quite delicious. The hotel had booked for us in advance some museum passes and tours. For the city tour, we thoroughly enjoyed the private walking tour given by Fadi Bassil of florencetown. Fadi's background in architecture enhanced our understanding of so many of the beautiful structures and art pieces throughout the city. He was knowledgeable about all of the questions we had along the way, was very flexible about timing and which attractions to see in accordance with our preferences, and even took us to a tiny, local wine bar for a break where we enjoyed a delicious glass of wine and some of the tastiest cheeses and appetizers we have ever had. Our private Chianti tour was given by Miriam Buzzi of Firenzeshuttle. Miriam was also terrific, and drove us to a couple of charming towns (one with an antique market), a picturesque restaurant overlooking the Tuscan landscape, and a vineyard at which we learned about the production of balsamic vinegar in addition to wines. We were extremely pleased with both tours and would highly recommend them to anyone travelling to Florence. We had the most perfect time in Florence and will definitely be returning soon!", "Date": "Oct 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR735702066", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "jola23"}, {"Content": "Superb oasis... The Relais is an oasis in Florence. We stayed for in June 2008 and were simply delighted by the room (Junior Suite) and the overall service. The building is beautifully restored with spacious public areas which retain their traditional style. Our room was fitted out in quite a modern, but restrained, style. It was about 5m by 5 m, with a separate 3m by 3m area containing a walk in luggage area and a bathroom containing a clever combined shower/sauna. The location is extremely convenient and our view to the Santa Croce Basilica over the adjoining rooftops was lovely and gave a distinctive insight into the rooftop lives of the locals! One of the lounges has an area for smokers with large French doors open to a street view. We were served the best olives we had in all Italy with our drinks. The breakfast buffet was excellent. One tip, ordering something not on the menu (crisp bacon with the eggs) caused a 45 minute delay and a complete melt down in the kitchen. It was good when it arrived, but it wasn't worth the delay.Our stay contributed two great moments in our trip.One was the (separately operated) restaurant on the ground floor of the building, the Enoteca Pinchiorri. This a 3 star Michelin establishment that rewards a evening. The prices may not be for everyone, but it is well worth mortgaging the first born for one of the best food, service and (especially!) wine experiences in Italy. Beautiful rooms, a slightly formal air. Gentlemen would feel uncomfortable without a jacket and I must admit I was glad I wore a tie. Indescribably stunning.The other great moment was our arrival. Manuel lives, and he is in Florence! We dropped the car at the door without checking in and went straight on a walking tour (Context travel, well worth a separate review in their own right!). We returned bearing backpacks a few hours later to be challenged by the Concierge.After reassuring him we really were guests, we proceeded upstairs to check in. From what followed we can only assume that if the front door does not personally accompany guests to check in they are summarily executed at dawn. After a few minutes at the counter a visibly stressed concierge appeared at our side apologising volubly in several languages for his failure to escort us. We waved him off, completely unconcerned, but puzzled at the strength of his emotion. At the end of check in he showed us to our room apologising still over his shoulder and delivering a number of memorable lines including one thing I love about you Americans is your sense of humour. This to an Aussie and a Brit. With apologies to any North American readers, there was no tip forthcoming.", "Date": "Jun 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR727028804", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "cunim"}, {"Content": "A romantic dream Beautiful place, a pure luxury and really romantic...", "Date": "Jan 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR490330169", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Sharon_hot"}, {"Content": "The most elegant and special evening we had during our entire trip My husband and I were recently in Italy on holiday. As we were exploring Florence, we noticed Relais Santa Croce hotel. Being the curious person that I am, I went in to look around and also spoke to the bellman. He was very friendly and polite, and we asked if you all were open for dinner to non-guests. He said yes. We made reservations, and dined with you on Tuesday, Nov 8. We had fantastic cocktails in the bar, and our dining experience was the most elegant and special evening we had during our entire trip. Mario, I believe that was his name, told us more about the hotel. Both Brant and I were overwhelmed by the fresh flowers, the furniture, artwork, the fresh berries that were served with our drinks and the lovely candles that had been so artfully placed.   If we ever make it back to Florence, we hope we have the good fortune to be able to stay at the Relais Santa Croce. Judy B.

However, I was a little concerned upon arrival. The hotel is in located on a nondescript street, there was no one to help us with our luggage at the front door, it didn't really look or feel like a hotel and I was beginning to wonder what I had gotten us into. After maneuvering our way through the ground level, we came across the elevator and found our way to the reception area. It was pleasantly quiet and really quite impressive as the hotel is in quite an old building that has wonderfully high ceilings, crown molding, and beautifully carved doors. I was starting to feel better about the situation right away. We were greeted by a very friendly gentleman at the reception desk who signed us in and found the bellman to assist us with our bags and show us our room. We asked to look at a couple of rooms, which they showed us, and we made our decision. It's really quite an interesting hotel that doesn't feel like a hotel. The hallway floors are, I believe, painted concrete, and there are Tuscan wall sconces thoughout the halls draped with simple sheer cloths. It was, for lack of a better word, very Tuscan and really quite nice. Simple and elegant are better words. The room we chose was very comfortable. It had hardwood floors, flat screen TV, nice millwork throughout, natural stone bathrooms with a tub/shower combo. Another thing I liked was the atomsphere; it was peaceful. People were not bustling in and out, in fact I rarely saw other guests. It had a very relaxing air about it. The room was equiped with complimentary bevarages from the mini bar, complimentary movies and complimentary wifi. Granted, the wifi didn't work in the room we stayed in, but it worked fine in the bar area - which was also beautiful; boasting a large fireplace, big, comfy over stuffed chairs and couches, friendly staff and tasteful music (jazz) playing in the background. You don't get the feel you are staying at a hotel here, you feel as though you are staying at someone's very lovely home. I really found this extremely satisfying and highly recommend it to anyone seeking a relaxing hotel that is away from the crowded areas, yet in a great location. It's a home away from home, with the perks of having people around to look after you.", "Date": "Jan 11, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR697077397", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "karl_H11"}, {"Content": "Wonderful experience A great place to stay - we loved the room, the service, the food and the location.", "Date": "Nov 2, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR380979072", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Pooferone"}, {"Content": "Above and beyond the expected!

The Relais Santa Croce is a stunning hotel.The furnishings are contemporary in an antique palatial setting. A beautiful blend. The breakfasts are to die for. Besides cereal, fruits, cheeses, hot croissants, there was an amazing array of fresh pastries and pies. The service in the hotel restaurant both for breakfast and dinner was wonderful. But the service at the front desk was quite snooty. One of the workers was quite affected and made me feel uncomfortable when asking for assistance. The doorman often was not at the door and one day when we brought a case of wine back from Tuscany , he didn't even open the door for my son. He was unable to get us a taxi on several occassions because it was too hot outside. That was the reason we wanted the taxi(to avoid walking 20 blocks in the heat). We asked to talk to a manager several times and were told that she was on vacation. We found it hard to believe that no one else had the brains or the authority to see to our issues. After the third request we just gave up.
