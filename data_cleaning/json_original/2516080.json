We stay at various Hilton chains quite a bit for work and as well as for family travel. This was meant just to be a couples weekend in LA. I generally like Hilton as they are a bit boring maybe but definitely professional. I thought the boutique label would make this different. Well, it was different. So the PROS: Great Location. Great rooftop hot tub. Very nice staff for the most part. The CONS: Rooftop pool was closed - in LA? In Aoril? C'mon! And it is the size of a large bath tub. Decor was just old school, not interesting or even that nice. Marble yes, but kinda old and....icky. Bathroom amenities were the same brand as they use in their Hampton chain (as I said before - it has a boutique label - but where oh where was the boutiqe-y - ness?) Two towels, had to send for more. Two glasses, had to send for more. No robes. Mini bar had no fridge....? Kinda lame supplies. Coffee in lobby gone at 9:35AM, maybe earlier but I wasn't there earlier. Noisy maid service in the afternoon. Okay, I sound like a princess but again, this was a couples weekend in a boutique....right? If I were there for two days for work, it would be fine. There's a large marble desk in the MIDDLE of the small room. But it's not a cheap place. For a few bucks more one could stay at the truly boutique-y Standard (which also had some issues, but it lived up to its' reputation). If you're there ask for a high up room and eat lunch at Sugarfish - FABULOUS.

The Checkers Hilton in downtown Los Angeles was certainly convenient but I do not view this property as a great representative of the brand. Of course, I knew prior to going it was a Hilton which is trying to assimilate in an old building which likely dates back to the 1920's. This translates into the probability of smaller rooms and may I say, small may not be the world to use as it related to my particular King room. It was smaller than small. If you put the bathroom and closet together, it equaled the size of my room. In any event, the greeting process at the front entrance was none existent. Of course, it is possible the doorman was busy doing something else at the time of my arrival, but there was also no bellman available. Fortunately I was able to handle the luggage on my own and did so without a problem. The lobby is more modern and represents what one would expect in a smaller property but does not represent the nostalgia of the days it was built. Oddly, all signage on property including room numbers, have an elephant logo which is likely from a prior flag or owner which has nothing to do with Hilton. I believe I saw a similar logo on a hotel in Dubai but cannot be sure and I'm not certain what flag was on this property prior to Hilton. Upon entering the room I was surprised with just how small it was. Frankly, it was disappointing. The bathroom was large, modern and full of marble which was pleasant to the eye. My issue in my room (601) was there was a constant noise originating from shaking pipes all through the night and the toilet ran all through the night as well. Further, there was a constant issue with the cable/satellite tv of losing channels throughout my stay. Finally on what turned out to be my last morning at the hotel, the satellite was completely inoperative for a period of three hours which is when I decided to check-out and go to another hotel. Also, the bathroom had mildew on the wall and along the baseboard was filthy dirty. I did have room service which was purely average and I also tried the restaurant which offered a great salad and my entree of fish and chips was severely undercooked. I'm sure this hotel has a chance of doing well and it appears they are trying to do the best they can with what they have to work with. Unfortunately during my stay, it represented a brand of much lower standards and even though I knew it was a \"boutique\" style property, that actually increases my expectation level, not decreases it.

My other big complaint is that they had no coke machines, and had the nerve to charge 4.00 for a 10oz coke in the restaraunt and bar. Talk about price gouging. Also they charge 38.oo for parking.

Later, one of our guests called us and said they were unable to book 2 bed bedrooms on a day. I called Yolanda and questioned her. She said that day on our block was all 1 bed bedrooms. She said if the guests want 2 beds, they could call the hotel. I told her that we don\u2019t want our guests to trouble with calling the hotel. It made us seem unorganized for not having options ready for them. We had a little argument. In the end, I told her to switch all those rooms to 2 bed bedrooms. She asked what if our guests want 1 bed bedrooms. I told her that they could call the hotel to switch it to that then. On our cut off day, our rooms weren\u2019t booked enough to get an upgrade for our wedding night. So, Yolanda gave us the upgrade anyway. We got a penthouse and it was very big and beautiful. It was prefect for doing our makeup/hair and photos before the wedding. At night, it was a little too cold. The heater wasn\u2019t working in the bedroom. The bathroom\u2019s bathtub was a little small for penthouse. In the end, our wedding block was all filled up. Yolanda told us that if we had guests who needed more rooms for our special rate, the hotel will give them the rate if there are rooms left in the hotel. One of our guests tried to get more rooms during our wedding block, but the hotel didn\u2019t give her the special rate.

The view is great. But I never got any service at the spa onsite (I went somewhere else). The menu offerings seemed more a la carte and sparse.

I complained a bit, he said he would see what he could do, and magically a fruit plate did appear, but I only had 2 bread items -- was he trying to \"stick it to me\"?

The restaurant serves decent, California cuisine, but is overpriced for the quality and selection of menu items. My biggest beef with the restaurant was breakfast. I received the Diamond complimentary breakfast voucher and decided to use it the first day. I have had varying experiences with complimentary HHonors breakfasts, but the norm is usually a continental buffet bar with pastries, breads, cereal, fruit, etc. At the Checkers, I was offered the choice of a basket of bread or toast. I received (for by $12-14 value) exactly 3 miniature pastries that were defrosted within the previous hour. I recommend here taking the extra HHonors points and going to Starbucks across the street. The rooms were nicely appointed, but the large flat-panel lacked high definition feeds. The picture was too grainy on that nice, expensive television to justify it being in the room.

The room was clean. The room service prompt. Unfortunately, the squeaky girls next door made me feel like I was in a dorm room. The neighbors on the other side started to watch tv at an early hour. The place had thin walls. The other problem was the bar. I came in late, after 11 pm, so maybe the place was closed. But there was a bartender and one gabby patron sitting at one end, so I took up a stool. The bartender never even looked in my direction. She could not have been enthralled by the gabby middle aged guy at the bar. Not worth it--really. After several minutes and no sign that she was aware of my existence, I left. Bad! (The bar at the Biltmore--much better. It was raining so I decided not to venture across the street and went up to the noisy room instead.) The other disappointment was the spa. They advertise in-room hair and makeup services and I thought I would treat myself before my work-related event. I called about 4 days before my arrival but they were booked and I was out of luck.

The hotel was kept very, very clean with the exception of room service dishes down the hall that were not picked up in a timely fashion (two days in a row) and bothered me enough to comment to the front desk about (they were picked up soon after).

We did not eat at in the in house restaurant but colleagues did not like their lunch there and we heard room service was \"not great\". However, our group had a small party on the back patio and we all felt the food was excellent and a nice atmospehere was created with light strings and dressed tables despite the narrow space. Biggest downsides: Bar charged outrageous prices for a glass of house wine...I think it was $17. Renovation was ocurring off the front lobby that was somewhat disruptful at times. Room service dishes not picked up for hours. Pluses: Smaller hotel, nice but small rooftop pool and hot tub. Close to the LA Library (worth a visit), Disney Music Hall, and other downtown venues.

My schedule did not permit use of the rooftop pool or fitness center, but I did head up there at night, to check them out. The outdoor pool and whirlpool are small, but the setting is spectacular, with the city all around you, and the pools seemed clean and welcoming.

To respond to another comment, there were adequate power outlets at my room\u2019s desk, in the form of outlets in the base of the desk lamp, plus a power block in a nearby wall outlet. The only two negative comments I can think of are minor ones. There was a strip of small bulbs behind the bed's headboard providing indirect lighting.

My Sister is a Hilton Diamond Member. To achieve these ranks with the Hilton affinity program, you have to stay at a LOT of Hilton Properties per year. We have both stayed at the Checkers Hilton in the past when we come to LA for business. This visit, we each paid $250 per night. I see in the other reviews the other previous guests (leisure travelers) gave good marks to this property: I am wondering if perhaps these were less seasoned travelers? As seasoned business travelers, we have come to expect more from a business hotel: THE GOOD: *Handy Location to Financial District and Staples Center *Friendly Staff at the front door *Lovely rooftop pool and patio *Spa on site THE BAD: *Filthy Carpeting- our feet turned black after a short time of going barefoot in our room. *The bathroom was filthy- it was evident that the cleaning staff does only light daily cleaning and heavy cleaning had not been done for a very, very long time. *Tile and fixtures dirty and corroded with scale and lime *NOISY: the staff at the Library next door starts the leaf (garbage) blowers at 6:45am EVERY morning in the common sidewalk betwen the buildings. When I asked the front desk clerk about this, she thought it was funny and told me there was nothing she could do. *American breakfast for two will set you back over $50.... and it's the same ingredients you get at Hilton's Embassy Suites buffet...including the nearly undrinkable coffee. The UNFORGIVABLE: *Since the property is so old, the bathroom fixtures are seperate controls. (non mixing valves) This creates a safety issues whereby it is possible for a person (especialy elderly and children) to scald themselves with hot water. When you shower, the water temp fluctuates between hot, cold, warm and then cold again. *The Television in one of our rooms was not attached to the furniture properly, and when adjusted fell off the stand and injured my associate. *No available power outlets at the desk: how is a business traveler supposed to work? *No power outlet in the bathroom: if you want to use the supplied hair dryer, you must use it in a different room other than the bathroom. *The air ducts were so visibly filled with dust, when the (weak) air conditioning is turned on, little particles of dust fly out of the duct work. CONCLUSION: This property is old and tired... no longer charming. It is in need of a major remodel. If you are going to pay this amount of money for a hotel stay, demand that you receive clean, safe, and quiet lodging.

Too bad really, because I really like these boutique type of hotels. We were given a room on the third floor and my first impression was that the room needed a serious makeover. Upon further inspection we found the carpets in serious need of cleaning...they were filthy and spotted, the drapes were stained and had burn holes in them. Comforter cover had snags all over it. Not long after that my 10 yr old son remarked, \"what's that smell?\" Well, upon looking around for the source of the odor we realized that our NON-smoking room reaked of cigarrettes from a failed attempt by the staff to mask the odor with air fresher. (the whole 2nd floor is for smokers) We moved to another room on the 8th floor which at least was cleaner, but it too needed some work. I know the building is old, but the room was stifling (this was winter time) and the air conditioner didn't work and the tub would not drain...yuck. Overall, the place needs work....half dead potted plants, pool area tired (but the view is spectacular). Well, we wanted to make the best of it and took to the streets to check out the neighborhood. There is plenty to see downtown, but you might want to avoid Pershing square as it is a major hang-out spot for the homeless and isn't much to look at anyway. Disney concert hall is great, and the Library next door is amazing and there are plenty of good restaurants within walking distance.

My husband, Jake and I stayed November 22nd (Thanksgiving Day) and departed November 24, 2007. Our room was #803.

From reserving the hotel room myself, conversations with \"Robert\" the Hotel Front Desk Manager (arranging a corner room) one week prior to arrival and meeting the Hilton Checkers staff in person - doorman, front desk, maintenance (mini-refrigerator/no charge), housekeeping, bar and restaurant staff -- just OUTSTANDING! Our son picked us up from LAX which was a 15 minute ride to the hotel (traffic was great/Thanksgiving Day). First stop, Ralph's grocery store (corner of 9th Street and Flower Street). Once we arrived at the hotel, as I stated before, the Hilton Checkers staff was very welcoming and warm. We checked in early, room was beautiful, maintained well and clean. Great view of Bunker Hill and Library Tower (tallest building/West Coast). We visited the pool and spa area -- beautiful area and views. We had our Thanksgiving Dinner at the hotel \"Checkers\". Perfect holiday dinner. Food, atmosphere, service and the staff was great. What a great memory for myself and my husband. The next day, my husband went to Starbucks before we went walking (downtown LA). We both felt safe and comfortable in our surroundings. I know that there is a huge amount of homeless people \"wandering\" but we never felt threaten, nor when approach did anyone get upset with us if we did not give out any money. To our surprise, there is quite a lot of sightseeing to behold in downtown LA. First visit, Library Tower and Bunker Hill steps. Walking further North (Hope Street) toward 1st Street, we visited \"Walt Disney Concert Hall\". Heading back South (Grand Ave.) visited MOCA (art museum), Water Court (water garden, shops, restaurants, next to the Omni Hotel) and had lunch at California Pizza. Once lunch was completed, we continue walking back to the Bunker Hill steps (halfway), to Citigroup Center, thereafter, to the Westin Hotel (hotel elevator to the 32nd floor to view the \"Hollywood sign\". Once we exited the Westin hotel onto Figueroa Street, continue South sightseeing (Macy's, etc). Ended our sightseeing at Ralph's and headed back in the late evening/dark (about a 15 minute walk) without any problems, felt safe. Had dinner at \"Pete's Cafe\" (corner of 4th and Main/casual). Great way to end our night with our son and his girlfriend. As my husband and I get older (42 yrs old) we prefer smaller, well-maintained hotels and esp. wonderful customer service.

I went to the front desk and was told i had been locked out until i had paid the cost of the calls made from the telephone, it was a total of $140 which was approx 5 mins worth of calls to the UK. Not only that but i was trying to be charged for about 8 calls which i hadnt actually made. After an age explaining that i couldnt possibly have made 3 calls all to the same number all at the same time i was let back into my room. The next evening i went for a meal in the hotel restaurant, the food was beautiful. When my bill came approx $100 i left a $20 tip. It was only when i returned to the UK that i found the waitress had taken $100 for the meal $20 for the tip and a further $30 in gratuity. When i checked in i was asked to leave $150 in case i broke anything - something i have never done in any hotel in the whole world. When i checked out the gave me the $150 back in $1 notes.

Everything in this report is absolutely true and has not been exaggerated. We can see why our travel agent thought the hotel would be terrific. After we got home, we went to the hotel website and saw what she must have seen when she looked at it. The place looks gorgeous on the website. The actual hotel, however, is quite different from what is on the website. The exterior views on the website don't show the ground and the sidewalk outside the hotel. This is because there are drunks and vagrants sitting or sleeping on the sidewalk. The photo of the hotel lobby has been shot with a wide-angle lens to make the actual small, narrow room appear larger. The lobby shot has also been Photo Shopped to make it appear bright and well lighted and to make the marble floor look highly polished. The actual lobby is dark and dreary and has a marble floor that is dull and scuffed. There is even a cheap burgundy colored curtain on one side of the lobby to close off the bar, which is on the other side of the curtain. Is it perhaps against the law to be serving alcohol in a room where there will be children? This might account for the curtain. The mirror in the lobby that looks so bright and well polished is actually in need of having the back re-silvered and the frame is chipped and in need of a paint job. Most of the other photos on the website appear to have been shot with a wide-angle lens, too. If the lobby photo is any indication, the meeting rooms, bar, swimming pool, and restaurant probably don't look like the photos either. The room that we were given was dark, dreary, and not clean. Some time or other (probably not recently) someone had tried to dust the place. This was done with some sort of less than clean damp cloth. The streaks from the cloth were on all of the glass surfaces in the bedroom and bathroom. A film of dust was covering the streaks. The bathroom floor was downright dirty, as was the tub. The linens on the bed had seen better days. The curtains were absolutely filthy, with repulsive looking stains on them. There were also smudges of some sort of black colored stuff on the curtains. The furniture in the room was shabby and consisted of mismatched pieces. The desk chair was particularly old and cheap. Again, all of this differs radically from what is shown of the rooms on the hotel's website. The suite shown on the website looks lovely...and perhaps this suite actually exists at the hotel. Of course, it may have been Photo Shopped, too. The old, worn carpet in our room had stains on it. We wouldn't have wanted to walk on either the carpet or the bathroom floor in our bare feet. The dust in our room was terrible. I have allergies to dust and mold, so I was having trouble breathing within a couple of minutes after entering the room. Even my friend who was with me, who has no allergies, was having trouble breathing after we had been in there awhile. I'm sure that, even though we never ventured up to the rooftop bar, it doesn't look anything like the photo on the website either. The Checkers really has presented an incredibly false impression of the hotel on the website. We called our travel agent from our room and told her what was going on. She found us a room at the downtown Marriott and we left the Checkers less than an hour after we checked in. Our travel agent also called the Checkers and told the desk clerk that we were checking out and why. We left less than an hour after we got there. At least we weren't charged any money. We loved the downtown Marriott, on Figueroa Street, and stay there all the time now when we go to Los Angeles.", "Date": "March 19, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "claremont, california", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, terrific hotel\u201d", "Author": "trekkrsal", "ReviewID": "UR4460711", "Content": "Hilton Checkers is an unimposing hotel with a terrific location.

All ammenities were as listed (Evelyn and Crabtree), had a hair dryer, coffee maker, iron, etc. The beds were the most comfortable I have ever slept in, in a hotel. We wanted a late check out, which they happily granted us. We did not go to the rooftop pool, as we walked to the Bonaventure Hotel instead (about one block) and had a cocktail on the top floor revolving lounge and restaurant,(takes about 60 minutes for the full 360 degrees) with a beautiful view of the city. Also at the Bonaventure there are nearly two full floors of various restaurants, from quick Thai or Morrocan food to sit down Italian restaurants. The Los Angeles Public Library is next door to Checkers, and is well worth a visit. The \"Dash\" public bus takes you to the Fashion District (aka, Garmet District), and many other places, all for only 25 cents! The hotel is only a block from the jewelry district. Also, if travelling by train, the hotel is only a block from the Pershing Square exit on the Red Line.

While shopping around for good deals and a nice place to stay, I had noticed that people are way more likely to write negative reviews than they are to point out the positives. So I knew that regardless of the quality of my stay in CA, I was going to review each hotel once I got back. That being said, we really enjoyed our stay here. We got there a few hours before check in time but the staff was very accomodating and they were able to let us check in early. Our bags were promptly brought up to our room and we were very pleased with all aspects of the room. The beds were probably more comfortable than in any other hotel that I've ever stayed in. The room was spotless and everything was in working order. We ordered room service one night and the food was excellent. There was a billing error with our bill for the food, but it was promptly corrected. My only major complaint would be the location, which has nothing to do with the quality of the hotel. The hotel is located in downtown LA, in the financial district. So if you happen to be there on a weekend, as we were, don't expect to find anything open nearby. We walked several miles hoping to find a restaurant, shop, or really just anything that was open, with no luck. And as with any downtown area, the homeless population was extensive. But still, we felt very safe once inside the hotel. Also, the hotel has a chauffered car service who they use, which really came in handy getting to the airport, for not much more money than a cab. I would defintiely recommend this hotel, as long as you have activities/plans of things to do outside the downtown area.", "Date": "September 26, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oakland, California", "Title": "\u201cProbably not top-rate enough for Paris\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3802369", "Content": "It was the day before our end-of-summer trip to Los Angeles, and I still had no idea where we would be staying. So, I decided Priceline was the way to go. Each bid request kept bringing back rejections, so I kept upping the ante and adding $5 to my nightly rate plus adding a new location. Finally, the magic words appeared: \"Your bid has been accepted!\" Hilton Checkers, Downtown Los Angeles. Whoops! Did I really check yes to downtown L.A.? Well, I had. So, visions of a 4-star hotel on the beach quickly disappeared. What we did get was a 4-star hotel with 4-star service, albeit a few wrinkles. Details are below. Parking: Beware the parking charge: 26 bucks a day with unlimited in-and-out privileges. Yes, the unlimited in-and-out is nice, but of course we felt obligated to tip each time. So, by the end of our four-night stay, we had shelled out $120-plus in parking. Also, how long it took to get the car was very inconsistent. Sometimes, it only took a couple of minutes. Other times, we waited close to 20 minutes.There are parking lots nearby, but most do not have in-and-out privileges, and most of the safe-looking ones were close to $20 a day. The room: Spacious. When we checked in, the man at the desk was very accommodating and did his best to find us a larger, corner room when he saw our very active toddler in tow. The room was also very clean. One morning when we returned after breakfast, we surprised the maid, who was on her hands and knees scrubbing the tub. I was pretty impressed. That night, I felt none of the trepidation I usually have venturing into hotel tubs. The bathroom was spacious and a great place to make phone calls while our 18-month-old took her naps in the room. The room also had high-speed Internet access for about $10 a day. It was very easy to connect and seemed noticeably faster than my home DSL connection. (There is also a free Internet terminal in the hotel's lobby for guests to use.) One thing that was missing was a mini fridge. When I had inquired about them on the phone before our arrival, I was told that I could request a room with one when we arrived. No one mentioned that there would be a $10 a day charge and that it would have to be delivered. It would have been a nice touch for keeping our daughter's milk chilled. The pool and fitness room: This is the reason why I gave the hotel above average reviews rather than excellent. A summer family vacation in Los Angeles inevitably includes time poolside, and we were excited for that until we saw the rooftop pool. The view was nice, but the pool itself feels like an extended hot tub. It is tiny by four star hotel standards, even by motel standards. It was fine when we were the only ones using it, but add a few more people in, and it quickly became decidedly crowded. The hot tub is nice and has a great view. You can order drinks and/or snacks from room service, and they will be delivered there. One other problem with the pool is that the roof is also used for hotel functions at which point a wooden platform is placed over the pool and it becomes inaccessible to guests. One afternoon we arrived at the pool only to find it covered up. What happened next made me feel much better. I inquired at the front desk as to when it would reopen. After a few minutes on hold, I was told that we could go use the pool across the street at the Millennium Biltmore Hotel without any charge. This turned out to be a stroke of luck. The pool there is tiled from the 1920s and worth a visit. It is also much larger than the pool at the Hilton, so everyone was happy, especially my daughter, who didn't need sunblock, since the pool is indoors. On the night we arrived at Checkers, there was a welcome happy hour poolside. Free appetizers were passed around, and you could order drinks. A screwdriver and a glass of wine came to about 20 bucks. My husband was very happy with the fitness room as there was a LifeFitness eliptical machine in it. Fresh water and towels were also available. The neighborhood: The good part of it is that there are lots of historical buildings to tour (the Bradbury Building would have to be the highlight) and lots of Monday through Friday cafes. L.A.'s impressive library is literally next door. The bad part is that the place becomes a virtual ghost town on weekends. To get milk for my daughter on a Sunday morning, I had to drive to Little Tokyo, 10 minutes away. I combed the streets surrounding the hotel, but nothing was open. Even RiteAid didn't open until 10 AM. All in all, the Hilton Checkers is a great place to stay if you want to be downtown, comfortable, and don't care about the size of the pool.", "Date": "August 24, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal", "Title": "\u201cVery very nice\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3777226", "Content": "The Checkers is a very nice place to stay in the downtown LA.
