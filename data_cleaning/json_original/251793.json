I was wary of the transparent blocks between the loo and the room, leading to potentially more intimacy between my partner and me than we bargained for; but there is less permeability than one imagines, and I cant really say it was an issue (I would think twice about a first romantic weekend though...but then I wouldnt choose this location for that.) The location is extremely central, with all the transport options you need, from bus to U-Bahn at your doorstep.

It is a bold statement in favour of modernity (with comforts), simplicity and style. The lobby is quirky with a nice round bar and a long table (at the back) for communal conversation; modern art works are scattered throughout, so the impression is that of an art gallery, rather than your run of the mill hotel lobby. After you are handed out your key, which is in fact an electronic tag that you need to use even to operate the lift, you enter a hotel room which is worlds apart from chintz, velvet and plastic fripperies. The floors are uncarpeted (spotless of course) and tones of grey, soft green and beige plus clever lighting, turn the room into a relaxing environment. Bathrooms are also extremely modern and efficiently designed so that you have everything, but without the clutter. My only concern, given the design of the shower, was how the maid could possibly clean it, but it was spotless so they must have thought of a way of doing it! After a comfortable night, I took myself to their breakfast room which is located on the 7th floor, unusual but yet again refreshingly different as you are projected into an airy room with views of the city. Do not expect your run of the mill breakfast; it\u2019s more akin to nouvelle cuisine with emphasis on vegetarian living, than a traditional hearty early morning fare. This may disappoint you somewhat if you are not into fresh fruit and yoghurts and prefer instead bacon and eggs (you have a choice of eggs, but no bacon!). As this hotel makes a statement you either love it to bits, which I did, or possibly hate.

Overall, I was satisfied with the hotel but will most likely not stay there again. Not because of any significant problems with the hotel, but I would rather pay a few $ more to get a less \"institutional\" feel from my hotel. The hotel is located on the far west side of the Kurfurstendamm, away from most tourist destinations. The closest U-bahn (Adenauer Platz) is a 10 min walk east, and the closest S-Bahn is a ~5 min walk west. Both the S-Bahn and U-bahn require changing trains to get to most tourist destinations in the heart of the city. If you're comfortable with public transport it's no big deal and I was able to get around easily. If you're unfamiliar make sure you get some help from the front desk before you first step out. In addition, there's a Bus stop right outside the front door that will take you to either the S-Bahn or U-bahn station in ~5 min. I usually hopped on the bus to Adenauer Platz and either took another bus or the U-Bahn to my destination. From hotel door, using public transport to the Reichstag took ~35 min. The hotel itself is easy to find with a \"modern european\" decor. To me, \"modern european\" is defined as meaning little to no furniture, a darker than preferred room, no carpet, no amenities and no pictures/paintings on the wall. It seemed to be more of an \"institutional\" feeling (like a hospital or barracks) which didn't exude warmth and comfort. I'm 38 yrs old so maybe my tastes are different from the majority of the folks visiting the hotel (of course all the guests seemed to be around my age). Furniture consisted of a TV, a small table, two small chairs, a phone, a \"shrank\", and a bed. There was no alarm clock which I found inconvenient, but it was very easy to arrange a wake-up call in the morning. The bathroom was bigger than most european hotels I've stayed in with a suprisingly huge shower and powerful shower head. It was a great way to start off the day. The hotel lobby is relatively small with an attached bar and sitting area. Again with the \"modern european\" decor. There were also two built in internet terminals but of the seven times I tried the terminals, they only worked twice. This was a recurring theme for me and other visitors. Some kind of issue with the server. The bar seemed pretty active. Seemed to be both locals and guests. I didn't try the bar out so I can't comment on price or service. I found the staff to be extremely friendly and helpful. Every request was met with a smile and genuine will to please. Even the maid smiled and said good morning in the hallway. A first for a German hotel stay. Kudos to the staff. The breakfast buffet in the morning was very good but not the best I've had. A good variety of breads, juices, eggs and teas. Less so on meats, fruits, and yoguhrts. Again, the staff was very helpful and friendly. The view from the seventh floor was nice but hardly awe inspiring like some of the earlier posts. The hotel is located in a commercial/residential district so the view is of commercial residential housing rooftops. Overall I got my money's worth and am satisfied with my stay. I rate the hotel a 2 or 3 star and a good value for the money. If you're expecting luxury and convenience go somewhere else. If you're looking for a place to lay your head at night, get a good breakfast in the morning and are comfortable getting around town with public transport, all for a reasonable price, consider this hotel.", "Date": "February 18, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belfast", "Title": "\u201cWonderfull\u201d", "Author": "Fuzzboy", "ReviewID": "UR4121761", "Content": "The 101 is an ultra modern and very trendy hotel.

The only thing \"off\" was that the gimmicky T.V. that rolls back and forth had left marks on the walls (from a prior guest). Also, I never figured how to adjust the T.V.'s contrast. Bathroom was spare but attractive; the bath head was adjustable for either bath or shower use. The only disappointment in the room was the lack of floor rugs (except for one small one)which gave the floors a Northern European hospital feel. Service was reliable and always pleasant. I booked on ---- and was pleased that the breakfast (about 15 euros) was included in the room rate. A word about the breakfast: it is the best buffet I have seen in any hotel. There are separate stations for coldcuts, cereal, eggs and even vegetarian offerings. Superb quality and, especially, presentation. There is a terrific view of Berlin from this 7th floor restaurant (breakfast only). The lobby bar is lively with guests (mainly Euros) and neighborhood types. There are 2 free internet terminals in the lobby (although no printer!). The location is in a mixed but nice commercial residential neighborhood. I do not recommend this hotel for 1st time visitors since it is a hike to the Adenauer U Bahn station (which doesn't have any direct trains to the prime tourist areas).
