{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Best Hotel ever I stayed This hotel is the best ever I stayed. For the first time, I hesitated if I had to stay in because there was no review. The main reason I chose is that this hotel was cheapter than any other la quinta inn in new orleans.It is almost 8-10 mile away from a downtown. we needed to take a bridge to reach the hotel and/or the downtown. It is possible to have more time to where you want to reach if the bridge is in traffic or unexpected accident (we actually were in that case. we almost spent more than 30 minutes from the downtown to the hotel).Hotel itself is perfect. I don't know whether it was new built, but very clean. Room is large enough with a microwave and a refregerator. Every hallway has security cam, so that we felt safe. Breakfast area is large and good food. They refill all food so fast. I absolutely will stay again if i'm in the area.", "Date": "Jan 5, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR159430099", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Wayneness32"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60864-d850405-r23295836-La_Quinta_Inn_Suites_New_Orleans_East-New_Orleans_Louisiana.html", "HotelID": "850405", "Price": "$102"}}
