This would be a 5 star sight otherwise and you should strive to visit the other, lesser known, Gaudi sights as an alternative. You can still get something from a visit, and I recommend that you buy your ticket online to avoid the sizable line (just show your receipt to the guard and you're through). Like with most popular tourist sites, try to go at the opening or near the closing for the best experience, though I doubt even that would rescue this sight.", "Date": "April 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maale Adumim", "Title": "\u201cI was Bored Silly\u201d", "Author": "danielmarks", "ReviewID": "UR126662927", "Content": "This time I shall be a kill-joy, but in my opinion the Casa Batlo is vastly overrated as a tourist attraction and if you aren't interested in architecture, I'd give it a miss. The real question is whether you'd spend 15-20 Euros or a couple of hours going to an architecturally interesting house in your own country, I wouldn't and after standing in line to get in and receiving a recorded tour that promised that it would be a life-changing experience I wandered round looking at large windows and blue tiles asking myself whether I was the only visitor who was bored silly. We did our tour on the eve of Christmas when the rain made walking around a house seem like a good idea, but it wasn't. It was, however a fascinating study in cognitive dissonance and I still wonder how many of the visitors that day would have stayed for more than ten minutes if the admission to the Casa Batlo had been free.", "Date": "March 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cA Barcelona must see for certain\u201d", "Author": "Tevao", "ReviewID": "UR122335858", "Content": "Great museum is casa Batll\u00f3 designed by Gaud\u00ed.
