They run a very disciplined process from check in, movie rental, maid service, valet and check out. The rooftop deck was an added bonus and the only thing better would have been a pool for the kids.

The hotel is only 6 years old and everything is immaculate with soft relaxing green and beige earth tones throughout the hotel. The beds are apparently quite comfy and the rooms are very quiet which is a rarity for being so close to Union Square. One of the selling points when I booked the hotel was the fact that it is one of the most eco-friendly hotels in San Francisco. The staff were eager to help with any questions and the restaurant had a nice menu and a wonderful butterscotch chocolate mousse dessert.

Just one thing to be aware of - especially if you have just got off a long transatlantic flight - we had stayed at the Orchard Hotel in the past which is a couple of blocks up the road. For this holiday, I booked the hotel and my husband booked the transport from the airport and he assumed we were going to the Orchard Hotel and we ended up at the wrong place.

The staff there is generally commendable and we noticed that some of them take on multiple roles- the bell boy is also the waiter at the restaurant on the first floor, for example. The hotel is small but rather cosy. My sister and I were lucky to have a spacious room with an additional couch. We could hear people talking at night but thankfully, there were not too many people occupying the rooms on our floor and it wasn't too noisy. The beds were large and there was an iHome in each room. The food is average. We had eggs, turkey ham and toast every morning. I would have liked more variation in what was served. The gym is small with not much equipment, all of which were out of order during my stay. Yet, overall, I really enjoyed my stay at Orchard Garden Hotel, mostly because of the excellent service and the nicely-furnished rooms. Not having too many people in the same hotel also gave a sense of privacy. We had the whole restaurant to ourselves in the morning. There is wifi as well, as an additional plus point.

The hotel isn\u2019t huge, about 10 stories with 10 or so rooms on each floor, but large enough to not to feel cramped which can happen with some boutique hotels. The location between Union Square and China Town is convenient and provided easy access to the cable car down to the Warf. The rooms are a bit on small side but well-appointed and comfortable. The 1st room we were given had a sliding bathroom door which didn\u2019t seem to close completely and didn\u2019t necessarily provide full privacy. The room was still fine for us but we were adjacent to a family with young, very upset, screaming children. After waiting it out it died down so we thought the worst was over. The next morning it continued again and we decided to change rooms and the hotel was very accommodating to this request. We were moved to a room on the top floor which we liked very much. This one was a corner room with a very large 5 piece bathroom. I imagine all rooms in this hotel have their own unique floor plan. The staff at the Orchard Garden is very friendly and helpful. Being in town for fleet week was a fluke on our end since this was just a loosely planned quick trip for us to get out of town. But it made the public transportation a nightmare. We planned to take busses, cable cars, etc., around town but the waits, especially from the Warf, were just too long to waste our time on. We waited for a muni bus for about 30 minutes only to have it wave to us as it passed by because it was too full by the time it got to our stop (happened twice). So to get around town we ended up using mainly town cars because they were easier to flag down and cabs were few and far between and always full. Not sure if it\u2019s always this bad, but it was our experience over this weekend. Up bush there is a small market to get some snacks if you don\u2019t feel like getting them from the mini bar. There is also another small market at Bush and Kearny. We ate brunch at Caf\u00e9 de la Presse across the street one morning and it was very good.

I especially liked the comments about the hotel being quiet since we've encountered noisy hotels quite often in our travels. The hotel definitely met expectations for location, noise level (which was amazing considering the location in the city), and quality of hotel (very nice). We did not eat at the restaurant, so we can't comment on it's quality. The room was adequately sized for a family of four and the beds were comfortable. We had notified the hotel of a feather allergy and our need for feather free bedding at the time of reservation, as well as the day before arrival, but the room had down bedding when we checked in. The hotel did get the bedding changed out quickly and without inconvenience to us, but considering our multiple notifications of the need for down free bedding we expected the room to be ready at check-in. The doorman/concierge we had our first night was very helpful in making restaurant recommendations and the one we went to did not disappoint. Our only issue with this hotel was parking. Although the rate was very high (as with most SF hotels), we knew the rate in advance and had no issues with cost. Our problem was the length of time it took to get our car when we wanted to use it. The hotel parking is offsite and valet ONLY. This means you need to call the front desk to request your car. The timeline was always given as 15 minutes, so we could at least plan ahead to time our call based on the time we wanted to leave. However, one morning we waited over an hour for our vehicle. We sat in the tiny lobby area with our two young children for almost 60 minutes (we didn't come down to the lobby until 10 minutes after requesting our car). It was very frustrating and an impact on our activities for the day. Ultimately it was confusion as to which car the parking attendant was looking for that caused the delay, but the hotel did nothing for us. I expected to be reimbursed for part or all of the daily parking fee, but was given no monetary credit for our inconvenience. I realize that it was an unusual delay, but ultimately the hotel should have taken responsibility and offered us something for our troubles.

The City passes actually saved us a lot of money over that 4 days - the 2 adults in our party got free admission to the deYoung Museum and the California Academy of Sciences (both wonderful and highly recommended), as well as our cable car ride. We only had to pay for the 2 kids. For breakfast at the hotel, 2 of us ate the buffet included in our package, and the other 2 ordered off the menu. The hotel was walkable to Union Square, to the Ferry building and we walked home from a Giants game. My teenage son was impressed with the hotel's commitment to the environment.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and would recommend it to travellers of all ages.", "Date": "August 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ioannina, Greece", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel but it it live up to my expectations\u201d", "Author": "ThanasisNa", "ReviewID": "UR115909169", "Content": "The hotel is next to China town and is very well located for shopping (at Union Square) or to walk around the city centre.

It would have been nice if the fridge was empty or had room to put our own drinks in it, but it was full of mini bar drinks. The room was clean with plenty of towels. And we were happy with the free WiFi. The rooftop patio was amazing and we used it almost everyday after a busy day of sightseeing. Take a bottle of wine and just enjoy the view. We tried to eat at the restaurant for breakfast once, but we were in a rush and the server told us it would take over 20 mins to make our breakfast, so we had to leave. The customer service was good, but not great. Also, we did make use of the various recycling options provided in our room, which was great.

Expedia had a deal on the Orchard Garden for $111.75, and very positive reviews, so we booked it. What a find! First off, you really can't beat the location -- at the foot of Chinatown, it is literally walking distance to the Financial District and Union Square. For everywhere else, do take advantage of the valet parking even though it's $40.00, the doormen and valet were absolutely wonderful -- they immediately unloaded the car for us when we were checking in, and whisked the car away -- only to have to turn around and bring it right back when my friend and I decided to drive down to the wharf instead of getting drenched in the rain. But they didn't mind and never lost their cool or grins (which were genuine & not plastic!). In fact, the customer service was the best that I've had in any of the hotels in the city, bar none. From the front desk to the housekeeping staff, they were all warm and welcoming and extremely helpful. As for the room, it was immaculate and tastefully decorated, and had all the similar amenities that you would find at the Mark or the W. The only issue was that the \"view\" was of a large messy dumpster -- but so what, once the drapes were drawn we forgot all about it. The beds were extremely comfortable, and yes all of the eco-touches are commendable. But like other reviewers I found the toilet annoying -- the handle was hard to flush, and the flow was too weak to do a proper job. I have a low flow toilet at home, but it still does a nice job, so it must be the brand. Oh well, a minor blip in otherwise a very satisfying stay. At the cheapie rate breakfast wasn't included - but Cafe de la Presse is directly across the street, as is a Starbucks, and then there are plenty of dim sum places right around the corner -- so it wasn't missed. Will definitely be staying here again in the future!", "Date": "January 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel ... wonderful, courteous staff ... convenient\u201d", "Author": "Unbiased&FairAdvisor", "ReviewID": "UR93978727", "Content": "First timers to the Orchard Garden (but have stayed at sister property = Orchard) ... Grade: A- (very good), but bordering, close to a B+ Let's get to the review: HOTEL: A very nice small, boutique-ish hotel that is literally at the foot of Chinatown on Bush St... steps from the Chinatown gate (Grant Ave). It is very convenient to obviously Chinatown, Financial District, shopping, and easy walking to Union Square & Market St. The staff was great, from front desk to porters and cleaning staff ... always greeting us with an acknowledgment and a smile, anywhere in the hotel. An A+ for the staff. The lobby is minimal, as expected for this type/size hotel. Upon entering, you are greeted with a warm front desk welcome, and to the right, a split with entry-way to their in-house restaurant, which we did not try (too many other options in SF!). After check-in, we walked a corridor (with decorative, metal perforations to see into the restaurant) to the elevator (qty 2). First impressions: clean, well-kept hotel. Additionally, this is a \"Green hotel\" ... we like that too. ROOM: Our room was very nice. Decor was very light in tone, saturated by neutral beech/blond colors in the wood for headboard, credenza/desk, nightstands, and some muted greens (in comforter/duvet). Very safe decor, maybe a bit too monotone. Comfortable Queen bed with bonus of a comfy couch (seats 3, and probably pull-out for extra people) in a sitting area by the window. View = alley & back of other buildings ...and we did hear the much-dreaded garbage-truck-pick-up in the evening (no biggie... if in the AM, might have been a minus). Fairly standard accoutrements of flat-TV on wall, mini-fridge, pay-for-snacks/drinks, in-room safe, and robes. TV is not movable, so viewing from the couch was a strain, at best. Bathroom was good sized, and very clean with basic toiletries. Some minor minuses that brought our grade down a tad: the toiletries were very small, so tubes of shampoo, body wash were barely enough for one person, let alone two. Additionally, pressing the lever for the toilet felt like a harder push than normal, and it was not a very powerful flush either. OTHER: The hotel goes \"green\" by offering recycling baskets (total of 3) for trash, as well as presumably a low-flow toilet. Again, we had to press the toilet handle hard (felt like it was lifting a bucket) to create the pressure, thus a weak flush. More obvious in their \"green\" effort was the requirement to place the room key in a slot by the entrance to initiate the electricity = European style. If you leave the room and take the key, lights go out, except for a bedside lamp and the alarm-clock. Works for us! SUMMARY: Yes, we would recommend this hotel for a nice, warm, friendly, comfortable stay in SF. It is convenient, stylish enough and very clean. We liked the sister property, Orchard Hotel, a tad more, but not that big a difference. Very good hotels ! Happy Hotel-ing !!

The cleaning is done with green, non toxic products, and the place is VERY clean, without those obnoxious smells or the toxic feel that other places have. I particularly love the light, both coming from the windows as well as from the very well place and pleasing lamps, and the feel of the materials chosen for the bedding. And find the bathrooms very pleasant, both aesthetically as well practically (with details such as a make-up mirror, that greatly helps when I have to take off my glasses!), all spotlessly clean. This time it was even better than before: as returning costumers, and honoring the special occasion, they offered us a room upgrade and a complimentary bottle of wine! Located right by the gate of Chinatown, this hotel is just the best place to walk out and go shopping, sightseeing, or to go to a conference or meeting, as we have done before. The back and interior rooms are very quiet, with very good light, and some even have views of Chinatown. The front rooms (we had one only this time) are also quiet, large, spacious and very comfortable, the kind of comfort that we value: soft and pleasant materials, non toxic environment and pleasing aesthetics, wide windows, good light, nice materials for curtains and armchairs. And the great quality of all the supportive technology: flatscreen TV, plenty of plugs for all our computer stuff, wireless internet, etc. Only good things to say about their service, that was very attentive to our needs and always friendly and present. They were able to accommodate our needs for an early check in, and were very quick to respond to any further requests we had, In previous stays, we have tried their excellent cocktails at their bar and loved them (they use these exquisite organic vodkas and juices as ingredients), and had good meals at their restaurant.

When I did more research, I discovered in the \"specials\" section of their website that they offer a discounted rate of $149 for a superior king room when you book three consecutive nights (\"San Francisco Triple Play\" special valid through 8/31). When I clicked on this special and attempted to book my stay, however, it only offered me the room at the regular rate of $213 a night, $64 more a night! Assuming this was just an error with the website, I called the reservations desk. They couldn't explain why I couldn't book at that rate either so they transferred me directly to the hotel. The hotel staff politely explained that this rate has blackouts, and that I must have been trying to book during the blackout. The special didn't mention blackouts, and I pointed this out. The special is worded plainly and said that if space was available, the offer was valid through 8/31. No fine print, etc.- I was very careful to pay attention. Long story short, they admitted that this is used to entice customers during times of low vacancy and that the rate is only available arbitrarily, i.e., there may only be one room available at this rate on a particular date. I'm upset because it is extremely deceptive to say that a promotion is available until a certain date if space is available (which it was), and then not honor it. I asked if they would honor their special, but they said that they weren't willing to and that the higher, regular rate is the best they could do. Bottom line is that they advertise specials to interest you, then try to charge way more. As a result, I'll go elsewhere...don't waste your time trying to use one of their specials or discounts.

The restaurant looked very nice and smelled great, but we didn't ever eat there because it was much more expensive than other restaurants in the area. The location of the hotel is perfect for tourists and shoppers! Union Square is just a couple of blocks away, as is the Cable Car line. You can also walk to the Muni Station, which is just about five blocks away. My only complaint about the hotel is the business center. We used it various times to buy event tickets and print boarding passes. There were only two computers, and neither worked very well.

We were exited to return to the hotel and got a great deal at the Orchard Garden. The problems started after resting a few hours in the room: inadequate ventilation and poor air quality. First, the windows are plugged (presumably according to California law) and there is a tiny vent underneath the window, but this is not nearly enough for fresh air. I complained about the air quality and was advised that it could be adjusted. I asked \"how,\" and soon realized she was talking about lowering the temperature in the room. I still do not understand how making it colder would make the air quality better...... The ventilation is so poor that the gets humid and uncomfortable even with the air condition on after two normal showers. Frankly: it was unpleasant. Second, there is a sliding door to the bathroom. It is thin and doesn't close all the way. Hence, there is NO bathroom privacy! Third, the air condition system is set up so that the air circulates in both rooms, thus resulting in the smells from the bathroom spreading in both rooms. So, unless you are comfortable sharing bathroom smells and noises with you partner, this hotel is not for you.

Rooms were quiet, clean & comfortable (beds brilliant) and bathrooms provided herbal 'eco' toiletries and large fluffy robes - a nice touch. Staff were all great - very welcoming (as was almost everyone in San Francisco), nothing too much trouble. In particular Art on the front desk was really helpful with advice on where to go and best ways to get there, and nothing was ever too much trouble. We ate breakfast a couple of mornings, and had one evening meal - food in 'Roots' was very good. Location was excellent - just a few strides from the ChinaTown Gate. We walked a lot and had no problem finding our way around. Did also use various transport - cable cars (just for the experience), buses, trams etc - transport system is excellent. On our first full day we took a 5 hour city tour with Dylan's City Tours. There were just 13 of us in a small tour bus, and Dylan is such a great guy we felt like we were travelling with a family friend - highly recommended. We also took another tour to Carmel and Monterey with Great Pacific Tours. Once again a small tour bus with just 11 passengers and a lovely tour guide, Mary. This tour includes lunch in Carmel which was in a lovely restaurant and saved us wasting our limited time looking for somewhere to eat. Also gave us an opportunity to chat with fellow travellers. Most memorable thing we did ourselves was probably Alcatraz - definitely not to be missed, but in line with comments I have seen from previous reviewers book before you travel. We pre-booked and when we visited Alcatraz there were signs up saying sold out for next 5 days. A previous reviewer refers to a 50's diner which didn't suit them - this was probably Lori's and we loved it. I'm a sucker for all the old music and enjoyed feeding the jukeboxes, but more to the point the food and the service were excellent. We much preferred it to Sear's which is highly recommended but which we found to be dark although the food was good. If you are tired in the evening and don't want to walk too far, turn left out of the hotel and walk down about a block and a half to Belden. There are several little bistros along this lane and it has a nice atmosphere. We ate in Cafe Bastille (Parisian) and B-44 (Catalan) and would recommend both. We also had a lovely lunch one day at Pier 39 - Fog Harbour Fish House - clam chowder, swordfish, crab cakes etc. - superb. We also loved the Italian district around Washington Square, North Beach where there are lots of great places to eat. If there are any mechanical/technical fans in your party, the Cable Car Museum is worth a visit. It's not just a museum, it's also the winding room providing the power for the whole system. It's very hot and noisy but very interesting. We all loved San Francisco - the climate (warm while we were there - just needed a sweater in the evening and a jacket whilst on a ferry), the people (very welcoming), the sights, the places to eat, the hotel ... really everything about the place!", "Date": "August 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "NC", "Title": "\u201cWonderful place, great service!\u201d", "Author": "laurenpk", "ReviewID": "UR38443081", "Content": "I just wanted to add the excellent reviews of this place.

They offered to arrange a wheelchair for me and also offered to handle any arrangements that I needed. The staff are incredible! They are professional and extremely helpful! The beds were very cozy and the room was clean and very nicely decorated. I enjoyed the energy conservation and think that more hotels should offer this. They also have evening turn down service which was nice. I can't say much about the view, it was a view of other buildings and the street but you know, the noise was non existant. I read a lot of reviews about noise being such a problem in many of area hotels. This was not a problem at all, I was never troubled by noise. The only down side of the hotel is the honor bar in the rooms. It's a small broken refrigerator that has different types of very over priced drinks. Example, a can of soda is $4.00. Who wants to pay 4 bucks for a hot can of soda? There was a display in my room that was supposed to have snacks (over priced as well) but it was empty. When I brought it to the staffs attention, they advised me that they were in the middle of finding a new vendor to handle their honor bar service which was why they weren't working and items were missing. That's not a problem except that they don't even have vending machines! So if you want a drink, you either have to bring in your own or order from the restaurant. That was a bit of a drag for such a nice hotel. I think they need to just get rid of the honor bar completely and add some vending machines to this hotel. It's certainly not a service to a customer to charge them $4 for a hot can of coke.

With the recent hit to the economy, prices are way more affordable, and that leaves more in the budget for eating at the excellent Roots organic restaurant downstairs. They have decent wireless Internet, as well as a wired terminal in each room. It's free, but for longer stays you have to get a new code from the front desk from time to time. This is my biggest annoyance. The Internet access was good enough to be able to watch a Netflix movie on my laptop, which is saying something. The hotel is only a block from Belden lane (a whole row of four-star restaurants!), and within sight of the tourist entrance to Chinatown. And don't forget Bart a few blocks away. Muni access is equally close, though I don't know Muni well enough to tell you how easy it would be to get to, e.g., Fisherman's Wharf. Most of my business trips to SF involve walking to an office near the Ferry Building/Embarcadero Bart, which is just about a mile from the hotel. I find the rooms to be quiet--even the ones on the street side. If you're SUPER sensitive to noise, you can request an \"inside\" room, where the view isn't as nice, but it's completely silent. The A/C system is all digital and works great. OH, except for one thing: It forgets your temperature setting when you leave your room (the keycard is required to operate the A/C), so if you go out for ice and come back, you'll need to reset your temperature, unless you like 72 degrees.

The room was HUGE for the city. Spacious, clean, beautiful -- great flatscreen TV and DVD player, beautiful granite bathroom, ridiculously comfortable beds and linens, and a powerful shower with hot water for days. My only very minor complaint about the room is that the mini-fridge is one of those sensor-type minibars, so you can't store perishable food you might purchase on your own. We stayed for 3 nights, and on our second night, we unfortunately had some obnoxious neighbors... at 11pm they were playing guitar, singing, banging on bongos and burning incense! (I'm an extremely light sleeper, and the room was VERY quiet -- no street noise, and even these loud neighbors were a somewhat muffled noise.) I called the desk, especially because the incense was bothering me... and they took it very seriously. They didn't merely call the room and ask them to be quiet, they sent up a team of security... the noise immediately stopped, as well as the odor. The next day, I checked to see if the same people would be in the room next to me, and they were -- however, the desk told me there had been a note made in the computer about the incense and noise, and that the people had been firmly warned and they would be asked to leave immediately if I had any more problems. As someone who is a frequent business traveler, I'm kind of used to being sometimes blown off by the front desk, but the Orchard Garden took my complaints seriously. The next night, there were no problems whatsoever. The only overall negative is that we really didn't like the hotel's restaurant \"Roots.\" Food was mediocre, overpriced, not great service.

To get here from the San Francisco airport, just jump on the BART ($5.35), take it to Montgomery Station and walk up to the hotel. 4) The staff is extremely helpful. They upgraded us after I filed a complaint about my room. 5) Our first room (a Junior Suite), although a bit small, was fine with a nice comfortable bed. What we didn't like: 1) We could hear way too much of what was going on in the next door room. We were awakened by the couple next door making love and then literally could hear their pillow talk afterwards. We were very surprised that such a nice new hotel wasn't designed to include adequate sound proofing. This problem was definitely a deal breaker for me and I complained to the front desk the next morning. They were extremely helpful and upgraded us to one of the top floor Terrace Suites which was great. So as I said, I am torn. I really like this hotel. But unfortunately, I am hesitant about going back. My girlfriend, on the other hand, is willing to give them another chance. So, if you stay here, be sure to mention that you want a room that is quiet (especially in the middle of the night).", "Date": "February 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful, quiet, convenient...\u201d", "Author": "nkelley", "ReviewID": "UR24692952", "Content": "I stayed at the Garden this past weekend and loved it!

Room was very quiet, bed and linens were great, loved the recycling bins right in the room too. The bathroom was large and laid out pretty well but I prefer more water pressure in the shower, I have long thick hair and it felt like it took me a half hour to wash it! Loved the EO products provided, especially the grapefruit mint glycerin soap. Would have preferred to receive USA Today rather than the local paper, and never saw the USA Today available in the lobby as was mentioned in the room, but oh well, that's no biggie. Fitness center had nice machines but there are only three (!) - one bike, one treadmill and one elliptical plus a small area with a mat and an excercise ball. I know it's not a big hotel but IMO there should be more machines available, a minimum of two treadmills and at least some free weights. Also thought it was gross that there was no sanitizer to wipe the machines with - yuck. Luckily, there is a lot of cardio available from the city itself :) Did not have room service since there are so many options nearby - Starbucks kitty corner from the hotel, Working Girl's Cafe going the other way (awesome place) and Cafe Amici down the block (wouldn't really recommend that one). Favorite restaurant of the trip? Capurro's down at the wharf - great seafood, pizza and steaks, awesome happy hour and fabulous service. We liked it so much we went there three times in four days! Had lunch at Nonna Rose down by the wharf and liked it alot, and went to the trusty Boudin for tasty and inexpensive food too. Also went to the Irish Bank Bar and Restaurant which I would never recommend to anyone - horrible food, service and the place was dirty. Two out of three of us got a stomach ache after dinner here.

Perhaps the front desk has improved because of TA complaints but we had excellent, prompt customer service. Front desk guys were friendly and helpful. They also rushed to assist us in hailing cabs, carrying luggage etc. We were also pleased to not see hardly an homeless people and so were not badgered or made to feel unsafe during our five night stay. According to many reviews of other SF hotels this is a chronic problem. So we're not sure what to attribute it to- apparently the mayor is asking people not to give the homeless handouts so that they will avail themselves of existing services or perhaps the hotel's location was better- between Chinatown and Union Square. Someone else complained about the mattresses being uncomfortable- we thought they were quite comfy- kind of a firm foam rather than box springs but not too firm. Linens were excellent quality- seemed to be all cotton with high thread count. Climate control was good and the room could be made cool enough at night to enjoy the down duvets. Our \"superior\" room with two double beds facing the front of the hotel was quite roomy but another room facing the back with a king bed was quite small. We heard almost no noise from other guests over five nights but the king bed to the rear reported some noise issues. Street noises were also minimal in our 7th floor room. Bar service was nice and we enjoyed the free appetizers with drinks which seemed quite pricey but are probably standard for big city hotels. The dinner menu looked good but I have a fear of most hotel dining... so often mediocre. We ate breakfast one morning across the street at Cafe de la Presse- a really cute fake French place. The atmosphere was great and would definitely go there again. Breakfast was tasty although an order of toast tasted kind of old or stale.. Espresso drinks were acceptable but not great. We also ate dinner one night up the hill on Bush St at Bar Crudo. High quality ingredients and pretty good but not great unless you are a fan of sashimi.. We thought it was going to be Italian and so were disappointed in the mostly raw seafood menu. A seafood chowder was creamy and good except for cubes of lardo swimming in it. Would be improved by being plainer and less exotic. Had alot of disappointing dining experiences despite reading Zagat and SF Chronicle Best Of. RW Apple steered us wrong on the Tadich Grill- very poor food but nice atmosphere and private booths. Maybe we should have asked the hotel staff for suggestions but we didn't. Our best meals were at the Ferry Bldg. Slanted Door (Vietnamese) is excellent but very busy and expect a wait even with reservations. Also, as you face the ferry bldg, the taqueria in the bldg immediately to the left was quite tasty for lunch. Miette Bakery at the Ferry Bldg had divine pastries- bring some of their packaged cookies home as a gifts. My only minor criticism of the hotel was the daily maid service which was adequate but marginal despite leaving a good tip each day. No eye for detail- so the hotel management might want to consider hiring more females- not to be sexist.. but the maid service was marginal as I say.. kept things clean but not nicely straightened up. Would we stay here again? Yes, if a good rate was available. We had also considered the 480 which had a good expedia rate.

Don't stay here if...you like big hotel rooms and lots of amenties (it's pretty basic); you want outstanding service. On to the pros. The rooms are nicely decorated, obviously new and the beds are extremely comfortable. For a tourist level hotel, it was a pleasure to have turndown service available and they did not scrimp on amenities (shampoo, etc) like lots of the big chains do. Everything was spotless and the bathroom was spacious enough. The included breakfast was basic (think European continental - cereals, fruit, breads, meat and cheese, yogurt and coffee), although you could splurge and pay extra for a full \"american\" breakfast. In a city with relatively expensive dining options for breakfast, particularly nearby in Union Square, the breakfast was a nice touch. The hotel is really central if you want to visit Union Square or Chinatown, and is close to the California Street cable car line. There are lots of close restaurants, and the hotel is happy to give a recommendation (I followed one - the french restaurant across the street, and was happy with it). The cons....the rooms are a tad small and there was nowhere to put our suitcase because the closet was too small. The \"roof deck\" is not anything special - it's just a few tables on a 10th floor roof - not really a great view to boot. The exercise room is clean, but basic. They boast their LEED rating, but if this is really important to you, please note that they actually scored really low. The worst part had to be the front desk service, however.

We paid $250 per night including tax for a standard king room excluding breakfast through the hotel's website. This was the most we paid for a room on our two week holiday, but I gather hotel prices are much higher than average in San Francisco anyway. I'm glad we stayed there as the hotel was lovely, the room was well appointed. Smaller than average but not too small for us. The staff at reception and on the door were very friendly and helpful. Actually, all staff in the hotel including cleaning staff, mini-bar staff and everyone we passed in the building were particularly friendly. The hotel is in a fantastic location, just a 5 minute walk to Union Square, close (maybe 5-10 min walk) to the BART (which takes you to the airport for $5.35) and metro and close to shops and china town. I had read reviews that the rooms can be noisy so we had requested a quiet room. I was very surprised that the hotel had actually remembered my request, especially as I had booked through the website, but they gave us a quiet room (301). Because it didn't face the street the view wasn't great (just a view of a car park at the back!) but this didn't bother us at all - would much rather have a good night's sleep. Don't even think about having a car here though as the one-way streets and parking are an absolute nightmare! We hired a car for our two week holiday but gave it back when we got to San Francisco (but drove into San Francisco via the Golden Gate Bridge and took a look at Golden Gate park and Ocean Beach before going into the city centre as it's not as easy to get out here on foot or by public transport as it is to get around the city centre of course). The city centre is very easy to get around by foot and buses - particularly Union Square, the Marina, Cow Hollow, Fisherman's Wharf, Financial District, Chinatown, etc..The bus network is excellent and cheap ($1.50); your hotel can give you a map showing all bus routes. As our room rate didn't include breakfast we ate out for breakfast; once at Home Plate in Cow Hollow (lovely family-run type place, great value - food was ok) and once at Cafe De La Presse opposite the Orchard Garden Hotel (fantastic food but a little pricey). I'd definitely stay here again. I would recommend it if you are looking for comfort and convenience but not if you are looking for a cheaper option.

Flat screen TV and DVD player, fridge, minibar, wardrobe and a really clever sliding door to the bathroom which mean't you got lots of room in there to play with. We loved the toiletries which were refreshed everyday. Plus the turndown service in the evening where we got fresh coffee for the machine. This isn't a hotel with a view, but we got a good, quiet room up on the 8th floor which we slept so well in.

We didn't even have any early morning wake-up calls from the housekeeping staff like we have at other hotels. The staff on the front desk were extremely helpful. Directions, advice about visiting things, recommendation for late night take aways - whoever you asked, they were very knowledgable. We didn't try the restaurant but it was surprisingly busy at lunchtime with local business people and the smells wafting from it in the evening were delicious. We stayed here during an eight month trip around the world and having stayed at a number of Hyatt's, Sheratons, Holiday Inns etc it was refreshing to stay somewhere independent, small-ish and with people who actually treat you as an individual and not a credit card walking through the door.

The only sign of this we saw that was that little bit different was that it has rescycling bins for paper, plastic and trash in all rooms. It boasts about how it saves energy because it uses room cards that shut off most electrical appliances when you go out - but don't a lot of modern hotels? I jokingly mentioned this to the front desk staff and they laughed and agreed. The front desk staff, by the way, were by in large excellent. Sadly the same can not be said of the waiters at breakfast. One in particyalr was downright rude. The other, however, was delightful. Breakfast is way overpriced - one day they ran out of wholemeal bread and at $18 a day I thought this was poor. To be fair, however, front desk did send the miserable waiter out to get some. The rooms are clean, quietish and have some modern items such as ipod docking stations, plasma tvs and a good shower. All in all it was a nice hotel near the centre of san fran and very close to the BART, cable cars, main bus stops, shops and theatres.

The hotel, built in 2006, is the first hotel in America to use the room key to turn on the electricity in the room therefore saving electricity when you leave the room because you take the room key with you! We found this a bit funny because we've been using this technology in Australia for at least 25 years. It is just at the bottom of China Town and very close to the trolley cars, but it is also only a few blocks from the centre of town where you could catch all different types of public transport.

In San Francisco, a great deal too. We paid $204 per night (AAA) excluding tax, for a room with 2 double beds. Non-smoking, eco-friendly, CLEAN, small rooms (but typical size for the city). We had a 2nd floor room on the Bush Street side, and I cannot believe how quiet it was - almost weird how sound-proof the windows were. Very comfortable beds too. Be sure to grab Starbucks (across the street, on both corners) and take it to the roof-top garden in the morning. Visit the bar in the hotel restaurant (Roots) and have a fantastic free appetizer (garlic fries) during happy hour (4:30-7:00 p.m.). Avoid the pseudo-french cafe directly across the street though - $$$, so-so food, and poor service. Close to Chinatown, Union Square, North Beach, cable cars, BART, Embarcadero, etc. We ate in North Beach every night (walked) and had outstanding meals (try Franchino's) and really great gelato. The walk to North Beach from the Orchard is about 15-20 minutes (Bush to Kearney to Columbus) or about a $5 cab fare. Recommend the evening tour of Alcatraz too - even if you've been on the standard day tour, check out the evening version...special presentations, less crowded, city lights - it's awesome! HornBlower on Pier 33 is the only way to go ($30 per ticket) - and about $6 cab fare. Walk the Bay Area Ridge Trail through the Presidio (free). A great urban trail that winds through forested and historic sections of the park, and culminates with amazing ocean views from the battery bluffs, and a trip across the Golden Gate bridge. Total out-and-back round trip from the Arguello Gate, including across the bridge is about 8 miles, so plan on a 4 hour walk if your fit...and if you're not fit, go anyway. Cab fare from the Orchard to the Arguello Gate is about $8. The Orchard Garden staff is extremely polite, friendly, and helpful. If you need a cab, directions, or anything at all, they'll help. We're a very discerning family, and my travel goal is to find the cleanest places at the best prices - so I don't just throw praise around casually.

One dinner, one lunch for party of three our total bill was around $770 No real view but there are many places in town to visit for a great view. Small room but still ok. 4.

Day shift hit and miss doorman very good but no one explained my room package on our check in which included breakfast buffet and 20% off other dining at ROOTS .

A hotel proclaiming eco friendly but not offering whole grain breads and/or bran muffins on its breakfast buffet???????. Very yummy scones but needed some wholegrains!!!! Wine list is not great but it has full bar. Dinner in hotel was good not great but solid good. service ok... Tips for hotel to improve! I loved the idea of the hotel trying to cut travel industry waste and applaud and will stay with them again for that. Loved the lights out idea with card by door it also help that where did I put that card key anyway feeling!!! They can step it up by not giving such tiny shampoo but adjusting size depending on stay. A few extra amenities make guest feel like they can have a spa like feeling in these simple rooms, SHOWER GEL!!!!!at least no one uses bar soap anymore really! Extra blanket in closet for those who would rather tuck in instead of turn up the heat. Offer filtered water so that guest do not need to purchase bottled water, you can sell reusable drink containers to make up the profit loss! DVD collection is a real bust come on... Pick up a few SAN FRAN classics Birdman of Alcatraz, Mrs Doutfire, Vertigo, and any San Francisco history DVD's.Its not that hard to build a great DVD collection with a few new titles in the mix... Why advertise offering free in room dvd's if all you have is old but not classic b movies? Towel heaters needed in rooms would help cut use of towels and a great touch since heat goes off when you leave room. Reuseable canvas bags for laundry and other items with hotel logo would help promote hotel (see [-] ) Train all staff!!!! I realize many our new since this is a new hotel. TRAINING IS IMPORTANT DO NOT CUT BACK ON TRAINING! Explain the system of logging into internet not just handing a small piece a paper with code on it. Take a moment to show guest around. I called the day before my arrival asking if there was a car rental place nearby and staff responded they were not in rental business and too busy to ask someone else ???????

An encounter that illustrates the helpful service at this hotel: On our last night we fancied going out for a burger. It had to be a burger, nothing else would do! It was quite late and we spotted whom we assumed to be the bar manager having a chat to one of his collegues outside the front of the hotel. We asked about the best place to get a burger considering it was quite late. His sugestions were useful. However given that it was getting on he offered to rustle up a good burger for us in the hotel restaurant if we did not want to chance being too late. This was nice as the hotel restaurant is not realy aimed at the quick burger and fries market! Nevertheless, we had an extreemly nice burger and a glass of wine in the elegant surroundings of the hotel restaurant and with excellent and helpfull service.

We were pleasantly suprised at the quality of the services provided at the hotel. We did not rent a car for our stay in San Fran, so we cannot comment on the parking rates. The location was close to the BART Montgomery station. Just a few blocks away and close enough to walk to. The staff are very friendly. The greeted us every morning when we left and every evening when we returned to the hotel. They were also very helpful in providing maps, directions, and assistance when asked. Always with a smile on their faces. The room itself was cozy. Not small. It was enough room for my husband and myself. We also requested to be away from the noise and got a room that didn't have that great of a view, but since we didn't plan on staying in the hotel room for htat long, this did not matter much to us at all. The bathroom was a nice size as well. One thing that both my husband and I were really impressed with was the hotel's move to being \"green\". My husband has a knack for forgetting to turn off lights as he leaves a room, so the 'lightswitch' that can only be activated by hotel key was a nice touch. This comes in really handy for two reasons: it helps conserve energy by being able to control all the lights with one switch, but it also helps you to always remember where your room key is, and allows you to 'turn off' your lights as you leave the room for the day. <-- GREAT FEATURE My husband and I were not impressed with the prices of the minibar, but they are usually always expensive. We also didn't use the the room service or restaurant, again fo rthe prices. We had Subway Sandwiches form across the street because they were selling footlong sandwiches for 5 dollars. So it is hard to compete with that. But hotel prices for food are also usally high to begin with. Overall, we enjoyed this hotel.

We wanted to go to dinner in the mission on a date before we met up with friends and when i asked the Conceirge where he would suggest he looked at me like I had five heads (most upper scale hotels are spot on when it comes to suggesting restaurants). I explained that a freind suggested Foreign Cinema and Quince but i had tried to make a reservation at both places but they were booked. The man just stared at me and stuttered i asked do you know of anything similar that i might try. He had nothing for me so i asked for a map and he hesiatated for a second like he didnt understand.

Upon our arrival, we were quite favorably impressed with the room. Our room was actually large for San Francisco, and it was quite clean and lovely. The first thing that distressed me about the hotel was the fact that other than one Clif bar, I found that none of the mini-bar snacks were organic. We have stayed in green hotels and inns all around the US and Europe, and this lack of organic food was a big surprise to me. The hotel's restaurant also says nothing about organic foods on its menu, although they note that they use sustainable fish and hormone-free meats. We did eat dinner with them anyway and the food was quite delicious, but I was disappointed that it wasn't what I consider really \"green.\" Now here comes the bad part. When we checked out (after a one night stay) we found out that the parking for one night was $38.00 + $5.32 tax. I live in a city that has very high parking fees, but this seemed excessive. Whatever -- it's just play money on vacation anyway. But we found out, after arriving at the airport, they gave us the wrong car!!!!!!! Another guest had rented an identical car and they gave us his. Our car was still sitting there with a $2000 painting in the back. I called the hotel and spoke to a young man there who seemed to try and put the blame on me (didn't you notice it was the wrong car?). He never apologized, and asked me how I wanted to pay for the shipping of my painting. What? I said I didn't think I should have to pay -- so they shipped it at their cost, but it came damaged because it was packed so carelessly. He told me the manager would call me to let me know that everything was taken care of, but, of course, I never got a call back. There's more. A few days later, I found a charge for over $100 on our credit card. My husband called the hotel and they said they had no record of this charge, but agreed it was incorrect. The charge was supposed to be $43.32 for the (overpriced) parking, and the operations manager said they would refund us the parking fee (since they gave us the wrong car!!). Big mix up. Today I checked the card to make sure they had given us the refund. Oh my. They not only didn't refund us that %100+, they charged us another parking fee! Gee whiz, now they are just dipping into our funds any time they feel like it!

It's a small boutique hotel where the staff were always helpful and friendly. It's a fantastic location; right next door to Chinatown. Union Square and the Financial District are both within walking distance, as are all the shops and Westfield shopping centre. The room was very clean and with it being a 'green' hotel there are separate bins in the room for rubbish, bottles and paper. We had a view of Bush Street which isn't particularly attractive but what do you expect in the middle of San Francisco?!?! There was a safe in the wardrobe along with an iron and ironing board; you also get free WiFi if you have your own laptop. Each room also has a Flatscreen TV, IPod docking station and coffee machine. There was a mini-bar and a tray with snacks that are all on sensors. We didn't eat any of these or use the mini-bar because they were soooo expensive. You get the option of turn down service each night; we didn't bother but it's a nice touch. There is a bistro downstairs called 'Roots' that serve breakfast, lunch (I think) and even an evening meal. We had breakfast included with the price of the room and it was really nice. A choice of pastries, muffins, bagels, fruit salad and cereal; along with tea, coffee and a variety of fruit juices. They also do room service. There is also a roof garden, but that was closed during our stay; we didn't realise though and went up anyway! It gives a fantastic view of the city at night. Whilst we were there one of the lift's broke down which was a bit annoying but I suppose these things happen; it just meant that with only one lift working we had to wait longer than usual. The WiFi also went down due to flooding in the street; but again these things happen, it's not really something that the hotel can control! The mainenaince guys were working all night in the street to try and get the problem sorted though. But the main reason I only gave the hotel 4/5 is because of the gym. They have a tiny room with a treadmill, a crosstrainer and a bike; for someone who works out 6 days a week this was a bit of a let down. You can use a nearby gym but I thought $15 per day was quite pricey so I didn't bother. The bar staff are very friendly, one of them even gave us a free tequila! The staff will recommend restaurants as well if you ask and are very helpful with regatrds to directions etc as well; they will also book you taxi's / city cars to get you to the airport etc. All in all we had a lovely stay at this hotel and would definitely stay here again.", "Date": "October 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cJust Okay\u201d", "Author": "Zusclare", "ReviewID": "UR10126738", "Content": "While we loved the \"green\" aspect of this hotel, our stay was nothing special.

The hotel staff was very nice, but not particularly helpful. For example, when we needed a cab, they suggested we walk a few blocks to another street to find one. Another example, we wanted to go to the movies (it had been raining, we'd already enjoyed two museums) and we asked about nearby theaters; the theater names we were given were totally different from what was listed in the paper.

The place is perfectly located a few blocks away from Union Square and Financial District, right next to Chinatown. The property is impeccably clean, and the overall green-yellow color scheme is as soothing as it is sophisticated. The personnel were generally very helpful with everything with the exception of a single minor maintenance request that has never been attended to, eve n despite an extra reminder. There is a tiny fitness room with just a couple of machines, a business center and a hugely overrated \"roof garden\" which is basically of no use because of cast iron furniture - try to seat in one of these chairs for two minutes in fall and have your butt frozen, or for a change have it roasted after two minutes in summer. My room 1005 - top floor king - was spacious and light. The bed, mattress and linens were wonderful and the two-layer bath robe - from a local company \"Telegraph Hill\" - was easily the best I had ever worn. The bathroom was quite large, with a full bath and vanity mirrors. There was a room safe, a tea/coffee maker, HDTV unit, DVD player and an ipod docking station (=alarm clock) in the room. The air conditioning unit was effective and not noisy at all. My reservation included a complimentary breakfast - unfortunately, the same selection five mornings in a row. Valet parking was $32 + tax. There are just two specific concerns that I would like to bring my fellow travelers' attention to as they may be quite annoying. Firstly, their room access cards deactivate each time you use them to access business center. You have to trot to the front desk to have your card reprogrammed after each visit to the business center. Another - and potentially quite embarrassing - concern is the sliding bathroom door. Not only can it not be locked from the inside, there is a 2 1/2-in gap around the whole door panel opening into the rest of the room. Bearing in mind how exciting all those bathroom sounds - and smells - can be, I strongly doubt this solution was correct...

The staff - from the front desk clerk to the bellman to the restaurant workers - was friendly to a fault! We felt very welcome from the minute we arrived. We had a 8th floor view room with two double beds. The room was immaculate....the beds were insanely comfortable....the sheets were perfect.....flat screen TV...AC worked well...the room was incredibly quiet even though it looked out on Bush Street and was a half-block from the main gate of Chinatown. Your room key-card activates the room's electricity when you enter the room and place it into the power \"receptacle\". A fantastic way to cut down on the amount of electricity the hotel uses! The European buffet breakfast each day was excellent. Fresh baked croissants, fresh fruits, yogurt, cereals, juices, coffee....it was an excellent start each morning! The hotel is conveniently located to Chinatown, Union Square. We actually walked to AT&T Park as well as North Beach from the hotel (about a mile in either direction). However, there is alot of mass transit available close by. There is a rooftop terrace which is an excellent place to read and catch the afternoon sun. I whole-heartedly recommend it! Overall, I'd say this hotel stay was one of the best I have had!

Quick walk to Union Square and transportation to the rest of the city. We booked two double rooms but were not told until arrival that each floor only has two double rooms - so one of us switched to a King room. This was fine with us but you should know this if expecting to be near traveling companions with the same room type booked. We did not get the City view and instead overlooked a courtyard and it was wonderfully quiet. I would definitely book standard again. The concierge at the Orchard Garden was great as was the night staff, who helped with everything with a smile. From hailing us the perfect taxi to recommending two very good restaurants, to getting us to the airport in time, the staff helped make the trip easier. The rooms were very clean and well stocked. The only thing I'd say was a negative was the mini-bar and snack trays which we nor the girls touched but seem to have been sensitive enough that we were charged for a water anyway. Not worth getting upset over but something to look out for. We did not try the restaurant as it was a bit pricey and there are so many affordable options within walking distance of the hotel.

Of all the places we stayed during our trip, the Orchard Garden was by far our favorite. The hotel as well as the room was extremely nice and we thought the amenities/bed in the room (the fact that it is a \"Green\" hotel was a definite plus) as well as the size of the room itself was perfect and comfortable for my wife and daughter. The hotel and lobby were very clean and the breakfast was great - scones, meat and cheese, etc. The location in the city next to Chinatown makes visiting that particular area of the city very easy and convenient. But the most overlooked part was simply the staff - from the valet to the desk person - they were extremely friendly and very accommodating. We had traveled to San Francisco from Malibu the day we checked in ... the staff made our transition into the room flawless, gave us directions and tips, all with a wonderful attitude throughout our entire stay.

However, the rooms are very clean and utilize the small space. The bed is amazing and the flat screen tv with a DVD player is a nice bonus. The only thing that I did not like about the room was the bathroom door, or lack there of. The \"door\" is actually a sliding panel that does not completely shut all the way. The breakfast: Free breakfast is included each morning. The breakfast choices include huge croissants, delicious scones and muffins, fruit, bagels, cold ham cuts, cheese, hard boiled eggs, cereals, juice, and coffee. The scones, croissants, and muffins were all quality and similar to those you would find at a nice pastry shop. The location: What a great location! You are right next to the Grant Avenue entrance to China Town. You are a few blocks from shopping at Union Square. You are approximately 3/4 a mile from Coit Tower and approximately 1 mile from the Embarcadero. We walked to dinner each night and found great restaurants in China Town, Little Italy, and North Beach. There were plenty of Muni bus stops in walking distance and the BART and Muni underground were four blocks away. We called \"511\", which is free if you call from the bay area, which allows you to speak with someone who will tell you what bus route to take to certain places and where the bus picks you up. We easily took the bus to the Golden Gate Park, the Presidio, the Golden Gate Bridge, and AT&T Park. You are in walking distance to many restaurants, coffee shops, and retail stores. However, many of the restaurants close by 10:00 pm. If you are a late night diner, then try Chinatown. Overall: I will definitely stay at this hotel again and recommend it to my friends and family.

Frankly, the hotel breakfast was just as good and didn't cost us anything. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful with tips for getting around the city.
