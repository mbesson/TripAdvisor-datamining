I havstayed previously by myself, but stayed this time with some American friends (who did want to eat McDonald's) and we shared a family room (slept four) which was large and spacious, with its own exit onto the side street - very handy when getting a taxi back to the airport as we could load all the cases without causing traffic problems). We had a key to the external door so getting back late at night was no problem. The hotel is spotlessly clean, internet access is fast and free (rare in Rome), the breakfast is full with a good choice of pastries, fruit, cereals and juices, and the staff are lovely - extremely helpful, very efficient and really wanting to make sure you have a good stay at the hotel. It's about a twenty minute walk from here into the city centre (to the Trevi Fountain, for example). The Metro is good for getting across to St Peter's which would otherwise be quite a hike - and despite all the hype the Metro is not dangerous as long as you're sensible. The 'hop on, hop off' buses run from Termini so again, very convenient. Drawbacks? If you have a lot of bags getting them up the stairs might be a problem - ring the buzzer at the front door and ask the hotel receptiomnist to meet you with the key to the lift (elevator) - makes life much easier. The hotel is situated on the Via Nazionale which is an extremely busy road, so be prepared for some noise in your room.

We chose to stay at the Hotel Gea di Vulcano for 1 our night in Rome after reading the other reviews here on Trip Advisor. We ended up settling on this hotel after weighing the price against other travellers' experiences. What clinched it for us was the lack of bad reviews. The hotel is very centrally located, about a 10 minute walk from the Termini train station. The check-in time was very early (12:30), so it suited our one-day tour plan perfectly. Finding the hotel is a bit of a trick, as it is located in a nondescript building and you have to buzz thorough a big ornate front door into a lobby and then through another gate into a courtyard before entering the building containing the hotel. Then, the hotel is up a couple of floors. We couldn't find out how to summon the elevator (it appeared to be locked), so we ended up walking up the stairs with our suitcases. In hindsight, you should probably tell the front desk clerk that you need the elevator when buzzing in the front door. Being our first time in Rome, we were a little bit worried about personal safety, especially near the train station. The hotel fronts onto a wide, well travelled and well lit street and we did not have any issues returning to the hotel later on in the evening. After checking in, the staff were very helpful, answering our questions and providing tips on what to see and how to get there. All the sights are easily walkable from the hotel; Ancient Rome, the Pantheon, Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain. Our room faced a side street, so it was quiet at all times. The room was much larger than we expected for Rome. The furniture and decor was basic, but adequate and comfortable. The windows opened right up and the air conditioning worked very well. The washroom was bright and clean; however, we found the shower stall quite cramped. There was no safe in the room, but the front desk had a large safe available with deposit boxes if you needed to lock up any valuables or important documents. Free wireless internet is included. The breakfast is nothing special, but Italians don't really do breakfast. A variety of juices, sticky sweet confections, yogurt, cereal, etc are available to guests. The coffee is great though! Overall, a solid pick for a stay in Rome. Perfect if you plan on spending most of your time out and about seeing the sights and enjoying what the city has to offer.

Firstly, we arrived and were told that we didn't have a room (even though I personally called 2 days prior). They found our reservation after I showed the print-out that I had brought.... no problem, simple mistake. They then brought us to a room that was outside of the main hotel! It was a room straight off of the back staircase to the hotel, below the Breakfast room. We first thought that this was nice and romantic... but as our week went on, it was increasingly annoying to walk all the way out and around the building in order to get to the front desk again. And after hours was even more complicated as they shut the front doors to the courtyard. So that was a bit annoying. Aside from that, the noise was a bit disturbing. The windows were not sealed very well, and were right off of a main road, so the sounds of cars and people yelling went on early into the morning. We were able to sleep and essentially ignore it, but if we were an older couple we probably would want a quieter room in the actual hotel.

Months ago I had emailed them and I booked a family \"apartment\" for the amazing price of only 190 Euros/night including breakfast and taxes. I only have positive things to say about this hotel. First the apartment we booked was huge with a sitting area, 2 bedrooms and one bathroom. We are 2 adults and 3 children and we had tons of room to spread out. Second of all I loved the location. It's on Via Nazionale about 2 blocks south of Piazza della Repubblica. It's only a 5 - 10 minute walk from the train station and that was very convenient. There was a supermarket 2 blocks away on Via Nazionale heading the other direction. It was about a 10 - 15 minute walk to the Trevi Fountain and the Spanish Steps and about a 20 minute walk to the Colosseum. What really set this hotel apart was the friendliness and the charm of the staff. When we arrived we were greeted by Francesca and she cheerfully showed us our room and that if you book the apartment you have a separate entrance on the side street. Then later that night another lovely and helpful woman Alessandra helped us to choose a restaurant for dinner and was so warm and welcoming that it really made you glad you booked this hotel. Not to be forgotten was the woman who served the breakfast in the morning. She didn't speak any English and I don't speak any Italian but we smiled a lot at each other and she was so nice as to give me a tray to bring back some breakfast food to our sleeping children in our room. There is a computer in the lobby that was rarely busy and the guests were welcome to use it. If you bring your laptop you can use their wireless internet in the lobby too. The day before we left Francesca arranged for a cab to come for us and Alessandra stored our luggage for us during the day after we checked out. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.

Also within close walking distance is Termini train station and not too far off are all the many monuments such as Trevi fountain and the Colliseum. Francesca at the front desk made us feel at home from day one! Thank you for your warmth and excellent service! She and Maximo at the desk made each of our 4 days stay here truly special from their restaurant recommendations to their personal suggestions of where to find certain things. The room was simply gorgeous! The charm of the room including the floor tiles were stunning and the size was unexpectedly large. We had a large queen/king bed and an extra alcove that had a separate single bed for our 4 yr old child with its own cabinet. There was a small stocked mini-ref and a large bathroom with shower and small coffee table and chair. Very clean, spacious and quiet since it was on the 2nd floor and facing the inner part of the hotel/courtyard. (Included pics with this review). The neighborhood was very safe and we enjoyed strolling even late at night with our child. The hotel has a very small sign up front (easy to miss) and is located on the first floor inside a little charming building compound (1st floor in Europe is 2nd floor for us in the US) and although there is no wireless access in the rooms, they have it in the lobby and also have a laptop for guest use. They close the front door at night so you have to take the side entance on the side street but it was no incovenience at all.

The issues: 1. The bed we had was clearly sagging on one side. Though it didn't cause us to lose sleep, it would have been good for the hotel to replace the bed as it was clearly sagging, even when we weren't on it. 2. The hair dryer in our room worked, but when I lifted it to turn it on, the cord detached from the base (easier to imagine when you know what their hair dryer looks like). Someone had clearly broken it prior to our arrival and tried to hide it. 3. The shower head in our bathroom was too heavy for the base. It was one of those shower heads that could be hand held, but in this case, it had to be hand held because the weight of it kept bending the holder over....

We were in the suite which would easliy accomodate 4 adults. It had 2 bedrooms and small livingroom/sitting area and a large bathroom that was immaculate and newly renovated. Both bedrooms had airconditioning units which worked very well in the 90+ degree Rome weather we had. The location worked well. Everyone says its close to Termini...but it is actually closer to the Republicca area (opera)...much nicer area than Termini. A short stroll up Via Nazionale to the Republicca metro stop and you can get anywhere in the City. We felt very safe traveling on the Metro from this location and took it to the Vatican (San Pietro) and also to Termini to transfer to the blue line to the Colliseum, Forum, Palantine Hill etc.... You can walk to Piazza Navona, Trevi Fountain and the Pantheon if you put on your walking shoes or take a taxi. If you are taking the train out of Termini Station, or picking up a car like we did...you can either walk the 10 minutes up to the top of Via Nazionale then take a right, walk a few minues and you will see Termini or take a short cab ride or take the metro one stop to Termini. The only place to be extra careful is at Termini...my husband stopped a thief from stealing a businessman briefcase while standing in the Avis Car rental line. Just always be aware of whats going on at all the busy sites....even at the Vatican! Breakfasts were good, and they did have limts on toast and cappucinos, but there is plenty of good croissants and roles and juice, etc...that it was not an issue for us. We used the via Napoli entrance for the suite, which is the side street to the left if you are facing the front of the building on Via Nazionale.

PROS: -spacious and quiet room. I don't *think* the hotel has any rooms on busy Via Nazionale, and our room was very quiet (when the window was closed). Bathroom was huge (for Europe). -close to Termini station. We just walked to the hotel from the station upon our arrival, and it was a quick 5 min walk back to the station to catch the express train to the airport two days later. -great breakfast. I'm a huge muesli fan, so any place that goes beyond the standard croissant fare and give you cereal is OK in my book. We were somewhat put off by the strict \"breakfast quantity limits\" that were handed to us at check-in and also posted in the breakfast room. But we had all the food we wanted/needed and weren't hassled by anyone, so no complaints. CONS: -the furniture/carpet in the room was a little dated, so no awards for being modern. Not too bad, though. -Regarding the aforementioned huge bathroom: the shower head was one of those 100-stream types and was very nice, but that also means it was big and heavy, and would only stay upright when the water was turned on. This wouldn't be an issue, except that when I turned the water off at the end of my shower, the shower head came crashing down, fell off its cradle and hit me in the head. Happened to both me and my gf on our first night...poor (and somewhat dangerous) design. -Location. This seems to be a \"PRO\" for many people, and even I have listed the proximity to the train station as a plus above. However, we found ourselves wanting to spend more time in the Pantheon/Piazza Navona area of town at night, closer to the historic city center, so while the hotel was great, and is still walking distance (or a cheap cab ride) to everything, I would probably try to find something in a more central location next time. But if you know this is where you want to be, it's very convenient to the Republica Metro stop, easy walking distance to the Colosseum/Forum, etc. Really just a matter of personal preference.

I was travelling with three young adults. We arrived in Rome at Orly and travelled by bus to the Termini. We then walked with bags to the Hotel, I had read that the Hotel could be difficult to find at night so I was prepared. There is a small sign with the hotel name beside the front door. However if you arrive at night you may miss it as the door is shut. You just ring the intercom and they are very prompt at comming to let you in. The gentleman was very friendly and took us to our room which was not with the rest of the rooms. You accessed it from the side street through another door up a few steps and it was by itself. We were blown away by the room and the space! It had a first room with two pull out twin beds, we only used this room to visit together in the evening, then a large hall with a large bathroom off of it (shower only). Then you had the next room wich was a double and then another room with two twins. All the rooms were very spacious and nicely decorated. They had nice amennities and big towels! They cleaned the room each day very well. The breakfast was plenty of food, which I had read the other reviews that mentioned the rationing of toast etc. This is true they have a limit on how much of each item you can take, however they give you several items. We had no problem with not enough food and the group I was with ate a lot! We are not a high maintenance group though. We wanted a place to stay, eat breakfast and take a shower and this exceeded our expectations. The few questions we needed answered they were more than eager to help and if they didnt know the answer they phoned someone who did. We had an early flight out and they arranged a cab for us and phoned us when it arrived. And then you add in the location, well it was perfect. As others have said you can walk to all the sights very easily. We took the metro to the Vatican and walked back. If you decide to do the Metro just be prepared it is crowded and you must be on alert for pick pockets. We also went out to the Appian Way and Catacombs and in this instance we took the bus. So this hotel is close for walking to the major sights and close to the termini for trains, busses and metro. I cant say enough good things about this hotel, I would definately return here.
