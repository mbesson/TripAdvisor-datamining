I asked that Hotwire to just fax it to the hotel but even the fax machine had problems. And worst of all, the front desk was speaking Spanish to the other staff there with a frown on her face. I felt so insulted. I have worked with a few companies and I know they can be fired for doing that.

Other than that, everything was perfect. The room was incredibly clean. Housekeeping was so courteous--the kids often left stuffed animals in every corner of the room and housekeeping made the beds and put the stuffed animals up there so they were ready for bedtime. We were hardly there during the day but when we left in the mornings there were always people sweeping the walkways, cleaning the pools, making sure the garbage cans were emptied. The food was so good too--and a great deal. The breakfast buffet and drinks for 2 adults and 2 kids was only $25. The room had a mini-fridge and the hotel has mini-golf, basketball, and laundry facilities on site as well. We never took the complimentary shuttle to the parks, but it is offered. We had a rental car and the drive was honestly maybe 5 minutes. For the price we paid, I really wasn't expecting what we got.

Got a great rate at $55 per night, including taxes. We had read reviews and booked a \"tower room\", and not one of the low-lying ones down the back. That was a good decision! We really liked our room. Spacious, little kitchenette with fridge, coffee maker and microwave, sizeable bathroom, and all the things you otherwise expect (flatscreen, wifi, etc.). We requested a higher floor, and had great views over the attractions further away. Fireworks in plain sight was great. Ample parking, huge lobby and restaurants/bars on the premises or close by. We were happy to've picked a higher floor, as in the evening there would be Karaoke sessions, which were quite loud. You would probably hear them on the 1st or 2nd floor rooms.... A lady in the lobby (the \"concierge\") sells your cheaper theme park tickets, but in order to get them, you have to go through a gruelling 3 hour time share presentation at a nearby property (Westgate resort, also owner of the Ramada, funnily enough), which was said not to take more than 90 minutes...... Yeah right, Big mistake from us Dutch people, looking for a bargain. We saved over $200 on 4 parks, but in the end I'd rather pay up...... Apart from that, no major dramas. We enjoyed our stay, and actually booked another night, as we \"were not done yet\" with the theme stuff......

My daughter and I were traveling separately and planned to meet up with the group there. I booked a Deluxe Tower room two months before our anticipated stay. We got to the hotel about 10:30pm and upon check in we were told that two entire floors of the tower had been shut down due to an electrical problem; there were no tower rooms available and they would have to put us in the older motel-style rooms. They \"graciously\" took $10 off the price of the standard room. I told them I didn't want to be placed where people would be walking by the rooms all night (each room has a very large window and the doors open onto the exterior walk-way). She put us on the second floor, facing the pool and told me it would be quiet because there were lots of empty rooms down the hall. When my husband and his group arrived, I found out all their rooms were in the Tower part. We walked over and rode the elevator to every floor. There was power and people on all floors. We also saw people, not with their group, coming in with suitcases, like they had just checked in. I went back to the desk and there was a different attendant there. I expressed my displeasure and told him what the first person had told us about two floors being closed. He said that she had \"misspoken\" (read: lied), that they had electrical problems but only in a few rooms and no, they couldn't move us that night, but to check back in the morning with the morning manager on duty and see what he could do. He gave us free breakfast vouchers for our stay. We went back to the room and I went online (with my 3G, could never find the WiFi). I pulled up the hotel reservations and the \"deal\" they gave me was actually $15 more per night than the advertised AAA rate, which was how I booked the first room. Also, it showed they were sold out. I think they overbooked and since I arrived late at night, I got whatever they had left. That night was the worst I've ever had in a hotel. I'm no prude or diva when it comes to the furnishings, etc. The room was rundown and a little musty smelling, but it was clean. The shower ran hot and the TV worked. However, the beds were awful-would have been more comfortable on the floor, the air conditioner blew forcefully and directly on my bed closest to the door, but if you turned the air off, you could hear everything in the adjacent rooms. Our neighbors came in after us. It was the middle of the night by then and they stood on the walkway outside our room smoking, talking loudly and banging on the metal railing. Their baby was crying for a long time. I called the desk and they had to send someone to shut them up. There were also people walking in front of our room and because of the large window and no insulation, you could hear everything. Neither my daughter or I slept all night. The next morning we went back to the desk and I talked to a third person about the situation and was basically told that it didn't matter that I had a reservation for a Tower room, that the reservations really meant nothing other than confirmation that you'll have some kind of room! Wow! This totally shocked me that he admitted that. When we realized that my husband's room had a king bed and a pull-out that could accommodate us, we told the desk we would be checking out early due to dissatisfaction with the room and moved into his room. Fortunately, they checked us out with no argument, but also showed little concern over our poor experience the previous night. The breakfast buffet was average. The pool looked nice, but we were gone during the day when it was open, so we never used it. Great proximity to the parks.

(Make sure you get a display ticket when you check in) We ate breakfast in the restaurant and opted for the $9.99 buffet which was ok consisting of hot and cold drinks, fruits, scrambled eggs, streaky bacon, pancakes(shop bought), scones, toast, small sausages, cereals and porridge, made to order waffles and omelettes. Some days the breakfast was better than others. Gratuity is included automatically in the bill so for two people you end up paying about $24. Staff were friendly and willing to help. Lovely pool area but never got to use it as we were out all the time. There are lots of good restaurants along the 192\u2026Kobe (Japanese) and Sizzlers in particular were very good. Internet was only available in the foyer for us since we were not in the Tower rooms. Only small complaints\u2026.walls are a bit thin and we could hear people talking late at night on our first night, secondly the fridge in our room made a humming noise which can be annoying if you are a light sleeper but after the first day I hardly ever noticed it.

Nothing much in the area other than quick service buffet restaurants a few discount shops etc. I would stay here again as a great stop for Disney. The hotel is great base for exploring, if your looking for a luxury resort to chill in for a week this is not the product on offer here!

I am here attending a 5 day conference at a nearby resort, and wanted to save money. I booked this with Southwest Airline and got a great deal. Sometimes you get what you pay for. Not in this case. Here's why... The good things.. GREAT location near the Magic Kingdom entrance, lots of restaurants nearby, easy access to highways, and they have a very, very nice staff. I stopped dropping names due to concern for them, but the front staff and the breakfast staff are nice, friendly, and helpful. You can get a USAToday with Breakfast for free, and my room in the 300's section was VERY quiet. The maid service kept the room clean and did not touch my stuff. It has two pools and can handle kids easily. For those on a tight budget, this place has great value. It is a bit huge in that there are over 400 rooms by my calculation, but you don't feel it walking around. Some rooms are two story outside door entrance, and they also have a 8 floor tower for more money. Since I had a first floor outside room in the back, I was near an ice machine, and I could park my car 4 feet from my door. Speaking of Parking, a number of hotels charge to park in their parking lot, even if you pay to stay! This hotel does not, so you can save even more money with their free parking! Also, the entrance is gate guarded, so people can't just enter the location, unless you have a room or are checking in. Now for the bad.. if you are a light sleeper, do not take a room pool side as the music stays on loud and clear until 10p. The facility is old, and the walls porous for noise. You can hear people talk next door, or hear them walk down the sidewalk past my room outside; especially if you take a room pool side. Being in the back dropped the noise and traffic immensely. When I checked in they put me in the 100's area and asked to be moved to the 300's.. and the staff were great and supportive. Upon getting ready for bed, I laid out my towels, only to find big bugs jump out of the bath floor towel and a face towel. The front desk offered to move my room but I stayed and asked for clean towels for all areas. That was 3 days ago, and no bugs since. After much thought, I am finding many locations are designed this way, outside doors, where the cleaning person leaves the towels and doors open for bugs to come it. So, if you want a inexpensive room, you must accept this as happening. Or you can go to another hotel for twice the price, and pay for parking. My two female colleagues were aghast and would have demanded changes. But they stayed in plush hotels and more than twice what I paid. I did not demand anything and I am okay. There are not bedbugs here. Speaking of Beds, the mattresses are hard and not soft.

The main attraction for this hotel is the fact that it is located on Highway 192 just several minutes drive from the Disney World gates.

First, inside access \"tower rooms\" and second, a grouping a two story buildings with rooms either facing the parking lots or the courtyard pool area. These rooms have outside access. I stayed in a non-tower room facing the courtyard. The room was value priced at $43.00 per night plus tax. Upon entering the room there was a definite strong cleaner/bleach smell - but the room was clean. The bed was comfortable with decent linens and the towels in the bathroom were thick and fluffy. The non-tower rooms are older but my room was very spacious with a table and chairs to work or eat. WiFi is only available in the tower rooms or in the hotel large lobby area. I asked for a room closest to the tower/lobby area and had no trouble connecting to the internet. I was surprised by finding a more up-dated flat screen TV however there was no microwave and the cube style mini-fridge was located in the bathroom area. Many hotel amenities were available including gift shop, fast service deli, and full service restaurant. I appreciated being able to get a fast start to Disney in the morning by ordering from the ala-carte breakfast menu and receiving very quick service. There is also a $9.95 breakfast buffet with a station for custom omletts. This was too much food for me in the morning!

I went with a friend and our intentions were to choose a nice, clean, safe and economical hotel close to Disney, and this was a last minute choice, however, a good choice. The hotel is pretty big, with tower rooms on one side and rooms overlooking one of their pools on the other. Unfortunately, we didn't get to really venture out into the hotel and look around and see everything they had to offer, because Disney would tire us out and we'd leave early morning and come back late at night. Before staying here, I read the suggestions that the tower is the place to stay, and that's where we did. The room was nice and spacious for two young females. It came equipped with a fridge, microwave and storage space to put groceries; we definitely made use of each. A problem with our room was the ac...it would come on/off when it wanted. Honestly, the hotel was pretty bare. It wasn't really active; we didn't see it thriving with people, but that was fine with us. The only time we'd see a huge amount of people at one time was in the morning, waiting for the shuttle to Disney parks. There was a restaurant, and a diner type of food area, we didn't try either, due to the fact that we had purchased food at the Walmart, enough to last us the 5 days we were there for. The pool area that is overlooked by the pool area rooms was pretty bare-hardly anyone out there. In addition, I wanted to clear up some things that were said in some of the reviews: 1) Walmart and/or Target are not within walking distance, we actually had to drive about 15-20 mins to get to a Walmart. 2) The outlets (international drive) and universal are not close by. 3) We didn't encounter any \"sticky fingered\" maids, ours were pretty nice. If your intention is to go out to Citywalk every night be prepared to spend around 40$ on a taxi each way from this hotel.

We read the reviews on here but we can not find and neither can my family, any fault with this hotel. Our family from our booking with BA in the UK, had complimentary upgraded us to the tower block, which we took; however the rest of the family all stayed, one in a room overlooking the pool, and the other round the corner, on the same balcony. All were clean, and fresh, and everything you needed, as for most part of your holiday is spent visiting and doing stuff. We all had lines over bath for washing, we all had fridges, iron and ironing boards, and hairdryers, and coffee machines. All showers had new shower heads, and worked properly. As for the air conditioning, they all worked well, and although they do make a sound, its barely noticeable, unless your an insomniac!! Rooms were cleaned everyday, and towels changed if you wanted them to be, by leaving them on the floor. Us with 2 children, had most time plenty of rubbish, in our bins, and messy sinks, and these were cleaned and new again every day. The hotel staff were helpful and courteous. The hotel small diner was brilliant for a quick meal. We had pizza, 14\" for $8 and the chicken wings were great after a tiring and long day at the parks. The swimming pool was lovely and refreshing, not dirty or messy, and the towels were washed and put back reguarly. My Family said they had no problems with anything in their rooms or with staff, other than one room the tv didnt work, but that was resolved as soon as it was reported, and it wasn,t going to spoil the trip anyhow! There is also a laundry room, $2 for a wash and $2 to dry, and its clean and great for family who want to take a small amount of clothes to wear.This hotel i would recommend, and we would stay again. It is 1 mile from world drive to Disneyworld and parks, and 20 mins from Universal. The only difficulty we had was that we didnt hire a car- (now we spoke to the lady at the large desk who arranges taxis etc (not the wdw tickets etc lady/man!!) She arranged a Chrylser voyager 7 seater for just under 3 weeks with action rental car (locally) it cost in total $1007, and they came and picked us up to sort paper work, and dropped us back after we returned the car, very helpful and cheap. We would recommend a car, because although they do have free shuttles, you have to undersatnd that there is 2 in the morning, one for magic kingdom and one for epcot, and only 2 back, around 9.40 + so for us it was no good as we needed to leave the parks early to eat etc, also the disney water parks closed at 5, so it was then a matter to get from there, so i would get a car so you can do the parks at your leisure, unless of course you really don,t drive!!! As for supermarkets, this hotel is at marker 5-6, and walmart is up at marker 10, along with steak and shake, publix, walmart on 27, and super target,etc There is a bus that takes you into magic kingdom every 15 mins from outside hotel, you get the 55 to celebration,(2mile) and then the 56 into MK, only costing $2, so you do have another choice. There are perkins, bob evans, ihop and McD,s, shoneys, sizzler, and ponderosa, and golden corral, 7eleven, within 5 minutes walking distance. Beware of the heat, and not really loads of pavements for pedestrians, but you can do it. The local supermarket next door is handy for last minute bits, but i would go to the bigger stores for cheaper stuff. This hotel was greatly located and on our last night we got a local cab, to orlando,s miller ale house, a big A++++, if you like seafod and steak and ribs, a lovely family place, it cost us $9 one way, and its approx 3 mile up 192. We thought it wasn,t a bad price? We throughly enjoyed this holiday, no bad experience at all, and we had an 8 yr old and a 16mth old with us. They provided a cot after we requested it, and to note they allow you the extra time in the room til 12, if you need it then $10 an hour after, which we took advantage of cos we didnt leave til 2pm. We were here during the Skunk show and we didnt have any problems with them, or the skunks, and there was no noise or rowdy guests as suggested in other reviews. The hotel has security, and if you get a car just let them know and they,ll give you a permit for your car. All in all, if your from the UK, and you wanna be close to wdw parks, and the other parks, and supermarkets shopping malls, then this is the place for you..Don,t be put off by the reviews, some people spend too much time in their rooms nit picking, and trying to find fault, instead of enjoying florida. [Just as a side note: make sure you get your tickets in the UK, as they are hoppers, so you can hop into different parks on the same day, and they inc fast pass..This hotel is merged with wyndham, who have a new hotel/vacation club/timeshare right next to WD typhoon lagoon, my family of 2 adults took up their offer for a 90 min talk, with breakfast and free taxi to WDW parks or back to hotel; and you can either get $100 or WDW tickets, but this is not true, you end up staying longer than 90 mins, the free breakfast is some egg, bacon and croissants, its meager, and it cost my family $22 for the taxi to take them round the corner to typhoon lagoon. The tickets they requested was 10 day park hoppers inc water park visits, and they didnt get them. Instead they had to top up their tickets to hop as they were 1 park a day, at Disney which cost another $55 each so they were supposed to save $120 but in the end it cost them in time and money, which they are now complaining about here in the UK.] Don,t fall for this scam! It is not Ramada but Wyndham who are the offenders...

The ribs from their Smokehouse Restaurant will melt in your mouth, and the bartenders at Mulligans make a great Margarita. The atrium area adjoining the large pool has four nice pool tables and lots of outdoor seating. The whole place seems to be a Wi-Fi hot spot, and even my temperamental cell phone got great reception. My spacious room in the Tower offered a spectacular view of the fireworks from the Magic Kingdom and Epcot, every night. The room was bright, very clean, and had both a refrigerator and a microwave.

We had decided to upgrade our room 6 weeks before departure to a pool view room for an extra \u00a35 per night.Glad we did as part of the hotel is where the rooms overlook the car park & a building site (closed hotel) next door! However, when we arrived my daughter's bed had sheets with bloodstains on! We reported this to reception, who apologised profusely & the sheets were immediately changed.The room was very clean,all electrics were fine-we had clean towels daily & the beds were changed as & when we asked. Air conditioning was on all the time due to the humidity & worked great.The buffet breakfast was OK but we thought expensive for what was on offer, so we bought cereals/milk/produce as the fridge in our room was more than adequate. Food at the snack bar was excellent value & huge portions. Would maybe stay there again & would like to try the tower next time-location for the parks/Florida Mall are perfect & we found the staff helpful, obliging & courteous. Only big gripe I have is that the safety deposit box is not in your hotel room-it is at reception & when there were other guests checking in or being dealt with by reception staff we had to wait ages for attention. We definitely did not like that when you were accessing your safety deposit box in the small room behind reception that other guests are also allowed in this room at the same time. I thought that this was wrong that other guests are allowed in there at the same time and some of them just entered when we were in there without asking if it was OK.I feel that staff should have allowed access to the safe one room at a time only-this takes away the point of privacy/security when accessing your safety deposit box. We asked about this & staff told us that it was better for security to have safety deposit boxes at the reception desk instead of in the rooms-I completely disagree with this, we would rather have the privacy of the safe in our room-then only you have the access & view of what is in your safe.", "Date": "August 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cHated It They Need 2 Close It Down !!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "shimerathomas", "ReviewID": "UR117278700", "Content": "They charged us 3x's..... we were suppose to have the law enforcement rate they put is in the parking lot while the hotel was basically empty ( all women and children) the rooms were smelled like cigarette smoke and chlorine.... the frig was nasty they had roaches,ants, and water bugs ( I have pics of them) the supervisor refused to speak with us we were force to upgrade because if u cancel they would had charged our card ( because u have to cancel 24hrs b4 check in ) security harassed us, the staff was very rude, had to get my own towels,the front desk did not answer the phones, they didn't know how to communicate well, they stole money from us, the shuttle was a night mare and the supervisor needs a GED .....The so called manager told me my family and we should had been in the hotel when it burned down ..... and his name is Andrew.

The room was clean and well-maintained but dark. They have a large pool in the courtyard which we expected to be packed with kids, but it was not busy at all.

There was one little snag: When we reserved the room in advance, we did not use our Wyndham rewards number because you can usually give them the number when you pay for the room. When we went to pay for the room, someone else had used their own Wyndham number to earn points on their own account. I assume that it had to be someone who works at the hotel or who handles reservations...

I took her word that it was a nice place. Even though I read other reviews before arriving....I read the good and the bad ones. I was willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. Mostly because of the no cancellation policy. When my transportation van arrived at the \"gate\" the security guard had to verify I was a guest. The van driver proceeded to tell me that he was relived that I was not staying at the property next door and that the surrounding areas was improving since that next door property burned down a few weeks ago. He said there was a lot of drug use and he believed that there was some sort of meth lab that caused the fire. Great to hear!!! Anyway, the front desk clerk asked if I wanted a 1st floor or 2nd floor. My original reservation from the travel agent was for a 2nd floor. I feel safer on the 2nd floor of motels. I told her 2nd floor please. She proceeded to check me in and gave me my room key for a room on the 1st floor ! I said I wanted a 2nd floor room. We got our new room key after a look of disgust from the desk clerk. This hotel / motel is like a maze. She told us we had to go past the first pool...which we did. But from then on....a complete maze with dead ends. Needless to say, after traveling all morning to get to this place I was not very happy about that. A little bit of warning would have been nice about all the dead ends. The room, when we finally found it....after passing all sorts of trash in the walkways, stunk. It had not been vacuumed in what appeared to be a very long time. I went to get a tissue from the bathroom and the tissue was discolored...and not because it was getting close to the end of the box. My son had his laptop with him and tried to get online but was unable to. I was told there was WIFI. If there is the signal is incredibly weak. I immediately called my travel agent and told her that I can not stay here. We tried in vain to get online to find another property. Travel agent was useless....but that is a whole other story.

I have never written a hotel review before but I felt compelled to do so. First I say I stayed at the \"hotel\" as despite being clearly advertised as a hotel, we stayed in the inn next to the hotel. Outside our room we had a view of the building site next door which was operating a very loud bulldozer and there were a gang of hooded teenagers hanging outside the door. After feeling a like a prisoner within the room, my parter quickly complained and we were moved to a room overlooking the swimming pool. In this room the furniture was very dated, there was a massive hole in the sofa and there were insects in the bathroom, however I felt that this room would be quieter and that I would get more sleep away from the building site. How wrong I was. The hotel likes to throw functions for birthdays/reunions and there are a few function rooms around the resort. What they don't tell you is that they arrange outdoor parties, in the area surrounding the swimming pool. Now I am a very deep sleeper, I have slept through alarm clocks and fire alarms, and yet these parties would constantly wake me up and continue until about 2.30am. I complained a few times to the main reception and nothing was done. They clearly care more about the funding taken from the parties than their guests. Now 2 in the morning may not seem late while you are on holiday but considering the shuttle to disney leaves at 7.40, there isn't too much time left to sleep. As for the \"free\" shuttle bus it was a disgrace. This bus was one of the main reasons we stayed at the Ramada Gateway and yet chose to pay for taxis, rather than use the shuttle service. Now the shuttle service operates for 4 different hotels, 3 of which are very close together. However, despite three of the hotels being in very close proximity to one another the shuttle driver actually drives past the Ramada Gateway (and another Ramada hotel) and drives to a hotel called \"Champions World\". This additional unnecessary journey added on about 30 minutes to our return journey and I am still baffled as to why the Ramada guests could not have been dropped off first. As the shuttle bus accommodates 4 hotels it was always packed. After our first night we decided to use the shuttle bus which would pick us up at 10pm from magic kingdom. When we arrived at the stop we were concerned with the number of people waiting and even further concerned when the bus arrived already full. When the bus stopped everyone scrambled towards it, everyone was pushing/shoving/swearing/shouting all in front of very small and tired children. The shuttle driver refused to come back and turned some families were turned away. The bus clearly drove with far too many people squashed onto it and it was an awful way to end a lovely day out. I am shocked at the standard of this hotel and I will never stay at a Ramada hotel again. The staff within the bar, cafe, and restaurant were lovely but I could not wait to get away from this place.

I made a reservation while en route (was told very specifically that I would need to have this charged to my credit card since it was past the cancellation time which was fine with me since we were on the way) and also called the property itself so we wouldn't have any problems. When we arrived at 2am, the front desk informed me that the hotel was full and there were no rooms, even if I had a reservation. He wouldn't even help us find another location (at 2:30 in the morning). It was only after 45 minutes of begging that I was given a room, after calling central reservations and still being told that \"yes, you have a room - you have a reservation\". #2 - There are 2 very different types of rooms and hotels. You will notice in the pictures that there is a tower with very nice rooms, fluffy comforters, etc; however you may end up in the back with exterior corridors, old dated rooms, bad beds that move if you lay on the side, and not even an elevator if you are on the second floor. Apparently there is a rate difference for these rooms. #3 - Was told that we would have breakfast included when we made the reservation, but had to argue to receive that also. #4 When I spoke with the manager, I have to say that he did move us to a very nice \"tower\" room and gave us coupons for the breakfast, but he was VERY patronizing and tried to make sure that I thought he was doing something special for me. In actuality, he gave us what we reserved - a room with interior corridors, breakfast and queen beds at the rate that we reserved. When I arrived home and really thought about it, I called Ramada/Wyndham customer service. They wanted to refer me to the manager, so I declined since I already had spoken with him.

They should tell you that if you pay a certain price you will be staying in the inn and not the high rise. Since I didn't know I stayed in the inn. The rooms in the inn definitely need updating...old dreary paint, smoke detector was falling out the wall, toilet didn't flush too good, and one of the outlets by the sink didn't work and meanwhile the others were very loose and had HOLES around them making me very cautious about charging my electronics. Also the coffee maker needed serious cleaning which I ended up doing myself. The iron was about the most updated thing in the room. We had the pool view so that was good, but if you plan on staying here anytime soon (in the inn), make sure you don't get the parking lot view because you will see a demolition zone and hear the noise all day! The pool was very clean and heated and they offered towels and plenty seating area. NOW the FREE SHUTTLE....well they don't tell you its first come first serve. They also don't tell you that the suttle picks up other people from other hotels which means that there are even less seats on the bus.

I was a bit suspect when the walls of the bathroom were painted yellow, but after careful inspection, saw that it was clean. There was a mini fridge in the room we took advantage of and it kept drinks and cheese sticks cold. The air conditioning worked great during a hot week and I was grateful for that! This particular hotel was very affordable and had some nice perks. The pool and play area in the center of the room groupings was very well designed and not really full. Most of the time we were the only ones using those facilities. They also had a great little basketball hoop area. The best part was a snack bar by the pool which was quite inexpensive. The TV only got 7 channels in our room. Two of them were in black and white for some reason. However, the free internet worked great and was something that was more important to us personally. Who goes to Orlando to watch TV anyway? That issue may have been solved by a call to the front desk, but we really didn't care, and didn't make that call. The service from the employees was great and I always found them attentive and anxious to be of help. All in all our stay here was pleasant and we will stay here again next visit.

It is not a 5 star hotel so we were not expecting luxury, only a good bed, shower and a/c. We stayed in two rooms in the Inn side at the very back part of the hotel, with easy access to the parking lot and to the pool, which was nice. We had our room cleaned twice daily, around 8-9 am and then again at 1-2 pm. We didnt use the restaurant so I cant comment on that. The check in desk was a little bit busy but it was because there was only one person attending. Dairo checked us in and asked us if we wanted 2 separate rooms or 2 connection rooms and also he asked us if we needed a parking permit so he directed us to the concierge desk where a lady gave us the permit and asked if we had any time available to attend a timeshare tour. We simply told her that we were not interested and she didnt put pressure on us. The room was bigger than those at Disney's All Star and Disney's Port Orleans Riverside ( have been on both ), even though it needs remodeling: a spot in the rug, some mold in the bathroom, nothing big. There's an internet room which costs 20 cents for each minute and apparently there is wifi but I didnt use it. The a/c worked perfectly and the beds were very comfortable, it had a mini fridge which we used to freeze the drinks, tv with local channels and 2 or 3 hbos, There is a mini laundry which we used twice, ( two dollars each load, we bought the 3 in 1 Purex soap for 3.39 at Walmart and it worked perfectly ). We used the mini fitness center once, and the pool twice. There are many retaurants and shops nearby but a little bit far from HAO HAO Chinese Kitchen restaurant ( 5479 Irlo Bronson Hwy. ) our favorite restaurant, try it! They dont have late check out so we had to purchase an additional night because our plane departed at 2 am, so beware! I dont give this hotel an excellent rating because as I said, it needs some remodeling in the rooms, but for the price ( 494.00 for 2 weeks for one room) what else can we ask for!

I was really worried by all the reviews on this site that we were going to a crappy motel, but we were pleasantly surprised! I am guessing that the people who gave it bad reviews are expecting a 5 Star resort, which it is not. For a 2.5 to 3 Star hotel it was wonderful. Security at the gate made sure we were on the reservations list which was nice. The front desk staff are a little hit-or-miss. The man checking us in (Mr. Conti) was a jerk. We told him we did not have a car with us and then he writes us up a parking pass and does not give us the shuttle information! We had to go back down and get the suttle times. The gal who checked us out was very sweet and kind. I liked her. The free shuttle was something I was worried about because not many people had written about it on here, so here is my review. We took the early 7:40 shuttle each morning with no problems and easy transfers to all parks from Magic Kingdom. It was not crowded at all. For the return shuttle it only picks up from Magic Kingdom and Epcot at 10:00pm and 9:45 pm. That shuttle was very crowded and we were forced both times to transfer to different shuttles at the 2nd pick up. We were not very happy having to stand on the bus the whole way back. Also, you will have to take a taxi back to the hotel if you choose to see the Fantasmic show at Hollywood Studios at 9pm. They do not pick up there and there is not enough time to get back to Magic Kingdom in time for the 10pm pick-up. We ended up buying some breakfast items and our alcohol at the Kings Supermarket next door because it was WAY cheaper than eating or drinking at the hotel. There was a mini fridge in our room so we had milk, juice and cereal. We also ate at the Ponderosa the first night. It was pretty good. I found a 10% off coupon on their website and used that. Housekeeping did a great job and the air conditioner kept the room really cold. It was a little loud, but as others said, we were exhausted after spending 12 hours at the park so we slept fine. The carpet was clean and looked newer. We did not encounter any bugs or insects in the room. The shower head was a little bit low for my 6'1\" tall husband. Our room was in the first section of the 'inn\" with a parking view. Very easy to get to, just on the other side of the first swimming pool. The time-share people did not speak to us at all. We purchased our Disney tickets through Disney.com. That was the cheapest I found. The hotel is actually called the Ramada Plaza, so make sure you tell people the \"Ramada Plaza Gateway\" so they know where you are talking about. There is a Ramada Maingate across the street that the shuttle people tried to take us to. All in all, we had a wonderful time in Florida!

We've had some hit and miss rooms on our various visits. Since our last visit, they seem to have renovated some. There is now a guard in the guardhouse (never saw one before) and he was friendly and quickly sent me on my way to check in. Nobody was at the front desk when I arrived and it took about 5 minutes for the clerks to come out of the back room to assist the guests in line. Check-in went quickly after that and we were off to our room. The room was at the back of the property, so there were only a few other guests around, which made it very quiet (which was nice). The room looked to be freshly renovated, but we were missing a side chair for our table and the toilet was broken. Maintenance was able to fix the toilet in about 20 minutes, but took half of our towels with him and never had anyone come by to replace them. The mini-fridge is way too small. It's meant to only hold a couple of bottles and the freezer portion is an absolute joke. The bathroom was tiny, but clean. Beds are fairly hard, which we like, so we slept comfortably. If I need to stay more than one night in the future, I don't think I'll stay here again since the mini-fridge is useless to us and we bring lots of beverages from home to take to Disney. One other thing - I think there is only one ice machine in the non-tower room area that I have ever found to work. The guide map for the hotel shows a bunch of ice machines around the premises, but most are either non-existent or broken.

It was nice a little bigger then our room the refrigerator was double the size of ours and it had 2 sinks a walk in closet and a flat screen tv. The beds also seemed more comfy. The view was amazon! We will stay there again next year I plan on calaling in the next few months to reserve our room. While there the hotel looked very full but everyone was helpful and nice.they were remodleing 2 rooms a few doors down from us and when I say remodleing I mean that. We walked past and the rooms were bear every inch taken down. the floor, walls cealing sink and toilet were removed along with all the fixings (beds, dressers ect) so whenn the remodle its done right.

Upon check in they stated a room by the courtyard(the pool) I said no they said I had to have some kind of proof to show I booked in the tower the confirmation number was not enough.

We got a great deal and were very excited until we read the reviews on this website and few others. WE WERE SCARED! People were describing this place as a dump. HOW WRONG THEY WERE.

We arrived at the hotel at 11:30 am and were able to get rooms. We asked for the rooms to be in the quiet section because we had small kids and we wanted them to take naps without too much outside noice. We received two rooms on the ground floor facing the 2nd smaller pool, which was practically deserted at all times probably because was not heated. The rooms were in the inn section, I believe building 4. We were so relieved to find the rooms very clean and everything working properly. We did notice that the tub needed to be repainted, but for an occassional shower it did not bother us at all. Also the internet in our rooms did not work.

I checked this site regularly for guest feedback and was distraught to find some of the reviews of this hotel were very, very negatve. It had reached a point where we had discussed going back to our travel agent to see if we could change to an alternative hotel before we arrived at a hotel from hell.............how sheepish did we feel to arrive and find everything was what we had hoped for when we booked. From the start...: Very easy to find on the 192 highway. Close to the interstate, and literally 5 minutes from Disney property - absolutely excellent location. Checking in - Admittedly we were staying during a quiet time of year (as confirmed by a member of staff) so can not comment on busy times, but checking in was very fast and efficient, handled by very pleasant staff (a theme that continued through our stay). No hard sell whatsoever on timeshares, only had to speak to the concierge to get our parking pass, and even then he was nothing but helpful, giving us a few maps, coupon book, magazine on the local area and highlighting where we were in relation to the attractions on the map. The Room - having stayed in budget hotels in the UK and abroad, this was what you would expect, have paid for and serves it's purpose. Think of a bog standard Premier Inn with slightly dated decor. Clean, tidy and pretty comfortable. Two Queen sized beds, shower/bath, loo, sink, hairdryer, mini-fridge and large flat screen tv. The large windows are a problem with privacy, but curtains drawn/lights on and it's not an issue. Cleaning service was excellent. A lot of US citizens do stay at the hotel along with other international guests; for a weekend of our stay we had some \"gangsta rap\" types staying next door, could have been a bit intimidating but they were friendly enough. In regards to our room, we were on the first floor of the motel section facing the car park. I had e-mailed ahead requesting this, and whilst I did not receive a reply or acknowledgment of my request, we had what we wanted (could be a coincidence but they could have put us anywhere, so who knows). Some small issues with the magnetic key cards. The receptionist addmitted the strip was crap - get it wet or near a mobile phone and it would need reprogramming. Not ideal, happened twice, but was sorted very quickly and pleasantly. One other issue was that we could not get our door to lock one morning. Turned out the batteries in the electronic lock had gone, needed a hotel engineer to fix it. Was told 20 mins, but waited an hour. Reception explained it was due to a management meeting, were very apologetic and fixed very quickly once he arrived. Didn't bother us too much - depends on your temperament I suppose! Only stayed by the pool for one afternoon - once we did wish we had more often. Clean pool, complimentary towels for poolside and friendly guests. The pool was a bit chilly though. Other facilities.... Deli - Never saw this open duration of our stay so couldn't comment on what it's like, no explanation on why it was shut, but we never asked. Wi-Fi - Only available in the reception area, crap connectivity but we only wanted it to e-mail home. Complained in passing to the manager without realising who he was, and he commented it is something they are looking at. Management - apparently the hotels have just been bought and taken over so there may be further improvements on the running of the hotel(?). Safe - A \"behind reception\" safety deposit box system in place which we used everyday. This is a free, handy service; but can be a bit awkward. Receive a key when you ask to use the service, this key and a reception key are required to open your box which means you need the receptionist to be free to get in it. They leave you to it once you're in (which may mean waiting a few mins to get it locked up if they are busy). Still, better than nothing. As mentioned, the location of the hotel is excellent. There are lots of amenities close by. 2 steakhouses are within walking distance (2 minute walk), as well as a bargain world gift shop, an electronics/camera shop and a small supermarket. A couple of \"gas\" stations are within a minutes drive and there are plenty of other fast food, all you can eat restaurants and gift shops around. There are 2 large supermarkets (Super Target and Publix) about 5-10 minute drive away. It takes about 35 minutes to get to the far (Universal) end of International Drive (If you go the non-Interstate route. About 20 minutes via the Interstate). We were very happy with the hotel, quite annoyed that there are so many negative reviews on this site and can't really understand where those people are coming from. We will happily return to this hotel again when we return to Florida. I am also recommending this hotel to my sister and her boyfriend for the trip they are planning next year. It isn't perfect, but having stayed at both I-Drive Quality Inns, and a couple of Kissimmee area Villas, this is certainly no step down or horror show as described elsewhere.", "Date": "October 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saltash , Cornwall", "Title": "\u201cPerfect hotel/ perfect holiday\u201d", "Author": "Martin4040", "ReviewID": "UR84923230", "Content": "Please do not take any notice of the negative comments- this hotel is excellent, the staff are always helpful and will go out of their to help you out, we stayed in the tower so i can't really comment on th inn but request a tower room, we had 2 queen size beds and cannot fault the cleanliness, the hotel has a games room and internet access, the bar is a slight negative as it closes at about half ten not late enough for us!, (Happy hours 5-8), The restaurant is superb clean with a variety of food and plenty of it!!

The Tower, though a bit pricier, perhaps offers a better quality experience. But for the purpose of this review, we will focus on the motel portion of the property. Since value is the predominant reason why folks would likely choose this property, I will offer some trades of what you get and what you don't get for the price. First, what you do get is a relatively clean room with two queen size beds (rather than the \"norm\" of two doubles). You can book up to five guests in this room which is great for a family like mine where most properties tell you to get another room. Other amenities include: single-cup coffee maker, ironing board and iron, desk-top-size refrigerator, alarm clock, 27\u201d LCD TV, and a Gideon Bible. There were also no hidden fees, like resort access fees or extra person fees. We paid $31.20 per night and were billed $31.20 per night plus 13% tax. What you don\u2019t get is a microwave. You also don\u2019t get a continental or any other sort of breakfast included. There is a restaurant and bar on site. Not too expensive, but it\u2019ll set a family of 5 back $45 for breakfast. It is something to consider when pricing other properties. The room experience was lacking. I did keep reminding myself that I\u2019ve spent more money on rooms not so nice. But it was a bit difficult to keep convincing myself. The drapes were heavy and dark, but didn\u2019t close off all the light. The door stuck on the jamb and required a bit of force to close all the way. Light could be seen around the door when it was closed. Housekeeping was generally pretty good, but there were dust bunnies if you looked for them. There were substantial cobwebs above the doorway and dust balls in the bathroom vent. Mold and mildew were almost completely non existent. Maintenance was also a bit lacking. The toilet had a leak and would refill about every 20 minutes. The faucet handles on the sink at the vanity also leaked, and were very difficult to shut off all the way. My thought is that with the money saved from energy costs between the door and the leaky water, they could really step up the housekeeping. Shower temperature was adequate but not overly hot. The beautiful 27\u201d Samsung LCD flat screen TV was unfortunately fed a poor TV feed with most channels (except the hotel channel) coming in fuzzy. AC worked great and offered us consistent sub-70 temps during the night and helped keep the humidity at bay. The pool seemed nice, but we frankly didn\u2019t have time to enjoy it. Over all, this was a nice property that we wouldn\u2019t mind staying at again.

The room was a bit dated and was clean on arrival although we found the cleaning staff to be a bit lazy (beds only made up daily changed every 2nd or 3rd day unless you took the time to catch the maid and request the beds be changed). The air conditioning was nice and cold although very loud and there was something in the hotel room making both of us come out in a rash and feel very hay feverish. The pool was clean & quiet and there was never a problem getting a sun lounger. We only ate at the hotel restaurant 1 night and it wasnt really anything to shout about and not great value your better off walking along to the ponderosa. The concierge were polite and friendly but not very helpful and must have been working on commision from the taxi firm operating from the hotel grounds. I was only 20 when I went so I couldnt hire a car and my boyfriend doesnt drive so getting to the shops & theme parks was a bit of a nightmare. the hotel had a shuttle to disney run my MCO express (3 trips to & from magic kingdom per day) which was always crammed full with people having to stand if you got the last shuttle home at night. the driver was constantly on his mobile phone speaking in spanish not really paying attention to the roads. The attraction tickets sold from the hotel are fairly priced but if you ask about transport for example to premium outlets, universal studios or discovery cove they concierge will advise you can only get to anywhere by taxi which is kinda expensive. We found our way round using local transport using Lynx buses (the stop is alligators bluff opposite the ponderosa restaurant) the drivers are so helpful and will tell you the right buses to get on/off and where to get your connections etc. cheapest way round is the lynx day pass for $2 each or they do week passes as well. overall the hotel is not bad value but unless you have hired a car you will struggle to get to any attractions except disney. Good restaurants, gift shops, nightlife a short walk from this hotel, we felt perfectly safe strolling back after a meal in the small hours All things considered for a basic quiet hotel on a budget it was ok but I believe there are better hotels in the area with shuttles to other theme parks (universal / sea world etc) would be less restrictive if you have a hire car", "Date": "March 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Louisville", "Title": "\u201cI would stay at this hotel again, they were very helpful.\u201d", "Author": "tammeadam", "ReviewID": "UR59134055", "Content": "We stay with Wyndham when we travel because they offer a great rewards system, plus they are always very clean and nice rooms.

We were really pleased with our decision - the room was on the 4th floor and very peaceful. I think the rooms are adequate - you're not paying 4 star prices so won't get 4 star quality! What you will get is clean well-equipped rooms with a great daily maid service and towel change. We found the staff a little sullen sometimes but generally they were happy to help.

I don't recommend the Smokehouse Bar and Grill - it's OK if you get back late and can't face going out somewhere, but is very over-priced and the food's not great. My kids eat anything but didn't finish their food, which is a great indicator! We tried it for breakfast on our first stay, but found there was a very poor selection compared to somewhere like Ponderosa, and was more expensive. Needless to say, we didn't eat there again. Location-wise, it is right on the side of a main road so sometimes have to queue in traffic to get in/out of the car park, but the plus-side is that there are lots of restaurants etc very close-by.

We first stayed at the Ramada for three nights then took a Caribean cruise and returned to the hotel fo a further four nights. Following reading some of the comments on trip adviser I was concerned to say the least but have always tried to follow the positive comments rather than the negative. Remember this is a three star hotel. The room that we had was large bright clean and comfortable. It had two large beds ample storage, mirrors and table and chairs. There was a small kitchen area that had a sink, microwave, fridge, coffee maker, bottle opener, Iron, ironing board and cupboards. The bathroom was clean and bright and with a bath and overhead shower , there was a good supply of lovely clean white bath and hand towels plus least four face cloths towels every day. The water was hot and the air con worked well. Check in was efficiet and most helpful, I asked if we could have two top floor rooms in the tower area as they were reccomended on trip adviser. We were promptly changed at no extra charge, the rooms were on the front with views of Disney. The pool area was pleasant with clean towels available all day, we did not try the pool but spent time sunbathing round it in comfort. The reception staff were all really pleasant and helpful without exeption. Safety deposit boxes are in the reception area and are free . The only downside for us was the bar was mostly open open from 5.30PM to 10pm. We would have welcomed a lunch time drink and again at bedtime. I must stress the bartender Chris was first class and more than helpful with local advice. The consiege desk was always open and I believe staffed by Westgate the time share company, unfortunatly the staff on there did not offer the the same level of service as the hotel reception staff. We asked for a taxi one night and was told that they were only allowed to ring one company, after 45 mins we gave up and walked instead. ( the two on the desk were busy playing computer games) We did agree to visit the timeshare site which we were not over impressed with and had to listen to really loud music while the salesman tried to talk to us. It was not a hard sell and when we told them we were not interested they were polite. These negative points in no way spoiled our enjoyment, When I had a couple of minor problems they were dealt with immediatly by the reception with good grace. For a three star I think this hotel does well and I congratulate them on their efforts I feel that the Ramada has had some prety unfair feed back.

And if i had had this info before i went it would have made things a whole lot easier. When i read the bad reviews i just ignored them thinking it was people being snobby. Im a student so used the not the nicest of conditions but i was surprised when i arrived. One review said it felt like being in a horror film such as Vacancy. I do agree with this. That was exactly what we thought when we arrived it just seemed really dodgy and the rooms were identical to a motel in a horror film. However after being there a few days you do realize that it is completely safe place to stay. I did think the other bad reviews were making it out to be worse than it was, but the room is pretty bad. Like it smells pretty strange and the bathroom is just gross. There were hundreds of dead ants in it every day when we arrived home. The bed and sheets were clean thou - so just the bathroom and smell really. Also was the odd bug found. The maid service was excellent thou, made the room feel alot nicer to come back to. The staff are pretty rude as mentioned in a review. Like when arriving and checking in they spoke in spanish (obviously about us). We were not made to go to the concierge desk before given our room key, probably cos we were a young couple and obviously couldnt afford to buy into time share. However older couples and families in front of use were. So thats a pretty bad thing, When all you want to do after traveling is get to your room and you have people shoving time share at the promise of cheap tickets down your throat. We chose to stay in this hotel over a villa as we did not want to hire a car and thought people would help. However nobody would help us with anything. The hotel reception and local tourist info points know nothing (apparantly) about the public transport. Yet conveniently all are friends with this guy that runs a shuttle to universal for $20 each, each way. Anyway getting around was OK. not the best but ok. The shuttle that the hotel runs leaves at 7:35am, 10.15am and 12.05 am. With return times being at 6pm, 8:15pm and last one at 10pm. Which is the time the fireworks start at Magic Kingdom. The ones at hollywood studios are 10.30pm. So if your wishing to see the fireworks you will have to pay aroun $25 dollars fare in a taxi back to the hotel. Yet many of the drivers we experienced did not know where our hotel was. And it is not easy to direct to either as all the roads look identical. Anyway to get to places such as universal studios here is the way to do it - without paying for a taxi (which cost $40 each way). You get the the Links buses from the disney transportation centre. (which is where the hotel shuttle drops you for the parks) So you catch the links 50 to Sea World, then the 8 to Wet and Wild and then the 37 to Universal. (dont believe someone when they say its a 10 min walk from wet and wild!) To get to and from the disney transportation centre (the disney transport system place) you can also get the links buses. To get from the Ramada to the centre catch the 55 (the stops near the hotel) then the 56 to the transportation centre. So if you go to universal without using the hotels shuttle you will have to get 5 buses in total to get there. Kind of annoying really. But after youve done the journey a bit you get used to it. Just make sure you know the last times for all the buses. (the 55 stops at 9 so doesnt help if your planning on staying in the parks late) We never went in the hotels pool so cannot comment on that. The reason being it was very crowded and we were intimidated by the big groups in and around it. Anyway i hope this helps somebody as we were very stressed about how to get around the first few days. And as i have stated none of the staff will help you as everyones interested in selling you something. We only paid \u00a3200 each for this holiday as it was extremely last minute so we were pretty satisfied at the end of the day. But if your planning on paying a large sum i strongly advise you to look elsewhere for accommodation. We would have been so angry if we'd paid much more than that for what we received. And that price included the flights - so the hotel much have cost hardly anything. Do not pay much to stay here. And do not think my review is exaggerating. Its telling it a it is. There were ants and funny smells.

The hotel was clean, and the guest services employees were very helpful as far as printing out directions to the area.

The problem with relying on TripAdvisor is in trying to find a current review for your hotel. (It's really helpful for people to review hotel stays promptly and consistently.) There were reviews for the Ramada only a couple of weeks old, so I booked here. I stayed Dec 28th thru 30th and will leave the morning of the 31st. Yep. WILL leave: I'm there now and had to write. I looked for a room while we were in Orlando visiting family. I drove up to the attendant's booth at the Ramada's entrance to find out about rates and he said that they had rooms starting at $49. I parked and went into the lobby and they directed me to the house phone. The lady on the phone said rates started at $79. When I asked about the $49 rooms, she said I had to go to the concierge desk for those rates. That was a \"Come listen to a short spiel about our timeshares in the morning and we'll give you your rooms for $49 each night.\" No, I said. \"Ok. how about we give them to you for $45?\" No. \"Ok how about we give you one night free? What about tickets to a show? Discounted Disney tickets.\" No. I'm on a tight schedule and I'm not interested in buying a timeshare. So I hopped on the internet and booked the rooms for $71.95 per night at Expedia. The room was fine and they let us check in early, so that was a small plus. Contrary to popular belief, not all hotels have a minimum free continental breakfast. The Ramada's was $6.95 for adults. As an earlier reviewer said, the parking lot view is a disaster for quiet evenings or sleeping through the night. With cars beeping on and off, pulling in and out all night, we could hardly sleep and add to that the loudmouths a couple of doors down that had the party in their room... well not \"in\" their room - more like on the sidewalk spilling over into everyone's room, and you have an aggravating, frustrating and unhappy experience.

However, the Ramada opposite offers free shuttles to all major theme parks whereas we forked out $40 for a cab (each way)!! If you're not driving, check out other hotels for their shuttle services. * the rooms are great, no problems whatsoever and the maid came in every day. However, we had a room facing the parking lot and were frequently woken by cars in the car park. Most cars beep their horn when the central locking is activated/de-activated and considering the times people arrive, this could drive you mad! Perhaps ask for a pool view room. * there are two pools in the hotel, one is empty as they don't allocate rooms around that area so you can get the whole pool to yourself. * the breakfast buffet is worth giving a miss. Better and cheaper just a short walk away. For any young people looking for nightlife and so forth, skip this area as it's very family orientated and head to International Drive instead.

After a few days the free WiFi broke down so we asked for an other room which was no problem. The second room was a smoking room, we don't smoke, but didn't smell like an ashtray at all. The WiFi worked and the room was clean but the fridge was old and small. I asked if they could move the fridge from our first room to this room and that was also no problem. All 5 weeks the staff was very friendly. Room was cleaned every day, got clean towels every day and clean sheets every 3 days. Housekeeping was very friendly but should learn English so they understand you when you talk to them. We felt safe in the hotel, security staff walked around all day and at the gate was a security guy every day. They also drove around the parkinglot frequently.

Three days after arriving at the hotel we found out that our flight operator XL had gone bust and as there was no information anywhere, no one to call or talk to!!!! we decided to see if our reception might be able to help us or at least point us in the right direction, they didn\u2019t have any information so we turned to the concierge desk (directly opposite the reception) and all they were interested in doing was selling timeshare to us!! we were not at all impressed with this, purchasing a timeshare was the last thing on our minds, we thought this was very bad taste indeed!. So warning to watch out for this these people they are very very pushy, best to not make eye contact!! The only other minus is the internet access at the hotel \u2013 it was not cheap to use and the internet connection was so frustratingly slow, it is not worth using, you are better off finding an internet caf\u00e9 instead! There were two pools in the middle of the motel section, we didn\u2019t dare use them as they looked really dirty, like they hadn\u2019t been filtered in ages!", "Date": "September 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester", "Title": "\u201cWhat do people expect for their money?\u201d", "Author": "shaun5797", "ReviewID": "UR19938138", "Content": "Having read the reviews before we arrived for our 14 night stay, my friend and I (both 21) were both a little dubious to say the least. However, when we arrived we were more than pleasantly surprised. Ok, so it isn\u2019t 5 star luxuries, but then again, we didn\u2019t pay 5 star prices. After all, when you\u2019re in Florida there is so much to see and do that it is only necessary to have a base to sleep in at night. The room we got allocated could have easily been the one in the pictures on their website- clean and spacious. It had all the amenities such as:- air con, iron, ironing board, cable TV, mini fridge, hair drier, soap, shampoo and conditioner, shower gel, shower caps and a coffee machine (which got replaced as soon as they were used and no they wasn\u2019t charged for at the end of our stay) The sheets were changed regularly and they checked to see if we needed clean towels when we were there (more often than not, the two of us didn\u2019t require another 4 bath, 4 hand and 4 face cloths every day) or replaced them when we wasn\u2019t. We thought that the free safe was a nice touch, as everywhere we have stayed at previously have charged an additional fee (and for air con for that matter). We found all the staff really friendly and couldn\u2019t say a bad word against them. In our opinion, they always seemed to be surprised when we used our good old British manners, may be they aren\u2019t use to people being nice back to them. The only negative that I must agree with regarding previous reviews is the privacy issue. It is true that if you have your curtains open in the motel rooms people can see in. However, in my opinion it is more of a design flaw of a typical motel. Fair enough, some blinds wouldn\u2019t go a miss but even then I\u2019m sure our curtains would have stayed shut. But to be honest I can\u2019t say it posed a massive inconvenience as neither of us are in the habit of sleeping with curtains open. During our stay, when we used the pool, we tended to use the \u201cheated\u201d one as it was more central to our room and can safely say that it was very clean and tidy. I don\u2019t recall seeing any insects floating around in it or around the complex in general come to think of it. However, do people really expect every insect in the grounds to be eradicated? We can\u2019t really comment on the food because we never ate there, especially as there are so many other gut busting eateries a short walk away like Ponderosas for example. As for the time share issue, we didn\u2019t experience or see anything to suggest that was happening. Maybe they can pick out two students a mile away! :-) Having stayed there, I wouldn\u2019t hesitate in staying there again or recommending it to friends and i urge people not to take too much notice of the reviews- make your own mind up or pay for 5 star.

Having read the poor reviews before we went went we decided to book another hotel (Renaissance - Sea World) 4* for our return stay. (a good move) On arrival as expected we were put into a motel type room overlooking the car park. The cars were only feet from the windows making you feel very vulnerable. My 10yr old felt scared and we barracaded the door to make him feel secure. The room however was clean and towels changed daily. The wardrobe area was a simple rail next to the sinks which was too small. You can't open your curtains or the world sees inside your room (so you live in darkness). The hotel provides a free safe behind reception which we always used and would recommend. A positive - The location turned out to be great, a simple short drive to Disney World and the free shuttle bus was fine. Just up from the hotel is a fantastic Black Angus Steak house as well as a Ponderosa and sizzling grill, plus various shops etc. We discovered later that the hotel attached to the Steak house has a booklet called \"Enjoy florida\" - near the back is a 15% discount voucher for the steak house. We had breakfast one day in the hotel and it was Fine, the staff were lovely. One night we wanted some food in the room but the restaurant closed at 10pm which was annoying. The only advantage of the motel room is the quickness to the pool (behind). I worried about the pool at first as it was a bit cloudy but the kids had loads of fun in it without any problems. The smaller pool at the bottom of the hotel was full of insects etc, and looked horrible - we wouldn't let the kids in. I never saw or spoke to any timeshare people, and it was never mentioned when we spoke to staff who were polite and helpful.

We were aware that this hotel was not a 5 star hotel, but you do expect certain standards. We have two children aged 4 and 9 and after arriving in Florida we were extremly tired and could not wait to check-in to our hotel. Upon arriving at the hotel we were immediately pounced upon by hotel staff trying to force a time share meeting down our throats (which would have lasted at least 1/2 a day) in return for discounted Universal tickets. This was the last thing we needed as we had two very hungry and tried kids. We said that we were not interested and that we would like to check-in to our room. We were horrified to see that we had been allocated a room in the Motel side of the hotel. It was terrible. We had been given a ground floor room which over looked the car park. The room was dark and dingy, you could not even open your curtains as you were overlooked. (There were no blinds). We did not feel safe staying at this hotel. It was like gangstervill. There was not a safe in the room, so you would not leave any personal belongings in the room as you felt that as soon as you left your room your belongings would not be there when you returned. The wiring to the television was not safe. There was pubic hairs in the bath. The fridge was dirty and rusty. It looked like there was mould on the floor. There was no way that we could stay for two whole weeks at this hotel. We went to speak to Pablo, the hotel manager, who said that if we attended the timeshare meeting he could upgrade us free of charge to one of his villas, but within one minute one of this offer his staff immediately said that all of the villas had gone!!. He then proceeded to offer us 100 dollars to attend the timeshare meeting for our inconvenince. All the hotel staff were interested in was selling you a timeshare. It was getting really late now and was too late to sort anything else out so we stayed for one night and thought maybe we could get hold of the holiday rep from COSMOS to try and sort something else out tomorrow once we had a good night sleep. There was NO WAY that we could stay at this hotel for two weeks! The following day we spoke to the most unfriendliest receptionist and we asked her if she had a telephone number of the COSMOS Rep, she gave me a number, which turned out to be completly wrong. She then commented that we had only arrived yesterday and that it would be 2-3 days before a rep contacted us. We found this to be completely outragious that a rep was not even there to greet us at the airport, you would at least expect a welcome pack at the hotel, but then to be told that it could be 2-3 days until someone saw us. There was no way that we could wait another 2 days, so we therefore checked out of this awful hotel and booked into the Disney Carribean Beach Hotel and then proceeded to have the most wonderful two weeks holiday. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL. THE STAFF ARE NOT HELPFUL AND THIS IS THE WORST HOTEL I HAVE EVER STAYED IN IN MY LIFE. PLEASE TAKE MY ADVICE AND DO NOT STAY HERE.

I have stayed in many hotels from 1 - 5 star in a couple of countries now and would put this one on the same level as a holiday inn.

It was a little disappointing to have to keep the drapes closed while we changed etc. Would cut back on their electric bills....

I started to walk back to my room defeated but my little girl said \"Mama, why don't you just ask for some extra blankets?\". Great idea. I turned around, went back and asked the girl at the front desk for some blankets and guess what? They just happened to find a roll-away that was available. We had 5 people in our room and it was plenty big enough but I still can't figure out why they only left 2 towels and 2 washcloths each day. We had to call room service daily to get extra towels and washcloths or I chased down the cleaning ladies in the morning to get more. I would stay here again though.

We would not recommend this hotel to anyone. We thought we were getting a good price and were prepared for a decent place as promised. What we got was an old room nicely looking over the pool in their older motel section. The carpet was stained and not well cleaned, bathroom in poor shape and the promised internet connection after calling tech services we were told it had been down in the motel section for a long time with no intention of repairing the connections. Our motel door also had to be forced closed to be secure and the handle would only open the door if you pushed and pulled up. Very unsafe. We booked through a timeshare program and the program was awesome but while there we complained about the room and were moved to the tower section of this hotel. The rooms are much better but the service at this hotel is the huge complaint. We came back from the Disney parks one day to find the cleaning staff had left an empty drink bottle and cookie package like our room was the break room. We had no clean towels, nothing else picked up only our beds made and their trash left. Upon speaking to the front desk they didn't even ask for our room number and just said what do you want us to do about this? So unprofessional. We then found where they left the trash bag and requested new towels and to speak to a manger - we got a young man with towels, questioning again rudely about what happened and what we wanted done. They didn't care at all and no call was returned from the manager after being told he was dealing with another angry guest. We never once got an \"I'm sorry\" from any of the actual hotel staff. That was unbelievable! On a positive side it is a good location, the conceigre service was great and the food at the restaurant was very good although they were short handed so be patient it was worth the wait. The gift store had good prices and was convenient, their staff was very friendly. The pool is nice and seemed well kept. It truly was the uncaring staff of the front desk, bad attitudes that made this stay horrible once we were in the Tower section of the hotel that is.

My wife & I have just returned from a holiday to Orlando staying at the Ramada Plaza hotel in Kissimmee, This is our review. Reading the past reviews on this hotel ranging from 'crap' to 'good value for money', We arrived with some in trepidation on what to expect. Well generally the hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. Booking in was quick and we were directed straight to the 'motel' room (141) accommodation on the ground floor, (not the tower rooms, where reviews have always seemed more favourable) Our room also had handy car parking right outside the room. (Not always a good thing, as you will read later). Our room was very clean, had 2 large queen size beds, nicely made up, the bathroom had a bath, shower and toilet, plenty of fresh towels and a separate sink area. This also had a small but adequate fridge, ironing board, an iron, hair dryer, all working. There was a large TV (with free and pay as you view options). A small table and 2 chairs, and 2 adequate sized chest of draws. So we were pleasantly pleased with the room. Beds were made up every day but not with fresh sheets, these were changed once a week, but towels were changed daily. Now for the down side. Being on the Ground floor, and discovering later we were situated close to a hotel maintenance room, we found there was little regard for those trying to sleep. On a few occasions we had the need to report noisy staff congregating outside the maintenance rooms after 11 at night and on our first night a large delivery vehicle left its engine running for over half an hour after midnight outside the room, while the driver chatted with staff. A phone call to reception on each occasion did restore the peace, but I cant help wondering if this was a coincidence & It did not prevent similar issues on subseqent nights. Each morning we were woken early by the movement of maintenance and laundry trolleys being pushed along the path outside the room from 7:30am onwards, and during the 1st week our room maid knocked on the door at 8:00am to see if we were out. Not Impressed! Vehicles parking up and driving off at all hours of the night also presented a problem especially for a ground floor room, so be warned. If it wasn\u2019t for the fact we were so very tired after the resort trips it would of been a greater issue. We should of realised that after the first problem we should of asked to move, But we were reluctant to change as the room was nice,the parking convinient and you never know what you will end up with. If I could of got a tower room, I would of done so, but these always seemed to be full. Both pools were small, clean and adequate for a quick dip. The pool surrounds were nice and the gardens well kept. There were always a free lounges to use when we were there and clean pool towels available. Be advised that there were some motel style rooms next to the heated pool and games area, which could present some unwanted noise, but great if you have kids. So in a nutshell, the hotel is generally very good for the money, its not luxury so don\u2019t expect it. Staff were helpful and friendly. Its excellent located for the Disney Resorts, Only 10 mins from the closest (MGM). There are local amenities (shops, restaurants etc) right outside the hotel if you need them. I never went up the tower, but I would recommend a room there based on what we got and the reviews on these rooms, or at least be very choosy on what you get if they give you a motel room. I would use them again but would be more wary of my room location next time.

The Ramada is seperated into two sections. The Tower rooms and the inn rooms. We stayed in one of the inn rooms(369). Room: The room was clean. It had working A/C,hair dryer, two large comfortable beds, color tv, coffee pot, and fridge. The shower worked fine. While it is time for new carpeting, it did suit our needs just fine. A clean safe comfortable place to unwind after a day of play at the Disney and Universal parks. Each evening when we returned to the room, the room had been cleaned, fresh towels were left, as were new coffee packs. Many of the area pizza places that deliver will leave flyers in the rooms. Pools: there are two pools to choose from. There are large towel carts at each pool so you dont have to use towels from your room. The pools are clean. Smoke house grill and deli: We did not eat at either. The smokehouse grill open for breakfast and dinner never seemed to have more than a few patrons even at peak hours. The breakfast buffett at 12$ could not compete with the ponderosa at 4.99 just up the street. On more than one occasion the deli was closed when the sign on the door posting it's hours said it should be open. I did once buy a 2 liter bottle of pepsi for 3 dollars and change. Gift shop: I attempted on several occasions to see what the gift shop in the lobby had to offer, but not once ,in 6 days ,did I find it open. There was a sign on the door stating it would re-open at 5:00PM which was on the door all week. I have saved the best for last. The Ramada Plaza Gateway is actually owned by Westgate Resorts. Westgate Resorts are really just a Huge timeshare conglomerate. But, you don't have to believe me, if you go to the lobby to take advantage of the discounted Disney and Universal tickets you'll find out for yourselves. My wife and I wanted 2, 1 day passes to Universal Studios and Island of adventure.

I am shocked by all of the positive comments I have read about this and that is why I felt the need to write a review, even though it is quite some time after I visited the hotel. We had a wonderful time visiting the parks, but continue to talk about the miserable experience we had staying at the Ramada Plaza Gateway. As we booked the hotel, we were excited and impressed by the pictures shown on the website. It looked classy and clean. As we arrived, we were still optimistic--the lobby was appealing, although dead and not as large as we had anticipated. The trouble started as we were led to our room in the INN part of the hotel. We did not realize there were two separate parts, and we were booked in the back, motel-style portion. As someone who has stayed in average to above average hotels in the past, I was shocked when we opened the door to our room. I have never seen a room like it, other than in movies. The door was off the hinge, there was mildew, fungus, or some other unidentifiable disgusting material growing on the celiing, and the bathroom was unclean. I will say that after we went and asked to be moved, the staff did accomodate us and even \"upgraded\" us to a room with a view of a \"mini garden\"--one palm tree and some plants outside of our door--quickly and free of charge. Our new room lacked the growths on the ceiling, but absolutely reeked of mildew and just felt damp. The shower curtain was dirty, the bathroom was falling apart, and the matress on the bed was COMPLETELY sunken in the middle. It had absolutely no support. I would not take off my socks to walk on the carpeting. I dreaded having to come back at night, and we made it a point to spend as little time as possible in our room. My boyfriend and I laugh about the experience now, but we were absolutely miserable at the hotel and would NEVER stay there (or at any other Ramada, for that matter) ever again.

I needn't be, as it was excellent..... We had a Plaza room with 2 king-size beds (requested) on the 7th floor, with a great view of Disney, there were 5 of us, 2 adults and 3 children. Our room was huge, clean and kept very tidy by housekeeping, we had fresh towels every day. The staff were always polite and curteous and would go out of their way to help you. Yes, there were concierge staff there for you to buy tickets, etc and book timeshare viewings with, and sometimes there were quite a few in the lobby - but not once were we offered a timeshare tour or tickets - they were all very friendly and the most they said to us was good morning and good night. The hotel has 2 pools, one of which was heated, we used the pool on several occasions and it was lovely and warm, even in February. The hotel provide towels for you to use when using the pool and there was plenty of them. The laundry room was handy and at only $1.50 per wash or dry, was excellent value. The shuttle to Disney was really good, they left at 8am, 10am and 11.45 in the morings and returned at 5.45pm and 9.45pm in the evening. You were taken to Epcot, where you can get Disney transportation to any of the parks or hotels. They also do shuttles to Universal and Seaworld. There are plenty of restaurants in walking distance, the best was Angus Steak House (adjacent to the hotel) and Golden Corral (10 min walk), there was a Ponderosa 5 minutes away which was great for breakfast. The hotel's restaurant, Smokehouse Grill did the most excellent ribs.

I was traveling on business and booked a suite so I would have room to work. Although confirmed, no suite upon arrival. Waited until late to check in, still no room or rate adjustment - told I already had good rate at $89 (quoting others for courtyard cheap rooms $49). Finally moved to second day. This is a Westgate hotel (timeshare people) and they definitely support their sales people. Upon arrival, timeshare people overwhelmed you but once you told them no, they politely backed off and stayed off. Front desk personnel generally helpful, especially Rey. Don't expect help with the bags unless one of the timeshare people feels friendly. Don't expect to call and get any \"service\" oriented responses. Two calls and two hours of waiting for something in the room resulted in nothing so I stood at the front desk for 20 minutes to finally get it myself. Don't expect any help with drycleaning, they couldn't even find one that would pick up and they don't do any laundry either but they do have a washer/dryer available if you want to do it yourself. The breakfast bar was overpriced and generally greasy or stale and I should have known better than to eat any dinner where the menu is on the place mat, it was just horrible and again, way overpriced. Housekeeping was totally consistent in it's inconsistency. After three days I no longer got replacements for coffee and condiments and sheets were only changed twice in 10 days. Sometimes all the towels would be replaced and other days hand towels or wash clothes wouldn't be replaced. The suite was cleaner than the room but it was really scary to think what the stains on the furniture might be so I avoided the furniture completely. Dirt, rust and possibly mold were evident and it was obvious that a deep clean had not been done in a long, long time. Security was a joke. It was clear that on the days when they were doing timeshare tours there was a man in the booth looking for a car hang tags but that was usually on the weekends only and not for any consistent period. I kept to my room but on more than one afternoon the police were onsite, including a helicopter above for over a half an hour. I came and went to dinner at night without incident and never felt uncomfortable. I was a little concerned when one day my key wouldn't work and I went to the desk and they simply asked my room number and remade the keys, no ID required so I always locked my door and threw the latch when I was inside. My suggestion is to be clear what you are getting into, the tower is the tower and the courtyard is the courtyard and they each have their own prices.

This is not true. The hotel is divided into two distinct sections, the Plaza or tower section is the more elegant or classier portion of this hotel which requires an upgrade from the standard room reservation. The Inn section is for the more economy minded travelers who want a decent room at an affordable rate. We chose the Inn section and spent an entire week getting exactly what we expected and more. Our traveling companions did not fare so well but I will explain that further below. Our room was clean, smelled clean and had no bugs or mold. We had clean towels and linens. Our water pressure was fine and the heat worked OK. (Yes, we needed heat in 40's-50's temps) Everything worked fine and the service was fast and pleasant upon our arrival. We did NOT encounter any Time-Share people nor did we have to deal with rude staff. It was too cold to swim but our 13 yr. old son went anyway and had a great time. The pools are well kept and clean. Towels are provided near the pool. There are pool tables, ping pong and a game room with about 15 machines (tokens) which kept our kids happy. The internet room provides wi-fi service with adequate work stations for several users and a laptop interface to a printer - n/c. Work station printer copies are .75/copy. We had a laptop in our room and were able to get complimentary wi-fi service in certain locations (low signal but it worked) The hotel lobby was HUGE and very nice with concierge. There is a cocktail lounge with a large flat panel TV adjacent to the open area lobby and a large area for relaxing in a couch or chair. The gift shop was open but I did not venture in there. 3 private pay-phones. We only ate in the Smokehouse Grill once for breakfast Buffet. The selection was limited but the food was good. There is a chef on-hand to make omletes to order and I found the wait staff to be very friendly. We did do some take-out from the menu, the nachos are GREAT! In short, if you want to live the high life with all the luxuries, try another place. If you want to crash in an economy hotel with some first class amenities available, you might want to try Ramada Plaza & Inn Gateway. our Pros: location - close to Disney, price, pool, hotel amenities, security (see below) FL LOTTERY retailer onsite in the Deli to purchase scratch-off tickets and on-line games was a plus! our Cons: The restaurant was closed early a couple nights, even Saturday and the Deli was not always available with wait staff working in the back and not minding the store (granted its off-season and not busy but...) Tips: Dining - Use the coupon books available most anywhere and online 1.)CiCi's Pizza - about 5 miles due east on 192, $4.49 All-U-Can-Eat Pizza/Pasta/Desert PLUS you can use a 10% off coupon! It was good! 2.) Golden Corral - about 1/2 mile west on 192, $9.95 all-U-Can-Eat Buffet with the most buffet menu items I have ever seen! It was GREAT! 3.) Universal Studios/Islands of Adventure Meal Deal - We feel it was a good deal but probably broke even and you really have to wait in line longer than most places to get your wristband. Forget the Sipper Cup deal, you gotta lug around the plastic cup all day and the straw is too big and clumsey. Avoid: Dining/Food/Etc... 1.) King's Supermarket/Liquor - Too Pricey! There is a Winn Dixie near Outback Steakhouse 1 mi. west behind the mini-golf course 2.) Outback Steakhouse - Not nearly as good as back home 3.) Black Angus Steakhouse - Simply a motel restaurant with inflated prices and average food. 4.) Gift Shops Ok, here is the rest of the story... We traveled to Orlando from Edgerton, Wisconsin as a group of nine. 3 families, 3 children and 3 rooms total. We all had airline seats together and hotel rooms right next to each other. Well, the first night, one of the rooms (not ours) had a very smelly stale urine smell and ants crawling all over the sink and toilet area. The staff was to have housekeeping there immediately but after a couple hours waiting nothing so they wanted another room and few doors down the hall, OK. The next day the heating element goes bad and they are forced out again. The room the hotel gave them had a plugged toilet and was not even cleaned. By this time, they were a bit irrate, understandably. The hotel Manager handed them the keys to a Plaza Suite, Yes, a suite! We all marched up to the new suite to inspect, all nine of us! All the doors on the way had numbers, 1200, 1250, etc... but theirs had 1300 SUITE. Upon entry we find vaulted ceilings, multiple bedrooms, two bathrooms, amenity after amenity... So naturally we had to find that the bathroom fan did not work and the shower and curtain was moldy. It is in a tropical climate afterall, right? Actually when we kicked up the heat, dust flew out from the fan and the clocks in the room were still set for daylight savings so no one has even been in the room for months. Ok, now all is well and they are satisfied with their suite, wheww! The last night before we leave we are sitting around having a few drinks (11pm) in the peon section (inn) and a guy from the neighboring motel shows up and is asking for money. HUH? He says he had his truck stolen and needs money to get to work. I quizzed him and found his story less than believable so I took his picture and called security. He left and started to wonder the halls next door watching us from behind some pillars. Darrell from Security came to our aid and we decided to call the cops because he was acting odd and who knows what he would do later. We have kids and now feel unprotected. 3 Osceola Sheriff Deputies arrive, we explain the situation and show them the picture. I think they recognize him and they call for back-up, pretty soon there are several squad cars and even more officers milling about the neighboring complex. They caught the guy and held him in custody. My daughter got close enough to the action get some info on the guy. He had just been released from jail the previous Saturday. He was going to jail that night for auto theft, possession of drugs or drug paraphenalia, possession of stolen credit cards and perhaps trespassing as the residence he said he was staying was registered to a women who was not at home. The cops were still there at 2:30 am when I went to bed and I have not heard anything about it since. I am curious though! An Interesting last night indeed!

Another positive point about this hotels location was the fact that it had a Black Angus Steak house (recommended), Sizzler, Ponderosa and 7/11 petrol station, all within walking distance from the complex. The only negative points I can give about my stay there would be to comment on the Westgate reps in attendance in the Lobby. Although very pleasant, and holding doors open for my girlfriend and I etc, they did, for my girlfriend in particular make it feel a little intimidating when entering and leaving the hotel, mainly due to the number of them present. The other, far less important negative was the lack of functioning drinks machines on most floors. One night I was gasping and took the lift to 5 different floors to try and get a drink, without luck. Some floors didn't have a drinks machine available at all.

We all have different standards and expectations so my review is a canid one of my stay at the Ramada Plaza in October 2006. The hotel is located on the East Bound 192 between mile markers 5 and 6 just prior to Angels restaurant. Geographically the hotel location is ideal, the reception is modern and the reception staff welcomed us, and could not have been nicer. This is a large hotel with a \"high rise\" accommodation block which we did not stay in and the low level two storey (ground and first floors) which we did. We were originally allocated a first floor room which we had requested but had to change to a ground floor room after one night due to the \"drone\" from the air conditioning units on the roof. The reception changed our room without question and the air conditioning was very noisy, especially at night when the background noise is less. The room is clean and tidy with drawers, TV, two double beds, a wash basin with clothes rail and ironing board and a toilet with a bath/shower. The buffet breakfast is great, but cannot comment on the evening meal as we ate out all of the time. There is a Deli for Pizzas etc and this was nice to use and eat from. There are two pools but we used the one nearest the reception which is basicall rectangular with depths of 1.1m to 2.4m. The pool is heated, well maintained and sun lounges and palm trees and in abbundance. The pool gets the sun all day long. They also provide towels to use pool side which is a great idea, you return the used towels to a bin when you have finished with them, brilliant. The room and hotel overall was ideal for us as we were on a budget, and use the room for storing our possessions and sleeping in only, that said it was better than expected and/or anticipated having read the reviews posted here previously. Occupancy levels were \"low\" at the time of our stay and at full occupancy your experience may be different from our own. My niggles are, The security guard on the main gate does not stop and check vehicles or people entering the premises, so what effect does he have? The evenings are \"dead\", the bar is quiet with TV and no music. Pool and table tennis can be played outside in a covered courtyard. Dont use the hotel room telephone for international calls its very expensive, buy a international phone card instead and use the phones in the covered courtyard. The room has two curtain tracks and I think (but I do not know of course) that the first could have been for a net curtain and the second for a \"heavier\" curtain. We kept the \"heavier\" curtain drawn all the time as no net curtain is fitted and also people walking by can and do look into the room, so privacy is compromised. Also without being paranoid those intent of stealing from hotel rooms can look through the window prior to gaining entry possibly? There is a man on site with a petrol power leaf blower and he likes using it a lot! When I say a lot I mean A LOT AND FROM EARLY IN THE MORNING. If you stay hear ask for a room in a quit location away from the air conditioning, plant rooms, the leaf blower, and do not forget that car parking is right outside the rooms is some examples and you get the noise from people and vehicles comming and going. Major Moan. I approached the Concierge desk enquiring about theme park tickets. Straight away we were pressurised into visiting the West gate Resort nearby for cheap tickets in return. I explained that I would not and could not afford a villa or a time share, did not want to waste my holiday time and was prepared to pay the full fee. The middle aged lady who was dealing with our enquiry was rude and is obviously not used to someone politely saying NO THANK YOU and she is obviously not used to not getting her own way! If you want this option then goon for you, but for those of us who do not should still be treated courteously I think.

Occassionally it could be a little noisy at night (why do American Fire Engines have such loud sirens and use them at the dead of night still?) Rooms were spacious and had reasonable facilities. They do need a really good clean but were functional. Air-con worked fine as did the iron, fridge etc. Plenty of fresh towels etc were left daily. There was plenty to do at the hotel. The 2 pools were usually empty which suprised me as they were superb. PLenty of towels usually availble.There are pool and table tennis tables, a basic gym and games room. We found all of the staff to be really friendly and helpful. Any request we had from room service were met very quickly. Would recommend using the safe boxes. They are free to use. We also chose not to eat in the hotel, purely on price, as there are numerous restaurants within a few minutes walk or drive. There is a Publix supermarket as couple of miles up the road too. We drove to the parks each day. The hotel is situated on the main 192, with very easy access to all of them. In summary we had an enjoyable 2 weeks here. It isnt the Ritz but for what you pay it is superb value for money.

Give it a break - it is a budget hotel being used by most as a mere base for the theme parks. In this respect it delivers - we only paid \u00a320 per night for the two of us. Ok, the rooms need a bit of updating, but they are clean with maid service every day. The 2 pools are also clean with fresh towels. The hotel is ideally located near Disney with plenty of restaurants within walking distance.

I stayed here in July with my elderly mother and two small children. Yes this is a budget choice, however, for the low price ( we paid around \u00a325.00 per night) this hotel/motel is absolutely fine. ROOMS-our room was cleaned every day, we were left loads of fresh towels, shampoo,conditioner,mouthwash and body lotion. The rooms also had a little coffee maker and coffee sachets were also left each day. Downside of the rooms are that they are a little dark,slightly small and the air con is a bit noisy, but apart from that they were just average and fine. POOL- our room was at the back next to the small pool, which again was fine, pleanty of fresh towels supplied. We didn't use the pool very much but only because we we out most of the time. STAFF- i again found the staff perfectly friendly, didn't have much call to speak to them, however when i did they were helpful enough. We used the Disney shuttle bus a few times which was good, if there were to may people waiting they always sent another one. Drawback of the shuttle bus is that the last one back departs Epcot at 9.45pm, this is really to early if you want to catch any fireworks etc in the parks. So really it's easier just to hire a car. We used the hotel cafe a few times (didn't use restaurant, so cant comment) cafe was ok done nice pizzas. At the end of the day you must remember to review a hotel depending on it's star rating and price. You can't expect a top notch champagne hotel on a lemonade budget!!!! I have stayed in many many hotels all over the world from 5 star in Dubai to hostels in Capetown, and this hotel is in a great location for Disney, and is very reasonably priced....so if that's what your looking for this hotel is fine. Who goes to this area to spend much time in their hotel room :-/", "Date": "August 2, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ohio", "Title": "\u201cDo Not Stay Here!!!!!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "Joyisthename", "ReviewID": "UR5492325", "Content": "Maintenance was painting bathtubs and fumes made me ill.

A total rip off. The rooms were just okay as were the staff , whom had trouble trying to understand our strange accent no matter how polite you were.
