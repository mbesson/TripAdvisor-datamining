What's not to like? I say this isn't for everyone, and here's what I mean: they clearly skew towards the fun / party end of things, with a positive encouragement towards bands and rock'n'roll visitors to stay there. Plus, the area, being close/in the Tenderloin would be off-putting for some folks. And the rooms, while spacious, and clean, are I think deliberately kinda low-key and \"classic\". They've kept the look and feel of the movie motel, while ensuring the right things are upgraded and modern to current standards. For me, that worked, and was complemented well by the staff, who were great, and very helpful. I liked the area (great Vietnamese food all around!, walking distance to centre of SF, etc.), and the bar restaurant is a real surprise - way cooler than you'd expect, delicious nibbles, and buzzing with a clearly local hipster crowd.

Lots of magazines, a table and two chairs. The Wifi worked and the parking was free. Within one block there were lots of food choices. Cabs and buses right outside the door. The people in the office were nice and kicked back. The rooms are set around a really nice courtyard with a pool (warm enough for folks to swim in at night in the winter) with palm trees, water features, and art. Because the rooms are set back away from the road, there was no road noise. There is a restaurant ($$) and lounge along one side of the courtyard, and people sit outside. The lounge people party it up a bit, and there apparently was a wild time going on at night in the pool cabana, altho the motel warns you about keeping it quiet around the pool. Smokers have to go out in the parking lot. There are some street people in this area, but it wasn't bad.

We had three requirements as a family, pool for kids, free wi-fi and within walking distance of Union Square. We so enjoyed. A heads up that to walk to Union's Square, you will pass some shady characters and lines for soup kitchens. No one bothered us and it did open our eyes and that of our kids as to how really lucky we are. Really lucky. We saw the tree, enjoyed a late lunch in Jack Foleys and then took the 28 bus to Japantown. 99 cents stores are now 1.50 but we had fun. The staff at the Phoenix were awesome. Do ask about the controls for heating the room as we didn't and couldn't switch off during the night. Our mistake for not asking especially when the front desk made a call to ask if everything was okay once we got settled after half hour or so. Definitely will revisit ... we can hear the boys requesting already. More renovations in the works too so experience can only get better. Loved the free continental in the morning. Yogurt and/or cereal would add to the experience. Happy New Year and all the best in 2012 for the Phoenix!

It's not as lush in that respect as some other parts of SF, but you won't starve. Besides, there's a restaurant on the premises. Fourth, the rooms were neat and clean, with large windows facing the courtyard. It gets noisy in the evening, when the hipster crowd arrives at the bar, but the noise quiets down promptly at about 11 p.m. and wasn't an issue. Fifth, the staff was friendly and helpful. No complaints there at all. Bottom line is that it was a fun, different place to stay in SF. The room rate was quite reasonable for a SF hotel.

What we liked the best was the restaurant/bar located on the hotel premises. It had re-opened the week we stayed there after some major rennovations. It was a early 30-ish crowd which made me & my husband the oldest ones in the bar. (We are both 59 yrs old) But everyone was great, the staff was friendly and the drinks reasonably priced. We just loved the atmosphere and the interesting crowd. I recommend this hotel for people who are familiar with the city. It is safe to walk around during the day but I would not recomment late night walks (after midnight) because there are alot of homless people in that area. Also, it is a short walk to public transportation (Market St.) and the SF City Civic Center. It is 3 blocks from the Asian Pacfic Museum. The hotel staff was great friendly, courteous & engaging. The rooms do not have a safe for valuables so the front desk kept my MacBook during the day. The housekeeping staff kept our room spotless. In fact, one staff member saw me walking in the rain and ran out with an umbrella to keep me from getting wet. What great service! We did not use the pool but it looked beautiful & it's heated. It is a great place to stay and reasonably priced.

Their continental breakfast is a gorgeous spread of hot coffee & tea, fruit juices, a wide assortment of bagels, pastries, and muffins. They even have fresh fruit like bananas and apples. The hotel is in the heart of the very colorful Tenderloin District. They allow for one parking space per room per night free of charge.

The Tenderloin District has a ton to offer in the way of food and entertainment, but is also in close proximity to other great neighborhoods like Union Square, Hayes Valley, Soma and the Mission District.

The central location of the swimming pool was nice, we had a few steps to take from our room before diving in. As much as we enjoyed relaxing in and around the pool with other guests, I could see how noise may be a factor for couples looking to really \"get away\" from that, mostly due to the smaller size of the hotel layout. Perhaps a second-floor room would suit quieter guests a little better. For us, mingling with other guests & hotel staff was a welcome activity that only added to the fun of our trip.

Once you enter the private courtyard at The Phoenix, you're in another world! Here's what you get: An incredibly clean, comfortable room, with lovely furnishings, wifi, in-room coffee, as well as a nice complimentary breakfast in the morning AND a very reasonable rate. Add in the superlative assistance at the front desk, a great pool and lounge area with fun statuary around, a relaxed, casual atmosphere, the occasional rock star and you have a recipe for a delightful get-away. And did I mention that there is free, and safe, parking? If you need anything, a simple call to the front desk takes care of it. Staff makes each and every guest feel special and welcome. As a member of the Joy of Life Club, we had a split of Chardonnay waiting for us when we arrived as well as a greeting card from the staff welcoming us to The Phoenix again. We also enjoyed a superb dinner at the Bambuddha prior to our show. They offer a blend of small and large plates and make it easy for a family to enjoy many different dishes. If you enjoy Asian fare, give the Bambuddha a try. You'll be glad you did. We already have another trip to SF planned in July so we'll be back to The Phoenix Hotel!

We were there for a party at the Bambuddha Lounge, a great night spot adjacent to the hotel. The decor is what you see in the pictures: a funky revitalization of a 50's style motel. Our room was basic but quite clean and comfortable. There was a faint odor of cigarette smoke, even though it was supposedly non-smoking -- but it was faint enough not to bother us (our friends were initially assigned a much smokier-smelling room, but they asked to be switched and were accommodated). The front-desk staff was generally attentive and polite -- especially the night clerk, Luke. We were mostly surprised by what a great deal it was. We paid $133 with our AAA discount, including on-site parking and continental breakfast. Usually when breakfast is included at places like this, you're lucky to get coffee and doughnuts. Although not lavish, this one still exceeded my expectations: laid out buffet-style by the pool, it included coffee, several types of milk (soy, skim, whole, and half-and-half), OJ, several types of pastries (muffins, croissants, danishes, raisin bread), bagels with cream cheese (you could toast them if you liked), and whole fruit. The only major downside is the neighborhood (the Tenderloin), which is down-and-out. Then again, since your car is parked right there with complete in-and-out access, you don't need to walk around.

The hotel is a unique combination of '50s retro with Asian influences. All of the rooms face an interior courtyard that features a nice pool and sitting area where you can relax and have a cocktail from the Bambuddha Lounge which shares the property. Our room had bright colors, a ceiling fan with wide, bamboo blades, and magazines dedicated to the local music scene in San Francisco. The Phoenix is within walking distance or a short taxi ride to many famous music venues, including Slim's, The Great American Music Hall, and the Warfield Theatre on Market Street. The neighborhood is edgy and unique, but not in the least threatening or intimidating. The friendly staff will direct you to the best of the city's music venues and restaurants, and there is no better city in the world to eat and enjoy a great show!

If you are wondering if you will like the place, the information in the reviews here, when taken as a whole, presents a great picture. What is said about the neighborhood is true -- it's gritty. If you are from suburban USA or abroad you might find the down-and-out folks who frequent the area frightening. If you are from a big city, anywhere, you will probably be sufficiently inured to the realities of poverty and street living that you will witness. My teenaged daughter and I navigated the area with no incidents. We did not tempt fate by venturing out late at night. It is true that the hotel itself is not the Ritz. It is more like a Motel 6 done up by a decorator who specializes in garage sale chic. Funky is an apt term, and proudly so. The furnishings are not top of the line, but they function just fine. The beds were great. The bathroom was adequate, just, but very clean. There is a curtain instead of a door on the closet. The TV is average size. There is no AC (but lots of jalousie windows and a ceiling fan). The front desk is staffed by a very young and hip group with piercings, fashion hair styles and rock star clothing. They were all friendly, but none would pass muster at a four or five star place. Expecting the expertise of a four or five star hotel staff would be unfair. On the other hand, their enthusiasm and verve makes up for polish. We asked about bus routes and the staff bent over backwards to find us maps and explain the best ways to get around. And, their advice was flawless. We were not there on a weekend so I cannot address the noise issue. The Bambudda restaurant shares the hotel's patio space. One of my favorite comments from a reviewer here was about the surreal scene of urban hipsters dressed to the nines enjoying a date on the bar patio by the pool, whilst children who are guests of the hotel splash in the same pool. True, true. An experience for both. The gardens are the thing that would take me back to this hotel again and again. Opening your hotel door -- especially if you are on a ground floor room -- is a true California experience. Outside your room is a paradise of Pacific flora, from hibiscus and bouganvillia to banana trees. There are lawns, manicured walkways and little alcoves with benches where you can sit and read, or close your eyes and soak up the peace. You will forget that there is a city outside the garden gates. The garden is a haven for birds. Breakfast is set out by the pool each morning. Having a peaceful breakfast in the lush garden beats any hotel breakfast room in the city, in my opinion. City bus service is great. I highly recommend looking up routes for transportation ahead of time. We were able to get to the hotel by taking the BART from the airport to Civic Center, and walking a few blocks. Bus service comes within a block of the hotel. Also, I recommend that you join the Joie de Vivre guest program. The Hotel Bijou site has a link, I think, or at least their parent hotel site does. It is free, but \"buys\" you a nice little welcoming gift. We had bottled water and a chocolate waiting in the room, with a welcome card from the staff. Yeah, it made us feel special. :) This is a special hotel. If you read the reviews here, and think it sounds like the sort of place you'd like, you are probably right.

Rock 'n' Roll is there to stay, too, with music recommendations in the lobby and, when I was there, a rock band tour bus-looking vehicle in the parking lot and a Smashing Pumpkins van.

We'd had a chance to walk a lot around the surrounding neighborhood, and I have to say I did not feel unsafe but there are more prosperous parts of town. That said, the two other gals took a run after dark and were fine.

Didn't make it there the first night but stopped there the 2nd before bed and people were having a blast.", "Date": "March 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Del Mar, CA", "Title": "\u201cOld SF feel + tiki lounge style & hip elegance\u201d", "Author": "hcsminx", "ReviewID": "UR7245996", "Content": "I loved my stay at the Phoenix hotel. A friend of mine who lives in SF recommended the hotel to me. She mentioned it may not be a good place to stay on my business trip, however, I found it to be very accommodating and quiet. The BART station is just 5 blocks from the hotel - a nice brisk walk away. The Bambudda Lounge has excellent food (the best edamame ever) and provides a nice happy hour. The outside patio is very romantic- it has cushion seats, a warm fireplace and outdoor speakers playing soft tropical tunes. The pool is warm and clean. The teak lounge chairs that surround the pool area were a great place to enjoy the SF sunshine as well as the complimentary magazines that were in my room- Paper, 7x7, and one other. The staff was polite and attentive- they provided wakeup calls and recommended restaurants w/in the area. The room was bright, spacious and very clean.

It has such a great atmosphere. The rooms are always clean, and a nice size. The grounds are tropical and the rooms feel like you are on a tropical vacation with their bamboo, and ceiling fans. Since we are members of the Joy of Life Club (a free benefit) we get some freebies when we arrive including a drink and chocolate to start our stay. The free continental breakfast and a heated pool are great extras. No charge for parking is unheard of in San Francisco. And their room rates are unbeliveable. The location, right on the edge of the Tenderloine district, might scare off some but don't let it or you'll be missing out on a great place to stay. There is a restaurant on site, easy food like KFC and pizza just blocks away, or great restaurants just a couple miles away. The wharf is only three miles. And the staff is always wonderful.

But the Phoenix - I was very impressed. The courtyard/swimming pool area is beautiful and very relaxing. The room was spacious, clean and nicely designed. The shower was awesome. All the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The bed was comfy. I like the location - central to everything - on the edge of the Tenderloin but not in the worst part of it. There are many decent restaurants, bars and clubs within walking distance. The guests were, as a whole, quite young and hip. Because of the courtyard you don't get the street noise that you do in many other hotels in San Francisco. They let me check in quite early, which was very nice after a long, cramped, early morning flight from Chicago. My only minor complaints were that the room had only a small heater which didn't seem to work 100%, so I was a bit chilly for a while, and my room didn't come equipped with a frig, which would have come in handy. Also the only chairs in the room were made of bamboo and weren't very comfortable. But, I can't say enough good things about how awesome the courtyard area is. I'd like to go back when it's warm enough to swim. I absolutely loved The Phoenix, and will definitely stay there when I visit next time.", "Date": "January 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Memphis, Tenn", "Title": "\u201cLovely retro motel, clean and fun, good location.\u201d", "Author": "kelkel45", "ReviewID": "UR5613239", "Content": "Prior to staying at the Pheonix in August 2005, I read reviews on this site that warned of nighttime noise and other problems. While the place is famed as a rock-n-roll hotel (and the earnestness of the staff's rocker \"look\" is a little funny/silly), we didn't find it too loud at all. However, it's not the kind of place you stay if you're in town for early business meetings. We stayed up half the night entertaining friends in our room, but we did not receive any complaints from our neighbors, nor were we at any time disturbed by them. I remember from years ago that the hotel bar here was very fashionable, cool, and fun, but this no longer seems to be the case - it was pretty much a dud, very dark, deserted, and too loud. But the pool and pool area were lovely, the staff were friendly, and the room - while certainly not luxe - was clean and comfortable. It could have been a little bigger, though, seeing as how we had a king-size bed. See the attached, very blurry picture for an idea of how pretty the courtyard looks at night. The Tenderloin is wacky, for sure - NOT the cleanest or calmest of urban areas, but that, to me, is part of the experience. My boyfriend and I walked to and from the hotel after dark, but you may want to avoid doing this if homeless people cause you alarm. I would highly recommend the Pheonix for people travelling for fun with friends or partners.", "Date": "August 15, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Phoenix Hotel, a Joie de Vivre hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60713-d81209-Reviews-Phoenix_Hotel_a_Joie_de_Vivre_hotel-San_Francisco_California.html", "Price": "$133 - $206*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">601 Eddy Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">San Francisco</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">94109</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2515986", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/9f/0b/9f0b315493573368e256567c03d084034large.jpg"}}
