It looks amazingly faux-authentic and was very Disney-like. Yes, the hotel was big and noisy and packed over Spring break. It was full of 20-somethings, traveling in packs, so that was fun to watch it the 'faux' outdoor cafe next to rows and rows of slot machines. We're not used to 'smoke' and the casino had its share of smokers. It was fun to learn how to use the slot machines and the dealers (especially around the empty lunch time) had no problems introducing us to the games. We played for about 4-5 hours for about $85.00 The location of the Paris was right in the middle of the strip and had a great view of the Bellagio fountains. We ate at most all the restaurants and enjoyed something at each meal. One day we ate lunch outside at Mon Ami Gabi and it was HOT! The table was right in the sun and it warmed up the plates so much that the cheese on the $15.99 cheese platter melted! We ate breakfast there later in the week and it was so nice outside. We had a room on the 17th (no smoking) floor and it was nice enough. The bathroom including shower were nice, water was warm really fast. TV lacked some useful channels, but we didn't watch much TV anyway. It was very quiet in the room and when the elevators deposit you on the casino floor the noise immediately hits. We went to the pool, but the water was really cold, although it was 75-80 deg outside. So we sat in the sun and read our books. We couldn't decide whether to take the Eiffel Tower Ride one evening and the ticket person, seeing that we were undecided, offered us half price tickets. So who could turn that down. The night view of the strip and the fountains were excellent. So glad we went.

The experience was phenomenal. I've always wanted to stay at this hotel and I would recommend it to anyone who is even a little bit francophilic. We stayed in the Red Rooms, a slight upgrade from the regular rooms, and it was pretty standard. I liked the decor, but the rooms weren't all that special. The airport shuttle was satisfactory, although they drop you off at a weird side entrance, so if you don't know your way around this hotel, you'll get lost like I did. The service was great, and I liked the location of the hotel as well as the different amenities within the hotel: Buffet -- delicious, five stars, although pricey, but it's Vegas. If you like buffets and can eat enough to where the near $30 price tag is worth it, then DO it, because this was yummy. Spa -- minimal, three stars. I enjoyed a massage and that was nice and relaxing, but overpriced and the sauna/spa/hot tub area, was pretty disappointing. It wasn't at all the kind of ritz you'd expect at a premium Las Vegas hotel and reminded me of the saunas at YMCA gyms. Food -- We also ate at Mon Ami Gabi (delicious, but super busy, but had a great outdoor view of the Bellagio fountains) and had crepes and pizza downstairs. Again, pricey, but there are a lot of options for food at this hotel depending on how much you want to spend.

Why? It's hard to say ... little things, mostly. The airport shuttle drop off for visitors is at the complete opposite side of the hotel than the taxi/limo drop off and the hotel registration. There are no signs explaining this and visitors dropped off at the airport shuttle door (if there's no doorman in sight) have to drag their luggage across the hotel to find hotel registration. There was a terrific doorman on duty at the shuttle door when we left on Saturday, but there was no doorman at door when we arrived (around 1 pm on a Tuesday). That would certainly have helped. The elevators to the rooms are weirdly far from the registration desk. All of the restaurants are pricey - one can't eat a meal anywhere in the Paris hotel for under $15. Other hotels I've stayed in have at least one cheap option - for example, Planet Hollywood has the Earl of Sandwich in which you can have a breakfast sandwich and coffee for about $8 including tax. There is only one place in Paris convenient to the elevators to run down and buy some coffee at breakfast time to take back up to the room, but because there's only one, the lines were always LONG. All restaurant lines are LONG at standard eating times. The pool closed at 5:00 pm and we were asked to leave the area. We explained that we didn't want to swim, we just wanted to sit in the lounge chairs and enjoy the evening, but were told we could only do that in the summer. We were disappointed because there's no other outdoor space available for this at Paris, and this is something we like to do. Both the Venetian and the Flamingo have some lovely pool gardens and we've stayed in these late into the evening (also in March) with no problems. We actually went over to the Venetian to sit in their pool garden - and they let us even though we weren't staying there! Our room at the Paris hotel smelled a bit like dirty shoes, so I went to Bath and Body works at the Miracle Mile shops in nearby Planet Hollywood to purchase an air freshener for the room. I was CONTINUALLY accosted by salespeople from a shop near the elevator - they stand at the door of the shop and very aggressively try to shove a free sample in your hand then try to pull you into the store to sell you a product for your hair or eye cream (obviously I fit their target profile). Do I need to say I hated this? The incessant Jersey Boys music in the elevator made us want to punch something! :-) Even though our room was on the 29th floor and we paid for a view of the Bellagio Fountains, the loud music from the nightclub at ground level woke us up periodically until 4:00 am Wednesday! There was no music Thursday-Saturday.) So what did I like about it? Overall, Paris is clean and pretty to look at. Most of the staff was friendly. The food in every restaurant we tried, though pricey, was well prepared and tasty. I love Le Village Buffet and eat there every time I'm in Las Vegas. Mon Ami Gabi was fabulous - the first real bifteck frites I've eaten outside of the real Paris, France. These are the things that kept me from rating this hotel as poor.

The room we were comped in was the Paris' standard room (also known as their Luxury or Blue room). However, after practically no wait to check in, I did my usual front desk tip trick (sandwiched a $20 bill between my ID and credit card) and without me saying a word the front desk clerk upgraded us to a Luxury Red Room with a Strip view. I'd say the Paris is one of the safer bets on the Strip to \"bribe\" your way to a better room for all who are curious to try. Our room was clean and updated (where as the standard blue rooms are in need of updates), looking out on the Paris pool, the Eiffel Tower and a spectacular full view of the Bellagio Fountains. Beware the fountains can be a bit loud if you go to bed early and sleep light. The living portion of the room wasn't very large and consisted of a small love seat, coffee table, small bedside desk, king bed, ottoman and entertainment center that doubled as our wardrobe. If you are one of the few people that stay in your room a lot in Vegas, you'll be pleased to know the TV was a nice 42 (or more) inch flat screen and lined up squarely with the bed. As for the bathroom, it was non-proportionally large in comparison to the bedroom. It was only a single vanity but had tons of counter space, a decent sized tub and separate glass enclosed shower. It is quite easy for 2 or so people to get ready in there at the same time. For the women, my wife did say (contrary to some other reviews) that the hair dryer is yet again a disappointment. Low power with low heat. It's not the worst hotel dryer, but if you can find room in your luggage, you may be better off bringing your own. As for the restaurants, whether I stay at the Paris or not, I'm always a fan. There are 2 places we always eat at while in Vegas and they're both here: Mon Ami Gabi and Le Village Buffet. As for the buffet, the lunch and dinner are not very impressive, yet the breakfast is amazing with a wonderful crepe station and a great overall selection of savory and sweet. Just be prepared for a long morning wait, especially during Sunday's champagne brunch. As for Mon Ami Gabi, the outdoor dining with a view of the Fountains is a must do experience, just be prepared for a long wait at dinner time as patio seating cannot be reserved in advance (breakfast and lunch wait isn't normally bad). Also, their \"Frangria\" is the best adult beverage I've ever had. Lastly, the gaming. It's not a very large casino floor, but at the same time it's never too crowded. You can always find a seat at a table or your favorite slot without much, if any, waiting. I myself normally like to play a low $10 a hand blackjack, however, Paris only offers this in single deck, so I just stick to slots while here. My wife and I have both found the slots here to be moderately loose when compared to many of the larger central strip casinos. Also, the drink service doesn't ignore the penny and nickel slot players like other casinos regularly do. Consistent and prompt service no matter what you're playing Overall, we enjoy the Paris every time we come here. It's not the Venetian or Bellagio, but it's a fairly quiet casino in a perfect location with some of the most incredible Las Vegas views if you get lucky with your room.

The rooms need a make over/update to keep in line with other Las Vegas hotels of the same standard, whilst I must say they were kept very clean.

There is also a bus stop nearby which takes you north (in front of the sugar factory) or south of the strip (in front of Bellagio). The staffs we encountered were friendly, helpful and knowledgeable about the local area and tourist hot spots (eg. Grand Canyon, Hoover dam). The disappointing bits about Paris hotel were security, poor air ventilation and allowing pets in hotel rooms. Security - anybody can get to the lift lobby and go up to any floors without any questions asked because it is located near the gaming floor which is accessible by the general public. Ventilation - for a non-smoker, walking inside Paris, whether in the lobby, gaming floor (I expected this) , lift lobby or hotel floors feels like living in a smoke chimney. Fresh air is non-existent. This wasn\u2019t an issue at other hotels - Wynn, Bellagio, Cosmopolitan or Caesars Palace. Air quality was so bad at Paris that I spent most of my time elsewhere and was not able to explore the facilitates within it. And lastly, pets, from small dogs to big, Paris resembled a zoo at times. P.s. Beware of taxi drivers taking you on a scenic route from the McCarrran international airport to Paris or Bellagio. Demand that you be taken via Paradise Rd, then onto Harmon Ave (Hard rock caf\u00e9 corner). Total journey should cost you $14 to $18 dollars tops.

Here is my quick review: After parking in the lot and entering the hotel, I was first bombarded by the people selling timeshares which I chose to ignore. It took a little while to find the check in desk due to the poor signage but I eventually figured it out. Check in was quick and we were placed on the 24th floor facing the back of Ballys. We had to settle with a 2 queen bed room nonsmoking due to king nonsmoking being sold out. It was only 6pm they must have very few king beds in the place!!! The room was nice and clean with comfortable beds. The bathroom was large with a walk in shower and a separate bathtub. Yes it was an old tv but who cares I turned it on 2 times during the 2 nights I stayed. In summary, for the most part it was a very clean place with good customer service. I ended up getting a late checkout due to a late flight. The 2 downsides of the property for me were the huge crowds this place gets in the restaurant/store areas but then again that is expected in a mid strip hotel.

We have been there several times before staying on and off the Strip. All the hotels seemed to be offering great prices, but we decided that location would be the main draw for our hotel. Paris didn't disappoint. At check in we were asked if we'd like to upgrade for $55.00 per day/room, and we said yes. We were upgraded to a room on the 24th floor with a view of the Eiffel tower and the fountains of Belliago. The room hadn't undergone the remodeling that the hotel is doing, but the furnishings were tasteful and elegant. The beds were outstanding!! My husband would like to buy one, as they were extremely comfortable. The upgrade also gave us access to the Rondevous Lounge on the 31st floor. They offer a filling continental breakfast and nightly cocktails (limit of two). One night after having a late lunch, the cocktails and appetizers were our dinner. The lounge also offered water bottles, so this in itself saves you from having to purchase extra water. The only complaint I have was that they never varied the breakfast items. If you like bagels, cream cheese, and lox, this is your place! They also had cereal, fresh fruit and a delicious granola, fruit and yogurt parfait. At night they had shrimp, cheese and crackers, fruit, a few hot appetizers and a pasta dish. We found that it was more convenient to eat breakfast here and not worry about the crowds in the hotel restaurant. Also included in this upgrade is a special concierge service staffed by young professionals eager to help. If you are of the \"Boomer,\" age and like a slightly more refined Las Vegas, I definitely recommend the Paris hotel with the Rondevous Lounge upgrade.

This place is gorgeous. We had a bit of a line to check-in but only waited about 20 minutes. The lady who checked us in (I can't remember her name) couldn't have been more helpful. We had prepaid the 4 night stay about 7 months previously and at that point my son was going to travel with us so we had paid for 2 queen beds in a standard room. After cancelling my son's trip, we called the Paris and asked to be changed to a one king bed room which they approved verbally. I was not able to get a refund for the 3rd person as this was paid via a third party booking site. Our check-in lady had offered us an upgrade for $40.00 per night which we were more than happy to take up as this was our honeymoon (although we weren't actually married yet - that was 5 days away). We agreed to the upgrade, she was frantically clicking away on her keyboard and then she asked us if we had received a refund for the 3rd person who had cancelled. We explained the situation to her and she immediately said that she was giving us the upgrade for free - I couldn't wipe the smile from my face - Welcome to Vegas! My husband wanted to give her a $20 tip but I was so happy with the service that I gave her $50. She spent the next 10 minutes explaining where everything was, giving us tips for shows, restaurants etc and mentioned that if we needed anything during our stay, to ask for her. We headed off to the elevators dragging our luggage behind and when we got to the elevators, we realised we were on the 27th floor - very cool! When we first walked into the room (2758), my expectations were blown out of the water - what a beautiful room! Huuuge king size pillow-top bed, fridge, coffee maker and a gorgeous (and big) marble bathroom. At the check-in, they had asked us for a credit card in case of charges to the room. We told them we did not have a credit card and would therefore pay cash for everything and this was not a problem at all. Our entire stay was 100% wonderful, from the room service delivery guy to the concierge and the housekeeping staff, we were treated so well. Our room was cleaned daily up to my high standards and we were basically left to do our thing. Express checkout was a breeze and we even left the key to the room in a box in the lobby - so no waiting to check out. We ate at the buffet for breakfast and it was nice - not great but still a great choice and nice food for breakfast. We also ate at the take away pizza place - massive slices of American pizza - delicious! We ordered take away desserts from the patisserie - again very delicious and we ordered room service - always hot and very yummy. We gambled in the casino a couple of times and found the cocktail servers to be a lot slower than a lot of the other casinos and the slots were definately NOT paying on the few times we played them. Walking through the walkway to Bally's was much better for us - great cocktail service and much better gambling. We are already planning our next trip next year and Paris is the top of my list for accomodation as we had moved to the Mirage for the last half of our stay and were not nearly as happy there. All in all this place has everything you need - location, great staff, great food and beautiful king rooms. I had read extensively on trip advisor before our trip and noticed a few people were compaining about the internet charges - but honestly all we needed to do was transfer some extra money into our account while we were away and the little kiosk in reception was more than adequate for us - I mean how much time do you really spend on your computers whilst your in Vegas?

Paris had a better deal for the dates that we were staying and was directly next door, making it a good buy. We arrived late on a Friday night. Took a cab from the airport and instead of insisting on a route, we allowed the cab driver to take us to our hotel. Needless to say, he took the freeway, and our trip was over 10 dollars more than our return, where we took the back roads, not including airport taxes. Live and learn. Check in was quick at that time at night (12 am), we learned that our request for a king was not available...but we could change rooms the next day or upgrade to a strip view king for 55.00. This upgrade included a concierge floor with free hot and cold appetizers at night and free drinks, free hot and cold breakfast in the morning. We did not take this upgrade until the last night, and in retrospect, it was a good deal. Drinks were high quality and free, non-alcoholic drinks were available at all times (including free water). Food was perfect for an afternoon snack or for breakfast. We would have done it sooner if we had known exactly what it was like, and would do it again upon return. Room are...older, with warn carpeting and stains, peeling wallpaper, old \"box\" tv's. They are larger with ample room, including the bathroom, which had both a shower and tub (separate). Our upgraded room was still older, but did have the promised strip view of the fountains, etc. I know they are upgrading some rooms, it will be nice when they are able to upgrade all as they are showing their age. We had no issue with noise, towels and linens were adequate. House keeping was inconsistent. One morning they came before noon, the next day they were there at 5 pm. They left trashcans and other room items in different places, making some things hard to find. The upside to the hotel is that it is centrally located in virtually the middle of the strip. The \"express\" bus makes a stop directly in front of the hotel and can cheaply and easily take you to downtown casinos and attractions. The actually rooms and hotel elevators are not too far from the entrances, a rarity for Las Vegas hotels. We ate at both Mon Ami Gabi and the Eiffel Tower restaurant. Both were good- pricey, but worth the money in my opinion. Service was excellent as was the ambiance. We enjoyed the crepe place as well for breakfast. The one negative eatery experience occurred at the pizzaria. Multiple pizzas and slices were advertised, however, when we attempted to purchase a slice, we were told that out of 8 pizzas, they only had 2 available. The clerk gave no indication of when or if other pizzas might be ready. We then attempted to order a glass of wine (which was on the menu) and were told that \"they didn't have wine\". None of this was done with an apology. Casino was enjoyable- we were consistently offered free drinks when playing machines, despite the bet or type of machine. While we liked the martini bar near the guest room elevator, it was VERY pricey (27 dollars for two drinks). We enjoyed the bar in the middle of the casino- it had very nice bar tenders and quick service, however, when you actually sat at the bar, it smelled strongly of vomit. We did not use the pool (still not too warm), although we could see it from our room. Essentially a large circle, nothing spectacular. Check out was quick and efficient, the hotel was able to hold our bags for the day. My main complaint for the stay was related to room charging. We find it easier to charge meals and other items to our room versus pay each time. We set up our credit card for purchases upon arrival. When I charged items, I was asked for my ID and room #, easy enough. My significant other, although he presented his ID when checking in, found it virtually impossible to charge items to the room. Clerks would look at his ID and type our room number in and state that it was not a match. We finally stopped at the front desk to correct the mistake, thinking that they had his name wrong. We were incorrect. It turns out that their system is set up for ONE person to charge to the room. Any additional guests required a phone call from a clerk, waiter, or bartender to the front desk to ok the charge. Not convenient when I was in a conference all day. Seems like an outdated system. Overall, rooms were large and comfortable, though slightly old. Front desk staff and most of the hotel staff were friendly and helpful. Location was first rate and casino and restaurants were nice.

We weren't looking down onto \"The Strip\" but we didn't mind because we weren't there to look out the window. The hotel's common main level interior spaces were also very nice, clean, and spacious. The walkways were wide and accommodated what we considered fairly large weekend crowds (more on that later). The casino area was clean and spacious as well. As for \"smokiness\" in the casino, we didn't notice any...the ventilation must be very good, and the ceilings are very high, so we suppose that helps. We just happened to make our trip (a Friday, Saturday, and Sunday night stay) with three other couples who opted to stay at Bally's, an adjacent sister property (they had to pay for their rooms, and Bally's is somewhat less expensive than Paris). The great thing, for our party of eight, was that Paris and Bally's are connected by an indoor walkway. This made it easy for all of us to meet up in either place, but even without that need the walkway connection makes it easy to move from one property to the other if so desired. The two properties also share the same parking garage and at least some of the same parking garage elevators. We didn't see the rooms in Bally's, so we can't compare them to our room in the Paris. The casino area in Bally's, however, seemed more cramped than Paris's. Now to the crowd I alluded to earlier. As we walked around the main floor common area of the Paris where most of the eating areas are located, we noticed pretty long lines in almost every such place, from just coffee and pastries to pizza to the buffet, no matter the time of day or night. We (all eight of our party) got in a rather short line outside the Le Village Buffet on Saturday about 6:00 p.m. and waited about an hour and 45 minutes before we were seated. Do not be fooled by what appears to be a rather short line outside...there is another line inside three or four times as long. Moving on regarding Le Village Buffet, the food was plentiful and as varied as just about any buffet in Vegas (we've been to Vegas before and visited several buffets), but it doesn't come close to the quality or ambience offered at the Bellagio (pretty much across the street...a short walk) that was just $1.00 more at the time of our visit (about $30 per person at either place). However, we weren't there for the food, either. We were there to gamble and our biggest complaint was the 1.75 hours spent in line that we could have spent at the craps tables! BTW, if you've never been to Vegas, staying and eating on \"The Strip\" in one of the newer properties will cost much more than staying and eating at most outlying properties. Don't expect to pay anything less than $10 for a cup of coffee and a pastry in an eatery within one of the newer \"Strip\" joints (no pun intended). As for gaming, we can best attest to the craps tables. The Paris has six craps tables and on the Friday and Saturday afternoons and nights we played the action was good, meaning at least four or five of the tables had 6-10 players. Unlike some casinos, the table personnel moved the game along at a good pace (there's nothing worse than a slow bunch working a table) and the drink gals came around fairly often (although not often enough in our opinion, but we're fairly quick drinkers, so next time we'll order two drinks at a time). Overall, we rate the Paris 4 out of 5 stars. Only 4 stars because it's not the highest end of luxury in Vegas and the lines for food are long. Otherwise, it's a fine place to stay that's smack-dab in the middle of \"The Strip\" - convenient to Bally's, Caesars, the Bellagio, and the monorail that runs north and south between several other properties, if you feel the need to roam. Personally, we never ventured farther than the Paris and Bally's, and to Bally's only because our friends were staying there.", "Date": "February 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fanwood, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cVery nice stay!!\u201d", "Author": "VIPalltheway", "ReviewID": "UR125087385", "Content": "First time staying at the Paris in Vegas, and I was impressed!

When you enter the hotel the high ceilings are painted as if you are outdoors on a sunday day, nice clouds etc. The stores are designed like you are in a Parisian city as you stroll by you almost forget you are within a building. Restaurants are good and reasonably priced. The pizza place along the promenade offers two very large slices and a drink for $9.99 great when you don't need upscale dinning. Location is directly across from the Bellagio very central. On to the rooms: quite nice and some have been upgraded our was not but is was well worth the money, beds were comfortable and thats our only concern as we didn't spend much time there. They have a large banks of elevators several going to each section of the hotel and we never had to wait which was nice. This is one of the few hotels that doesn't have a daily resort fee and wi fi is free in the coffee shops. Valet parking is also free as are most. For a small fee you can travel up the Elif Tower and enjoy a vast view of Vegas. One think we really liked is there is not a heavy smoke smell anywhere in the hotel, some hotels smell like your in an ashtray. I think because it pretty new the ventilation system is great, being non smokers this was very important to us. The check in process was painless as was check out, we were able to extend out check out time until 2PM without charge and actually it went closer to 3PM with no issues.

Great deal. As with all hotels and casinos there is smoking everywhere, we asked for a non smoking room and they gave us a room on a non smoking floor, great. As for the casino the ventilation was very good, the only time I had probelms was when someone sat next to me and started to smoke, I am an exsmoker but what can you do, yes i got up and left. I the standard room there was no coffee maker so you had to go down to the coffee shop and pay $3.50 for a coffee or tea. you also have to be carefull of the refrigators as soon as you lift something out, even to look at it and put it back, they charge you room for the cost of that item so be careful. There is a Wallgreens about 1 block south where you can buy all the snacks and drinks you need at a fraction of the cost. There is all kinds of entertainment available in all the hotels but the best entertainment is out on the streets and small outdoor mall where live musicians are playing all day and all night, these peopl really earn their keep.

I really want to LOVE it, but for several reasons I don't. The Hubs and I stayed here over Valentine's Day in order to celebrate 10 years together. Since it was a special occasion I had really high hopes we would receive great service, but alas this wasn't the case. During the booking process, the service was excellent. We were given a good rate and told that there would be a note on our reservation indicating our anniversary, so we should expect good service. Upon our arrival I had high hopes for getting a good room and we were told that the room we were assigned was really nice with a view, but it wasn't ready. We were fine with that because we wanted a nice room for our celebration - we were told to come back in two hours and our room would be cleaned by then (he said he put a rush request). Well after 3 hours walking the strip and coming back at 4 for our room, it wasn't ready. I was getting upset and clearly just wanted to plop down in a room for awhile, so the guy gave us another room with a view that was available. He said it was in a good location not near an elevator. Lies- it was the first door after a suite right near the elevators! The room was ok - not the red room we booked, but it had a great view of the fountains and Eiffel tower. Unfortunately, we were next to a suite, which was really noisy. We were really upset and asked to move rooms the next day. The person we spoke to was rude and offered us a new room, but no apology for the nose of sewage smell in the bathroom. The second room we got was a red room. It was similar and also had a good view but a smaller window. All in all, I like the location of Paris and the style inside. We really liked Mon Ami Gabi and going to the top of the Eiffel Tower.

First of all, what everyone says is true - the casino is smoky smelling and that's your first impression when you walk in, but to be fair you eventually forget about it and the smell does not extend beyond the casino floor. We checked in early at 12:30 with two queens. We could have had a king if we waited till 3, but after a long flight we didn't care about the bed count. The room did look somewhat dated, but was clean. I was scared of getting a room with that royal blue carpet, but ours was a calm sagey green. Yes, there was a tube TV, but we watched it maybe 2 hours our entire stay. (Who CARES about the TV, people? It's Las Vegas. Go outside.) The separate bathtub was a nice touch, and there was a small fridge that was cool, not cold. I hated the lighting in the bathroom, as there were CF bulbs that made my makeup look crummy. But the extending makeup mirror on the wall was a nice touch. The location was outstanding. We bounced back and forth to Bally's, went to the Miracle Mile Mall's ABC store for cheap liquor and bottled water , watched the Bellagio fountains, and visited Caesars and The Cosmopolitan as well. The clientele was mostly over 35, but there were a few party kids who woke us up screaming \"Happy Birthday\" in the hall at 2 a.m. Saturday night. But Saturday night was absolutely crazy up and down the street of strip. The rest of the nights were quiet in the hotel. The casino was pretty quiet as the oldsters slowly lost their pensions to slots and video poker. Not a whole lot of young faces around, compared to the newer hotel/casinos. The cobblestone streets and shops were cute, but everything was way overpriced, and the gifts needed more variety. We had a pastry from the shop and it was really good, as was the coffee. Did the buffet for breakfast and that was decent. The staff were very friendly and helpful; we were definitely pleased with the service from the bell desk to the car rental counter. There was nothing spectacular but nothing that angered me either.

Having said that, I would shop around as the strip is full of great hotels that can beat this one. I have stayed at almost all the top Vegas resorts but this one rates mid to lower end. The room and bathroom was quite large, although we had a room at the end of the hall that followed with a \"P\". Not sure if this was an upgrade, but the view was nice and it had an entry hall and perhaps bigger square footage than most rooms. It was odd that the room had a host type refrigerator that usually stores items to purchase, yet ours was empty? Maybe they don't stock them anymore as some people touch or lift items then complain about being charged for them. At least you can use the refrigerator for your own food or drink items. The room itself was clean, although the large marble bathroom had some age with issues around the shower stall. The elevators were very quick when called. Two issues that were really annoying. First, the cleaning staff does not make it a priority to collect room service trays and rolling tables from the hall area. Each day you could see items left out all day and night without being taken away. The second issue was internet. Paris Hotel prides itself on being free of resort fees, yet charge $14.00 each day for in room internet. We opted to pay extra to use our laptop, which turned out to be a waste of time.

We booked a smoking premium room facing the strip with view of fountains, pool, and tower. The room was a nice size, large bathroom with shower and tub separate, large flat screen tv, couch, large wardrobe space, free in room safe and coffee maker. Average room rate was about $150, some nights being a little less. It's really about your perspective of what you call value. Sure, you can find rooms $31 a night, but will you have hot water or 'guests' in your bed? I prefer comfort ;) the check in staff were great and got us in early as requested, about 10 am. Later in the afternoon, we went to the casino lounge where we were greeted by Noam the bartender and a local couple. We had a blast! The hotel and casino is a nice size, not a huge city you feel lost in. Easy to navigate around. Connects nicely to Ballys and their casino (indoors) with some restaurants, the best buffet in Vegas, and shops along the way. Miracle Mile and Planet Hollywood next door, Bellagio across the street. Central strip location, but not overly crazy with night time activity...that's a bit further down (up?) by Flamigo and TI. Sugar Factory at Paris is pretty cool and not outrageous for $$. We each had a burger/sandwich meal, portions are huge, for about $16 a piece. We were comped a pop rocks martini :) Everyone at Paris were friendly, helpful and welcoming. There is an Internet plug connection in the room and wifi available for a reasonable fee, but front desk guy suggested we just go to the free Internet room on main floor and check email once or twice a day and be done with it ;) No resort fees is a huge bonus.

It was my 50th Birthday and my sister's 53th birthday celebration/mini vacation. We had Luxury rooms reserved through our Harrahs Total Awards. When we arrived at around 11:30pm, we were greeted by Brian at hotel reservation. He was taking care of the platinum members registration, but since there was not a line he waved us over. I asked Brian if there was any way that we could have a room that had a view to the strip, which would be overlooking the Eiffel Tower and the Bellagio Fountains, and inquired as to whether they had coffee makers in the rooms. He said maybe. We had requested ajoining rooms with my mother and younger sister. He said this is what we can do......he had two \"RED ROOMS\" available but they are not ajoining. These are their new rooms which have coffee makers, 42 inch flat screen TV and that they would do this upgrade at no charge. Plus our rooms would look directly over the strip. Wow birthday wishes do come true.....I had hoped that for our birthdays we could look out our window and watch the Bellagio fountains. THANK YOU BRIAN FOR OUR BIRTHDAY PRESENT!!! Our rooms were beautifully decorated in reds, rich browns and down comforter spreads and beautiful bathroom amenities. The entire staff at the Paris were outstanding, friendly, informed and helpful. We ate at the Moni Am Gabi....awesome food. We had breakfast there and my quiche there literally melted in your mouth and the wait staff exceptional. Now on not such a good note, the Cafe du Parc which is a cafeteria style quick grab and go place...Well poorly laid out and designed it took over 45 minutes to get a bag of chips, a soda and a ham and cheese sandwich and it definitely was not worth the wait and confusion. (This was however, the only bad experience we had on our 5 day stay) The decor of the hotel and the recreation of the Paris streets are done beautifully. The location of the Paris on the strip is just an added benefit you are in walking distance of all the major casinos. Thank you Paris for allowing the creation of great memories of my 50th birthday.

First off, we had reserved a room with a king bed, when we arrived, there were no king beds available. I asked what was the point of having a reservation then? The clerk replied that it was because of our \"late check-in.\" It was 8 pm.

Even La Quinta has flat screens in all their rooms. Anyway, the staff was hit and miss. Some really knew what they were tlaking about and others acted like it was their first day.

If it is a good price, then stay here, but we looked at adding a day (Sunday) to our gift stay and it was a little over $200 a night. We stayed at the 5 star Palazzo for less.

We both stayed at the Paris Hotel, which was a first time for both of us. I cannot speak for the other couple, but I was somewhat disappointed with my stay. I expected the rooms to more current than they were. The beds were pretty worn out and extremely uncomfortable. I had to request another room because of back problems. Hotel staff were extremely accommodating with changing my room. The beds on the 24th floor were new pillow top beds and very comfortable. No further sleeping problems after the room change. There were two other items that were disappointing, the TV\u2019s had not been upgraded to flat screen, no big deal, however, the second bigger problem was the no-flow shower head. This is a major item for me. By the time the water finally hit your body, it was like a dribble. When I take a vacation I so look forward to a great shower, which was not the case this time. On the positive side, the hotel is in a prime location surrounded by the Bellagio, Caesars Palace, Bally\u2019s, Planet Hollywood, Harrah\u2019s, and the Mirage. It\u2019s just a few short blocks from the Venetian. It is fairly easy to get around inside the hotel, and the hotel has one of the better buffets along the strip. I would probably not stay at the Paris again unless they offered a better room rate. When visiting Vegas one hardly spends any time in the room, so it\u2019s not necessary to shell out all that money for average accommodations.", "Date": "January 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "OHIO", "Title": "\u201cParis - Las Vegas\u201d", "Author": "MARGARUSHKA", "ReviewID": "UR123658365", "Content": "We love the atmosphere of the Paris Casino \"complex\" so decided to stay at the hotel for this trip.

I had heard only good things about this hotel and was very much looking forward to experiencing what it was like to stay here. My brother stayed in a regular room at the same time. The regular rooms and the Le Mans Suites are in desperate need of updating, but more about that in a bit. We were able to check in at 11:45 AM. The exact rooms we wanted, single king bed for my brother\u2019s room and non-smoking regular room for me, were not available. My Brother took a 2-queen-bed room while I opted to up-grade to the Le Mans Suite rather than wait for my non-smoking room. Since check-in is 3:00, can\u2019t complain that things were not ready. Early check-in is always a bit of a chance one takes, and checking in was quick and painless. They try to emulate some idea of Paris from the middle ages rather than today, so outside the reception area, the floors are designed to be cobblestone-like rather than flat. This can really reek havoc on your luggage if you have those small wheels on a spinner so just be careful and take it slow if you must. My brother\u2019s regular room was quite basic and the furniture and carpet were quite worn. He did have a separate bath and shower rather than a combo which deserves a bonus point. Also he\u2019s a chain smoker. The windows at Paris do not open but the ventilation system recycles the air so well that he wasn\u2019t bothered that he couldn\u2019t open them. The Le Mans Suite is a large room (see pictures). It has a wet bar with a refrigerator and a one cup coffee maker, but not one of those Keurig K-cup. Coffee is supplied each day at no charge. The furniture is quite old and old fashioned (like your grandma\u2019s). The coffee table is iron and marble and the TV is an old tube set. The bed was not very comfortable unlike many of the beds on the strip. The bathroom is huge, with a Jacuzzi and separate shower. There is a toilet and a bidet. The Bath facilities are quite good. There was also a large walk-in closet and a make-up desk in the hallway between the closet and bathroom. Although the room was a bit dirty when I moved in (crumbs of food on the sofa and such), the cleaning staff took good care of me as my stay progressed and I always show my appreciation to those that give me good service. We ate at the caf\u00e9 which was very reasonably priced and had breakfast once at the buffet. The food itself was nothing to write home about. In the caf\u00e9, I had the duck and was left a bit wanting. All in all, I found that the Suite was substandard, but the other facilities of the hotel were average for a low to mid-priced Vegas hotel. Unfortunately, Paris is not low priced, nor is it value priced. It is on the high end of mid-priced, and I think you can find better deals. After the hotel undergoes a renovation, then it would probably be worth what they charge, but not right now. I heard the Red Rooms are supposed to be modern, but I did not stay in one of them nor did I get to see inside of one. If they are modern, then they might be worth staying in, but I was really surprised that a Suite would be in such need of updating with such an uncomfortable bed.

The upgrade also came with a continental breakfast from 7-10 am and then appies and alcoholic beverages from 5-8 pm; both were well beyond our expectations and well worth the upgrade. The staff in the areas for the breakfast and appies was very professional, again, and we were glad to leave them appropriate tips each time we visited. The room we had included a king size bed which was very comfortable and a very big and luxurious bathroom, marble floors, separate bath and shower, larger counter, beautiful mirror, etc. Maid services was great with no problems whatsoever. We ate at Cafe Mon Ami Gabi and the food and service was wonderful. Only downside was the second time we ate at this cafe they sat us outside in what could be described as a wind storm and didn't give us an opportunity to move. Our bagette, utensils, etc. went flying off table and it was rather distracting and not very relaxing. If it's windy, I would suggest that you not sit out on their patio. The first time we visited we were also on the Patio and it was sunny and wonderful! Only other statement is that I was disappointed with the Stores in the hotel. I was looking forward to a little big of Parisian culture, ie: artwork, etc. and there is nothing so to speak. It would be nice to see this type of store in the Paris hotel.

It\u2019s very central on the main part of the strip, across from Bellagio, next to Bally\u2019s, not far from Venetian, Mirage, CityCenter, etc. Checkin only had to wait about 10 mins in line but we noticed the next day the line for checkin was very long. Seemed like front desk understaffed to handle the workload. We took the airport shuttle to get there which worked great. Only stopped at 2 other hotels before ours. Our room was on the 14th floor, however we looked back towards MGM hotel, not the better views towards Bellagio which I think would have cost a bit more. Room was really cheap \u2013 I think only $55/night. If we had stayed 2 nights later, Dec 30 and 31 it would have been closer to $180/night. It was very quiet and we slept well. Amenities etc. were fine (for $55/night -- if I had to spend over $125 I'd probably also comment about thing starting to look a bit shabby in rooms etc). Didn\u2019t spend much time in our room other than sleeping. We ate breakfast in the hotel, 1st day at JJ\u2019s Boulangerie where I had oatmeal and hubby had lox and bagel. We were both very happy although the wait for the food was a bit long (10 mins ) so not really \u201cfast \u201c food. 2nd day we split a crepe from La Creperie which often had long lines. We probably had to wait close to 10mins to place our order, then another 5-10mins before order was filled but it was very yummy. We didn\u2019t eat any other meals at the hotel. Observations: If you don\u2019t like crowds, this might not be the right hotel for you. I think the buffet and the Eiffel tower draw a lot of non-hotel guests thru the lobby at all hours so it becomes very busy, especially along the \u201ccobblestone\u201d way that goes past the creperie, caf\u00e9\u2019s and stores.

We were really surprised at this considering its the city that never sleeps! Second, Im sure its standard with Vegas, but everything in this hotel was SO expensive!

THere were three of us, two who have travelled many,many times. We asked for an upgrade to a Suite and were told nothing was available. We went to our room and were dissapointed with the smell in our hallway (smelled like dirt, old carpeting) and then the room (dirt marks on the door and bathroom wall just not cleaned and a section of the rug cut out and replaced - frayed) the smell was in the room also. We called down to the desk and insisted on an upgrade and they immediately offered us one of the Red Rooms for $40 a night extra. We took it and moved to a much nicer room that one would expect for a Vegas Casino. We left the made a note and $5 for extra pillows and towels...she took our $5 and left nothing. We had one hand soap the entire time and considering one of our travelling companions was sick it would have been nice to have fresh soap. The taxi stand was great, prompt and friendly service although he made it obvious he expceted a tip for waving the cab over to us!!! We did the buffet twice and although it was pricey it was superb. The food was amazing no matter what you ate. The table both times rocked so our drinks would spill, the silver ware was FILTHY one one occasion, lipstick on two of our cups and rarely was a spoon to stir our coffee found in the silver ware left wrapped at the table??? On our second visit to the buffet the waitress was snippy with us when we told her that the hostess has already taken our drink order and was down right rude to the table beside us (family with kids wanting hot chocolate and she brought chocolate milk with their orange juice...ewww. She snapped at them when they told her they ordered hot choc and not choc milk.). We took some fruit and pastry with us for snacking later it would have been nice to have a take out container so we could take some of it to our rooms. I know they do this in Mexico and considering how much food must get thrown out I would think it acceptable? We did Mom Ami Gabi on Saturday night and sat on the patio under heaters and watched to Bellagio fountains, awesome. The crowds were so much fun to watch and the food was amazing, my compliments to the chef and the waiter (french fella from Quebec) who even offered us the recipe to the chocolate pudding with salted carmel sauce...omg it was amazing. We all decided to return to Vegas with our partners next time only we would DEFINITELY stay somewhere else so we could experience what Vegas is so famous for, service, cleanlieness, customer service and wow factor.

The hotel itself is enormous, like all of the main hotels on the strip, so it's a bit of a trek from reception to the rooms, but that means the rooms aren't noisy at all. Service was fine and we had no problems checking in or out. However, we were there in December so very much out of season for them.

For anything other than visiting these same mega resorts, it would be better to stay off the strip - far more convenient.

I had no idea when I booked that this was such a quiet time for Vegas and that most of the shows I wanted to see (O, Love, Penn & Teller) would be dark the entire time. There were four of us staying in 2 rooms. I'd used the Total Rewards memberships for my wife and I to get the room discounts (always do this even if you aren't a gambler - its free and it saves you money!) but this meant that the hotel had us booked under two different unlinked references. I did email them asking if the rooms could be located close together but got a standard reply saying that room preferences could only be considered at check-in. I neededn't have worried - not only were the rooms next to each other, they were linked right at the end of the corridor with our own private entrance way. This meant that the rooms were very quiet - no late-night revellers wandering past. The rooms were great - big (especially compared to where we stayed in LA, San Fran and NY), the bed perhaps a bit too soft. There are a couple of signs of ageing but for the cost it was definitely the best value for money hotel out of the 8 we visited on our trip. The buffet was excellent - we had a number of breakfast buffets and a dinner one, and if you time it right you can sample both the breakfast and lunch menu for the lower price. And don't forget to get the Total Rewards discount. If you time it wrong you end up in a big queue and the breakfast that you thought you were going for turns out to be a champagne brunch costing $10 more per head. On this occassion we made tracks to the Sugar Factory and had a really nice brunch instead. It was too cold to make use of the pool but it looked lovely with great views of the tower. The tower ride was good to do - great views of the Bellagio fountains atnight - but take a jacket (and gloves in winter!): we went up wearing what we had on for dinner - big mistake! I liked the overall feel of the Paris - it isn't noisy and brash like New york New York and, if your after a mid-priced but nice alternative, it fits the bill. I'd love to have the money to stay at the Venetian or Bellagio but the Paris is a lower priced alternative. Its bang in the middle of the Strip too, so cuts down on the travelling to and fro.

Even the most flea bitten hotel in a podunk town in America will let you book a non-smoking room if you want to. Not the Paris. When we got there, they had no non-smoking rooms left. After we threaten to cancel our two other nights with them they gave us three suites for our party which I thought was very good of them.

In the unfortunate evening of our flight cancellation, I've made a call to Paris thinking that I'm just doing a courtesy notifying them of our late arrival. No so fast! I was informed that they normally hold reservations only till midnight, and, should I not arrive by then, reservation will go up in smoke, prepaid or not. Then I called Easy Click Travel agent, and she was helpful enough to arrange that hotel will keep our reservation till the next noon. We made it in time, but there were a few nervous moments before we reached the registration desk. LOCATION: Paris Las Vegas is in the heart of the Strip, right across Bellagio Fountains. You can walk to pretty much anywhere from there. Monorail station is also nearby, somewhere behind the hotel, but we didn't try it. In a busy time of day it may be difficult for a car to turn from Las Vegas Boulevard to the hotel because there are so many pedestrians and there is no special right turn phase for traffic signal. ROOMS: I was truly impressed with our room. I understand that we've got lucky, maybe because of the low season, but still, a corner room on a fairly high floor for a price of so-so motel in some other market - it's something to remember. From one window we can see the Strip, busy by day and dazzling by night, with a glimpse of Bellagio Fountains. From another window - the airport, outlying low rise part of the city and mountains in the distance. Sunrise over those mountains was amazingly beautiful. At the same time, in the first window you can see how the scarlet color of morning sun slowly edging down the shiny faces of Aria and Vdara across the street. Interior of the rooms is dated, but high quality and well kept. It looks like rooms were designed before people started to use desks as laptop stands and charge their cellphones at night. More electrical sockets would be very welcome. FOOD: We tried only two restaurants inside the casino: Le Cafe Ile St. Louis and Le Village Buffet. The cafe has very nice setting, but the food was not as great. After our first outing to the cafe, it was buffet, buffet and more buffet. And I say it's the best buffet I know so far. Crepes were delicious. But beware - while in ordinary buffet you may gain a few pounds, in le village buffet you will gain exactly the same number, only in kilos! STAFF: We didn't have any problems while staying in the hotel, and staff was always courteous and helpful. ENTERTAINMENT: Paris Las Vegas hosts Barry Manilow show, which I'm probably still too young to enjoy. Eiffel Tower, which we visited during the day, was spectacular. The only downside is that observation desk is one big cage with a few gun holes to take pictures. Paris Las Vegas does not have resort fee, which is good.

We are members of the Total Rewards Program (Caesar's Entertainment, formerly Harrah's) and we decided to take advantage of a \"bounce-back\" email offer, for a comped and upgraded room at any one of the Caesar's Entertainment Casinos. We decided to try the Paris Hotel/Casino again. Making the reservations on the 800 number was easy and since we have a Total Rewards account number, they were able to find our email offer quickly and to our surprise, we even had some free casino cash available to use on the gambling floor. Be sure to arrange at check-in for all hotel food charges to be made to your room, because as u earn points on the gambling floor, u may earn enough points for your food charges to be comped. Another good idea would be to order a limo at the time u make your hotel reservations. It's $64 for a personal pick-up at the airport, it saves u time and u avoid having to stand in a long taxi line. The limo charge is added to your room charges and it's well worth it, just for the convenience alone! There is a lot to be said for a visit to Las Vegas in December. The weather is cool, the crowds are smaller, lines for even the best restaurants are short, there are plenty of open slot machines and card table seats and there are some extraordinary Xmas decorations and lights to enjoy. The hotel staff seem to go out of their way to be a little extra-friendly, a welcome change from a previous visit during the busy Summer season. Our comped, \"Red Room\" upgraded suite was large and very comfortable. We had a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains and the Strip. The bathroom was huge with a jacuzzi-style tub and large enclosed shower. The bed was very comfortable and we liked the large screen LCD television and easy to use remote. Everything in the room appeared to be new or almost new. We balked about the $14.95 charge for the internet, so we didn't utilize this service and we were a bit annoyed at the petty $5.00 cost to use an internet kiosk, just to print out our departing boarding passes. But our biggest bother was the fact that even with a \"do not disturb\" sign hanging outside our door, the hotel maids congregated outside of our room to stock their carts, making a seriously amazing amount of loud chatter and noise at 8 AM. The casino is small by Las Vegas standards, while there appears to be a fair mix of slots and table games. Not that many years ago, we could play the slots for hours, some of the time using our money and some of the time using the casino's money. The days of extended slot play are officially over. During our entire time on the casino floor (4 days), including the time we spent next door at Bally's and at the Planet Hollywood, we never saw a single slot player win a \"hand-pay.\" Not even the very minimal $1,200 \"hand-pay.\" We brought the same amount of money that we always do, with the full understanding that no one comes to Las Vegas to win enough money to pay off their mortgage, but we used to get those mid-level \"hits\" now and then and that made the hunt for the elusive jackpot an exciting adventure. Now, there are no more exciting adventure on the gambling floor - u insert hundred dollar bill after hundred dollar bill into the bill acceptors and u NEVER win anything EVER. U write another check for a thousand dollars and that too disappears with nary a single mid-range \"hit.\" It's simply no longer any fun to gamble at the slots like it used to be. There are simply NO winners and these painfully tight slots make a long day of gambling feel like tedious, grueling work. So, even though we earned significant tier level points towards our next comped visit, I think we will be gambling closer to home, at one of the many local California Indian casinos. Why go to all of the trouble of traveling to a Las Vegas casino, only to encounter the most incredibly TIGHT slots, that just kill any sense of adventure or excitement? This review has gone on far longer than I had intended, but I can't just end it without a recommendation to the Mon Ami Gabi restaurant. The food and service was excellent and if u go, be sure to ask for a seat outside (they have heaters) so u can see and hear the Bellagio fountains perform.", "Date": "December 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hawaii", "Title": "\u201cOK experience\u201d", "Author": "mauisnj", "ReviewID": "UR121990235", "Content": "We stayed here for a conference for 3 nights in November.

Slots layout was confusing. The amount would go from 1c, to 1 dollar, 5c to 25c and so on. Drink service while gambling in slots area slow. Are you a smoker? You will love it but it's Vegas right. You would think they could improve the overall air quality but the air was thick with smoke even in areas where there was no one smoking. If you are really sensitive to smoke I wouldn't recommend gambling there. Ballys was alittle better, Bellagio even better. All within maybe 5 minutes of each other if your walking. I have stayed at several different Las Vegas hotels over the years. In my opinion they need to update rooms, improve floor service and ventilation for smoke. Do your home work is final words.

The high ceallings the \"old paris street\" feeling and the staff makes the Paris one of the hotel where it didn't feel like we were in a Vegas Casino - The Staff was very responsive, polite and on the spot. Concierges are in demand in the morning so all your questions should be asked at night. - The Breakfast buffet in the morning is a must. Yes it's expansive but it's worth it for the ambiance AND the tasty food - Not many boutique. If you're the shopping type you will not find as many shops in the casino as other casino. But you're right next to the big Mall of the Hollywood Planet and 10 minutes walk away from the Ceasar's shops. - The pool is one of the less impressive we saw. We were there in december so we didn't mind but if you want a good pool area, the Belagio, Ceasar and Venetian are a way better choice. - GRAND CANYON TOUR - I have only one tip for you if you entend on going to the Grand Canyon on buses : RENT A CAR. If you go with a tour, you'll loose roughly 4 hours of waitings after other people or in lines to get things going and you'll be rushed if you go for the helicopter tour. Yes, the helicopter tour and the entrance fee will be a bit more expansive but you'll have control over your day and How you want to do things.

The second visit, we were told that the room requested (king bed, nonsmoking) is only a request and that they were out of those rooms and were initially offered a queen smoking room. I asked to pay extra for an upgrade--not available, then continued until we were offered the handicapped room. It was a king bed, nonsmoking room, but was not a deluxe. The room and bath was spacious as it had to accommodate a wheelchair. The bed was not as nice as the \"deluxe\", but still of good quality. There was a large wet spot in the middle of the carpet of which I can only imagine- we put towels over it so that we could walk in our stocking feet and not get a soaking wet sock from God knows what. When I looked for the coffee maker, I couldn't find one, so I called the front desk and was told that the regular rooms didn't get coffee makers. I asked if I could have one brought to me and was transferred to housekeeping where I was told that I wasn't a ViP and therefore didn't deserve a coffee maker--unless the front desk approved it. I was transferred back to the front desk where I was told yet again that I wasn't a VIP and so they couldn't bring me a coffee maker, but that there was a coffee shop in the casino that I could buy coffee at. The entire feeling of the hotel is a bit worn and I'm sure they do this intentionally to get you to leave your room and go down to the casino. Room service is ridiculously uncharged, the tv reception is worse than if I used rabbit ears to get it myself, no coffee makers and the air-conditioning is horrible (but miraculously in the hallway outside the room its cool). Anyway, I've stayed at many different properties in Vegas and won't be staying here again--there are lots of hotels in the same price range that actually treat their guests as guests instead of a commodity to spend money in their casino.

It is a bit like a Montmartre of old at night with muted lighting and shadows. They have a nightclub called Napoleons that has at least 12 great beers on tap. This is special in Las Vegas as it can be quite difficult to order a robust glass of quality draft beer. It is way cheaper for casinos to sell bottled beer. The entire experience at the Paris Casino is geared toward a French reality, but without a Disney atmosphere. The entertainment was way too exciting for this child of the sixties. They had an a Capella foursome that sang just like Smokey Robinson and the Miracles! They would then change up to the Temptations and I would continue singing with them and I didn't stop until they took a break. I have seen the original Temptations and these guys were perfect in their tribute. The casino was a casino except that the presentation of being in France continued everywhere you walked. Statues, fountains, screens, plants and a very large indoor tree all added to the effect of taking you to a Parisian neighborhood. It was soothing rather than jarring.

I had reserved only 2 days and called down to extend my stay by one day, which was easily done. Altogether a good stay and a good value for visiting Las Vegas. The LeVillage Buffet was great, but the lines were usually a 30-40 minute (if not an hour) wait. You can do the Buffet of Buffets pass which allows for 24 hours of buffets for $49 (or $45 for Total Rewards members).

Why I gave it 3 stars: 1. If you have lots of luggage and you don't want to drag it through all hotel from parking garage to registration and then to your room, then you have to drive to the front of the hotel and get the luggage person to unload it for you and give you the ticket. This person expects at least $5 tip. Then you get to your room and call Bell Captain to get the luggage to your room and here goes another $5 as it's going to be a different person bringing your luggage. The similar thing happens when you depart hotel. We had to wait for our luggage at least 20 minutes and we've been there when hotel had a slow time. 2. The hotel did not do a good job on creating an actual atmosphere of Paris. If you have never been to Paris, it's OK, but if you went there at least once, everything will look and feel very fake. 3. Hotel has very old plumbing, at least our room had. The toilet is the cheapest you can buy at HomeDepot and got stuck after the first serious use. The shower like that is not being used in France for good 20 years now. I could not even move the shower head up or down or side to side. 4. No coffee maker in the room, which is very inconvenient, but I understand that hotel wants to make money even on coffee and tea. 5.

First impression-shuttle drops you off far from reception so you have to drag your luggage through the casino.

You could have told me I was at a Quality Inn in Cleveland and I would have believed you. It is attached to Bally's so that adds to the number of places to eat/drink etc without leaving the hotel. The food was hit or miss. Mon Ami Gabi was delightful and I highly recommend their chicken brie and apple crepes and getting a table outside. They were very attentive there and it was the best view. I ate somewhere else at Paris (name escapes me), got oily escargot stuffed mushrooms topped with soggy bread (the hands down worst escargot ever) and a tuna sandwich that I could not eat because it was clearly not sashimi grade and was so fibrous and chewy, yuck. The pool area is large, the hot tubs are some distance from the pool which in theory is nice because it is quiet and secluded. BUT the hot tubs were old and cracked, there was mildew, and the second day I used it I was left feeling itchy and an odd almost sewer smell to my skin. They need to be replaced. I don't gamble (I am a grad student and too broke!) but I did play some slots. The waitress girl kept the drinks flowing because I was tipping her. Her outfit was worn with a visible tear, I felt bad for the girls working there when elsewhere they had much nicer outfits. Entertainment was lacking. Went to the nightclub and it was okay. There were no shows there that I was aware of (I went to Mandalay for Lion King). The Eiffel Tower is pretty, but Bellagios water show blows it out of the water. On that note-go to Bellagio and get a great shot of the tower during the water show. So would I stay there again? No, unless you get a good deal (under $100 and I would consider).

Room to room noise was very low until the last (of three) nights when we could hear the TV blaring next door. The remarkable thing about this hotel was the staff. From the valet who met us at arrival to the valet who packed us up to go home, every member of the staff we encountered was smiling, friendly, helpful -- \"Welcome to the Paris. What can I do to make your stay more enjoyable?\" . . . And I mean everybody. We asked directions of a security person. Rather than pointing across the casino floor, she said, \"here, let me show you,\" and led us to our destination. Other than the dull furnishings, the only other critique I have is that everything is expensive, there is no bottled water in the room and paper coffee cups sit next to the in-suite coffee maker. Tacky for a property of this calibre. We ate at the Mon Ami Gabi. Very good food. Pasta way overcooked, but sauces and meat delicious. We also ate at the Le Artistes Steakhouse. Probably the best piece of prime rib we've ever had in a banquet setting. Both restaurants very good, both expensive. There is a small pastry shop between the hotel lobby and the elevators.

I'm actually glad to have to schlep over from Bally's to Paris. First off the staff at the front desk at Paris were much friendlier than what I got 90 min before at Bally's. I wish I remember the gentleman's name (funny how we can remember the people who tick us off, but not those who made things considerably better). When I checked in I explained my aversion to smoking (I was there to give a presentation) and he found me a non-smoking room on a \"pet friendly\" floor. First, who knew? If I ever have a pet and want to bring it to Vegas or know someone who does, I'd tell them about Paris!. I took the room, the floor was quiet, and most important, the best was comfortable and slept until early afternoon. They were also very good about giving me a late checkout since I checked in so early that same morning. Besides the bed the best thing about the room was the bathroom, very nice, marble tub and shower, very nice relaxing shower with two shower heads. The worst things about the room were the furniture, taking american oak and making it into french style furniture is not french furniture; it's oak carved and styled to look like french furniture. And the view. The worst view of any hotel I've ever stayed in in Vegas. My view was of Bally's. Oh, well, it was a room with a comfortable bed and nice bathroom. For a business trip and begging for a room close to Bally's for the night, I can't complain too much. The best thing about being \"stuck\" in Paris was walking around the casino and finding out what was there. First, the sports bar by the check in serves the best champagne of any of the establishments in the casino. It's just Ste. Michele, but it tastes the best to me compared to Roger or the house champagne in Mon Ami Gabi. I'm one of those people who actually watch the casino channel to learn about the casino and sometimes I read the magazine. I read an interview with George Wallace who said he ate at Mon Ami Gabi for the great food (strip steak and pom frites) and people watching. He's right. I would love to stay here again on business and if I was stuck anywhere else nearby, I'll be back in Paris to walk the casino and eat in the restaurants.

What really keeps us going back to the Paris is: our reservations are always correct! The service at the front desk is fast and everyone there is so friendly. The concierge is always helpful and pleasant! The rooms are clean, comfy beds and secure rooms. No overwhelming room cleaners or over-the-top febreze like freshener, just PLAIN CLEAN! They have wifi in the rooms for an hourly/daily/weekly rate, you pick, that for the convenience is well worth it to us. If you are a cheap charlie the coffee shop has free wifi and hopefully you like coffee and people overlooking what you type or who you are talking to! The pool is lovely with lots of space, chairs, and natural shade! The room service is excellent! At the end of each day you can relax in the quiet of your room, and the rooms are quiet!! No room parties or situations that allow 10 girls to stay in one room, as we\u2019ve experienced elsewhere!

She gave us a choice of a king on the 6th floor or two queens on the 23rd floor. We chose the 23rd floor & I am so glad we did!

It was awesome to have a private show so we didn't mind the noise.The bathroom was very nice with a tub & a shower with lots of storage space & plenty of towels. All the staff were very nice. The restaurants & shops were very charming made to look like a street in Paris with blue sky & clouds painted on the ceiling.

Gold card holders, however, had to wait in line, it was for 7 stars, diamond & platinum but it was all one line, not seperate lines like in Atlantic City. There was never anyone in line when we went, I'm not sure if there weren't any other card holders or they didn't realize they could use their card in another casino, in any case we were thrilled because there was a long line to get in. The consierge was able to print our boarding pass for free. I found out after I had already paid at a kiosk to print mine. I didn't have my husband's conf.# so I couldn't print his. Then I remembered seeing online that the hotel will print them, so we asked & sure enough they printed his for free, so remember to ask first before going to the kiosk! We had a wonderful time & the slots were much looser than AC I went home with twice what I came with & played on house money the whole time!

We arrived at about 8pm on a Tuesday night, and there was only a couple of minutes to wait at the front desk. The clerk there was friendly and helpful. I asked about the possibility of a complimentary upgrade from the 'Red Room' we had booked. She took several minutes hunting through the system and then offered us a 'Red Room Parlor Suite' on the 25th floor, which is basically a slightly larger room with dual aspect windows. We really liked the position of the room - being at the end of a corridor meant that we heard very little noise from any of the other guests. Paris is a LARGE hotel by European standards, but really quite manageable when compared to the other Vegas mega-resorts, so it was easy to get from our room out onto the Strip each day. A couple of minor niggles with the room. Although the bathroom was very large, there was only a single basin. It would have been useful to have two for his/hers, as there was certainly room to do that. More annoyingly, the only mirrors in the entire suite were inside the bathroom. Normally when we're getting ready to go out, I'll shower and then take the hairdryer and my make-up out to the bedroom so that my husband can use the shower next. This wasn't possible, and was really frustrating when we were trying to get ready together. Come on Paris - get a mirror somewhere in the bedrooms, PLEASE! Other than those minor things, we had an excellent stay this time. All the staff I spoke to were genuine and friendly, from cocktail waitresses in the casino to Wyatt the lovely security man I chatted to and Rosa, our lovely housekeeper. It was nice to feel that dealing with me was more than just a job for these guys, thanks :D We ate twice (breakfast and dinner) at Mon Ami Gabi, and both times were very impressed with food, service and value.

I confess, I am not a gambler or a lover of bars. Moreover, after getting off my flight, I flew in from London, I had two thin slices of pizza in the hotel (for $10!) and within a few hours was violently ill with a very unhappy stomach. This forced me to come into close contact with the floor of my room's bathroom and I was astounded to discover that it really wasn't very clean. Later, I dropped some stomach medication down the side of my bed and this forced me to move the bed away from the wall a bit. Ugh! There were glasses covered in dust and grime below the bed itself. They looked like they had been there for eons. With all of this in mind, I did the sensible thing and called the front desk. They apologised and said that in the morning they would make things right by giving me a room upgrade free of charge. In the morning, before the room change, I searched my room for a tea kettle to make myself some stomach soothing chamomille tea. No luck. Again I called the front desk and asked about a kettle. They informed me that only suites had such things (in Britain all rooms have them, but I guess not in the US) they also told me that my room upgrade would not have one either. My heart sank but I didn't have to say a word, the staff member on the phone did the right thing. \"Sir, we will make sure you are in a room with a kettle.\" So I ended up in a suite with a kettle that was probably worth a lot more than the room I had paid for. Even so, it was remarkably ordinary. And so is most of the hotel. Eiffel Tower aside, the hotel is like most others in Vegas. You have to wade through a smoke-filled maze-like casino to get almost anywhere and for me, that was not much fun. The Palazzo and the Venetian, which I visited later in my trip, do not force this same experience. And facilities at the Paris are rather poor for the large hotel that it is. Two, poorly kept up jacuzzis and a single, unheated, outdoor pool service the enormous hotel. It is not enough for the population that they are handling. And finally, a word about food. There are no cheap eats in The Paris. Everything, even breakfast, is extremely pricey. I figured this was just \"vegas\" but after wandering a bit, I discovered this to not be so. There are hotels that have little places to get food that doesn't cost a fortune. Sure, they also have expensive restaurants, all hotels do, but The Paris does not, and that was a nuisance. So, good customer service, poor facilities, costly food, and even suites that are really rather ordinary.

My wife and I stayed at Paris October 27th through November 1st of this year for the 18th time. As you probably can guess we love Paris. One of the top reasons is the casino. We are both nonsmokers and with a three story high ceiling the smoke dissipates quickly. Unless you are right next to a smoker you really do not notice the smoke. Most of the other casinos have low ceilings with some being only 10 feet high. At Paris we do not feel confined, the three stories high, and well lit daytime sky blue ceilings makes it feel very open. There is plenty of space between the table games and between the slots. Another top reason is Paris\u2019s location, being center strip. You are within walking distance to many of the shows as well as many of the great restaurants. Over the course of our many trips we have eaten at all the restaurants in Paris and have tried a lot of different dishes. All are very good. Some of the best is the Le Creperie, Le Burger Brasserie and Mon Ami Gabi (especially the outdoor caf\u00e9 area, no reservations accepted for the outdoor area). We have always found the service at Paris top notch including the front desk, maid service, restaurants, dealers, bars and especially the cocktail servers. When we checked in, our basic nonsmoking comped room was upgraded to a basic strip view room at no charge. We are very late night people when in Vegas, so typically we ask to have our room cleaned in the afternoon and we give a couple hour time frame to have it done and the maids were always accommodating. But, the best service is from the cocktail servers on the casino floor. Three servers are worth mentioning, at the slot machines during day shift Saturday through Wednesday is Andrea, table games during day shift Monday through Friday is Ferra and the best server that we have come across in Vegas is at the slot machines during the swing shift Wednesday through Sunday. Her name is Angela. Please adequately tip all the cocktail servers. Information about the room. The room was clean and spacious. Outlets by the desk as well as by the bed. For us the bed was great. We like a firm mattress and that is what we got. Plenty of hot water and it only took a few seconds to get hot. The shower and bathtub are separate. Yes, we had a tube style TV, so what! As stated by many others, the mini bar was empty, but you can use it like a refrigerator. You have the use of a free in room safe. The AC is quiet and does the job well. Paris has several room types available. If you book luxury or red room luxury you will not have a strip view, therefore do not expect it, even if you make a \u201cspecial request\u201d months ahead. There have been several posts about the noise from the Chateau Gardens Night Club (open only on Tuesday, Friday and Saturday evenings) vibrating the building. We did not have a problem with this when we were there. You can hear the base coming from the club but if you have the TV or radio on at a normal level you cannot hear the club Free WIFI is available in Caf\u00e9 Belle Madeleine. Paris is pet friendly. Check the website for details. Paris does not have a \u201cdoorman\u201d, but the first set of doors on the right has a button for \u201chandicapped\u201d access. This button will open both of the outside and inside set of doors. General Information. This information is primary for first timers to Paris and/or Vegas 1) If you drive to Vegas \u2013 Virtually all the Strip Hotels self parking lots are far away from front desk. To avoid carrying your luggage a long distance after parking your car you have two options. If you are with someone go to the normal entrance where the taxis drop people off, unload your luggage and have one person stay with the luggage, go park your car and then come back to help with the luggage or in most cases the bell hop can help (for a tip). If you are by yourself, you can leave your luggage with the bell hop (for a tip), tell them you are just going to park your car and then come back for your luggage or have it delivered to your room after check in. 2) From the airport taking a taxi for two people (about $17 with tip) or taking a shuttle for two people (about $15) cost about the same, but a taxi will go directly to your hotel while a shuttle will stop at multiple hotels. Also, the shuttle will drop you off on the back side of Paris which is the opposite side from check in. There are no baggage carts or bellhops where the shuttle drops you off. Then you have to carry your luggage all the way through the casino to get to check in. If you have more than two people a taxi will be cheaper (five can ride for the same price as one). Tell the taxi driver you want to go the Swenson Street route; this avoids the Strip and the freeway. 3) The cocktail servers in the table area as well as in the slot area have a zone that they are working in. Servers are not allowed to cross over to another zone to serve a customer even if it is right across the aisle. Therefore do not get mad if the server tells you that you are not in her zone/station. The servers primarily work for tips and most drinks that they serve you would cost $6 to $15 at the bar, therefore tip accordingly. If you are going to be in an area for 2 or 3 hours, get to know your server. Be nice to her, treat her with respect and tip well. During their shift she will take an hour break and a relief server fills in. 4) Many of the hotels have a mandatory resort fee of $22 or more per night. This resort fee is to cover the use of the gym and WIFI. Caesars Properties, which Paris is part of, does not charge a mandatory resort fee. They do charge $14.99 per 24 hours per device for WIFI in the room, (Smart phones are the same as a laptop) and $25 per day for gym access. There is FREE WIFI access in Caf\u00e9 Belle Madeleine. Therefore, if you do not use WIFI or the gym you will save money compared to the other resorts. 5) Food is available 24 hours at Paris with many choices throughout the day. For late night dining (11:00 PM to 6:00AM) food is only available at the Sugar Factory (which has an outdoor seating area). At most of the restaurants they give you a lot of food and if you have an average appetite you can split a meal (some of them may charge a small split plate fee). From about 10:30 AM to 12:30 PM and 6:00 PM to 8:00PM the lines at the restaurants can be quite long, if you can avoid these times your wait will be short. 6) If you arrive at Paris during the peak time of 10:00AM to 1:00PM, expect a line at the check in as people are also checking out. This is especially true on Fridays and Saturdays. To speed things up, the person that made the reservations need to have their ID and credit card available. Just in case, have your confirmation number/printout handy. 7) Paris may look old and that it needs a new coat of paint. Paris hotel and the Casino is meant to look like old Paris with cobblestone \u201cstreets\u201d, therefore what may look like old dingy paint is in reality the look that they have intended, i.e. a distressed look. 8) Vegas is a 24 hour city and people are always in the casinos. Paris does a very good job of keeping the Casino area clean, floors swept, ash trays emptied, drink glasses and bottles removed from the tables and slot machines. 9) If you book with a room with Paris at one price and you see that the rates have dropped before you make your trip, just call Paris (at least 72 hours prior) and ask them to adjust your rate. This does not work if you have booked a package deal or with some travel agent. 10) Remember, Vegas is expensive relative to most small towns and cities so do not be shocked at the prices for food and drinks. There are bargains if you do your research.

Rooms were clean and nice and quiet. Beds and bedding was very comfortable. The Paris hotel is located directly across the street from the Bellagio so it is very central. Lots of lunch options in the Paris and Starbuck within a 5 minute walk. We found the Paris hotel a great size. We have stayed at the MGM Grand which is lovely, but very big and quite a ways off from the central part of the strip. We drove to the Grand Canyon and enjoyed a wonderful sunset and sunrise at the South Rim. Back to Vegas and enjoyed our last 3 days lounging at the pool at the Paris. Nice and big and lots of lounge chairs available. We would definitely stay at the Paris again.", "Date": "November 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Honolulu, Hawaii", "Title": "\u201cGood experience will stay again\u201d", "Author": "brianla811", "ReviewID": "UR120123295", "Content": "When I book a room in Vegas, I consider the following: location, parking access and price of room between $100.00 to $275.00.

I had read reviews about the hotel and despite warnings regarding the noise, decided to give it a try based on the location, the still-open pool, and the kitch factor. Upon checking in we were informed that they did not have the King non-smoking room that I had requested. I asked if there were any upgrades available (based on the positive reviews for the Red Rooms on TA) and was given a top floor suite at no extra charge! Wow! The room, while obviously an older suite, was still amazing! Great view, tons of room, and two bathrooms. The amenities were older (no flat screen, traditional furniture) but these things aren't really necessary for my tastes. Who needs a TV in Vegas anyways? To address the noise issue: we didn't have a problem with it. On Thurs night we did the 80s music bumping, but it was off by midnight and we didn't hear it the rest of the weekend. Perhaps they've addressed the noise issues others have experienced in the past. Both the pool and casino areas, while busy, seemed more mellow and enjoyable than the same areas at other hotels. The pool is smaller and doesn't have the amazing landscaping of, say, the Mirage, but it was calm and relaxing. I also liked the lighting and decor of the casino/shopping/food areas. Other strip hotel casinos can feel like you're just in a giant room filled with machines, and the Paris just seemed a little more...intimate and interesting. I also loved that Paris is right in the middle of the strip. While I realize my experience at the Paris was shaped largely on the amazing (free!) room upgrade, I believe I would have enjoyed it without, though I probably would have spent a lot more time downstairs than up in the room watching the Bellagio fountain show over and over again. I wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for modern/chic Vegas or a clubbing/party hotel, though they do seem to be upping the ante with the Chateau nightclub.

The rooms are average in size, but the beds are comfy, you get closet space, a desk w/ wifi (which I guess you have to pay for, I didn't use it so I'm not sure about the charges), an arm chair or two (depending on whether or not you have a 2 qn sized beds of a king bed), and a good size bathroom with OK counter space and separate shower & tub. Our room was showing it's age, but it was clean and comfortable. We had a non-Strip view this time and it is much quieter overall (although I still kind of missed seeing the lights, etc). I know this may sound weird, but for the first time I noticed that the mirror didn't steam up when I was finished with my shower - I realized that they had a vent above the shower stall that pulled out all the steamy air. This makes a difference when you have a couple of people taking a shower before they go out - no steamy mirror, the air doesn't feel all sticky while you are trying to get changed, etc. Small point, but it was that kind of detail that made me enjoy the room a bit more. Location is great - on the Strip, between Planet Hollywood (young crowds, louder bars) and Ballys (which you can reach via a short connecting walk past some retail stores & restaurants from Paris); right across the street from Bellagio and Cosmopolitan (which you can reach by crossing the street rather than the above ground walkways that can get claustrophic sometimes). Food - lots of choices here although I was not able to partake of any of their edible offerings this trip (the buffet is good, but didn't have time this trip); from very casual coffee/muffin/sandwich to bistro/cafe to Mon Ami Gabi, a steakhouse, the Eiffel Tower restaurant, etc. I haven't eaten at all of these, but reviews and word of mouth ensure a future visit to one of these in the future. Casino setting is comfortable - you aren't cramped between a lot of machines and chairs, lots of selection, and the architecture inside the casino makes it visually interesting as you walk around (from the fountain, to the 'legs' of the Eiffel Tower that stand inside the casino, there is a definite atmosphere to this place that feels like no other casino). Of course it doesn't compare to the real thing, but hey, it's Vegas.... The rooms can all be accessed easily - there is a main entrance to all rooms (four different elevator 'wings' help ease any congestion or long waits between floors) - and you don't feel like you have to walk two blocks to reach the casino floor.

I have lost count of the number of times we have stayed there but it would be better than 20. We are regulars to Las Vegas and the Paris has been our favorite hotel for years. We were quite saddened to see evidence of neglect and disrepair throughout the hotel including the rooms, that we had only begun to notice on our last visit there in 2010. I can only assume this is due to the difficult economic times and reflects tighter budgets and narrower profit margins. That part aside the Paris is still worth a visit and I would still stay there again. The food choices are excellent offering quick budget snacks to fine dining and everything in between. The buffet as well is one of the best on the strip with an excellent selection of varied and quality food. The Casino at the Paris is bright an airy with a blue sky painted ceiling and the actual legs of the Eiffel Tower descending in among the slots. We have found in recent years that the Paris has tightened their slots so watch your risks and gamble wisely or all too soon you'll be at the cash machine or up in your room wondering what's on TV. The rooms at the Paris come in 2 flavors, original Blue French Provincial or the newer Red Rooms. Both are good but obviously the newer remodeled rooms are going to be nicer.

Having read previous reviews, when checking in, I asked for a quiet room far away from the nightclub in order to sleep well enough to not sleep through my meetings. I was assured that was not a problem and was given a room on the north side of the building. Throughout my stay, I suffered a steady night time boom, boom, boom of club music bass. On the second night the room literally shook until almost midnight. The desk clerk advised me the entire hotel reverberated the beat and I was welcome to check out as my only option. Having prepaid for the room with a 3rd party, I did not exercise the option, rather accepted the discomfort and made the best of it. First, the room. Large and rather outdated. Clean with well worn sculpted carpets, the beds were hard yet reasonably comfortable. Nice pillows, sufficient to bury my head and muffle a bit of the noise. The tube TV seemed strangely old fashioned, but was operable. There were at least 5 channels in Chinese, a couple spanish language stations, 1 gay channel, multiple Vegas activity and Restaurant channels and a dismally poor array of general interest channels. The bathroom was the room's only delight. Covered in marble tile, it was spacious. The toilet flushed well and the drains drained. A separate shower and bathtub with good water pressure gave my room a bit of redemption. I did not eat in the restaurants as longish lines and generous prices encouraged me to victual elsewhere. The casino itself was dark 24 hours a day, making it a bit difficult to adjust to sunlight when stepping outside. The sky painted ceiling, cobblestone like floor and period french architecture gave on a sense of Paris but the background music had a stripclub/rave appeal. Overall, this was not an enjoyable stay, rather a test of endurance.

The room was comfortable; the view we had was uninspiring. (We were in the back of the hotel overlooking another building.) The concierge staff was extremely helpful when we said we were renting a car to go to the Valley of Fire, giving us directions, etc. They also suggested renting off property as the rental at the hotel was at a premium. One complaint - I always look forward to a particular banana tart at one of the restaurants at the hotel (I don't remember the name of the particular restaurant.) The tart is chocolate in a pastry shell with carmelized bananas on top. When I finally had the tart on Friday, in the first bite there was a massive hair!

We stayed in room 1037 in one of the older rooms. There wasn't a view of the pool or the Bellagio fountains across the street but you could still see the lights of the city and neighboring hotels. The noise level was never an issue in our area. The room was older and dated as some others have mentioned but it was clean, comfortable and roomy. The TV was old and not a flat screen but other than using it to check on the news and weather, we didn' watch it so this wasn't a big deal to us. If it is to you, ask to be placed in one of the newer red rooms. The hotel has several eating establishments to choose from. There is a buffet, upscale restaurants, bistros, cafes, etc. What we liked most about this hotel is that it wasn't full of restaurant chains and mall type stores that many of the other hotels had. It honestly feels like you are walking through the streets of Paris. The atmosphere can't be beat. It was fun to walk around the other hotels on the strip as they each have their own unique theme but again, most of them have a lot of commercial features too. It crossed my mind that it would feel like staying in a mall that also had a hotel. Staying at Paris makes you feel like you're in another country. We rented a car for the day one of the days we were there. There is an AVIS rental office right next to the check in desk. Red Rock Canyon, Lake Mead and the Hoover Dam are all within a short driving distance. It's really worth it to rent a car or to go on a tour to view the mountains...especially if you aren't from that part of the country. It's quite something to drive through the hustle and bustle of Las Vegas and then be faced with this gorgeous scenary and nature within minutes. I will give Paris 5 starts because we really did love it. But a couple of notes....the nightclub Chateau was very nice but a bit pretentious for our style. We went there for a short time then moved down the block to Harrah's \"Carnival Court\"...this was a much more laid back outdoor bar with bands, DJ's and dancing. More our speed for sure but it depends on what you are looking for. And while we did like the buffet at Paris, we liked the brunch at the Monte Carlo hotel more.

I have stayed at many properties in Las Vegas and find myself always rebooking at the Paris. I generally stay for 5 - 10 days (a long time by Vegas standards), to enjoy the strip. Paris consistently provides me with a comfortable place to stay, with well maintained recently renovated rooms accommodating my \"view\" request (I generally overlook the Bellagio fountains). Another reviewer recently mentioned the noise of the new Chateau Night Club. I will completely second all her comments with the exception of the reaction from staff. My Casino Host immediately began checking on the issue (yes - in every sense of the word, the noise was decible breaking and completely unacceptable until 4 a.m.), calling another manager and going out to investigate. He even invited me to come along, which I did. In a subsequent follow up phone call to me, he stated that they will be working on the problem of the noise, as apparently on this \"soft opening\" (it was one night only), someone had the sound levels too high. Much research had gone into what was acceptable for the hotel patrons, and this had gone WAY OVER what was acceptable. I've stayed at the hotel so many times without any problems that I forgave this indescretion. I was told that I could change rooms, however, they were NOT going to open the nightclub again at any point during my stay, which they did not. Once that problem was solved for me, the remainder of my stay was quite acceptable. I felt that my complaints were heard and they were doing something to resolve them. If nothing is done once the nightclub is opened permanently, this could be a very difficult problem - my best advise would be to call the hotel and find out if the problem has been resolved prior to booking a room. That said, I'm already booked to go back in December. The convenience of being right in the middle of the strip with very easy access in and out of Paris (unlike many of the other properties where you seemingly walk 'forever' just to get to your room), is great. The Mon Ami Gabi restaurant on property is outstanding - best French Onion Soup you've ever had - guaranteed. Many other restaurants on the property are available as well. My only negatives are the standard for ALL the hotels that I've stayed at in Vegas.

Otherwise, I will continue to return to Paris as out of all the properties I've stayed at, I've enjoyed the atmosphere the most while there. Oh, and be sure to take the ride up the Eiffel Tower to check out the views - I'm sharing my photos in this review (poor quality due to cell phone, but incredible views, nonetheless!). Oh - one more note - the taxi hailer is a total snarky guy. Feels he is OWED a tip for opening a door for you after the cab arrived. He made a very nasty comment about how he hoped we appreciated his service as he was closing the door after we didn't tip him. Everyone in Vegas has their hands out for tips, and you get a bit tired of it after awhile and multiple cab rides (I would never drive a car in Vegas - just too much traffic) - so be prepared to deal with their wrath if you don't tip someone. Personally, I'm comfortable with it. I tip for outstanding service, but can open my own car door.", "Date": "October 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cAbove average, older atmosphere\u201d", "Author": "madiw_", "ReviewID": "UR119270361", "Content": "I stayed 2 nights with a girlfriend in August.

Let's start out with the positive items. The hotel is lovely decorated French style with shops, restaurants and such in the Parisian fashion so it was nice to stroll around and see everything. Having easy access to Bally's via a walkway indoors was nice also. I saw Barry Manilow while staying there and since his show is at the Paris Hotel, that was the biggest plus. The restaurants are overpriced so we mainly stayed away but did avail ourselves of two eateries. La Creperie where they make the best French crepes with various fillings was superb. A bit pricey at $10 each but they were big enough for tow people. We also ate at their pizza location next to La Creperie and they had a deal for 2 slices and a drink for $10. The slices are big so unless you are really hungry, just order 1 slice. My husband did go down to get me coffee at their bakery (in the same area) for our last morning and paid $3.50 for a small cup. The room was detailed nicely and the bathroom was very nice with a tub and separate shower which is rare. It was also very large and my favorite part of the room! On the down side, the room had not been updated and had an old tv that did not work 1/2 the time. The bed was lumpy and uncomfortable. There is no coffee pot in the room and when I called about that, I was told that was standard in Vegas. Not true at our last hotel. We also had asked for an upgrade and did not receive it. Our view was of concrete and roofs of other floors. Also, even though the bathroom was lavishly appointed, the shower head did not adjust and sent out a fine mist. It took forever to rinse my hair. Just looking at the surface though, the room was well appointed if you do not mind no to little TV and sleeping on a lumpy bed. The casino at the Paris is one of the smallest in all of the hotels on the strip and the smokiest. I had trouble walking around downstairs because the smoke was so strong.

However, the rooms are quiet and the beds are comfortable. Even my non-view room had a decent view of Bally's and the Platinum hotel. I will agree with other reviewers that the checkin staff was less than welcoming, but the housekeeping staff was wonderful. One thing I hated about this hotel was the valet parking. Getting into the valet parking seems all but impossible unless you enter the hotel from the Strip, which of course is a nightmare. Getting out is the same -- you have to turn on to the strip. All the while, there are pedestrians crossing in front of the entrance/exit. If you are lucky enough to get a break in the pedestrians (drunk people aren't very good about following the crosswalk signals, so be careful), it may be moot because traffic may easily be backed up beyond the intersection. I sat for 15 minutes trying to get out of the valet parking on Friday afternoon. I do not recommend using the valet parking, and you may not have a choice because it was full a few times when I pulled into the hotel.

Tastefully decorated and of a good size, the little time that we spent in the room was very comfortable and relaxing. I slept really well in this hotel, with no complaints about noise from the hallway, other rooms, the strip etc. The room benefited from a room safe, large plasma screen TV, chaise lounge, empty mini-bar?? and a massive, extremely comfortable bed! The bathroom featured a separate bath and shower and came equipped with toiletries, hair drier, decent towels etc. The best thing about our room however, was the fabulous view of the strip. Located at the front of the hotel, we overlooked the pool and enjoyed a fantastic view of the Bellagio lake and hotel. The room was kept spotless by the excellent housekeeping service, who left us a little note to thank us for the tips I left. Outside of the room, the hotel has a decent size casino, resident shows, spacious pool, gym, many bars and restaurants, along with apparently one of the best buffets on the strip, although expect a queue. I found the food at the buffet to be OK, there was certainly a wide choice, but my advice would be to find a decent restaurant instead. You're in Vegas! There are fabulous restaurants everywhere! The Paris is very cleverly decorated to look like you're outside. If you look at the clouds on the ceiling while you're walking, they actually look like they're moving. This combined with the replica french streets, bridge and of course, the Eiffel Tower, create a theme that's fun, but surprisingly not too over-the-top or tacky. I'd recommend a trip up the tower. Buy one get one free vouchers are easy to find and the views are excellent, especially of the Bellagio fountain show. Time it with sunset for some great photo opportunities. The Paris is connected to Ballys via an indoor shopping arcade. You can catch the Monorail from Ballys to other areas of the strip. Although the Paris benefits from an excellent central location, the strip is just over 4 miles long and the Monorail is a great and cost effective way of traveling up and down when you're tired of walking in the desert heat! When choosing your hotel in Vegas, be aware that the MGM Mirage Group hotels, which is pretty much most of the hotels on the strip, now charge a controversial 'resort fee'. When I visited Vegas last year, this fee effectively bumped the room rate up. It's not the cost of this fee that's the problem, its the principle. If you're going to implement an extra, mandatory fee to cover the use of the hotel's facilities, regardless of whether or not the guest uses them, why not add it on to the room rate so your guests know what they're paying when they book the room, not when they check out?! I'm pleased to say that the Paris is not part of the MGM Mirage Group and does NOT charge a resort fee. Thank you Paris. In conclusion, the Paris is a fun, centrally located hotel and casino, offering comfortable rooms when you run out of energy and need to grab some sleep.

RESERVATIONS: We didn't make them for the convention, but when I tried to make them for the non-convention days, I was pleased with the friendliness of the staff who operate the reservation line. CHECK-IN: Very fast and friendly. The front desk clerk was helpful and willing to answer our questions. ROOM: To put it simply...if I had paid the price they wanted to charge during the non-convention days, I would have been REALLY ticked off! (Thankfully, my company paid for my room during the convention.) The room itself was nice...decorated in French decor, of course. But, frankly speaking, it wasn't worth more than $100 a night! (Which is why we moved to Bally's after the convention.) The beds were hard, the t.v. (the old tube kind) had TERRIBLE reception, there was no microwave and I could hear the person in the next room coughing all night. The soaps and shampoo were nice, but not worth any extra $$. And to top it off...they wanted to charge $14.95 for 24 hours of internet. PLEASE!!! That is absolutely ridiculous. FACILITIES: The Paris \"grounds\" are quite stunning. The casino area is made to look like it is outdoors. Very pretty. The shops are nice and I found some nice little trinkets to take home. RESTAURANTS: I am NOT into buffets, but decided to try their $15.99 breakfast buffet. It was AMAZING and I highly recommend it to anyone staying at the hotel. I won't get into all the details, but the choices were mind boggling. They had everything from freshly made Belgiun waffles to made-to-order crepes and omelets. There were pastries, bacon, sausage, different types of meats, grits, oatmeal, lots of fresh fruit, the list goes on and on. CHECK-OUT: We tried to check out via the t.v., but couldn't, so I called downstairs. Check-out was completed in 2 minutes by a very friendly front desk clerk. OVERALL: After the convention, we spent 2 days at Bally's. (The \"sister\" of the Paris hotel.) While Bally's atmosphere wasn't as nice as the Paris, it was fine for what Bally's charged. (Though the Paris room was cleaner.) I just feel as if the Paris charges way too much without any real added benefit. My other complaint...if you use the self-parking, it is quite a trek to check-in. But, Las Vegas isn't known for convenience...it is known for gambling. So realize this...the hotels in Vegas are built around getting you to spend money by either gambling or going to shows...\"convenience\" isn't in the Vegas vocabulary.", "Date": "October 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Waco, Texas", "Title": "\u201cJust a room\u201d", "Author": "tripfriends", "ReviewID": "UR118814543", "Content": "I've stayed here a number of times but the rooms are just an expensive room w/no real style or character.

Now, we arrived at midnight so that may have had a bearing on the upgrade. We were told that we had a handicap bathroom and asked if that would be alright, I replied \"certainly\". The room was really nice. Very clean, had a fridge and even had a coffeemaker! Not much of a view but we didn't come to Vegas to stare out the window. Now, the handicap bathroom was a bit of a challenge. Can't readily explain the set-up with the shower but it was a mess and I nearly flooded the bathroom on two occasions. The bathroom lavatory had a nice sink but very little space to put your toiletries on. The bed was wonderful!!! That room had, without a doubt, the very best bed I've every slept in during my entire life. I would have loved to have taken it home with me. Housekeeping came around every morning and kept our room clean and neat and we didn't hear any noisy people during our entire stay. I can't give any kind of a review on the restaurants at the Paris because they were very expensive and we found other places on the strip to eat. They did have a wonderful aroma as we were walking through the hotel restaurant area but there was always huge lines to get into the buffet. We did a little gambling there but the casino is rather small and again we found other nearby casinos to give our money to. I found the Paris a little difficult to get around in and a bit cluttered. Check-out was a breeze, we did that with our remote on the TV. Due to a late afternoon flight we had to leave our luggage with the bell captain and found those gentlemen very nice and upon our return had our luggage and a taxi for us quickly.

This was our third visit to Las Vegas and our third stay at The Paris. We choose The Paris because of our past experiences at the hotel and also because of its location - in the centre of The Strip and close to lots of attractions. We were greeted by a very friendly woman who checked us in and she gave us a free upgrade. We had booked a luxury room and usually we would get a view of Ballys and the mountains; this time we still had the luxury room but the view was of the pool and part of The Strip. With the exception of one rude waitress at the Caf\u00e9, everyone at The Paris was friendly and very helpful. Our weather wasn't that great but we did spend a few hours by the pool one day- the pool is great, water was not too cold, and it is larger than you think when you start swimming. We ordered a drink and although they couldn't make exactly what we wanted they improvised and we received a refreshing strawberry daiquari with a touch of banana liqueur. Yummmmm! My reviews of the Caf\u00e9 and Mon Ami Gabi can be found under their respective names on TripAdvisor. I did CSI:The Experience and we ate at Canelletto's in the Venetian Hotel and you can read my reviews of those experiences on TripAdvisor. Check out was a breeze. When I was on the plane going home I realized that I had left my prescription and non-prescription medication in the hotel room. Upon my return home I called The Paris and spoke to Nellie (not sure of the spelling) and Marian, both from Security. Long story short, my medications were returned to me last Friday. It was a good feeling to know that there are still some honest people in this world from the housekeeper to finding the medications and turning them in to the people in Security who packaged my medications and sent them to me via courier. I will definitely stay at The Paris again. One comment though: the rooms need upgrading from the furniture (the desk had a handle missing) to the pillows (too soft) to the mattresses (one of the mattresses has a permanent dent in it making the bed lopsided).

We complained about the state of the room and asked to be moved and while they were happy for us to move and were pleasant, we were basically told there could be no way the room would be dirty as they were newly renovated. The second room we were given was in exactly the same state. By this point we were losing our temper and asked to see a manager. The on duty manager was conveniently busy and could not see us but a king room had suddenly become available to us.

The room was amazing with a sofa and armchair which we turned to face the full length window and just marvelled at the view!. bathroom was huge with a seperate bath and shower and everywhere was spotlessly clean.

We chose this resort because we had such a favorable impression of the place when we walked over from Bellagio during our previous visit. Compared to the dark and crowded Bellagio, we found this casino to be pleasant, not overcrowded, and not too smoky, so we decided this would be the location for our next stay. I was very pleased with the rate we booked directly through the Paris website -- we were able to take advantage of a 40% off sale offered through the Caesars for a limited time during the summer. This great rate enabled us to book one of the upgraded Red Rooms at a cost comparable to regularly priced standard room. We arrived around 11 pm on a Thursday to prompt service from the bellman and the valet. There was no wait at check-in. Unfortunately, the front desk service wasn't great. He was rather rude and dismissive when we inquired about upgrades (for which we'd have gladly paid). The, after he'd already taken our credit card and applied the pre-authorization charges, he showed us a rate sheet that was nearly double what we'd booked. He fixed the mistake after we insisted, but with no hint of an apology. We then asked if the wrong amount had been preauthorized on our credit card, and he assured us it would not, but as we suspected, that's exactly what happened. The result was that nearly double the correct amount was tied up as unavailable on our credit card balance for the duration of our trip. This wasn't a tragedy for us, as we knew we'd likely have restaurant and spa charges that would easily reach the total being held, so we were fine with having that balance set aside. But, it still shouldn't have happened. A guest traveling on a tighter budget without extra financial resources could have been seriously inconvenienced by such a mistake. We were assigned to room 2695, which had a rather uninspiring view of the back of Bally's, but this was fine, as we spent little time in the room and even less time at the window. The Red Room included a coffee maker and a refrigerator. The refrigerator looked like an emptied-out honor-bar fridge. We appreciated this amenity, as we'd picked up water and other drinks from Von's on our way into town. The room featured smart decor, and it was spotless. The bed linens were comfortable, although one day our bed was made up with stained sheets. The towels were sufficiently large and plush. The bathroom featured plenty of counter space and a separate tub and shower. The shower had decent water pressure and glass doors, but it was not especially spacious. The bathtub was of standard size. The armoire/dresser unit included two small cupboards for hanging clothes, but there was no proper closet and no luggage stand or other horizontal surface for holding a suitcase unless one used the small couch, the coffee table or the upholstered bench at the foot of the bed. Overall, we found the room comfortable but not luxurious. This was in-line with our expectations for the property. For parking our rental car, we used valet service a few times and self-parking for the rest. Valet service was fine, the longest wait we had to retrieve our car was about 15 minutes. The parking garage was rather filthy and there were a few sketchy looking characters around at times, but we had no problems while using this facility. We had great meals at Sugar Factory and the Eiffel Tower Restaurant. A meal at the Cafe Il St Louis featured eggs that tasted spoiled and confusion and lack of effort on the part of the waitstaff who didn't seem to know which menu items were available at 11:30 AM. They offered us a breakfast menu that said \"available until 11 AM,\" and when we asked for a lunch menu they said they couldn't place any lunch menu orders until noon. I also had a visit to the spa and salon where I received excellent services. But the spa facilities looked rather worn and not particularly clean. The spa's jacuzzi, in particular, was about as aesthetically pleasing as the one in my local YMCA. The best part of the stay was the overall ambiance of the casino area of property, which was bright, clean, not too smoky, not too crowded, and offered easy access to the Strip. My husband was disappointed that there was no poker room, however. The worst part of our stay was the poor service at check-in and especially the improper credit card preauthorization that was nearly double what it should have been. On balance, our stay was \"Comme Ci, Comme \u00c7a\" -- just so-so. I'd consider going back, but it probably wouldn't be my first choice, and I wouldn't set my expectations very high.

If you are staying in the Paris area of the strip, I would highly recommend the \"Buffet of Buffets\" option. It is $44.95 and they put it on your players card. It is good for 24 hours and can be used for up to 7 buffets during that 24 hour period (I don't think that is humanly possible), and it good at about 8 different hotels...some of which are: Harrahs, Paris, Caesar's palace, Flamingo, Rio, etc).

We asked the friendly cashier if we could charge to our room, and she said yes so we gave her our room key. Turns out it's a slip of paper you need to bring for charging privileges that you're given when you check-in (strange system). We apologized and said, no problem, we'd just pay cash. The cashier was surprised that the check-in agent did not tell us about it. Sandwich was ample and pastries were elegant looking and rich tasting.

You're staffing a public desk and there's a customer in front of you...maybe you should give some service? There were no other customers waiting.

No full or 3/4 length mirror in the room so one could try on outfits while the other is using the bathroom. Usually after I shower, I can do my makeup in the room while DH showers. However, the room lighting relative to the mirrors was so poor there was no place to do it. Bathroom was large but also an old design: no place to put your towel while you showered so you had to open the shower door and get a blast of cold air (remember it's a large marble bathroom) to get your towel. Make up mirror was mounted too high for me to use. No fan or sunlamp in bathroom. Rooms and layout at Palazzo were much nicer. Room attendents did a good job and the pool area was clean and spacious. Didn't want to deal with the staff so we did all our gambling elsewhere so I don't know how the tables played.

It was our first visit to Vegas and we thoroughly enjoyed the stay. On booking in, we upgraded to a room with a King bed and the room was fine. We didn't pay for a view of the strip, given that we didn't plan on spending much time in the room at any rate, but it was worth the extra for the king bed. The room also had a good sized (I'd say around 40 inch) tv. The hotel is fairly central on the strip, so great for getting about to view the other hotels. In particular, it's just across the road from the Bellagio and Caesar's Palace. Most folk don't seem to walk much in Vegas, but we did and spent a fair bit of time visiting the other hotels to have a peek at what they were like inside. It's fair to say that we thought that Paris compared pretty favourably and perhaps only the Venetian seemed to top it for how it was set up inside. We didn't go to Vegas to gamble, so didn't spend much time in casino's however, coming from NZ, it would be great to see Nevada catch up with the rest of the world and ban smoking inside. It seems fairly bizarre that the minority get to put the majority out (given that the smoking rates in the States seem to be around 20%). The casinos would be much nicer if they were smoke-free, but this isn't unique to the Paris. While in Vegas, we paid a visit to the outlet stores at the south end of the strip (I actually think that we single-handedly helped to prop up the American economy and dread seeing my Mastercard bill). This was well worth the visit. We bought a 24 hour ticket that enabled us to jump on and off the buses. At $7, this was great value. We used the same approach to get out to Freemont St in old Vegas, again, something that is really worth seeing - especially for the huge screens on the roof. They seem to do a bit of a \"show\" on the hour, accompanied by music, so it's well worth popping down for an evening while you are there. The other highlight of our visit was a trip to the Grand Canyon. We flew out (a firm called Papillon) in a 12 seater aircraft and then got a chopper into the Canyon itself. It was a little expensive at $384 each, but ensured that we got to see the canyon from above and below, as well as a brief boat trip on the Colorado river. Some of the others we spoke to complained that they had flown out in helicopters and didn't actually land on the rim, so only got to see the Canyon from the chopper and then from the Canyon floor. Our option ensured that we got the best of all worlds and we thoroughly enjoyed it. We also went on the Skywalk. This cost around $35 each and you aren't allowed to take your own camera out with you, so if you want photos, you have to get the ones that are taken of you while you are out. Again, we enjoyed this and were glad that we did it. In summary, I'd definitely recommend the Paris.

We also visited the Dueling Piano Bar, which was fun! The guys on the piano that night were pretty funny. However, drinks were VERY expensive within the bar; 3 mixed drinks for $35. Yikes. As for the room we stayed in; it was just alright. The beds and pillows were NOT comfortable at all. The view we had was nice; overlooking the pool and the strip. The overall cleaniness of the hotel was good...our housekeeper was awesome! The bathrooms were spacious. Overall, the hotel is nice. However, I don't think I'd stay there again...just based on the beds. I like to be comfortable while on vacation. Especially when I'm coming from a 3 hour time difference. While in Las Vegas, I would recommend going to Paris Hotel and exploring!

The clerk told me they had upgraded me already, but in reality, they gave me the room I paid for on bookit.com, which was an upgraded room without a view.

It was a great location and nice and quiet., as requested. Inside the room the basic and the bathroom was well appointed and clean. There was an empty mini bar that we were able to use to keep our bottled water cold. The bedding was nice but not as comfortable as those at the MGM Mirage properties. We have stayed on several of the properties on the strip and thought we would give Paris a try and glad we did. It was a nice quaint hotel compared to the mega resorts in Vegas. It seemed as though they were missing all the drunken 20 somethings that we have encountered at the south end of the strip -- didn't appear to be geared towards that crowd. The casino is attached to Bally's via an indoor mall, where you can find places to eat, shop or stop by Napoleans for some evening entertainment. Planet Hollywood is directly on the other side of the hotel where there are many more places to grab a bite to eat. (Earl of Sandwiches is great for a late night snack if you want a great inexpensive sandwhich -- or anytime, I guess) We took advantage of the using pool, since it was so tempting seeing it right outside our window. It was so nice, water was clean and refreshing and plenty of seats open in the shade. They turn misters on from the arches when it gets hot, so you could scope out your seats early if you're going to stay the day. There are cocktail waitresses that come around to give you a flag to attach to your chair. You can flip it up when you need a refill. I saw a couple of c,abanas by the pool, but weren't occupied and don't know how much to rent one. With all the shade available at the pool, don't know if those will be a bit hit. There was a cute little sundries shop right on the way out to the pool if you had forgotten sunscreen or hat, etc. What was nice is that you didn't have to walk through the casino or public areas at all to get to the pool. Nicely done!! The casino, like the hotel, is kind of quaint with very friendly cocktail waitresses and a good variety of machines.

This time I tried the Luxor and checked out after one hour and ran back to the Paris!! If you into a long walk to a pool with no shade and loud hip-hop music and the tatoo crowd, then the Luxor is for you! If not, then go to the Paris! The Paris has a nice quiet relaxing ambiance. The pool is at the bottom of the elevator. You can get from your room to the pool in 3 minutes versus walking half a mile to the Mandalay pool. The Eiffel tower (built half to scale! Fact. Check Wikipedia) provides a nice view and shade. If you can get a room facing the strip, you can watch the bellagio fountain show from your room. The rooms are nice- clean. How much time do you spend in the room anyway?! Lol The buffet is solid. I rank it #3 behind #1 wicked spoon at cosmopolitan; #2 Wynn buffet. The Paris buffet has great French fare. There is great French pastry Cafe in the Paris hotel. The crowd is nice quiet mild. No tatoo urban hip-hop crowd. Big plus! I have seen most of the hotels in 4-star range. The Paris is the best!

Overall, we had a great week and found the hotel to be a pleasant, enjoyable stay, with both positives and negatives. This was our first trip to Vegas and we chose the Paris primarily because of the fantastic location, right in the heart of the Strip, and because it does not charge mandatory resort fees like most of the resorts do. The public areas of the hotel are beautiful and well-maintained. And, for the most part, the folks who work there were very friendly and helpful. In addition, both the public areas and our rooms seemed to be quite clean. Our rooms were standard-sized with no street or casino noise, although both my mother and my husband and I could hear the folks in our adjoining rooms clearly. Check-in and check-out were a breeze and no problem at all, although I am still waiting to receive my receipt from the express check-out. Three of the best restaurants that we ate at while in Vegas are located on the Paris property. These three consistently had the best food and were the most reasonably priced, making it incredibly convenient and easy for us to enjoy a delicious meal at our home base. Each morning when we got up, my husband went downstairs to Cafe Belle Madeleine to get us all coffee and pastries to bring back to the room for breakfast. These were the best pastries we\u2019ve ever tasted, especially the cream cheese danishes. Since it\u2019s located at the entrance to the bank of elevators and we had to pass it every evening upon returning to our rooms, we usually ended up with dessert, as well! The gals who work here were wonderful, consistently cheerful and friendly. Mon Ami Gabi is a fantastic steakhouse with both indoor and outdoor seating. The outdoor veranda is located directly across from the Bellagio fountains and we were thrilled our first evening there to have a front row seat to the fountain show across the street. The french onion soup is, hands down, the best any of us had ever tasted. The remainder of our meal, shrimp cocktail, fish and chips, and pork tenderloin, were all excellent quality and extraordinarily prepared for a very reasonable (Vegas-standard) price. If you go at peak times, though, be sure to make reservations to avoid a long wait. Finally, Le Burger Brasserie prepared what may have been the best burger any of us had ever eaten, cooked to order, juicy and moist. All of the wait staff at these facilities were tops. For the down side, we were disappointed when we checked in that the hotel could not accommodate our request for adjoining rooms. Luckily, we were able to get on the same floor, although my husband and I were down a different corridor than my mother. We both had adjoining rooms to our rooms, just not adjoining to each other. Had we been traveling with children, this could\u2019ve been a real problem. We were also pretty underwhelmed at our standard rooms. For all of the over-the-top ambiance in the public areas, our rooms were disappointing. We finally realized the reason why was there is no comforter or spread on the beds. The bedding consisted of basic, white sheets with a gold-colored band of cloth that was laid across the bottom when it was \u201cmade.\u201d If you look at the picture of one of its standard rooms that the hotel has posted on its website and imagine the beds stripped of the comforter that is pictured, that\u2019s what we got. The beds always looked unmade and it cheapened the feel of the room. I can understand that bedspreads in a hotel are considered one of the germiest areas of a hotel room. But, if cleanliness is the issue, why not choose a fluffy comforter with a removable, washable cover. It would\u2019ve made such a difference. In addition, the carpet in our room, #808, had a fairly large patch in the middle of it where it had been \u201crepaired.\u201d The overall effect was somewhat worn and shabby. By contrast, the bathrooms were large and lovely. We were also disappointed at the $15 charge for 24 hours of internet service. Seriously? In this day and age? Finally, we were a little disheartened by our concierge service. Our first day there, we inquired how to obtain tickets for Cirque de Soleil\u2019s \u201cKA,\u201d rated as perhaps the number 1 show in Vegas. We were told to go to MGM where the show is located. After making our way through suffocating record heat (110 degrees!) to the ticket office, we were told that KA was on vacation that week. One would\u2019ve thought that a concierge at a major resort should have been aware that the number 1 show in Vegas was on vacation. In addition, when we inquired about day trips to the Grand Canyon, the same concierge told me that the trip to the South Rim was too long and \u201cnot worth it.\u201d Thank goodness we did not listen to her advice. We booked the trip on our own (see our review of Grand Adventures) and it was one of the highlights, if not THE highlight, of our trip. It was incredible. Bottom line: we would probably stay here again if we got a really good deal. However, with all the options to choose from in Vegas, why not try something else?

The rooms itself are a bit tired, and could use a makeover, however I slept great every nite something I don't do in hotels.

This was my second visit to Paris and still definitely enjoyed it, but I think the hotel and casino in general need some \"polishing\". The french theme is beautiful throughout every bit of the property. So it's hard to say that things look \"dated\" but things do need to be cleaned up/polished just a little bit. For example, I have been coming to Vegas for about 15 years now and have seen and heard that several other hotels have been upgraded... I have not heard of or noticed any upgrades at Paris yet. In our \"luxury room\" (which is the basic room at the hotel), some of the lampshades were missing some embellishments. The nooks and crannies in the bathroom mirror needed cleaned out a little bit. Some of the wallpaper was peeling a bit. Our king sized bed seemed crooked and it was very uncomfortable compared to the super comfortable queen beds in a friend's room there! The mini bar was empty and you couldn't use the fridge for your own items. To me, none of these are a big deal, but I know there are some people out there that would find this unacceptable. The Cafe Ile St. Louis was very yummy and reasonably priced at about 10:30 at night, but breakfast was expensive and not what I was looking for. The buffet always had hugely long lines, so I never ate at it. The Burger Brasserie food was good, although pricey for burgers and fries. I did, however, have the best vanilla milkshake I've ever had in my life there!!! I also did not eat at the \"La Pizza\" joint, but the pizza looked and smelled so good every time we walked by! The $17 strawberry daquiri in the Eiffel Tower container was awesome, and quite an eye catcher. Get it at Gustav's Bar while there. Most of the restaurants are also true to the french theme, but do seem to offer a nice menu. The casino is small doesn't seem to offer a big variety of traditional slot machines. There are tons of different new video slot machines. The scenery like a french street is charming though. Definitely ride to the top of the Eiffel Tower! This was one of the highlights of my entire trip - as many times as I've been to Vegas this was my first Eiffel Tower trip. You can see so much of the strip from the top, and we could see the Bellagio fountains from the top too! It was a neat activity to do. There are convenience shops in the hallway, plus other shops between Paris and Ballys. Be prepared to pay about $3.50 for a bottle of water or pop! Check in was surprisingly quick, I didn't even have to wait in a line! I did check out through the phone because the option to check out via the television didn't work. (Just another small example of how the room is \"almost dated\".) All in all I enjoyed my stay here and was pleasantly surprised at the great rate I was able to get during my stay. I paid much more the first time I stayed... I must have just picked a good time to go. But after staying here twice over the years, I'd probably pick a different hotel to try next time - mostly just for something different.

At every outlet the croissant and breads are no better than day old stuff at the local 7-Eleven. Pastries are delicious, though, and a good value. The casino is moderately updated but languishes as \"same old, same old\" Vegas. You might expect a special stay at Paris but they simply do not deliver. SUGGESTION: If you can get a good room rate, terrrific. Paris has clean rooms (at least the renovated ones) and the location gives you access to the best on the Las Vegas strip.

Casino is OK too but as is the case with all Caesar's owned properties, the casino slots are collectively older and not on a par with the MGM properties. Rooms are nice and well maintained and the beds are very comfortable pillow tops. The standard rooms are large and decorated like your great grandmother's house in an attempt to appear Parisian. Red room luxury rooms come at a premium and are not worth the upgrade charge. NOTE: THIS HOTEL DOES NOT AND WILL NOT ENFORCE NO SMOKING RULES. I had a NO SMOKING ROOM on a NO SMOKING FLOOR with smoking neighbors. We're talking MAJOR SMOKE HERE. The smoke billowed around the corner and into my room. Three calls to security finally got an agent who said that they could not enforce the rule rather could only request that the guest REFRAIN FROM SMOKING. Needless to say, that this is the first and last time I'll stay at a Caesar's property for this reason. Overall, this property is clean, fairly well run, albeit a bit dated, like most of the themed hotels in Vegas. We are frequent travelers from California to Vegas and always stay at MGM properties. While MGM charges a resort fee, I must say that I feel like we get better service at MGM properties and I have never had the needs of a smoking guest placed above mine, as a non- smoking guest.

I admit that before going, I was concerned about some of the reviews that I was reading, but none of those were warranted with our stay. We checked in at about 8:30pm on a Sunday. There were only a couple other guests in front of us, so the wait was short. I had heard that room reservation requests were not guaranteed and we had requested a non-smoking king bed room. The front desk lady was checking her computer for our room and quickly going over our reservation ... I heard her say something about \"smoking\" and quickly stopped her and said that we needed to have non-smoking. She said that there were none available with a king bed, but that there was non-smoking with 2 queen beds available or that we could pay more and upgrade to a red room. We said no to the red room and told her that because non-smoking was the most important to us, that we would take the queen bed room. She did say we could change to a king bed room the following day, but that she was giving us a free upgrade to a view room with the queen beds and that we would lose that if we changed rooms. We were on the 10th floor and very, very pleased with our view of the pool, tower and the strip. The room itself was very clean and nicely decorated. I am usually pretty picky about dated decor and cleanliness and this room was great! Yes, the television is not a new flat screen, but you can hardly tell, as it sits in the armoire. The bathroom was large, clean, separate tub and shower, shower had fantastic water pressure (felt great) and a full length mirror behind the door. The room was cleaned and freshened up quickly every day by the maid service. Loved the location on the strip of this hotel. Loved the high ceilings in the casino, as I think it helped with the smoke, compared to some of the other hotels that we walked through. Spent quite a bit of time at the pool and enjoyed that. Never felt out of place, as there was a nice mix of age groups (same thing with the rest of the hotel). At the pool we never had a problem finding a chair and drink service was fantastic, if needed.

We stayed at the Paris for two nights at the beginning of a three week trip around California. We have nothing but praise for this beautiful hotel. Firstly its location is perfect, in the middle of the Strip opposite the Bellagio. Our room was lovely, decorated in reproduction turn-of-the-century Parisian style. The room was one of the standard rooms, large, spacious and very clean and had a beautiful marble bathroom. The air-con was quiet and we hardly heard it all night. The pool is lovely - a huge circular pool on a low rooftop, adjoining the mock Eiffel Tower, with plenty of sunbeds all around. On our second day our children spent the entire day in the pool, until it closed at 8pm. There was music playing at the pool but it wasn't intrusive or loud at all. (Later in our holiday we stayed at Planet Hollywood and were actually driven from the pool by the loud banging music that they play there.) There is a rule that you cannot take your own food and drink into the pool area (so that you will, of course, buy their snacks and drinks) which I don't like, but they do not search your bags (which they did at Planet Hollywood, making me feel like a criminal.) The shopping mall belonging to the hotel was very stylish and attractive - a fake Victorian Parisian boulevard full of authentic looking shops and restaurants with French names, all under a pretend sky. We really enjoyed our stay at the Paris - check in was almost immediate; check-out took only five minues in the queue and the staff were courteous and friendly. The hotel was just right for couples and families and it will be our first choice when we return to Las Vegas.", "Date": "August 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Spring, Texas", "Title": "\u201cshowing its age a little\u201d", "Author": "mattscards", "ReviewID": "UR117181595", "Content": "First of all, when you walk in the place it is gorgeous.

The pillows were like WalMart quality, if even that. It was almost like a big sponge in a pillow case. Not good. 6 nights and I had trouble sleeping. My neck would always hurt. The carpet was bland. I was at the end of the hallway, and in the morning I had to get up and go turn the water on and wait 7-10 minutes before the water would be \"lukewarm\" enough so I could not freeze getting in. This is easily fixed with a small Hot Water Return pump by the Water Heater source. You would think a place that generates this much money they could afford one. I know Motel 6 and Budget Inn can afford it. It is connected with Bally's and the place is very crowded. Always. The corridors are always filled up to the max. And, the place is very expensive. I cup of coffee and a muffin is $8.50. Pepsi in a bottle is $3.50 downstairs. But, it is Vegas, so hey I guess you can expect this. If it gets bad, they have a McDonald's about 2 blocks down. The location is great. All the shows are within walking distance. The casinos are nice... but the selection is better in Harrah's in New Orleans. The odds of winning may be a little better here than Harrah's though. All in all. I will give this a \"3\" Everyone said, 'We should have stayed in Bally's\" And \"Next Year we are not staying here\" Bally's is owned by the same people, but apparently it is better.

It had a separate shower that was beautiful. There was also plenty of closet space. The housekeeping staff were very friendly and attentive. The only thing that was odd was the fact that the TV was an old type (not the newer flat screen). It's a nice hotel and I'd expect that would be upgraded. So this is a pet friendly hotel. In order to take your dog in or out though you will need to go through the casino to the North Entrance. They also have a tiny little area for dogs. When I say tiny, it's probably no bigger than 15 ft by 8 ft with a bush, fake grass and a doggy bag holder/can. It was good to encourage the dogs to potty but not much for exercise. The buffet breakfast is absolutely fantastic. Lots of french dishes that were super tasty. There were several stations to offer baked goods, eggs, eggs to order, crepes, etc. All were stocked well and kept clean even though the place was quite busy.

We arrived early around 10 a.m. and I knew they probably would not have a room ready so we asked the front desk when we should check back and they said to try around 1 p.m. We left our bags with the very nice bellman and went to the casino for awhile and had lunch at Mon Ami Gabi-o.k. lunch no wait this time of day although they sat us in a corner with a wobbly table (we put a sugar packet under the leg) near the service entrance.

The burger restaurant downstairs was very good and convenient-we ate there 3 time (I wish I had noticed on the first visit that they include gratuity on your bill) We got 2 for I entrees, because I signed up for special \"text\" discounts from home before we left, also got a 2 for 1 drink discout. Go by the reward center when you arrive and get a players card - use it everytime you eat or buy anything - at some stores you get a discout.Water at the pool area is $4.50 -bring your own. Oh and we found out- after buying a cheese and fruit plate - that we could not take it into the pool area, however the next day we got to the pool early 9:30 a.m. and noticed people bringing food and coffee in-guess you can get away with it before the restaurant opens!?

Originally we were unable to book for the first night we would stay, and after ringing and booking (having been given a room for the first night at the Planet Hollywood right next door), we were emailed a confirmation of our stay - the whole thing at Planet Hollywood! I was utterly dismayed, this wasn't at all what I asked for! After another international phone call, we were given a very sincere apology and they managed to find us a room for the entire stay. We booked a Red Room Premier, and due to the clumsy mishap during the booking, we were consoled with a room on the 25th floor, overlooking the pool & tower. Once we arrived, check in went very smoothly and they had indeed kept their promise of the room with a view. My Mother was amazed and incredibly happy! The room itself was very nice, nice bathroom, standard terrible shower head but very nice beds. My Mother has a difficult time sleeping in most hotels due to her bad back however this was not a problem at all! Our fridge wasn't stocked with any minibar items however we were able to use part of it without incurring any fees, which was a nice addition - last time I visited we had no spare space at all! The internet was a little issue, I connected using the cable however despite following all instructions my computer was not able to see the connecting page. I was able to persevere with wifi, which was better than nothing. The entire Caesar's network of hotels/casinos touts a no resort fee policy, which is true - anything you want additionally is an additional cost (a novel idea!). This meant daily internet charges however they weren't too bad considering my love of the web. A fantastic little side note - we were having issues with baggage and the airlines we chose, and were hoping the hotel could help us with some scales. As it turned out, the lady in the business centre was more than happy to accommodate our request and opened up the security door to let us use her package scale.

None of the trash was removed and the carpets were not vacuumed. The beds were comfortable so we did sleep well. We ordered room service several times...the prices are fairly high and they add a $5 delivery charge. We also ate in one of the hotel's restaurants, \"Mon Ami Gabi\". Lunch for three (two sandwiches and a quiche, two mimosas and a latte) was $100. The waitstaff here was very cordial.

We saved some of the fruit and pastries and had them for breakfast the next day. The hotel common areas are beautifully decorated to make you feel you are walking through an old French town. However, restaurants such as the Sugar Factory and the club Chateau give the place a modern, trendy feel. The casino has pretty much the same offerings as most of the others. The minimum for table games is $10-15. The best aspect of this hotel is its location. It is directly across from the Bellagio and diagonal to Caesar's Palace.

Old style tv. No free wifi anywhere in the hotel. Closest would be about 3min walk away at Miracle Mile, Sephora and Starbucks. Also Coffee Bean inside the mall has it too. The room next to us had room service tray outside their room for 24hours. Staff was VERY friendly and never felt I was putting anyone out by asking questions. We did the $44.99 Buffet of Buffets, 24hour pass for unlimited buffet eating. Great in theory, however, there are ALWAYS line ups so unless you're eating at 7am or 9pm expect to wait 30 minutes. The crepes at the Paris buffet were the best I've ever had. Make sure you take the free shuttle from Bally's to the Rio's Carnival Buffet. BEST BUFFET EVER. The pool is a generous size with a lot of chairs ... though seem to see quite a few broken. This time of year, the sun hit the pool at 10:15am and seemed to stay over the pool quite late in the afternoon. Nice music. There are 2 hot tubs by the cabanas, in 40 degree heat, I was shocked to see people in it. There was about 5 lifeguards on duty too. Pool was always a nice cool temp, which was refreshing.

Express stops less and will take you toFreemont St and beyond to to the Las Vegas North Outlet Mall. $7 for 24hrs or $3 per trip. This is the better of the outlet malls.

The front desk did have a bit of a line when we checked in but the employee that helped us was very pleasant and when I mentioned we were on our honeymoon she said\" I'll get you a nice room\". The room that we got was only on the 5th floor and did not overlook the strip but other than that it was great. Nice huge bathroom with a glass shower and a bathtub and plenty of sink room for all our stuff. I do believe it was an upgrade of some sort after looking into some other rooms as we walked down the hallways. The king size bed was very comforatble as were the chairs and love seat that were in the room. Not a huge thing but the TV was an old style, 24\" tube TV. I would have thought at a hotel like this that it would have had a nice flat screen but then again we weren't in Vegas to watch TV. All in all, a great hotel. Very clean, nice amenities on the Paris Las Vegas properties and a really nice pool that is dwarfed by the Eiffel Tower that towers above the entire pool area. If you go, book a meal at The Eiffel Tower Restaurant. Again, when we mentioned it was our honeymoon, we were treated to a table directly overlooking the Bellagio fountains. Since it was around 9:30 at night the views of the fountains going off and the strip lit up at night made for a memorable evening.

A great way to get good deals on Vegas hotels: sign up for the total rewards card (this can be done by visiting any of the Harrahs hotel websites) and then call the total rewards number after a week or two to see what deals are available. Another way is to sign up to be a guest book member for the various hotels you are interested in staying at a few months to a few weeks in advance and you will receive regular emails with room discounts. Since we don't gamble much, getting compted room, etc... isn't an option for us. As for the hotel, check in was quick and easy and our room was spacious and clean. The rooms and hallways were very quiet, didn't have any loud or drunk disturbances at all. It was nice to not have to pay any resort fees. The washroom was nice and big with a tub and seperate shower which was great. The bed was comfortable to sleep in. We went to the spa for a 60 minute massage which was so wonderful. If you do go to the spa, take time to enjoy the steam room, sauna, whirlpool and the calm and relaxing atmosphere. Men and women are seperated however so if you want to spend time in the spa with hubby or boyfriend, you can't. I think one of the highlights of my trip was the spa and you get a 20$ coupon from the hotel which makes it even better. TV didn't have many channels but not a big deal. Not impressed with housekeeping however. Chips and crumbs that were left near the fridge were not vacuumed for 2 days, I even left the cord for the iron across the room to see if housekeeping would move it or pick it up when they vacuumed and they didn't even bother too! On the third day I spoke to the housekeeping manager, and within an hour someone came up to vacuum the floor properly. The best part of the hotel is the location, it is central and you can go to one side of the strip on one day, and then the other side of the strip another day. Hotel casino was OK but we didn't really gamble much. The walkway to Harrahs is nice with retail and food shops. Being beside planet hollywood was nice because the hotel's mall has some great shops. Outside of the planet hollywood hotel there is a machine (remember the gameshow press your luck) where you can win prizes and money to spend in their casino. We saw two cirque du soleil shows - Zumanity was funny (because of the cast putting members of the audience in awkward and embarrasing situations) and it had some great acrobatics but it is an adult show with nudity. The other was Ka - a wonderful storyline with beautiful costumes, acrobatics and music. We absolutely loved it and I even bought the CD! Went to Tao nightclub (we called ahead to put ourselves on the guest list) so entrance was free! Great music but so packed you could hardly move!

Of the CET hotels in Vegas - it is small and works well for my mobility impaired family. This visit however fell short and is making me rethink my decision. 1. With a VIP card, it goes without saying that checkin and rooms are smoother than the average bear would have. I can say the baggage people are extremely aggressive and tip seeking in an over the top turn you off way. My rooms were a petite suite and a red room. The petite suite was large with 2 beds, 2 baths and a living room. It was quite nice - the furnishings are heavy for my taste but they work, curtains work on an electronic system by bed so don;t fall out the window trying to muscle them open or closed LOL. One bath is a large tub - very high and hard to step into and the other is a shower. There is a small sink and fridge area and a large flat screen, sofa and 2 chairs, desk and chair and a small table for 2 to eat. View was ok not spectacular. The red room is considerably smaller with 2 beds, 2 chairs, a small table, desk and chair and a large wardrobe with 2 closets, the flat screen tv between and a few drawers. Bathroom is a shower and an extremely low lying tub. Single sink. The do not disturb was regularly stolen. Housekeeping was a real issue - if you left the room they pounced on you to ask if you wanted service - even if you were practically in your pjs going down for a coffee run. If you room was free for cleaning early like 9-10 am it was done fairly quickly if you were not out it could not be done till late afternoon and sometimes a call was needed. Housekeeper in the suite literally threw the toiletries on the tray on a daily basis. The casino is small - sometimes hard to get a table - limits higher than Ballys next door. Slots tight. Coffee shop is hit and miss. Premium card makes seating easier re: lines but service inside is consistently slow!! Food was pretty good - hash so salty it was inedible - waiter offered to take it off bill - then didn't. So an annoyance. French toast and omelet good. Pastry shop - not bad but no premium line so long wait. Staff not friendly at all. Buffet - I cannot fathom why there are long lines!!! - The food is just not that good. To give credit - it did improve over last year On weekends only you can get your omelet made and brought to you which is a nice touch - on non-weekends the omelet line was ridiculous. Tried for dinner and breakfast and its just not that good - made loops of the buffet and couldnt find anything I wanted to eat and I am not that picky. Go next store to PH - way better! Eiffel tower - nice view ask for window - we did not get one - came at sunset - mistake as they close the blinds as the sun is blinding - better to go after dark. Nice view of bellagio fountains going off. Food was good - ala carte, pricey and snooty service. They do NOT take comps - unless you go to TR first for a paper comp or charge to room. Would have been nice to see a sign re this. Also did NOT take rezzie without credit card. Valet parking - again premium card helped but the day it thunderstormed and they pulled my car out just beyond the awning so I could get soaked - they lost me! One morning was awakened by hammering above and 2 or 3 times all doors to elevator bay closed due to problems - once they said someone set off sprinklers by hanging their clothes on the sprinkler. I have a host and could not get service issues resolved to my satisfaction so I am concerned those without could do much worse. Rented car from Hertz in hotel - check rates sometimes cheaper to start rental at airport but this time it worked and was very convenient you pick up and drop off car at garage level one So it was a mixed bag and I used my displeasure to try out other venues and next time I may not show loyalty to CET because the showed a lack of loyalty to me by providing bad service.", "Date": "July 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cVery pleasant Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Cassie1209", "ReviewID": "UR115568792", "Content": "This hotel is really center on the strip and the access is easy!

The check-in process was slow, as some other reviewers had mentioned. There were two counter positions open for the regular travelers and I was the fourth person in line. It took about fifteen minutes to get to the counter. The staff person I spoke with was very nice and did not offer a room upgrade which suprised me. When I got to the room I saw why an upgrade had not been offered. We were given room 3198P and the room was absolutely incredible. The room was a one bedroom suite. The room contained a living room with sofas and a desk, and a dining room with a table and chairs. There was a half-bath off of the entry foyer and the master bath was huge. The room was a corner room and we had the best view of the Bellagio fountains you could imagine. The view toward the south end of the strip was also excellent. The room was in excellent condition with little signs of wear. Sure, the televisions were older models, but we weren't in the room to watch too much television. Everyone we met that was associated with the hotel was friendly and accomodating. Valet's delivered our vehicle within five minutes each time. The buffet offered a tremendous selection and forthe most part was tasty. The only complaint that I had is that I was charged an internet fee on one day even though I never used the internet. I found the bill on the express checkout details on the television and due to the long lines to checkout did not feel it was worth my time to dispute the $14.99 bill. I have stayed at the Wynn and Venitian in the past and this room at Paris was definitely the nicest I have stayed in.

Stayed here for 1 week on my 1st trip to Vegas from the UK. My partner had stayed at the venitian before so wanted him to experience another hotel. After a long 10 hour flight and a 20 min trip by taxi we were welcomed by attentive staff at check in. No problems and went to our room (red room on 27th floor as requested). Room was large with a comfortable super king sized bed, a fridge and large ish bathroom (no mirrors in bedroom though?). Having had a long flight we were shattered but wanted to ride out the jet lag. Arriving at 3pm, at 11pm we flagged and wanted to sleep!! BUT, after 30 mins we were woken by the 'people' in the room adjoining our room having a party! Not good when you have jet lag and been traveling for over 14 hours!! We called security, 10 mins later it started again! Called again, nothing, 3rd call. Nope. Then 4th time I spoke to the duty manager and told him our plight. Within minutes we were offered a bell boy and a change of rooms on the same floor. So at 12 midnight we moved to another room. The 2nd room was a premium room with a strip view (1st room was at the back), and we fell into a quiet slumber.... Excellent service on this part. The rest of the week went undisturbed (apart from 1 night were a drunk man came back into the room next to us at 6am and argued with his wife!!). The bed was huge and very very comfortable. Soft and luxurious to say the least. Large flat screen TV and clean. Maid service everyday, however if you want the bed sheets changing you have to ring housekeeping? We asked for more coat hangers as only 10 in room and these were delivered with no fuss. Le Buffet was divine, although once was enough as the same menu daily. We has breakfast included in our deal up to $9 peer person, but had to be bought in Bally'S next door? The Casino in the hotel was not that big and all seemed to be high stakes...... other casinos were cheaper. Staff were attentive enough but the prices in the hotel do let it down somewhat! Lovely central location but busy, very busy. The foyer is always packed of people, whether they are staying there or just looking it's always packed!!

A little boring for teens.\u201d", "Author": "rhonda2698", "ReviewID": "UR115196826", "Content": "My family (two teens, hubby, and I) visited the Paris in early June. The check-in was quick and easy and the lobby area where you check in is absolutely gorgeous! Our hotel room was fine (not tremendously fancy but very nice). Toiletries were provided along with a coffeemaker in the room. The room was clean and quiet and the beds were comfortable. The pool was HUGE and the fluffy towels provided were very nice. It is a truly beautiful pool with lots of room to swim even when there are several other people in it. There is a pretty view of the Eiffel Tower from the pool, too. Unfortunately, besides the pool, there was nothing for my teens to do at the Paris. They thought it was the most boring hotel they'd ever visited. The worst part of the visit was the CROWDS everywhere outside of the hotel area! There is lots of shopping in the building and near the casino area - the whole building is huge, and we literally felt like we were in a crowded shopping mall at Christmas whenever we stepped outside of the hotel area. Even to get to check-in, we had to fight throngs of people milling around. That was difficult to do when there was four of us trying to stay together, and we were lugging lots of luggage on the LONG walk from the parking garage to the check-in area. Even at check-out the next morning, the place was still completely packed. Our check-out went smoothly once we made our way through the crowds to the lobby. Unfortunately, we had to take another long walk from the lobby to the parking garage dragging our luggage behind us in the crowds. The evening we stayed, though, turned out to be fun. When my husband and I finally found a blackjack table with two open seats, we had a great time with several fun dealers. Unfortunately, the pit bosses were grouchy all night, and they changed the table minimum to $10 (originally $5) after we'd been there for a couple hours. They didn't grandfather anyone in at $5, and one of the players got mad and left the table. The drinks were somewhat slow to come, but they were good and we had a nice time in spite of the tremendous crowds and somewhat grouchy pit bosses. Overall, the hotel part was good (except for the walk to and from the lobby) and if you enjoyed shopping and being with lots of people, this would be a blast!", "Date": "July 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, GA", "Title": "\u201cLosing its luster\u201d", "Author": "AltGol", "ReviewID": "UR115192664", "Content": "Paris Las vegas used to be very special, but is now a bit run down.

We found the food to be very good whether eating at one of the buffets or the smaller restaurants in the Paris.

The website said that a refrigerator was included in each and every room. Correction - there WAS a stocked mini-bar which is no longer in use in each room.

That\u2019s because the desk personnel at the registration desk were rude to every member of the eight people (three other couples and two singles) who were meeting up with us at The Paris. But the friendliness of the other staff, the general comfort of a room for which we paid only $78 (tax included) per night and the hotel\u2019s close proximity to Bellagio and The Cosmopolitan led to The Paris getting traction over the four days of our stay to result in a better rating outcome at the end. That said, we will not stay here again nor could we recommend it as a place to stay to others. That is based on eight trips to Las Vegas, including this one, and experience with seven other hotels, of which we would happily recommend and return to five. There are just too many other options for lodging in Las Vegas to be treated as if a hotel is doing YOU a favor by taking your discretionary lodging dollars. As was the case with the desk staff at The Paris. That summary experience posted, The Paris has minus and pluses. If you\u2019re interested in the detail read on. FRONT DESK EXPERIENCE: A BIG \"minus\". This can be highlighted by the short version of the problem with the desk staff at check in for us. One of our group had arranged for five rooms in a block. Each room had a different confirmation number. Knowing we would be arriving in groups of two and three and originating from cities across the country, he made sure we all had all five of the confirmation numbers so we could check in as we arrived since he might arrive as late as midnight. But the hotel would not let us check in, even though we had confirmation numbers and could provide all of the pertient personal data for the guy who made the reservations \u2013 home address, phone, name, employer and so on. The desk staff very frankly told us the hotel was sold out that night, that we had rooms at a deeply discounted rate, and if the person who had reserved all five rooms did not arrive in time, they would simply sell the rooms at $299 given they were sold out that night. Or, they said, we could check in at that time and they would charge our cards the $299 rate. We said to the desk clerk that this could not be the only time this had happened, a party with multiple reservations arrives over the course of several hours and the person who coordinated the reservations is the last to arrive. No, she said, it is not the first time. So, we said there must be a solution for this. Yes, she said, the solution is you lose your rooms and we sell them to others at a higher rate. When my sister in law, who is a mild mannered and charming woman, nearly pleaded with the desk clerk to allow check in at 7pm given she had been up since 1:00a.m., the desk clerk said roughly this, \u201cDo you think that is MY problem?\u201d It would have been laughable for a training video in how NOT to gain customer loyalty if it had not been so intentionally obnoxious. Ta dum. ROOMS: Pluses and minuses. Once check in was finally achieved, all went smoothly. As you can imagine we did not receive rooms in great locations given the low rates we were paying and the full house at the hotel. But that would be expected under the circumstances so we had no complaints. The good news about the rooms is they were generally comfortable and nice and clean. My husband and I had a \u201cP\u201d room which is a bit larger and other members of our group had standard rooms. In all cases the infrastructure showed wear and tear, damaged furniture and paint coming off of woodwork as example, and old technology, as in smaller tube TVs as opposed to the large screen LEDs that one finds even at mid range hotels these days. But with comfortable beds, an adequate supply of decent pillows, quiet floors at night and everything nice and clean, it\u2019s hard to kvetch about the rooms for the price we were paying. However, if we\u2019d been paying anywhere near the rack rate, that would have been a different perspective. Note: wifi is $15 / day. GAMING STAFF: Pluses. From our perspective, the dealers at the black jack tables were top notch. The perfect nexus of professionalism and friendliness, they made playing a lot of fun\u2026at the $10 tables at least which is where those of us playing cards hung out. COCKTAIL STAFF: Pluses. Since we were a big group, we used the bar right on the floor of the casino as a \u201cmeet up\u201d location each evening either before or after going on to other things. This is a bar where you\u2019re better off ordering a beverage with no more than two ingredients (think gin and tonic not Sidecar) given the ingredients available to the bar tenders. (For a great quality cocktail we highly recommend the Vesper Bar in The Cosmopolitan across the street.) But the cocktail waitresses were so friendly and could give as good as they got from my wisecracking Brooklyn born and reared relatives in-law. The banter was part of the evening\u2019s entertainment and the service top notch. RESTAURANTS: Pluses and minuses. One of the advantages The Paris enjoys is a number of small, casual places to pick up something to eat\u2026a boulangerie, a patisserie and so on. That made it convenient to grab a fruit plate and coffee to take to the room for breakfast in the morning for those of us not eating a more formal breakfast and it also worked out well for a snack in the afternoon for those of us not eating a more formal lunch. And the Mon Ami Gabi restaurant (reasonably priced as Las Vegas restaurants go) patio provides a nice view of the Bellagio fountains from afternoon through evening. The Eiffel Tower restaurant, where service is great and prices are high and tables are packed like sardines in a can, is not owned or run by The Paris. While you may not want to spring for dinner there, it is a great place to have a cocktail in the bar and see the stunning view. LOCATION: Plus. Easy walk up or down the strip or across the street to City Center, The Cosmo or Bellagio. TIPS: 1) Upgrades to strip side rooms are sometimes available for as little as $40 / night. Our recommendation would be to pay for the upgrade but be sure you\u2019re above the 11th floor or, you\u2019ll look out at a parking garage. (As we did. I'll try to include photos of room.) 2) The rooms ending in \u201cP\u201d are like a petite suite, larger by far than a regular room, with a spacious bath, extra closet space and a small desk and, at least in our room, an in room coffee maker. If you can get a \u201cP\u201d room (ours was offered at the same price) take it.", "Date": "June 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFantastic hotel.

The shower had more air than water coming out of the shower head. I understand saving water, but I spent 10 minutes just rinsing my hair, and at my age, I don't have much hair. 3. The mini bar was empty, and when I asked, I was told that it didn't work. It was the kind that charges you money after 45 seconds if you remove something. 4. The TV was a small old picture tube type and the channel selection was poor. 5. The room and hotel just looked dated. 6. $5 to print my boarding pass. Skip it and print it at the airport.

Of course, we needed to see the Eiffel Tower, but since we couldn't go to Paris, France, we went to Vegas. Stunning hall with sparky crystal chandeliers & Napoleon pictures created the atmosphere of Paris. Well, at least they tried. We had to give 250 more at the register for a room with a view and lounge pass ( the last one turned out to be a good thing). When I opened the door to our room, I was staggered by the view. Amazing! Bellagio fountains, Eiffel Tower right in front of my bed... And a very strong smell of cigarettes mixed with the smell of dirt in the air. I took my shoes off and the carpet was sticky!!! Yuck!!! But oh well, I sat down on my bed and enjoyed the view of the tower & Bellagio hotel in the rays of the sun going down... Well, the throw on the bed had dirt and grease stains on it and even though the sheets were clean, the throw obviously was NOT. It was kind of stinky. We called the room service to ask for ANYTHING that could help eliminating this horrible cigarette smell. By the way, we booked a room on a NON-smoking floor! So much for that. In 30 minutes after out call they brought the ionizer and we had to leave the room for about an hour. We were going to do it anyway. When we came back, they took the ionizer away and it didn't seem to help at all. One funny thing is that looked like someone was smoking in the closet, because every time I opened the closet door, the smell of cigarettes coming out of there was awful. If someone had smoked there before we moved in just once or twice, the smell wouldn't be so bad and didn't seem so old and thick in the air. Evidently somebody was smoking there many times and those were not just one guests, but a number of them one visit after another. Or the previous guests spent all their time in smoky casinos and their clothes (and thanks to them ours too) smelled of cigarettes. Anyway, lounge at night was free, we got some free wine and light dinner and left the hotel to take a look at the new Cosmopolitan. Which looked really nice. Younger crowd inside. The bar is amazing. But that's a story for another review. So my biggest impression from the Paris hotel was how dirty the room was and the worst part - the rashes!!! I had to use tons of benadryl and aloe gel when I returned home. I knew I'd get something from that room. Those were not bed bugs, the rashes didn't look like it. It was more like a dermatitis. It took me two weeks to recover from it. I think they use some kind of a detergent to wash their linens or it could be just filthy room (the carpet in the room was terrifyingly dirty). I don't think I'll ever come back to the Paris hotel. Too bad, because I loved our view very much. Location is truly amazing. We didn't even have to go anywhere to enjoy the Bellagio fountains. I don't know if I can recommend this hotel... I guess we just were not lucky with the room. But the views and location are the best you can find in Vegas. Buffet is not impressing at all. Lounge that was included was ok. Free breakfast and night snacks and wine were nice. Eiffel tower tour might be worth taking. We did and it was... well, it was nice. Not spectacular but just nice. I liked it. I guess I might recommend this hotel but only because of the location & great views (for extra $$). But then again, if you have extra money, you might as well cross the street and book a room at Bellagio... Maybe you'll be lucky to find a better room at Paris.

Of course, I guess you could question whether you could keep any trip to Vegas purely business, but it was a good time. Not having been to Vegas since I was a kid (30 years ago), it was like never having been before. The Paris is huge. If you've been to Vegas recently, you're probably chuckling at the hayseed comment, but for those who haven't, it's meant to overawe you, and it works. The rooms are plush, and pretty comfortable. Lots of extra pillows, big comfy beds, and everything else you'd expect in a very nice hotel. The walls are a bit thin, so you may want to consider that your neighbors can hear you. The staff seemed pretty nice, and fairly helpful. They did their jobs, and pretty much knew what they were doing. In a place this size, it's almost impossible to expect personalized service. That makes it a lot tougher to judge. Public areas were amazing. They went for a french outdoor feel, and it feels surprisingly natural, from the architecture right down to the very high roof painted like the sky. The food was truly astounding. Don't expect $15 steak and lobster buffets. These days it's more like $38 buffets, but you get some pretty amazing food. The buffet here is, without a doubt, the best I've ever had. We tried the buffet at the Bellagio, and like this much better. The only place much better was the Eiffel Tower restaurant. Expect to pay a lot there, and have it be worth every cent. We had (arguably) our best meal ever there. The atmosphere and menu are high end french, so it's not for everyone, but we were 4 for dinner and loved it. The pool area may have been open, but with temps in the 50's we weren't really tempted to try it out. The casino is very large. Pretty much whatever your game, you can find it. If you're expecting a lot of comps, don't, unless you're a high roller. After 4 days of gambling pretty large amounts at a time, we couldn't get a meal for 1 person for breakfast. The Paris has a really good location. You've got lots of shopping, drinking, and dining options nearby. The Bellagio is directly across the street, so you have a wonderful view of the fountain show at night. There's easy access to the monorail. We liked the Paris a great deal.

Bathroom door handle pulled of when went to close the door; floor lamp fell apart when I went to turn it on; buckles in the badly burned carpets everywhere; hot water absolutely reeks of sulpher. Good bed & nice TV though. Fantastic location on the strip - close to everything because there is minimal in the hotel. The bakery in the lobby is their best feature-understocked & over-priced \"corner stores\" in hotel - save your $ Walgreens is half a block away CASINO is typical nothing special or unique. You would think that at $200+ a night you would get a free ride up the Tower - WRONG! And that's crap. Pool isn't anything special & standard resort rules regarding deck chairs apply.

If you are looking for a quasi \"relaxing\" experience at this hotel, I would suggest you look elsewhere. My major complaint with this hotel is the pool and the upkeep of it. Two of the days we were at the Paris hotel we lounged by the pool. The staff onsite for this part of the hotel are a bunch of teenagers. The group that I witnessed both times were disengaged from providing \"customer service\" and acted more or less as statutes in the grand scheme of things. On both days I was by the pool, the staff in charge of the deck chairs would literally pick vacated chair groups up and slam them on top of each other over and over again. In addition to this, instead of tumble weeds rolling by on the pool deck, abandoned beer buckets would be blowing around and rolling everywhere. The staff was completely uninterested in picking up the area. It was disheartening to see really. In addition to this, the flow inside the casino, if you are staying there is terrible. You have to fight your way past lines of people waiting to eat, lines of people waiting to check in, lines of people rambling in and out of stores and the bar.

We come to Las Vegas every 2 years and we liked Paris so much we came back to them again! We stayed in the Red Room and although it seemed nicer than the standard room I don't know if it was worth it. The first time we came we stayed in a standard room, and next time I think we would continue with the standard room. I was a little disappointed because the carpet in the more expensive \" Red Room\" needed to be restretched, there were bumps and rolls in it at the foot of the bed. Also, they boast a red couch shaped liked lips... the couch wasn't red, it wasn't what we expected. We did travel with another couple that stayed in the same room and they had the same problem. We also visited the pool, it's nothing great but it serves its purpose. We had a private cabana that made the pool more enjoyable. I would recommend getting a cabana. We had our own lounge chairs, plus a TV and other table and chairs inside. We had a server and cabana girl that made sure we had everything we wanted. It was great, we ate lunch and bought several drinks all day long. The hotel has a crepe shop that is fantastic and we LOVE Mon Ami Gabi, the restaurant that has an outdoor terrace right on the Vegas strip. This is an awesome place to sit and have drinks and dinner every night especially if you like to people watch. FYI, they will not seat you until your entire party is with you, we wanted a table for 4 and they had it available but wouldn't let us sit down until our friends came back from the bathroom. Seemed a little ridiculous but we still waited since we enjoyed the food there . They also have Napolean's, its the dueling paino bar, That is one of the best things about staying at Paris. We love \"Bill\" he's the piano player with the shaved head. He is the best, if he's not working that night wait to go a night he is. He's funny and an outstanding player/singer. We came here 3 out of the 4 nights we were there.

They were extremely courtious and didn't charge me for the second night, even though I checked out at 4pm (a rarity in Vegas!). Never disapointed in this hotel. The food is always good. Reasonable prices at the restaurants and no matter where we stay, my husband and I always have breakfast t the St Louis restaurant. The best omellettes anywhere and great sour dough toast.

We stayed at the Paris Hotel because we had been there before and had a wonderful experience. This stay was not what we expected. Arrived at 9 a.m. on Tuesday, May 10. Decided to have breakfast before checking in. Went to check in at 10 a.m. and was told that check in was not until 10:30 a.m. and we would have to come back. We came back at 10:30 a.m. and was told our room was not ready but we could have another room that was ready on the 15th floor. We registered and went to our room. The room was spacious with two queen beds. All the amenities were there to make our stay comfortable. First about our television. We had a rental car so left for the day to return at 7 p.m. to find our television not working. In fact, it would not even turn on. I called Maintenance and a maintenance man was sent up a half our later. He said that he had several other TVs with the same problem. He decided that we needed a new TV and returned a short time later with a new one. He install it and an hour later we had a working TV. On Wednesday we left early in the morning and got back to the hotel about 3 p.m. and once again tried to turn on the TV. The TV would not come on. A maintenance man was sent up for the second time in two days. He decided that there were bad connections to the TV but was able to get it working again. HOT WATER: On Wednesday morning we got up at 6 a.m. and tried to shower. No hot water. It took 15 minutes of letting the water run to even get warm water. We showered and left for the day. Thursday, we got up and were able to shower with warm water after letting it run about 10 minutes. We had an early flight on Friday (6 a.m.) so I decided to shower on Thursday night to avoid getting up at 3 a.m. Friday to shower. At 9 p.m. the shower was once again ice cold. Even after 15 minutes there was no warm water. I went to bed thinking I could try again in the morning. I got up at 3 a.m. and tried to shower again. Once again \u201cNO HOT WATER.\u201d My daughter opted for the cold shower. I tried to access the Menu on the TV to check out and was unable to get the Menu channel.

While checking out I informed the clerk about the hot water situation. She told me that the boilers were located deep in the basement and sometimes when hot water was in demand or it was so early in the morning that it was hard to get hot water to the rooms. I found this hard to believe since at 9 p.m. at night the hot water had been running all day and at 3 a.m. how many people were trying to access the hot water. We could not even get hot water from sink. Hot water should be available all day long. I have stayed at the Paris Hotel before with no hot water problems.

I've stayed at the Venetian/Palazzo a dozen or more times in the past but wanted to be more centrally located this visit. Checked in around noon on a Sunday with a very pleasant and friendly front desk clerk. A $$ credit card sandwich netted a free upgrade to the Red Room (king) on the 29th floor. The room was clean and spacious with a view of the Planet Hollywood Tower. They are using the former mini bars as refrigerators (which was nice) and the room had a one cup coffee pot and flat screen TV. This was my first time staying at Paris and I was pleasantly surprised with the lovely room and clean hallways. Elevators were always quick and I never waited more than a couple of minutes for one. The location of Paris is very central and I probably walked miles on the strip - usually down to Venetian, Wynn to the north or City Center and Bellagio. Played at Planet Hollywood one day and walked to Mandalay Bay another time, stopping at several casinos on the way. Also used the Duece bus once - it stops between Paris and Ballys. I used the pool several times for short periods (1-2 hours at most) . They had lots of loungers and pool towels. I thought the cocktails were overpriced, but the service was good. The pool area was clean and the water refreshing. I didn't see any children at all as one reviewer mentioned. Maybe he was there during spring break (?). I paid for high speed internet and it worked well. I didn't have housekeeping come in to clean, however I exchanged towels and got more supplies from the girl out in the hallway. She was always accommodating and pleasant. The restaurants seemed packed (lines most of the time) so I usually walked elsewhere. I ate at the Harrahs and Flamingo buffets (Harrahs was just ok, Flamingo horrid), Aria, Wynn, and Grand Luxe at Palazzo a couple of times. I also ate at Studio B at the \"M\" on south strip one evening and it was awesome. I didn't like the Paris casino decor and layout. It was very loud, uncomfortable, crowded and felt claustrophobic.

I was awe struck by simply how huge all the hotels here are. I think that the other reviews I read before my visit were pretty much on the money about this place. The positives: Location - right in the middle of the strip. It's a perfect location for a first trip to Vegas. Price - facebook friend the hotel, by doing so you get in on facebook exclusive deals. By doing so, we got an incredible deal - 80 for wednesday night, 90 for thursday night, and 160 for friday night. But here's a tip - it does not pay to wait till the last minute. Travel companions waited and the prices (for all the hotels on the strip) skyrocketed to 2-3 times the prices we saw a couple months in advance. And the facebook rate was way better in advance too. Onsite eating options - so many to choose from! We ate at the Chocolate Factory American Brasserie for breakfast twice, and had dessert in the Chocolate Lounge one night. Very good! But had our favorite meals of the trip at the Wynn (best vegan options there!) Pool area - very nice, not too crowded, crazy view of Eiffel tower. it was very shady in the pool area which could be a negative or a positive... and servers for poolside cafe were wearing teeny tiny white string bikinis...which also could be a positive or a negative i suppose - but both of these go on the negative list for me. also never got served even though we sat there for a couple hours. finally had to go to counter to get our own drinks. Toiletries at the Paris were nice. I liked them. And the sink area was very nice. I liked the french country blue and cream decor. It just needs a little updating. In room safe was handy. A few negatives: Parking is way far away from reception desk. It's like walking through the mall of america to get from parking lot to reception. I do love how all the parking on the strip is free though! Signage could be better too. I seriously think they should consider having a check in desk closer to the parking area. It is very confusing. Although once we found the reception area, it was very nice and pretty and bright, gorgeous chandeliers. Front desk staff was very nice and helpful. There was a line, but they were good at moving people through quickly. Then it was another super long, long, long walk to the hotel elevators, which were also hard to find. I suppose this encourages people to use valet parking and bell hops. If you want to buy a bottle of wine from one of the shops in the hotel to enjoy in your room, don't bother. Wine selection is horrible. Strongly recommend finding the ABC store down the strip which had a surprisingly good selection of wines, and great prices. This is definitely where you should get your Vegas souvenirs as well. Room - we wanted a good deal, so we went with the standard room. The problem is that the good deal standard rooms are the ones that have not be updated. The worst part was in the bathroom, there is a shower stall, with a glass door. There is mold under the showerstall door, which when it gets wet, then gets onto the floor. Gross. I know the cleaning staff kept wiping off the mold from the floor, but it was still under the door. They need to clean under that shower door or replace it or something. This needs to be addressed. I know i've seen other reviews mentioning the same issue. Also the drain in the bathtub is rusted. Looks gross. TV in room is the old and small style. If i stayed here again, I would definitely pay for the nicer, newer rooms... i have heard the red rooms are very nice. Although, if i ever do go back to Vegas (it might be a while, i got a sinus infection from all the cigarette smoke everywhere, still recovering from that) but if i did, i would most likely try the Tropicana. They recently had a major facelift. My dad stayed there while we stayed at the Paris during this trip. I like that the parking lot was so close to reception and the elevators to the rooms. And even less expensive than the Paris hotel, just a block or so down the strip. Internet was expensive. $15 a day. We paid for the first day, then realized we could use our droid phone as a hotspot for our laptop. Our verizon hotspot via our droid worked great there. Surprisingly, cell service on our phones was not very good in the room. It was fine everywhere else in Vegas and in the hotel, just not in our room. All in all, for what we paid for our hotel stay, it was a great value.

My mom and I got an excellent deal on Southwest Jackpot Deals. I asked for a complimentary upgrade upon check-in which they didn't have, but they did offer me a room with a fantastic view of the strip which I enjoyed day and night. for an additional $300 which I can't believe I paid, but to me it was worth it just for the view alone. I attached a picture of part of the few from our room and to the right (not in this picture) was Caesars Palace. Breakfast and happy hour (daily) in the Concierge lounge came with the upgrade which really did save on the cost of meals. Their breakfasts consisted of fruit, cereal, bagels, salmon, croissants and pastries plus fresh squeezed orange juice and a coffee machine that made any type of coffee you could think of. For happy hour they offered cold boiled shrimp and other foods that you could make a meal on plus this wonderful selection of desserts. Our bathroom was a nice size with a walk-in shower and a separate bathtub. The only complaint I would have is the towels and wash clothes they provide were very rough and not at all soft. Plus the pillows they use on their beds were the worst pillows I have ever seen in a Vegas hotel room so was really surprised at that and wish I had complained. Obviously they don't care about your sleeping comfort. Plus I got some kind of weird breakout on the third day I was there and first thought it was bed bugs but didn't see any so I chalked it up to the soap or shower gel in the bathroom they provided. I have read past reviews about the casino constantly filled with cigarette smoke and this was very true. This is my fourth time to Vegas in a year's period and I would vote their casino the worst when it comes to extremely heavy cigarette smoke compared to the other casinos on the strip. We did have a power outage for a few hours while I was there and the elevators were down so you couldn't even get to your rooms. We did see a few shows at other hotels which I would recommend - the Beatles Love show at the Mirage was excellent and we saw Rick Thomas Magic and Tigers show at the Sahara, but the hotel is getting ready to close very soon so if you are going to be in Vegas the first week of May I would recommend going over to the Sahara one last time. We ate at Mon Ami Gabi located in the Paris hotel which was excellent. Be sure to walk over to Serendipity and try their frozen hot chocolate - it was so good! I plan on coming back to Vegas end of this year and unless this hotel had an excellent deal where I didn't have to pay extra for the view and got better pillows, I probably won't stay at this hotel again. It is a shame that they charge you so much to get a nice view, but I would definitely recommend this hotel for the variety of french restaurants they have.", "Date": "May 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, accomodating staff, will definitely be back!\u201d", "Author": "DFranczak", "ReviewID": "UR106570417", "Content": "We had a comped room for 5 of the 7 nights we stayed.

The city is just depressing, and I am no feminist but it is wholey disrespectful to woman, if you have a daughter just stay out of the city entirely. Ok, so you can see that I have some bias.

Some of the new and larger places make you walk forever just to get off the property. The bad: What's up with the Red Rooms. Okay, we are Vegas regulars so got comped our room. We paid the $40 / night extra to get the Red Room. The website makes these rooms sound like your getting something amazing. First, there was hair in the shower . . . and we hadn't showered yet.

The Good: - Location! You really can't beat it. Easy walk to all the big casinos or to the monorail. - Staff. I had no problem with the staff or their courtesy. Everyone was fine. Nothing out of the way, but nothing bad or rude. - Room 848 was big and clean. Only complaint was that it was on a low floor in th back so we got the parking lot but no complaints since it was free. Had a safe, good shower, comfy bed. - NO resort fees even if you are not comped!!! - The pool is not a super luxurious place, but it is big, plenty of chairs and a cool view of the tower, balloon and cosmo in the distance. The Bad: - It's just starting to show it's age. The walls are a little dirty, the wallpaper is peeling off in spots, the carpet is worn. By no means is it a dump when when you walk across the street to the Bellagio, Paris feels old and nothing special. - The bagel breakfast sandwich from the quick cafe next to the crepe place was $9 and not good I'd stay here again a thousand times if it is free.

This was after she had rudely told me that the king bed room I paid for in full months in advance in non smoking was not available and that all she could offer was 2 x doubled beds in smoking and I said this was not acceptable. Her initial response was basically deal with it and she even said 'your booking is only a request and we don't guarantee to give you anything on there'. I explained to her that such Bait and Switch approach is quite illegal and that there is nothing in the terms and conditions stating what she is claiming. After being forced to lug my 3 bags all the way through the casino and lobby to check in (no porters, no doorman) this was enough for me to never return.

Front desk and concierge have been nearly the only employees with a positive attitude I have encountered here. Otherwise, bad attitude has been rampant. Walking down the hall alongside a room inspector from housekeeping, she told me how tired she was and how much she did not like her job! My room needs minor maintenance. Mini bar is completely empty. I tried to shut the bathroom door and the knob came off in my hand. Hole in the bathroom wall where something was previously attached. Marks on the bedroom wall that should have been corrected. \u00a0Considerable amount of mold in the shower. Desk chair very uncomfortable. Room does not cool down adequately. Alarm clock is completely off, yet makes a loud static noise about every 40 minutes (I unplugged it and am calling maintenance). Gym closes at 7pm and pool at 6pm, despite LV being a 24 hour city. Food has been good thus far. However, I tried to go to the popular buffet, but after waiting about 30 minutes it was clear I had another hour to go, so I left for another restaurant. Staff thus far has generally been jaded and brusque - but I hold out hope for a little more humanity in the hotel and restaurant personnel. The spa needs a good cleaning and the workout room has some weight lifting and aerobic equipment, but could and should be better appointed for $25 per day. Over all, not a good experience.

Walking down the hallway to our room, we saw a hole in the wall\u2013guest damage we guessed. Our room was fine, two queen beds, old CRT TV. There is no hope of fitting a HDTV in here! To the left and right of the TV, are small closets. In the morning we noticed a strange smell in the bathroom\u2013it smelt like sewer gas. Only three ways for the gass to enter the bathroom\u2013through the drains, air vent system or in the walls where the piping was installed. We called building maintenance and they bleach everything. In the afternoon it seemed ok but we noticed the same smell outside the hotel. This smell was not noticed at other Hotels. When we returned to our room around 9:30 PM, the smell was present again. Another call to building maintenance\u2013I requested them to send someone with a good nose. About 45 minutes latter, he arrived but said his smelling powers were not good. He said it could be the Hotel's grease traps--ok but our room was alittle high for that. I put a plastic bag over the shower drain and covered that with a wet towel\u2013put some water in the tub and sink & plugged their overflow to keep the sewer gass out. No room exchanged was offered, so I really checked out the bathroom air vent. WTF, it was full of dirt\u2013just look at the photos. The shower stall had either mold or water deposits where the door opened. Some floor tiles were broken. Our room was quiet but I would never stay here again. In the morning, there was no smell but once I removed the shower's drain seal & drained the tub & sink + cleared the vents for the tub & sink, the smell returned. Upon checkout, I asked if the Hotel had a waste vent system problem that was causing the smell. NO-- WE HAVE NO ISSUE! Then I explained the smell outside was the same as in our room. I feel PARIS was great in the long ago past, but its day has come and gone. I would strongly suggest to the maintenance department to clean the bathroom's vent, fix the shower door leak and scope out the drains for damage. Mostly, there's a blockage that is causing our water trap to be sucked dry upon many flushes within the hotel. The water trap contains water that keeps out the sewer gas. If the water is missing, the gas will enter the room. At checkin, we noticed some dirt on the wood trim and paint chips on the trim--that was a warning of a Hotel's lack of proper maintenance.

My wife and I stayed at Paris March 17th through March 22nd of this year for the 17th time. As you probably can guess we love Paris. One of the top reasons is the casino. We are both non smokers and with a three story high ceiling the smoke dissipates quickly. Unless you are right next to a smoker you really do not notice the smoke. Almost all of the other casinos have low ceilings with some only being 10 feet high. At Paris we do not feel confined. Another top reason is Paris\u2019s location, being center strip. You are within walking distance to many of the shows as well as many of the great restaurants. Over the course of our many trips we have eaten at all the restaurants in Paris and have tried a lot of different dishes. All are very good. Some of the best is the Le Creperie, Le Burger Brasserie and Mon Ami Gabi (especially the outdoor caf\u00e9 area). Service at Paris is top notch including the front desk, maid service, restaurants, bars and especially the cocktail servers. When we checked in, our non smoking comped room was not available. Shirley at the front desk upgraded us to a strip view room at no charge and we did not have to ask for this. We are very late night people when in Vegas, so typically we ask to have our room cleaned in the afternoon and we give a couple hour time frame to have it done and the maids were always accommodating. But, the best service is from the cocktail servers on the casino floor. Three servers are worth mentioning, at the slot machines during day shift Saturday through Wednesday is Andrea, table games during day shift Monday through Friday is Ferra and the best server that we have come across in Vegas is at the slot machines during the swing shift Wednesday through Sunday. Her name is Angela. General Information. This information is primary for first times to Paris and/or Vegas 1) If you drive to Vegas \u2013 Virtually all the Strip Hotels self parking lots are far away from front desk. To avoid carrying your luggage a long distance after parking your car you have two options. If you are with someone go to the normal entrance where the taxis drop people off , unload your luggage and have one person stay with the luggage, go park your car and then come back to help with the luggage or in most cases the bell hop can help (for a tip). If you are by yourself, you can leave your luggage with the bell hop (for a tip), tell them you are just going to park your car and then come back for your luggage. 2) The cocktail servers in the table area as well as in the slot area have a zone that they are working in Servers are not allowed to cross over to another zone to serve a customer even if it is right across the aisle. Therefore do not get mad if the server tells you that you are not in her zone/station. The servers primarily work for tips and most drinks that they serve you would cost $6 to $10 at the bar, therefore tip accordingly. If you are going to be in an area for 2 or 3 hours, get to know your server. Be nice to her, treat her with respect and tip well. During their shift she will take an hour break and a relief server fills in. 3) Many of the hotels have a mandatory resort fee of $22 or more per night. This resort fee is to cover the use of the gym and WIFI. Caesars Properties, which Paris is part of, does not charge a mandatory resort fee. They do charge $14.99 per 24 hours per device for WIFI in the room, (Smart phones are the same as a laptop) and $25 per day for gym access. There is FREE WIFI access in Caf\u00e9 Belle Madeleine. Therefore, if you do not use WIFI or the gym you will save money. 4) There is food 24 hours at Paris with many choices through out the day. For late night dining (11:00 PM to 6:00AM) food is available at the Sugar Factory. Caf\u00e9 Ile St Louis used to be open 24 hours (Starting April 11th they will close at 11:00 PM and open at 6:00 AM). At most of the restaurants they give you a lot of food and if you have an average appetite you can split a meal (they may charge a small split fee). From about 10:30 AM to 12:30 PM and 6:00 PM to 8:00PM the lines at the restaurants can be quite long, if you can avoid these times your wait will be short. 5) Paris may look old and that it needs a new coat of paint. Paris hotel and the Casino is meant to look like old Paris, therefore what may look like old dingy paint is in reality the look that they have intended, i.e. a distressed look. 6) Vegas is a 24 hour city and people are always in the casinos. Paris does a very good job of keeping the Casino area clean, floors swept, ash trays emptied, drink glasses and bottles removed from the tables and slot machines. 7) If you book with a room with Paris at one price and you see that the rates have dropped before you make your trip, just call Paris (at least 72 hours prior) and ask them to adjust your rate. His does not work if you have booked a package deal or with some travel agent. 8) Remember, Vegas is expensive relative to most small towns and cities so do not be shocked at the prices for food and drinks. There are bargains if you do your research.

Overall, the stay was okay but would've been great if staff had been the least bit helpful or polite. We started our stay at the front desk with the clerk insisting there were no strip views available even though I'd requested one with my reservation months ago. She was downright rude as she kept trying to put us in a room with a king-size bed even though I repeatedly told her we needed 2 queens and had made a reservation 2 queens. Finally I flat out told her I was travelling with a friend, not a boyfriend, and we would not be sharing a bed! In the end, the premier red room requested with queen beds overlooking the strip was a mediocre red room overlooking the parking garage. I know hotels can't guarantee requests like views but I also know those rooms were most likely given to people who booked their rooms much later than I did. Not sure what makes their money better than mine? One morning we would've liked room service but there was no book in the room to peruse choices so we opted to go downstairs. One afternoon I walked up to the counter at Le Cafe to order a latte. The young man behind the counter refused to acknowledge me even though there was nobody else at the counter. Finally I flat out asked if I could order a coffee and he replied \"yeah\". When I asked for a latte I was told his steamer didn't work and I should go to the place across the hall. Then he proceeded to tell me that this was a \"bar NOT a coffee shop\" I told him that the sign right above our heads said \"Le Cafe\" and mentioned espressos so they should change the name then! Walked across the hall to Cafe Belle and had a very average latte there. We had lunch at Le Village Buffet and the food was very good and our waiter was pleasant and on the ball. Waitresses serving the slot machines were also quicker and more efficient than most we found at the strip.

The \"red rooms\" are the ones they could afford to renovate but they are also beginning to show wear and tear. The casino is spacious and bright, but the games themselves are not a good value -- you can do better at most other non-Harrahs/Caesars casinos. The machines are tight and table games rules are not what they could and should be. Blackjack rules in particular are not good -- few tables pay a full 3/2 for blackjack and the limits are high for the house advantage on those tables [hint -- the Bellagio has a much better casino -- just walk across the street]. Drink service is average to poor. I found the dealers a bit discouraged and the pit staff was disinterested and, in one instance, actively rude to simple inquiries from players at my table.

The reception area is quite beautiful and reminded me of when I visited Versailles in France - glittering chandeliers and marble countertops. I also cannot say enough good things about the service - the concierge was amazing, and the people at the reception were great as well - courteous and prompt. As for housekeeping, they were very attentive as well - when we put a \"do not disturb\" sign on the doorknob, housekeeping left a voicemail to confirm that we indeed did not want to be disturbed, and told us to phone them back if and when we ever needed anything. We stayed in the cheapest room, the luxury guest room, on a smoke-free floor, so it didn't have the glamour of the reception area. The room had a view of the rear of Bally (a hotel that has seen better days), which wasn't a great view, but hey, you get what you pay for. The room and bathroom were clean - the shower was beautiful (gorgeous coral-and-tan coloured stone) - and although the decor was a tired-looking (it obviously was not a room that had been renovated recently), it had charm. Minor complaint: the pillows on the bed were thin and rather skimpy - there were only three flattened pillows per bed - and the bathtub had two holes in the ceramic, which turned me off to taking a bath there. In general, we found it a quiet stay - I have no complaints about noise from the other rooms. The martinis at the bar in the casino were priced at roughly $12 and were some of the best martinis I've ever had, and Le Provencal provided a pretty good dinner of Italian food. The one thing that would deter me from staying at this hotel again is that the casino in Paris is filled with second-hand smoke - more so than other in hotels like Mandalay Bay. This is a pity because everything else about the hotel is great. It's hard to avoid the smoke in the casino because you have to walk through it to get to the elevators to get to your room, and the ventilation in the casino isn't great. I think next time I'll opt for Mandalay Bay; by the end of the four-day trip, I, a non-smoker, was hacking up brown phlegm. Now, it's not because of solely the casino in Paris, but it definitely didn't help. So I recommend this hotel if you don't mind breathing in second-hand smoke to and from your hotel room. If you do mind - I think Mandalay Bay is probably a better option as there seems to be better ventilation there (which I gleaned from the hour I spent walking around there, where my lungs recovered somewhat from the smoke).", "Date": "March 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario Canada", "Title": "\u201cc'est magnifique!!\u201d", "Author": "lulucitron", "ReviewID": "UR100315733", "Content": "Just got back from 3 nights in vegas and had an amazing time. I loved the Paris hotel. The location is amazing. you're directly across from the bellagio and caesar's palace hotels and I could see the fountain show at the bellagio from my hotel room. The decor is amazing and I love how the inside area looks like an outdoor street with all the stores looking like outdoor store fronts. The ceiling has sky and clouds painted! The faux cobblestone floors, however, are tricky with heels; especially after a night of drinking! We went up the eiffel tower and looked at an amazing view of the city. Ate at the Mon Ami Gabi steakhouse and the food was very good. I found it funny that the waiters have french accents but cannot speaking a word of french! The minute I said \"Je voudrais...\" and saw a blank look on his face, I knew he didn't speak a word of french but the effect is cute for the theme of the hotel. As far as the rooms go, we upgraded to a room that allowed an outside view of the strip and the bellagio and other hotels. The room was comfortable and well appointed. The only pitfall is I wish the bed had more blankets rather than a sheet and thin coverlet. The bathroom as large and generous with a nice stand up shower. The bathtub was a little small so not used. I prefer a deeper tub. I did hear the people in the room next-door but no big deal. I also upgraded to include continental breakfast and happy hour munchies. The food was really good and plentiful--had smoked salmon, capers and eggs and tomatoes and cheese, which was nice. I grabbed extra water and fruit to drink and munch on throughout the day. Happy hour had amazing snacks. They said two drinks per person but they definitely didn't monitor so we had a good amount of alcohol. The table next to us got a fresh bottle of rum and drank 3/4 of it by the time they left. We also took travellers with us in tall lidded cups so it's worth the money and alcohol is expensive in vegas. Went on the grand canyon tour, which I highly recommend. It was amazing to see the canyon and the hoover dam. We didn't see any shows due to lack of time but went to the pure nightclub at caesar's the saturday night and I wouldn't recommend going. the VIP area is large and hardly anyone was in it so the remaining area where us normal schmoze could gather was small and they played house music, which I abhor. An amazing hotel and experience. If I went back to vegas I would definitely stay there again. Although bellagio and caesars are amazing as well, they're huge and takes forever to walk around it.

As a Total Rewards member, my stays have always been comped so I am less likely to complain about the view or the pillows. I do, however, still expect to be treated with courtesy. Unfortunately, this was not the case on my last visit. I encountered rude staff at the front desk and the Total Rewards desk, and some strange new rules that made no sense at all. For example, while playing at a slot machine, I ordered a tall Malibu and pineapple juice. The cocktail waitress asked to see my Seven Stars or Diamond reward card. I showed her my Platinum card and she told me that without a Seven Stars or Diamond reward card I could not have my drink tall. I wasn't asking for a double. Just a taller glass so the drink wouldn't be too strong. I can't figure out why they would reserve this special 'privilege' for their highest tiered players only. She told me she would have to ask her Manager because she didn't want to lose her job. I don't get that at all. There is no extra cost for them to put a drink in a tall glass instead of a short one (except maybe a little extra ice). I was also disappointed to see my favorite breakfast (southern style eggs benedict) has been dropped from the room service menu, my favorite slot machines have been removed from the casino (jackpot party progressive) and my favorite alcoholic beverage (Smirnoff Ice) is no longer available on the casino floor. One of the things I like best about Las Vegas is that you always have plenty of choices. I chose to walk across the street to The Bellagio and sign up for their new mLife players program and spent the rest of my stay with the family of MGM Resorts where I was treated very well.

As we are Total Reward members, we decided to use our points to upgrade to a \"Red Room Premiere\". It was not worth using the points. The room was slightly larger than a regular guest room, with a large screen TV. In addition, the room wasn't even red, it was purple. The room itself was supposedly recently renovated, but in the bathroom the wall paper was peeling off the ceiling, as well as the trim in the room was badly damaged. There was no hot water to take a bath, as the handle would only turn half way. We contacted housekeeping to repair the issue, they came within a few hours, but never resolved the issue. The next day we upgraded to a regular room suite, which was much nicer and worth the money. The houskeeping staff were friendly, and the room was always cleaned well each day. The rest of the service in the hotel left a lot to be desired. The staff within the main buffet restaurants as well as the 24 hour restaurant was poor. The staff were unfriendly and unhelpful. The food at the buffets was mediocre, and several in our party were ill after eating there. The food and beverages were also quite expensive ($16 martini's!), but to be expected in Vegas I guess. There was one exception in service. In the lobby their is a bar, which we used as the meeting point for our group during our stay. The bar and service staff in this area were always attentive and friendly. The Eiffel Tower Restaurant, which we found out once we arrived, is not associated with Paris Las Vegas, and is a seperate entity in its own, was incredible. We booked our wedding dinner there for our group (14 ppl). Everything was amazing. The service and quality of food was five star, and the event coordinator, Erika, was professional and accomodating. Our guests wanted for nothing. It was expensive, but worth every penny. Lastly, the wedding chapel and coordination services were great. The package we ordered included webcasting, which worked well, but was not simultaneous as advertised. Our family at home were not able to view it until several hours later. The flowers, minister provided, and the ceremony were fantastic. The photographer was a highlight to the day as we had extra time to take shots around the hotel. He did an amazing job capturing the day. One great heed of warning to all travellers to this hotel (if coming as a group) is the Total Experience Service - which is advertised on the Harrah's website. We booked all of our flights and rooms seperately as we were unaware of this service until after. When we called, they informed us that we were \"out of luck\" and were not able to take advantage of their VIP group services as we were already booked. When we responded via email to the manager of the service, we received no response and decided to discuss the issue in person when we arrived. When we went to the Total Rewards desk at Paris to discuss it, they had no idea what the Total Experience even was, or how it was associated with Harrah's. Later in the week we discussed it with the hotel manager, who gave us $100 food and beverge comp for our troubles. We are still not clear how the service works, and there may be an office at Caesar's Palace, we are still not sure. To date, we have had no response from our letter to the manager.

We knew we wanted to stay center strip, and the Paris was one of the best options within our price range. We had previously stayed at the Flamingo. Although both hotels were ok, we did probably prefer the Paris as it seemed a bit newer and \"fancier.\" The decor made it feel a little more romantic as well. I must also state that we are spoiled in terms of hotels. My husband travels weekly for business so we are accustomed to staying in top quality Hilton hotels for free. So for us to pay what we did for an average quality hotel can be frustrating for us. I must say I have no major problems with the hotel. The bathroom was clean, as was the room. The carpet was showing its age and I was a little surprised to not see flat-screen TVs in the rooms. We also requested a king bed and got two queens, which is not a huge deal but a minor inconvenience. Our view was of the neighboring casino, and I was ok with that as we did not pay for any sort of upgrade. I did really like that the pool is open year round. We are hardy mid westerners and made our way out there in the 60-65 degree weather to \"catch some sun\" (since it's been below 30 degrees for what seems like forever in our neck of the woods). The pool area was fine - you have to remember that it is definitely not peak pool time and probably was not a priority for the staff. It was clean but there were no frills out there this time of year (we had to unstack our chairs and there was no pool bar or any food for purchase out there - which I understand why as there were probably only about 20 people out there!). Although there was a gym, there was a fee associated with it (maybe $25 - I can't remember exactly). So although I was hoping to work out, I didn't want to pay for one visit what I pay for nearly a month at my home gym... The room was quiet and comfortable. The beds were ok - not a nice pillow-top but also not rock hard and uncomfortable. Overall, I have no real negative things to say, but nothing outstanding either. The staff was friendly enough, my room was cleaned in a timely fashion, and the location can't be beat. I would stay here again, but would probably explore another option the next time I'm in Vegas.

I'm including both the hotel and casino in this review. Keep in mind, it's very difficult to have a bad time in Las Vegas, and if you're enjoying it properly you're spending very little time in your room no matter where you stay. Starting with the good: The location is fantastic. Directly across from the Bellagio and within reasonable walking distance of both the north and the south end of the strip (for me the \"strip\" runs from the Luxor to Treasure Island). There is a monorail station located between Bally's and Paris so if you wanted to save yourself a little walking and don't want to spend the money on a cab this option is a nice alternative. The hotel/casino is very clean (although most of the places along the strip are pretty imaculate). The room was very clean and housekeeping was by every day. The bed we had was very comfortable, and we had quiet neighbors, but when walking the halls we could hear inside a lot of the rooms so I'm guessing the walls are very thin or poorly insulated. I'll admit, I typically had a couple of beverages that aided in my being able to sleep, but I slept fairly well here. It didn't appear to me that this particular hotel draws the truly wild crowds so I would think most people could get a good nights sleep here too. Now the not so good: Service is tricky to rate. The hotel staff, cleaning service, and everyone we encountered in the casino (dealers, pit bosses, waitresses, etc.) were 1st rate. A lot better in fact than I can say for other places I've stayed or played. That being said, the reason I can't give this a very good rating was one very critical thing for me in Las Vegas. There is no-where to eat after hours, and when I say after hours I mean 11pm. If this were any other town I would say this is no big deal. For me though, Vegas often requires eating a late dinner/early breakfast. The only thing open at that point are the bars (without food) or the tiny store selling water/pop/wine/candy/chips/etc.. Again, for some people this may not be a big deal but this was a major disappointment for us on a couple of occasions. The cost of the room when we booked it was right in line with other comparable places on the strip. There are cheaper rooms, and there are pricier rooms. Typically you get what you pay for in Vegas. In spite of the average price, I would have to say the room itself was below average. We had booked a non-smoking King, but only a smoking King or a non-smoking Queen was available. We took the room with two Queens and that might be why the room felt very squeezed in. A small desk pushed against one shared wall with the entertainment center/dresser/closet. A small chair pushed into the corner next to one of the beds. A small nightstand between the two beds. The bathroom was big enough, as it had both a shower and a separate bathtub, but I think that added to the living space of the room being even smaller. The TV was a dated old tube TV with a remote control that didn't want to work half the time and the only way to get internet was through a hard wired ethernet cable that cost extra. Again, I never plan on spending most of my time in my room when I'm in Vegas, but for those who do I would caution against a stay at Paris.

I love the way it feels. It has great ambiance and atmosphere. It\u2019s the right size and the buffet is excellent for breakfast. The room we stayed in was an average hotel room. The room was Clean and comfortable and very quiet. The water pressure in the shower was perfect. The self park garage is fairly easy to get to from the hotel room elevators. Our mid week price in February was $56 per night. This is a no frills room, no view room. Of course one of the best things about Paris is the location. Mid strip so you can walk to almost anything. It is right across from the Bellagio fountains and they are my favorite free attraction in Vegas. They give me goose bumps every time. My only complaints are: No coffee pot in the room for hot water to make tea. I brought my own tea bags and coffee express gave me free hot water in the evenings and charged $1 in the mornings. The Kleenex was very stiff and sandy, as Vegas is very dry, softer tissues would have been a nice touch. Tips: If you wish to ride the Eiffel tower, get a total rewards card for any of the following casinos total rewards desks: Caesars, Paris, Harrah\u2019s, Planet Hollywood, the Imperial Palace, The Flamingo and Rio. There is a coupon in the rewards booklet that gives you two for one rides. The cost is now $16 per person. The View is awesome; however I am not sure it is worth $32 for two, but is worth $16 for two. Be sure you stay long enough to see one Bellagio fountain show from the top of the Eiffel tower. I recommend the Buffet of Buffets. It is $40 for a 24 hour time and you can eat at 7 buffets. This includes Caesars, Paris, Harrah\u2019s, Planet Hollywood, the Imperial Palace, The Flamingo and Rio. So you eat Dinner first day at 6:30PM, breakfast before 9:30AM, lunch and then Dinner again at 6PM. Note: I recommend NEVER eating breakfast at a buffet after 9:30AM and never eat dinner at 7PM as the lines are too long. We ate at 5:30 one day and walked right in. So you get the potential of 4 all you can eat meals for $40. Even if you are not a big eater, the cost is great. We stayed in Paris so we ate breakfast at the Paris twice and Saturday morning they even had crab legs and crab claws on the buffet. The $40 is a great deal as breakfast on the weekends is $19 and dinner during the week in $25. So essentially lunch is free and if you can double up the hours, then two meals are virtually free. I loved breakfast at Paris, because of the way Paris made you feel. We tried Planet Hollywood and Harrah\u2019s for Dinner; however they lacked the atmosphere that Paris exudes. At the Paris buffet, you feel like you are on the sidewalks of Paris, while the other buffets had the atmosphere of a K&W or any other buffet in the USA. I would at least do the buffet once during your stay and time it so you get two dinners.", "Date": "February 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "bologna", "Title": "\u201ci would expect better\u201d", "Author": "jake80Bologna", "ReviewID": "UR95641672", "Content": "nice entertainment, room was ok, not particulary rich as las vegas use but ok, the climate was really too cold, and we cannot adjust becouse if we switched off the ac, the room would be fill of smoke of the rooms of the other floors.", "Date": "February 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and theme.

Service The people at the front desk are pretty good, although we did get one guy that was rude. When we first got there, we got to the hotel at 11:30am and the guy was rude and said that the rooms weren't ready until 4pm. When we asked politely if anything was available a bit sooner, he said he would put a \"rush\" on a room. However, when we went to check up every hour, it still wasn\u2019t ready. It wasn\u2019t until we got a really nice lady at the front deck around 3:30pm who said the room wasn\u2019t ready but she could give us another room exactly the same that HAD been ready. Also, be prepared to tip EVERYONE. You want info, a tip. You want them to watch your bags, a tip. You want a map, tip. And try to avoid making phone calls from the room, even the local ones are $1.25 each. If you can avoid it. Regarding checkout, they were VERY accommodating. They extended our checkout 2 hours past for no additional charge since we had a late night flight, plus they were really nice about it. So for the most part, the service is pretty good. Rooms The rooms were very clean, and the housekeeping insisted on cleaning our room every day (even when we didn't want to). Didn't know how I felt about this at first, but it really did keep the place VERY nice. The bathrooms were amazing and the decor in the room was very nice, and super clean (hence cleaning our room every day) Location: I gotta say, the location was PERFECT. It was right in the middle of the strip and surrounded by everything. We were VERY happy with the location. Plus, it was right across from the Bellagio, so you could see the water shows. VERY nice! Also a lot of the nightlife was very close. You could walk either way, north or south, on the strip and within minutes be at a bar or lounge. Shopping: Do not plan on shopping in the shoppes within the hotel unless you got extra cash to burn. Bottled waters were $4. A \u201cParis\u201d chocolate bar was $18. and a bottle of local sparkling wine was $60 (and it wasn\u2019t anything fancy). Also, we ate from one of the restaurants the first day and my boyfriend got sick from the food and it was a bit overpriced. Since the hotel was so close to other restaurants, I would suggest checking out one on the strip. I did hear that the buffet in Paris was really good, but we never went cause there was always a huge lineup. Atmosphere: The atmosphere was nice, but if your looking for somewhere \u201cyoung and hip\u201d, this probably isn\u2019t the place for you. The majority was an older crowd and we saw a few families. There weren\u2019t any good lounges or clubs in there either. However the eiffel tower and the decor was beautiful.

As a former owner of two hotels, I look at hotel amenities with a sharp eye. This is a well-run hotel. Our room, 1598, was clean and although it didn't face the Strip directly, we still had a great view of the fountain at Bellagio. The room was quiet, clean, the beds were comfortable and we slept very well. One annoying issue is the lack of a place to plug in the power cord for your computer. There are other comments about this, but management hasn't addressed the issue. Time for some flat screen TV's. We didn't watch it much, but the picture would be good for a few minutes and then deteriorate. The bed lights weren't well thought out as they are inconvenient to reach when it's time for lights out. Other then that, the room was well appointed. We tried several of the restaurants. Mon Ami Gabi is a solid 4 stars. The patio area fills up quickly but is a great spot for dinner. The seared scallops were excellent as were the crab cakes and of course the escargot. We also had the Fillet Mignon with the Merlot reduction sauce and it was superb! The caulliflower puree was a nice side. Breakfast: the Le Cafe is the first place you'll see when you get off the elevator. Their breakfast is very limited but until folks realize there are other choices, they stand in line! Skip this and head over the Mon Ami. Try the homemade hash and the breakfast hashbrowns are second to none. We didn't eat at the buffet but went in and walked around. There's a huge variety and it all looked great, we just don't do well with buffets. On Fri, Sat and Sunday, at the bar advertizing dualing pianos, there is a Motown quartet that will blow you socks off. Sit up front and let these talented guys flirt with your wife/girlfriend. We dined at the Eiffel Tower restaurant one night, had a window seat and a spectacular meal we won't forget soon. We started with the foie gras and the smoked salmon, perfectly prepared and presented. My wife had the beef Wellington with au gratin potatoes and I opted for the lamb chops that were 2 inches thick and perfectcly prepared. We finished the meal with a scrumpous chocolate creation. The service was perfectly paced and of course the view of the strip and the Bellagio fountains added a nice and romantic touch. We opted to rent a car, first time I've done so in many visits to Vegas. The valet service was quick and efficient and a right turn out of the property and a quick left and I-15 is a block away.

We called housekeeping to discover that only suites and rooms above the 25th floor deserve a coffee maker!!! I thought that was quite ridiculous. The fridge did not get stocked until we left.

Being able to escape to the 32nd floor and to the peace and quiet of our room was very much appreciated. The housekeeping staff took incredibly good care of us. We noticed that even as we passed them in the hall they would acknowledge our presence and give us a morning greeting, including a \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d on Christmas morning. The rooms of the suite were spotless and well done. It was a beautiful space and well kept. The staff at every restaurant that we ate at was truly amazing as well. We ate at the Ile St. Louis, Le Provencal and Mon Ami Gabi. Every single staff person from the host/hostess, wait staff, bus staff provided an excellent job of service to us even though the restaurants were always busy at this time of year. We never felt neglected or hurried as we ate our meals. We particularly would like to call out the staff at Mon Ami Gabi. It was such a delightful experience on our first morning there that we ate breakfast there every morning for the rest of our stay and decided to have Christmas dinner there. All of the food in these restaurants was superior and cooked perfectly. They were some of the best meals we have ever had we had and we have traveled a lot.", "Date": "January 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Eastern Ontario", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel, but difficult to bring in luggage\u201d", "Author": "POLDIE", "ReviewID": "UR91580798", "Content": "The hotel itself was very nice with a lovely Parisian athmosphere.

Here is my problem... I did not call to get a discount, future coupon, or refund. I wanted to inform the food service dept of the situation so that the issue is handled for the future and so that other guests would not go through what my husband did. We had to fly home the next morning so my husband was sick the entire plane ride and he is still sick. I would have thought that the manager would apologize for the problem but he stated only the above. I work in the customer service industry and I expected to receive better from such a large company. Especially since word of mouth recommendations are so big and customers keep the business running. The first thing I would have done was apologize on behalf of the company and explain that it would be looked into and someone would be contacting me back. It would have been nice to hear that at least. I can definitely say that we will never stay, play, eat or recommend Paris. It infuriates me that the customer service the manager provided me was so poor. On top of that the rooms and hallways were very old and small. They had a tube tv that was maybe 22in. Maybe most people come to Vegas to gamble, party or site see but you also want to know that you are laying your head somewhere comfortable and that to me means a tv that I do not have to squint at to see what I am watching. House keeping even stopped by to ask when we were checking out so they could clean our room. I thought when you put \"Do Not Disturb\" on the door that is exactly what it means but apparently I was wrong.

The basic luxury room given to us initially was terrible. It was on the 8th floor of the hotel and faced the back with a view of a parking lot. The entire floor was smelling very stale and it felt like their air conditioning was not recirculating the air very well. The room looked very tired and dated. The bed was hard, and the TV remote did not work. The bathroom door's lock was broken. And to top it all off there was no coffee maker in the room and no fridge. After spending 2 nights in this room we decided it was high time we asked for an upgrade. We were offered an upgrade to a red room that faced the strip and had views of the Eiffel tower and the Bellagio fountains. This upgrade cost us about $ 75 more per night in addition to what we had already paid. But it was worth it. This room had a flat screen TV and a coffee maker. The bed was ultra comfortable and the views out from our room located on the 30th floor of the hotel were breath taking. Everything was updated and clean and fresh completely unlike the tired luxury room given to us earlier. So if you want to enjoy your stay in this particular casino i would suggest you opt for an upgraded room and avoid their basic room offering. As far as the location went the casino is perfectly situated, right across the Bellagio casino and diagonally opposite to the new City Center with its shopping and hotels and also Caesars Palace. The ride to the top of the Eiffel tower for $ 15 per head was little expensive but the views from the top were good. The hotel also has quite a few restaurants. We ate at the Mon Ami Gabi which was excellent and also at the Le Village Buffet which was over priced and over crowded and the buffet stations were for some reason very dirty. It appeared to me that the service and wait staff were unable to keep pace with the considerable demand that this buffet has. We also ate at the Bellagio buffet which which was a much better choice and had an amazing variety of desserts. Be prepared for humongous lines everywhere. The wait to get into a buffet was nearly an hour long every time. Another problem area that this hotel has is the Valet Parking service. We used this to park our car almost everyday. But the wait while they retrieved our car was horribly long. One morning we had to wait for nearly 40 mins for our car.

We were taking our 96 year old grandfather who wanted to be in the heart of the action, and the Paris seemed like a good choice given its location in the middle of the strip and our price sensitivity since we were paying for 2 rooms. We booked a red room with a view of the Eiffel Tower for us and a standard room for our grandfather, and without us asking, the front desk upgraded our grandfather's room (although without a view) so he could be on the same floor. Our initial reaction to the Paris was disappointment with the decor at check-in, in the elevators and hallways. However, the red rooms were large with upholstered red headboards, a large storage unit with flat screen TV and safe, desk, love seat and a king size bed. The bathroom was also large, with a separate tub and stall shower. The tub was quite small and shallow and the shower head was very high and small. We've been spoiled by having 2 sinks, large tubs, good lighting and bathrobes in the Aria, Wynn and thehotel. When we called Housekeeping to ask if bathrobes were available, we were told only for purchase. Despite its shortcomings compared to the other LV luxury hotels, the Paris grew on us because of its amazing view and location. Our room not only overlooked the Eiffel Tower, but had a view of the Bellagio fountains. We turned the loveseat around to have a panoramic view of the strip. It was simply fabulous. Some great things about the Paris: - The view and being in the center of the strip - Getting a late check-out (1pm) - Having a very nice EMT on-site when one of us had some digestive trouble - The shops downstairs where a good variety of carry-out food was available 1 quirky thing - The empty fridge in the room.

This is going to be a very complementary review but I have to start with a negative. Because it was before 4pm, every line in the foyer said `checkout'. That meant that teems of people trying to check in got confused, queued with the concierge desk, went to the show tickets booth and generally didn't know what to do. Since we had a young kid and were very tired, wasting 30 minutes trying to figure out where to check in was annoying. Then we had a room debacle. Having paid for a premier red room,w e were allocated to a red room on a very low floor (level 10 or so). I immediately realised the error, but when I rang the front desk she told me there was no error and I had received what I'd paid for. Luckily, I had printed my booking receipt from the Paris website and took it down. The supervisor was very apologetic and told me it was lucky I had a copy of this with me as there `system' hadn't recorded it appropriately. He then told me this had happened a few times lately. Assuming this is a real mistake, it strikes me that this is pretty unacceptable if you are booking directly with the hotel. However, we got re-allocated to another room on about the 30th floor. It was lovely with a fantastic view of the Bellagio fountains. We could hear the music pretty easily and we turned our couch around so that we could sit and watch easily whenever the show started. Because we arrived about 4pm, we had a sleep prior to catching a show. No problems with noise at all. This was to continue on both nights. The first night we heard some young guys playing with our room service table for a few minutes but our sleep was excellent. The bed was exceptionally comfortable. After the show on our first night, we ordered room service and we found that we received excellent value for money. There was more food than we could imagine we could need! Also, everything arrived very quickly. I'd have to say the service was very good. Overall, you just can't beat the location of Paris, and this became obvious when compared to our second hotel (The Signature). We could get anywhere relatively quickly from Paris and this was important when travelling with a kid. Maybe if I had been travelling to Vegas in summer a better pool complex would have been important but we didn't go anywhere near it anyway. We had breakfast in one of the restaurants inside Paris on our last morning there and the pancakes were EXCELLENT! I would definitely stay at the Paris again, though the sheer number of choices in Vegas would probably make me choose one of the others in the vicinity just for a different experience. If you are a young couple looking for a romantic getaway, I can definitely recommend a Premier Red Room - you won't regret it at all.", "Date": "December 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cNever again\u201d", "Author": "WeThreeAdventurers", "ReviewID": "UR89607560", "Content": "We chose the Paris Las Vegas due to its wonderful central strip location...but it was not worth the rude staff and horrible rooms.

The women behind the counter sighed when we walked in, got angry with me when I told her I was paying with card and had no cash on me, was frustrated because I asked for something they were about to take to the back (for closing time purposes) but was still on the shelp and the reason for why I thought it was okay to order it and then had the audacity to glare at us while we ate out treats, which at that point made us feel like unwanted nuisances. The one reprieve we had was the concierge who not only was extremely well informed, but made us feel like we were all that mattered to him at that moment. He was very nice. I wish I would have written his name down to include it here, but this will have to suffice. I'm sorry to say that Paris was not what I had been expecting.

The walk from the parking deck to the check in counter was quite a hike, especially when hauling luggage through the crowded casino/restaurant areas. We arrived on Thursday about 2:30pm (check in wasn't supposed to be until 4:00). The line was not long at all and the check-in rep was very hospitable and accommodating. I handed the check-in rep my driver's license and a $50 bill and asked if there was availability for an upgrade for both rooms to overlook the Bellagio fountains on a high level floor. Since we arrived early, not all rooms were ready so the clerk took my number and called me about 30 minutes later. She offered me a nice, large suite in the corner on the 18th floor but could not get two rooms close to each other on that floor. We opted to wait a little longer (about 15 minutes) and got two king rooms together on the 24th floor overlooking Bellagio fountains. The rooms were a little dated but clean and comfortable. With the high cost of adult beverages, food and the long lines for restaurants, we elected the Concierge service for an additional 55.00 per night (which covered two guests per room). Concierge was on the 31st floor overlooking the fountains. It was open from 7am - 11am and again from 5pm - 8pm. During the evening service (while we were there), they offered ravioli alfredo, peel and eat shrimp, fruit, cheeses, wonderful breads and baked goods, adult beverages, beautiful desserts, coffees, juices, sodas.

We also indulged in a Napoleon and coffee at the pastry shoppe near the elevator. It was scrumptous. You've got to stop there. We had a late night dinner at Mon Ami Gabi. The ambience was fantastic.

There was only a double queen Red Room with no view available, so we settled for a king standard room. We were too chicken to slip the check in girl a $20, thinking that letting her know that it was our 10 year would be enough. Well we were wrong, she wasn't the nicest, but we didn't really care. We did pay the additional $55 a day for the concierge service. What a deal! Continental breakfast included smoked salmon and bagels, loads of pastries and fruit. Not to mention endless lattes and whipped coffees! Appies were served from 5-8 pm every night which included peel and eat shrimp, cheeses with baguette, sandwiches and then 2 hot items which varied from spring rolls to penne alfredo. It also included sodas and juices, and 2 alcoholic beverages a day. Considering 2 pastries and coffee at Madeline's cost upwards of $20, I thought this was a great deal!

Directly across from the Bellagio, so we got great views of the fountain show every time! But oh my it was loud, even on the 21st floor. We also did a spa service which we got a $20 discount on. Ladies - ask for Ivanka. She was amazing and super knowledgeable. Note the additional 20% \"service fee\" that is tacked on to your services - ouch! I wasn't sure if this was a hotel fee or a built in gratuity, but the massage was worth it. With any service you get all day access to the spa, and the steam and sauna were great. We're not huge gamblers, but we did spend an evening at the slots. The casino is nice, not too busy or overly loud like the MGM was. Waitresses are hit and miss though, some are super nice and give great service for a $5 tip, others are a bit more snarky.

One window overlooked the mountains and the north strip and the other window had a perfect view of the Bellagio Hotel and the fountains. The room was well appointed, clean and very comfortable.

Wandering the shops and enjoying the restaurants and the Piano Bar was highlighted by the feeling of \"being outside' on the cobblestoned streets of Paris. We ate three times at the Le Village Buffet using the 24 hour buffet pass - supper, breakfast and lunch. There was on average a 30 minute wait for each meal, but well worth it. The atmosphere of being in a french village and the vast array of food choices was outstanding. The crepes and omelette stations were fantastic. We also frequented Madeleine's and enjoyed coffee and french pastries. Unfortunately the wait was about 30 minutes. We spent about two hours each day by the pool enjoying lazing around, sunning and enjoyed looking up at the Eiffel Tower. We had many happy hours (two for one drinks), with the waitresses coming around often. We had no difficulty finding lounge chairs when we went in the late morning or in the mid afternoons.

I was awakened one night by loud snoring coming from the room next door. Most of the staff at the Cafe Madeleine were courteous but veeeeeery slow in service. One of the staff had such a bad attitude that after the second day I stopped going there. Not sure if she was having two bad days in a row, however I didn't feel comfortable going there any longer. Even though the this hotel's theme is \"parisienne\", not one employee spoke french. It's all for show.

We went to the second room which was significantly cleaner than the first but still dusty and a little smelly, we opened the fridge to find mouldy fruit and old bottles of water.

In order to give us this we had to give them a credit card and were told to spend the credit in the hotel . Having returned home , our purchases appear on my credit card bill . The 25 dollar credit does not appear to have been made . Having contacted the Paris , they are not able to rectify this as we spent money at the bar and not in the room which was not explained to us .

Was very surprised to enter the hotel and walk directly into the casino, I expected the reception first. Check in was quick and we had our suitcases brought up to our room by bellboys. The room was a standard room however it was very roomy, my cousin and I were sharing. We both had large comfortable beds. The bathroom was very roomy with bath and shower and a large sink/dressing top area. The room had an empty mini bar which we used for our own drinks/water. There are ice machines and vending machines in a room on each floor. Rooms are air conditioned as no hotel windows open in Las Vegas. There is also a television offering several interactive services and the usual mix of insane American television which was quite entertaining to watch in the early evenings before venturing out for the night! Lots of health/medical and lawsuit ads! The room was tidied daily by maids and the actual hotel corridors/public areas were spotless. The pool was a very nice area to relax in the afternoons beneath the large Eiffel Tower, which acted as a huge sundial in the late afternoons. The pool is open until 6pm and has bars and shops around it. Towels are provided upon entry to all hotel guests. We did not see much of the other hotel facilities as being in Vegas, so much to see and do with all the hotels intertwined, we saw the massive casino and the shops and restaurants. Didn't really eat in the hotel as again was out and about everyday and likely to eat elsewhere however I did frequent the small coffee shop several times to buy orangina and a cake from the patisserie which were absolutely lovely to look at let alone eat.

Beautiful lobby and walkway through the shops, casino and restaurants. Painted sky ceiling and fake cobblestone made you feel like you were in Paris (well, almost). The room itself was very pretty and very clean,with French decor motif throughout. Bathroom to match with ornate light fixtures and wallpaper, separate shower from bathtub. Housekeeping did a phenomenal job and we made sure to tip them daily. I can only imagine half the things they encounter, but we did end up having a bit of a spill on the carpet and by the time we returned to the room it was as if nothing had happened. One of my favorite elements of the room was the bedding. Paris Hotel puts a duvet between two crisp, clean white sheets instead of using one of those tired, old standard bed covers (that rarely get laundered). The bed felt fresh and clean and very comfortable. There was a (empty) mini bar in the room so we were able to use the refrigerator for our own drinks and snacks.

We arrived at Paris at about 5:00 p.m. and we were standing at the check-in within 5 minutes, which was great. Not so great: no standard rooms with beds at the pre-arranged rate. We were offered a jacuzi suite with a king bed for an extra $50 a night (which turned out to be $56 a night for a total of $106.00 a night) which we decided to take. On the plus side, the room was huge, easily the largest we have ever had in Vegas (and we have stayed at the Venetian, the Belagio, at Caesers in the Augustus and Forum towers, and, two weeks earlier, at the Aria). The room had a fridge that you could actually use (unlike the bar fridges at most hotels now), a sitting area with a couch, several chairs and a desk, a king size bed, a bathroom with a two-person jacuzi, double sinks and a shower (the toilet in a separate room) and a very large area where luggage could be stored out of sight and another desk. The furniture, including the bed, was very comfortable: we slept very well. The room looked elegant, but somewhat dated. The jacuzi worked well and fit two adults comfortably. On the negative side, while rooms of comparable price now have two or three flat-screen televisions, including one in the bathroom, this room had one very small box television in a place that you really couldn't watch comfortably from bed (not that we watch much television in Vegas, but it's the principle). Again, the room looked elegant but dated: we had payed $79 a night for the Aria two weeks before, and although the Aria room was much smaller, it was also far more stylish. Most disappointing was the view: at a room rate of more than $100 a night we expect something nice to look at (the Strip, the mountains, something), but we overlooked the roof and air-conditioning. We see little point in having a huge sitting area if the view discourages one from spending any extra time in the room. Regarding the hotel, we love the look of the casino and Mon Abi Gabi is by far our favorite restaurant in Vegas (AVOID LE VILLAGE BUFFET LIKE THE PLAGUE!

There is no music playing in any areas of the hotel like a lot of other places. We also booked a standard room that, while decent enough for the price, was outdated and in need of renovation. There are newer updated rooms if you want to pay the extra money. I would recommend this hotel if you want a nice place to stay and don't really care about a hotel with energy or up-dated standard rooms.

We had a total of 18 people for our trip. The guests were able to get discounted rooms. I had the Eiffel Tower morning package it was great and everything went very smoothly. I got a ton of compliments from friends and family about how it was the best wedding they had been too. We had a brunch reception at the Eiffel Tower restaurant - we had the pre-selected 3 course brunch menu - where the food was amazing and the Creme Brulee was to die for - people are still talking it was the best they have had in any restaurant. Personally, for me the food was way too rich and creamy - but I guess that comes with food type. For dinner we had our group at the Mon Ami Gabi in the private indoor room facing the Belligo fountains, the setup of the room was perfect and the service couldn't be beat. Everyone raved about the meal being the best of the trip by far - smaller groups of us also returned for breakfast and lunch because we were so impressed! This is a breakfast place that can't be missed - sit outside for the great view along with the tasty food. If you can swing it, between our brunch and dinner we rented a pool cabana. It was THE way to spend the day at the pool. They had an indoor room with A/C, TV and mini fridge, and an outside lounge area with misters - which is a bonus for those hot Vegas days in the sun. The drinks at the pool were pretty pricey as well, but it was a great day and well worth it. The downside - I hate to complain because everything was so wonderful for our special day, but a few things I would change if I were to do it over... my now husband and I were the first to check-in, a few days ahead of the rest of our party, and come to find out - we were given the worst room. Now normally I wouldn't mind - but being the bride and groom I was sort-of expecting extra special treatment. We had one of the lower room floors, and our room had not been renovated as the other rooms our guests received were - on higher floors. The higher floors also had the much better views, so I would recommend staying the highest floor you can reserve. I didn't want to request to change once I saw the difference in the rooms, because I had so much stuff with my dress and all - and also it wasn't in our nature to throw a fit to the staff for our wedding trip. The higher floors also go a turn down service in the evening which we did not get. Also, on the weekends there was loud music at the pool - being on the lower floors - you better like Jersey Shore fist pumping club music - because unless you turn on your TV, that is all you will hear... all day long. Our room did not have a flat pannel TV or ipod doc like the other rooms. I also wish they offered free wi-fi. In this day and age I think it would be a given, esp with all the bucks the hotels rake in, I think they can afford this perk to their guests :). For wedding coordinator I was expecting more of a best friend type for guidance - instead I got a drill sargent. She did get the spa to open an hour early for me - which I was unable to get them to do, in order to get my hair and make-up done at their hotel in time for the ceramoney - so that was a benefit to her toughness. The spa was nothing compared to Ceasars - don't waste your time at the Paris spa - for sure it is worth the walk and $ to check out Ceasers spa, it is amazing and a night and day difference between the two. You don't even need to get a treatment to enjoy their spa - they have a whole set-up with pools and saunas you could easily spend the whole day at - (the only scary part is some of our fellow spa guests who should not be allowed to follow the clothing- optional choice for the sake of the other people there - be advised :), The photos - you only get standard size prints - so be prepared to shell out a pretty penny to get the CD so you can make your own prints when you return home. My photos did turn out great overall, and I printed them online through a popular online photo site to get the larger prints and books. Overall - I would say Paris was an awesome place to be married (esp in the tower) - but just make sure to get yourself an awesome remodeled room on a high floor facing the strip to go along with you stay. The night time view of the tower and the fountains is amazing!!! I was told repeatedly that everyone loved the trip and it was THE way to do a wedding. So - I don't think you can go wrong if you get married here.

Location of the hotel is the best. Just in front of the Bellagio fountains and close to Miracle Mile Shopping Center. If you are a budget traveler like me, pay $18.00 for a beakfast is too much, so, 200 mts north there is a Burger King at Osheas Casino, there is also an Earl Sandwiches store at the Planet Hollywood where prices are low in the $8 or $7. Good? Yes. There is also a Hard Rock Cafe 150 mts south, with a Wendys and a Subway close to it. Good? Better. Ok, more tips, 1) The Deuce: Impossible to ride if you are not an early bird. The only way to see everything and take the deuce is waking up early. The whole day is full. Reason? $7.00 for 24 hours ride is a good deal. So be early at the strip and you will be able to ride it. Also, going early to the strip, you will also find the day more cool, the later at the strip, the hotter will be the day. Everybody is drinking till morning hours, people wake up late, and because you want to see the strip, you wake up early. OK. Whe i say early, means between 830 am to 9 am. 2)The best way to see the strip, is walking. You can not take picturesof the strip, from the inside of car or a bus. Go to google maps or panoramio.com, there are lots of pictures. Youtube.com have a lot of videos of the Strip, watch them, you will learn a lot, the more you learn, the more money you will save by knowing where you are. Study the place before going. You can save hundreds of dollars by doing it by yourself. 3) I was in a \"deluxe\" room. The cheaper one. There is no fridge, but there is an icemachine in each floor. If the ice machine is not working (that happened to me), go to the lower floor, each floor layout is the same. You will save $55.00 per night without a fridge in the room. 4) Go to the Top of the Eifell tower, by day $10.00 ride, by night $15.00, with $22.00 \"VIP ticket\", you do not have to make the line to take the elevator. Remember, the Bellagio Fountains show starts at 3pm, until 12am every day. So, stay looking at the Bellagio to take good pictures while you are in the top. 5) The best way to see the Bellagio Fountains show, is waiingt for it. If you leave, it starts, and you will not be there. Have a little patience and you will have a front seat! Is every half and hour and is a must see show. 6) There is a Seven Elleven at the Hawaiian Market, 200 mts south of Paris Hotel. Buy water, this place is really hot in summer time. There is also a Walgreen beside the Hawaiin Market. Housekeeping...terrible. They did not clean my room daily, i had to look around the floor to see the cleaning girls to see why it was 3pm and the room was not clean. The second day was the same. So i went to the lobby to complaint about it. The front desk clerk Luz, told me, \"You want to be cleaned the room daily?\" ,,,,,, WHAT!!!. So, i was dissapointted how rude this lady was. There are 2,925 rooms in the Paris Hotel, so, that nobody cares about you, you are another number, that is the way i feel. The hotel lobby looks like an airport, people going and people coming. Casino- Is beautiful, but like every casino in the strip, they smell the hell of cigarrete smoke! Be prepare for that.

The temperature was 100\u00b0+ so we did most of our sightseeing during early mornings and after sundown (with a mid-day siesta). We used indoor walkways, people movers and hotel trams as much as possible. Paris\u2019s central location made these excursions easier despite the heat. My sister and I booked our trip through USAirways Vacations and paid less for the three night package than the airfare alone. We had a standard room with a view of the Paris Balloon and the Arc de Triomphe that wasn\u2019t bad. We could have upgraded, but decided it wasn\u2019t worth the extra money. We\u2019d previously stayed at the Wynn and Venetian so Paris Las Vegas was small by comparison - but so was the price. The room was clean and quiet but could have used a little TLC. The hotel was very easy to navigate with all of the amenities expected at a fine hotel. Paris Las Vegas is in the shape of an \u201cX\u201d with the elevators at the center so there wasn\u2019t an endless, confusing walk to our room. One morning, we had three Mimosas at the casino (free), then walked across Le Boulevard and had cr\u00e8me brulee and coffee - the perfect Las Vegas breakfast. There\u2019s also a lovely bar in the casino, under the trees, that\u2019s a great place to sit with a beverage and people watch. We found a small coffee station directly across from the elevators for that quick jolt of caffeine without the restaurant lines. The service staff was very attentive. Check-in took about ten minutes. The Bell Captain and housekeeping were friendly and helpful and the waitresses in the casino were always available. We are low-rollers and don\u2019t eat at the gourmet restaurants but we were glad we did not purchase the 24-hour buffet special. During peak times, the lines for the buffets were very, very long and would have cut into our valuable vacation time. When we ate at the hotel, Le Caf\u00e9 was an excellent choice for meals with reasonable prices (for Las Vegas) and great service. Tip: When the menu says \u201cpeppercorn crusted\u201d they mean it. Our waiter warned us but we didn\u2019t listen. Our bad. Naturally, there are lines at regular meal times with special access given to big spenders. If waiting in lines aggravates you either become a high roller or stay home. If you think yelling at the wait staff will make the line move faster you\u2019re wrong. You just provide entertainment for the rest of us and run the risk of the staff pulling a \u201cMiss Celie\u201d in your water glass. The mini-bar was completely empty and turned off. (A mini-bar isn\u2019t listed as a room feature on Paris\u2019s website.) It didn\u2019t matter to us but some people might want this amenity.

Evidently, according to her, you are not guaranteed what you reserved. We could, however, upgrade to a newly renovated room with a king sized bed for an additional $40 a night. It was our 25th anniversary and staying at Paris was already an upgrade for us so we were not prepared to pay an additional $160 to get what we thought we already had signed up for.

I see a lot of people criticize this hotel for service and the employees' attitudes. I have to say that I did not interact with anyone at this hotel, other than the person who checked us in, who was pleasant and quick. Oh, and the dealer/casino staff were very nice. Also, I did not eat here, so I can't comment on that either. That said, here are the highs and lows from my perspective: 1. The room was fantastic. It was large, clean and appointed very nicely. The bathroom was the highlight. Huge, all-tile, stand-alone shower, kohler fixtures, lots of nice towels etc. All very nice. And, the bed was very comfy. The furniture was very nice as well. 2. The elevators were crazy quick. I honestly don't think I waited longer than 10 seconds for any elevator ride. This is WAY different than I've experienced at other Vegas hotels. 3. The hotel is easy to get in and out of. There is a dedicated stop light on Las Vegas Blvd, you can turn left or right onto Las Vegas Blvd from the valet and you can enter the hotel from Las Vegas Blvd going either way. This is a huge plus if you are a casino/restaurant hopper or shopper. 4. You can use the empty row in the Mini Bar for your personal use, so you kind of have a fridge in your room. 5. The Pool is awesome. It's huge, clean and in a beautiful setting. You're at the base of the eiffel tower. It's a beautiful setting and a fun time. You can chill out or play with the youngin's playing beach ball and drinking. 6. The location is as good as it gets. It's in the heart of the strip. Most things are walkable. The Bellagio is across the street. The location is one of the best features of this property. 7. The place is just the right size. It's big enough to have a good choice of restaurants, shops and amenities. But, it's not huge. You can easily find your party. The casino is not huge at all - just the right size in my opinion. If you've ever stayed with a group at MGM, you know what I mean. 7. No Resort Fees! Cons: 1. The TV is a crappy old tube type, but who goes to Vegas to watch TV? 2. Valet parking is very slow (the self-park is way quicker and the walk to the room is about the same). It was busy when I was there, but the valet was a bit of a disaster, honestly. I would do the self-park. And, I'm not a self-parker. 3. Internet is like $15 a day, which is expensive, but who goes to Vegas to surf the internet? 4. If you care about your view, you're going to pay a lot more. I think they said a strip-view was like $50 or $60 a night more. Totally not worth it to me, but if it matters to you, consider that. For my needs, I highly recommend this place. Meaning, if you're looking for a very nice, affordable hotel room in Las Vegas with a great location - this can't be beat.", "Date": "August 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cA Great Vacation\u201d", "Author": "almays", "ReviewID": "UR73815057", "Content": "We stayed at the hotel July 18-22, and overall we enjoyed our stay.

Room service was lacking, we called for a late night snack and was told it would be at least 1 hour to be served, which to me is ridiculous for such a resort.

This was our first time in Vegas so maybe this is the norm for Vegas but.....we had to wait in line for about 10-15 minutes for the valet. It seemed like there was only about 2 guys working the valet but lots of cars. And when we checked in it took about 15-20 minutes. There was a line up of about 120 people and only 3 people were serving the non-gold/platinum/diamond members. So it took a while to get through. Once we got to the desk it didn't take long though. And there was a lineup of about 150 people for the supper buffet at 9:30. I assume not everyone was staying at the hotel, so it would be nice if there was a separate line for guest entry or something. I noticed there was a separate entry for gold/diamond/platinum members. And to top it off we heard someone say it closes at 10:00 (but the manager can keep it open longer if she wants). We didn't feel like staying in line only to have it close so we went across the \"street\" and got a sandwich. But like I said, maybe that's the norm for Vegas?? Pros - The free valet parking was nice since we had paid for it the last few stops on our trip. The hotel is really nice and there is lots of elevators that are fast. There was plenty of restaurant choices. The grounds are awesome with the Eiffel Tower and Arc de Triomphe. The room was a good size and we had a decent view (upgraded at time of purchase). Although I noticed on the backside of the hotel people would have a terrible view, so be aware of that. The location is great for anyone wanting to experience the strip. We were in the P-room and I thought the value for the room was good considering the free valet. Cons - The big one for me was tipping and the valet/bellman. I noticed (with myself and other guests) that after they were tipped they would always look down at the amount you gave them. It was not professional at all and made me not want to tip them. Tipping is something that is earned not expected. Also, they use different bellman at your room and downstairs. Sorry, but I'm not going to tip $1 a bag to BOTH of them. Another head scratched for me was that the pool closed at 8:00pm! I thought this was Vegas?? I was looking forward to a late night drink and swim after a long hot day of walking the Strip, but I was shocked to find out it closed at 8:00. Not cool at all. Although the hotel was very nice, it was a bit too cramped. There was a small walkway around the casino area to get to the restaurants and elevators, but there was always so much people that it was too packed. Paris is suppose to be romantic, but it was much too crowded. All in all though, it was a good stay.

On this trip I was travelling with a \"newbie\" so thought the Paris location would be an ideal home base due to it's central location. HET offered a special rate for my travelling companion for the second room, so we booked. After reading many of the reviews on TA, I contemplated cancelling our reservations, but took the chance and am happy I did. Many of the complaints on TA are centered on the front desk check-in. Our check-in experience was excellent. We arrived early, around 11:30 a.m., no line and the front desk was well staffed. We were greeted by a very friendly and helpful front desk agent Nicky. I upgraded my room to the concierge level and my travelling companion upgraded to a red room. Our experience at check-in was excellent. My room (3123) was dated, not one of the renovated rooms, but had a fantastic view of the strip, Eiffel tower and Bellagio fountains. It was conveniently located on the 31st floor where the concierge lounge is also located. The upgrade included breakfast offerings in the lounge from 8:00 a.m. until 11:00 a.m. and appetizers and drinks (beer, wine and spirits) from 5:00 p.m. until 8:00 p.m. All of the food was fresh and well presented, definitely worth the extra fee. The concierge in the lounge arranged for the hotel limo to pick us up at the Hard Rock after the Kenny Chesney concert on July 2nd and printed our boarding passes for the return flight. The lounge offers a nice little escape and relaxation away from the casino. Housekeeping service was prompt daily.....my room was always cleaned sometime after I left in the morning and before my return and at some point when I was out in the evenings I received nightly turn-down service with the chocolates which was was a nice touch. These rooms do need a renovation and I certainly hope they get one so that the rooms will do justice to that wonderful view! Each and every staff member we encountered during our stay was pleasant and helpful. When I asked any of the Casino floor staff a question, they were always pleasant and helpful. The cocktail servers on the Casino floor were always pleasant and the service was good. I did not encounter a single staff member at Paris who didn't make me feel as though my business was valuable to them. Because we used the lounge for breakfast daily, we only dined once at Paris at the buffet. It was good, but I prefer the Flavors Buffet at Harrahs, Spice Market at Planet Hollywood or Carnival World Buffet at The Rio. Our other dining was offsite. The Paris location can't be beat, very central. On arrival, we went to the ABC Stores next door at Planet Hollywood to stock up on water, beer, etc. From the Paris location, you are an easy walk to many other hotels and Casinos. The Paris Casino is easily navigated and you are quickly from your room to the strip. The pool area was spacious, sunny and you could always get a lounge chair. Often in the more upscale hotels, that can be difficult and the areas are often over-crowded. Our check-out experience was just as pleasant as our arrival and I have nothing but praise for the staff at Paris. To any contemplating a stay at Paris, Bon Voyage!

Arriving in the mid-afternoon, patiently stood in the long line for check-in. Had read bad reviews so I was determined to be pleasant. The woman who checked me in asked if I planned to charge anything to my room, I said maybe a phone call home, she then went on & on about a previous customer who had $150.00 in phone charges he didn't agree with, she said she had a big fight with him and she told him \"not my problem\",She said 'you'll be charged even if you pick up the receiver' which made me very leary to use the phone. I asked if my room might have a view, she said \"no maam, you have to pay for that\" (I had booked through Expedia) I was tired and realized when I got to my room, she hadn't given me info on the buffet that was supposed to be included. I tried talking to a concierge guy, I got a vague answer and he shrugged his shoulders, I then got back in the long line, this front desk person actually walked away on me when I questioned what my understanding of the reservation said regarding buffets and she left me standing there. No I would not recommend this hotel as these are the first people you see upon arrival and it can set the tone for the stay. There were no pleasant comments like welcome or enjoy you stay. I'm sure their not all that unpleasant, but I didn't encounter any pleasant front desk staff. The one bright star was the fellow who guides you onto the shuttle or taxi's outside, he was extremely friendly & helpful. Room was okay, quiet and the temperature for sleeping was perfect for the room but the 2 thin sheets they put on your bed are lacking, the 'throws' are useless, we asked for an extra blanket, but I was still chilly. It is an extremely busy hotel, the crowd intensifies as the day progresses. If I was to go to Las Vegas again I would opt for one of the older hotels as they were quieter and they had people just standing there waiting to direct us or answer any questions when we visited, very pleasant. The buffet was very good, great variety. Pool area is nice but very open, no shade. Tip - Mono-rail is great, little hard to find but not busy Didn't have much luck with the bus system (Bell), we bought a 24 hour pass, but it was so full, it didn't stop and we were forced to walk if we didn't want to miss our 4 pm show.

Upon check in we were notified that we were eligible for a free upgrade to the \"red rooms\". This was wonderful news to us and we graciously accepted. Although the rooms were on the smoking floor, and we are non-smokers, this did not impact our decision as the rooms were clean and did not reek of smoke. The rooms: Absolutely beautiful rooms with the most comfortable bed! Everything was so clean and the housekeeping service was fantastic. Room service: The room service was a little bit pricey. I did not appreciate having to pay $4.00 for a soda but the food itself was great. The room service took roughly 20-35 minutes depending on when you place your order. We were disappointed to have cold eggs for breakfast but all dinner was delicious. Overall atmosphere of hotel: What a terrific atmosphere. Walking through the lobby and around the casino to the different restaurants, one can easily forget where they are and imagine themselves in Paris, France. The cafe has a lovely terrace which overlooks the casinos. The lobby has beautiful chandeliers and overall thoroughly impressed with the hotel. Location: The location of Paris is perfect! It is really central on the strip which is nice because most things are a walking distance from the hotel. If not, the valet service outside helps you get a cab and send you on your way. MAKE SURE you specify where you are going because we were taken to the wrong place once. Paris is very near the Planet Hollywood mall which has wonderful shopping and great eateries. Pool/Weather: DRY HEAT! I don't think I need to say more. Escaping the humidity that we get in Toronto was amazing. Great weather. Don't forget to pack your sunblock if you're swimming and laying out by the pool though because you will be scorched. The pool is beautiful and has the \"Eiffel Tower\" right there. It's a great view and perfect place to tan. If you want to order a drink by the pool be warned that they might forget about you...I was forgotten about. But the pool was so beautiful that it didn't bother me. Nightlife: The night life in Vegas is great! We are in our 20s so we went out to the nightclubs. We went to Tao in the Venetian and XS at the Wynn. Both are recommended. Be prepared to pay highish covers (10-30 depending).

The sandwiches are huge and only $8 you can split it with someone and still have plenty of food. The lines were pretty long but I am a diamond member so I didn't have to stand in line. Also, right outside buffet there is a window where you can get a bloodymary for $5 and they are outstanding. The machine didn't seem to pay off very well but could have just been my luck. The table were okay but I was playing on a table that was $5 so it was $20 a hand. The pit boss came over and raised it to $10 so now it is $40 a hand. It was Wednesday night at midnight there were four players. I asked that they not raise it but they did any way. We all left and they closed it. Later in the night I asked that a table be lowered to $5 and they did it but when I asked the next night they wouldn't do it.

It included the use of the executive lounge which had the free breakfast buffet (cold) but very good and happy snacks and beverage. (I felt that was very good value). The upgraded room was a nice suite but with a horrible view of the roof top parkade. We upgraded to another view room facing the pool, strip and Belagio water show. Very nice up on the 24th floor. The corridors were dirty. Dirty room service trays for longer than 8 hours, beat up and chipped moldings, dirty albeit high quality wool carpet, and there were actually gaping bashed in areas in the walls. The room was well appointed but TV's have not been upgraded. Bathroom had slow drains and a terrible smell of sewage. Sheets had a hole in them and we found a dead moth on the floor which indicated poor cleaning. Bed was comfy pillow were not. Room attendant kept calling my wife and I \"honey\" but she was friendly enough. The rest of the staff seemed appropriate. We didn't care for the buffet restaurant. It seemed like a trough and the atmosphere was not pleasant (personal taste). The smell of cigarette smoke proliferated the common areas on the main floor and really put us off. When we checked in I had to go and ask about the coupon book which was included on our book it.com reservation. The first fellow discounted it when I brought it up so I had to call book it and then go down and insist he provide it. (I never used it anyhow ) but it's the point. I used the pool area and it was nice enough, but again smokers all over the place. No designated non smoking area on the pool deck that I could find. It was quite gross actually. (I'm Canadian) and this is just something you don't see anywhere in our Country. $ 25 fee to use the fitness center is not appropriate for a hotel of this caliber. We expressed our disappointment about the smell of the bathroom and the lady at the desk was very accommodating and friendly and offered to credit us $ 50.

Check in - Although there was a long line, it moved fast and we were at the desk in about 10 minutes. The desk clerk was friendly. Although very busy, she answered our questions and confirmed our stay. Here directions to the room elevators was helpful. Room - We booked a Red Room and it was awesome! Very large with lots of room. I had a mobility scooter (more on that forthcoming) and there was ample room for entry, parking, and recharging. Never got in the way. We were on the 30th floor and had a great view of the City Center, Bellagio fountains, and South Strip. A little noise made it's way through the windows when the fountain show \"exploded\", but quiet (after nidnight). Housekeeping was prompt every morning and our room was completely made-up when we returned from breakfast (around 10 a.m.). Very long hallways, so try and book a room near the elevators that are also close to the ice machine. Food - We purchased the \"Buffet of Buffets\" package. 24 hours of buffet at any of the Harrah's properties. This was awesome. We timed our purchase so we had bkfst, lunch, dinner, and bkfst the following morning...all on the same 24 hour pass. The price was right. Be sure and get your total rewards card to save 5 bucks of the price of the ticket. Although the le village buffet was awesome for breakfast, we found the dinner meal had a better variety at Planet Hollywood and lunch at the Rio was truy fantastic. Great buffets. He had dinner at Harrah's buffet one night.....good but not great! Casino - Some 5 dolar tables early and during the week. 10 to 15 were the norm. Higher if you want. Poker Room - Planet Hollywood by far was the most comfortable. Great padded chairs. Mobility Scooter - I rented over the internet. The last day I left it at the concierge desk and returned a few hours later only to find the rental company picked it up.....a day early! Next time I will rent direct from the concierge.

The female clerk we got was quick and was able to upgrade me from my standard comped room to a Luxury Red room when I asked if there were any complementary upgrades. The room was extra clean, the bed was very comfortable and the room appeared to be recently updated, there was a iron and board, coffee maker, flat screen TV, shower and tub, hair dryer and when we called housekeeping for 2 extra pillows, they were in our room within an hour. The view was not spectacular, but who just sits in their room and stares out the window in Vegas??? Although at night the view was better. The hotel was easily to navigate through. The pool was quiet and relaxing when you want to catch some sun. One secret to all the lines you could potentially face when you want to dine: Eat at off hours!! The service is much better, you get your meals faster and you will feel much more relaxed. I recommend Paris for the Location on the strip and the benefits you receive on your Total Rewards card for everything you purchase, play and dine. I also signed up for texts to my phone through total rewards (its on the total rewards website how to do it) and I got 2 for 1 rides up the Eiffel Tower, free drinks, etc. Also check out the Dueling Piano's at Napoleon's Lounge that goes on every night!!

The package was $55.00 per night extra but when you consider how much breakfast (which was more than a continental breakfast as far as we were concerned) and appetizers with 2 drinks each cost it was more than worth it.

We are not gamblers but the hotel offers so much more than just the casino. The pool area is very nice, large with lots of chaisses and good bar service.

Let me also tell you the red rooms are FABULOUS, very nicely appointed, clean, fairly large, with large flat screen TV, and the bathroom was huge and one of the nocest bathroom I have seen in a hotel. If you go to Paris it is a MUST to get the RED ROOM - and you can get it upgraded for free. I saw the normal rooms and they were crappy looking - avoid them. The locationof Paris as everyone has said is perfect with Bellagio and its beautiful water display right across the street and its a must to eat at the restaurant in front of Paris, Mon Ami Gabi, is an EXCELLENT restaurant with views of the fountains - sit outsside and enjoy. their buffet was also the best I have ever had and the prices are reasonable but you can eat excellent food and nice amiance... Paris casino is smaller than many of the other vegas casinos but I liked it a lot and I won big on the poker slots.

It's right near the Bellagio (and you can see the fountain shows from across the street), Bally's, Bill's, Caesar's, Harrah's, etc. The hotel also has some pretty good dining options - during our stay, we hit up the Cafe St. Louis for late-night take-out (eh), some fast food Italian place (pretty good), Mon Ami Gabi (good), Le Burger Brasserie (really good), Le Creperie (really good), and the Eiffel Tower Restaurant (good, but probably not worth the price - although the view of the Bellagio fountains is truly spectacular).

At check in we asked to make sure we had a room with a nice view. 30th floor, tower view and Bellaggio fountains. Gorgeous. Loved the I-pod dock to play our own music. Huge HD flat screen. Liked the his/hers armoires for our clothes. Plenty of hangers. Could have been a little cleaner; more attention to minute details (the windows had kid's hand prints on them). We liked the fact that the windows have a portal opening that vents fresh air and we could hear the street sounds and fountains. Non smoking room, which we wanted. Our experience of Vegas that \"non-moking\" doesn't mean you won't smell smoke. Our room was completely smoke free!! Pool area was very nice. Drinks were spendy at the pool. Good poolside service, however. 4 drinks came to $74.00. Ate dinner @ Mon Ami Gabi. The most spectacular steak ever! A little dark for my impaired vision. Great wine selection. Room did have a coffee maker, but it was missing a component so it wouldn't work. Did have continental room service and it was fast and delicious. We gambled at 4 casinos and I only one at the Paris. Pretty much every time I played slots I walked away in the positive. Also, casino drink service was great at the Paris, but we did tip well. We packed a couple of bottles of liquor from home so when we got there we had a bar all set up and we could have drinks in our room while getting ready to go out.

We chose not to take these, and stuck with our luxury two queen bed non-smoking room that we had requested.

Fortunately, the carpet and bathroom were clean and the furniture was still in pretty good shape. The only thing that really stuck out at me were some stains on the upholstered furniture. The bedding in a standard \"luxury\" room is firm and not pillow top. The linens were clean and the bedspread was a light down blanket wrapped with two fresh sheets. I prefer this approach to the standard old-fashioned bedspread since you feel things are recently laundered. The room had efficient daily maid service, but the maid took liberties that I would not have preferred, such as putting pajamas away in a suitcase (how did she know what suitcase they belonged to?). The mini bar was expensive, but the $4 water in it was a better value than the smaller $4 water in the gift shop (everything is expensive in Vegas). The best feature of this hotel is the location. It is centrally located on the strip and it is quick and easy to get out of your room, through the casino and out onto the strip (compared to other strip properties).

With that said, the view is worth the price of the upgrade. It overlooks the pool, eiffel tower and bellagio fountains. I assume some even face the new city center. I turned the sofa around to face the window and enjoyed many of the different fountain shows. You can even hear the music. That could be the one draw back though, the boom of the fountains and music is quite loud, but I enjoyed it. The rest of Paris is just okay. I like the atmosphere of the casino and ceiling, along with the street of shops etc. But the restaurant selection did not suit me. The service at the 24 hour cafe was sub-par. There was a 15 minute wait for a place that was about 10% full. The rest of the service was also slow, understaffed I guess. The food was not very good.

She checked for the next few days, but there were no P rooms on a higher floor available. I asked if the hotel was busy/full and she said they were at 98% capacity and had never gone below 85%.

Good sized bathroom with toilet, single sink, bath, large separate shower and hairdryer. Nice toiletries including mouth wash and a vanity kit. We really liked the room as it was spacious, well furnished and spotlessly clean. There is a note in the room saying you can use the middle shelf of the mini bar to store your personal items. This is unusual as most of the mini bars in Vegas are fully stocked with items on pressure pads and items are charged to your account if you remove them for more than a few seconds. There are loads of nice restaurants including Mon Ami Gabi which is a French Steakhouse with a patio area overlooking the Bellagio fountains. The Eiffel Tower restaurant is more expensive, but has fantastic views. There are also plenty more casual eating places. The casino is large and is beautiful inside.

Paris is definitely a \"second tier\" hotel, not nearly as nice as some of the others on the strip but the room was acceptable and clean. The other casino/hotel features are pretty depressing and have seen a lot of abuse. This place is tired. Location: Central strip across from the Bellagio. If you want to be on the strip, you couldn't ask for a better location.The elevators are not too far from the main entrance to the hotel, which allows for quick access to the strip and other amenities (which you're going to need, because the Paris is lacking a lot of the support functions that some of the other casino hotels have). Room: adequately sized, with a comfortable bed and a spacious bathroom. The furniture was cheaply made and some pieces showing wear, but everything worked (and the one lamp that didn't was fixed quickly and efficiently by hotel staff). View: most rooms at Paris do not face the strip, but we were happy to be looking out on the mountains beyond the city. Below us was the parking garage and air handlers, but who's really looking down anyway? The support areas (restaurants, shops, bars, casino) are where the Paris really seems to be lacking. The stores are all in-house stores (with annoying names like \"Le Journal\" and \"Le Tabac\") selling \"Parisian\" souvenirs. The main drag, or \"Boulevard\", is loud, crowded, dark, and dingy. The waitresses & cigarette girls wear cheap, tawdry bustiers which are ill-fitting, creating a trashy rather than sexy ambience. We went elsewhere for almost everything (drinks, spa treatment, snacks, dinner, shows, even breakfast). We did eat at \"Le Buffet\" once but found it to be more cheapo cafeteria style than nice. There were very few bars that didn't have gambling tv-screens built into them, and those that didn't were deafeningly loud. The one think I can say about Paris is that the service was friendly and efficient. Our check-in/check-out was quick, when we did have problems with the rooms they were dealt with pleasantly and quickly.

We could not get in becasue of an obvious shortage of staff. There was a long line to get in but due to the fact that they were letting in only \"Diamond Club\" members, our line never moved. Being Vegas we realize that \"high rollers\" get priority. No problem...However, with an additional staff at the reception desk, they could have served us regular people as well. Will NEVER go back to the Cafe St Louis. It worked to our advantage since the Mon Ami Gabi had a much better breakfast for about the same price. No waiting! Total Reward staff was excellent this time around. Very helpful and did not try to rush you. We attended a Tailgate Super Bowl party at the Le Burger Brasserie. Somewhat disapointing. Very expensive for what you got. 90$ each. For that amount there was an all you can eat buffet with tailgate like food, two Miller beers each and a Miller T shirt (we were led to believe that it would be a Super Bowl shirt.) It wasn't. We had also expected that the food would be the excellent food normally served by Le Burger, it wasn;t. The big TV screen was great, the servers friendly and all and all it was fun. Just overpriced for waht you got. Also the procedure for getting in was not handled well and there was a lot of complaining by those of us who had reservations but still had to stand in a long line. Even with these concerns, we do enjoy the Paris and will go again. We just won't over pay for a Super Bowl party again and will stay away ffrom the Cafe By the way, the staff in the Sports Book were GREAT!", "Date": "February 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "bolton", "Title": "\u201cexcellent\u201d", "Author": "jk020285", "ReviewID": "UR55884541", "Content": "this hotel was brilliant we had a free upgrade due to renewing our wedding vows we had requested adjoining rooms and they sorted it for us without any problems.

The floor looked like it had just been vacuumed (you could see the vacuum lines), the bed was freshly made and the furniture was not dusty.

We paid $120 (Fri, Sat) and $79 (Sun, Mon) and thought this was a good deal. * Lobby. The lobby is nicely appointed, but is oddly located in the center of the hotel where the shops and restaurants are - i.e. a very busy area! * Room. Our room was older and had not been remodeled (they offered one for $40 a night more); it was comfortable and was certainly adequate for the money we paid. * Bathroom. While clean, it is on the smallish side and was certainly in need of remodeling. There is only one sink with a small vanity (a lot like European bathrooms). The tub was slow to fill and the caulking needed some work. * Parking. As other have mentioned the parking situation is not good. The parking lot is in the back of the hotel and is accessible from the strip or from Audrie street. Accessing the parking lot from the strip can be a problem when the strip gets jammed with traffic and pedestrians (which it often does). So I recommend entering the lot from Audrie street which is easily accessible from Harmon (see the accompanying photo).

We walked over to the new Aria? complex nearby, impressive (in size) but not for us. Very cold, no interior plants and lots of white and silver. BOLD describes it best. I always appreciate living plants inside, it makes a huge statement. Bellagio does an exceptional job with plants more than anyone else. Unlike the other reviews, we did not notice the cigarette smoke too bad. Yes it is present, but not as bad as some other casinos. Harrah's seemed much worse on smoke, however, we loved the energy in the casino at Harrah's slightly better. Although, Paris' casino was smaller and easier to get around. Overall, very pleased, restaurants terrific too (for dinner, many closed for lunch except for burger, sandwich, buffet). A word of caution, however, buffet lines do get long for breakfast/lunch. If you want something reasonable with no line, try PF Chang's next door at Planet Hollywood.

I will say the restaurant Mon Ami Gabi was great and we ate in the Eiffel Tower restaurant on our last day and it was great also. The food at both places is worth going to Paris for. All in all, we had a great time in Vegas and Paris was part of that great time.

First off, our check-in didnt take so long, but we luckily beat a large line that formed after us. My friends and I requested adjoining rooms and they happily found us a pair. Location was best.....many casinos nearby to hop over to and its connected internally to bally's. I learned the gaming floor is smaller than most other casinos, but I liked it because we used it as our last gambling destination before bed anyway because the weather was frigid. Plus it was easy to navigate through and not overbearing like all the others. Theres a wonderful bakery for breakfast and I had room service food on the second night...a delicious turkey melt with enough fries to feed an army (and fair priced). All other food places inside were average to me. The rooms were very fair, not that visually stunning but more than adequate. Bathroom was pretty nice and had toiletries i needed. I also used the wonderful in-room safe to store my winnings. There was internet access but we didnt use it (not sure if its free). The tv supplies a lot of purchasable viewing stuff and amazingly 10 chinese channels (but we didnt order anything lol). The view was okay from our 22nd floor but it was pointed away from the strip, but I didnt mind too much. My only gripe was the beds (very uncomfortable) and lack of a microwave and normal empty fridge (they had the type where you touch something and get charged). There was also a convenient small store before the room elevators where i was able to buy a razor to finally shave my face and my friend bought pepto bismol LOL. All in all, paris is a great choice for a first timer....fun atmosphere, beautiful scene, and great location. Staff was also friendly (frontdesk, maids, dealers). I will probably stay at different hotels for all my future vegas trips, but thats because I want a different experience every time and to see what they all offer. Still, I'm glad paris was my first one and maybe one day I may come back to it.

We have travelled extensively around the world and do have high expectations when it comes to our accommodations. It was our first visit to Vegas and we generally had a great time. The hotel itself bills itself as a FIVE STAR property. In our opinion, four stars would be a stretch. Please look closely when you arrive. Even though the property is only 12 years old, many parts of it are in dire need of a makeover. The entry doors to the rooms desperately need to be repainted and we found numerous holes in the drywall in the room and the hotel corridors. The rooms are looking weathered as well. They really need to be re - wallpapered in spots. If you expect to be rated as a five star establishment, these little details need to be addressed. I am objective enough to say that you do not go to Vegas to stay in your room; however, if you charge $200 plus per night, these deficiencies need to be fixed. The location of Paris is its greatest asset. The spectacular Bellagio and its magnificent fountains are right across the street and Ceasar's Palace and The Venetian are 10 to 15 minutes walks from the property. We celebrated the New Year at the Eiffel Tower restaurant. It was an excellent ( and very expensive ) meal and the subsequent fireworks show at midnight was awesome. We were lucky to see the Black Eyed Peas at Mandalay Bay and they put on a great show. We also caught a production of Zumanity ( Cirque de Soleil ) at New York New York. Once again, the show was outstanding and if you are there without kids, this show is an excellent choice. The absolute highlight of the trip was our helicopter tour to the Grand Canyon. We used Sundance Helicopters and their service was top notch. The helicopters themselves have little room but the pilot was very good. Let's just say the scenery is jaw droppingly beautiful - Mother Nature at her finest!!! Try the basin landing for champagne lunch; it was worth the extra $ to actually walk around the basin floor and marvel at the sheer size of the walls. Overall, our trip to Vegas was very good.

She didn't tell us which category of room it was, so I was excited to see what we ended up with. We took the elevator to the 26th floor, and was quite happy when I saw the room.

Room was fine, nothing special and no complaints. The lines for the buffet were ridiculously long and while we wanted to try it, we were not willing to spend the time in line. On our last day we saw at 8:00 am there was no line so we tried it for breakfast. Maybe it was just the fact that it was breakfast but I seriously cannot see why people would line up for hours for that buffet. It was good but equal to any other buffet in Vegas (and we have tried many!!). You must try Le Burger - a wonderful little cafe with great food and unbelievably great wait staff!! We were very pleasantly surprised - one of our favorite meals and all staff smiling and friendly and made the trip enjoyable. Yes, we swam! It was chilly but the sun was out, the water was around 72 and we got in the hot tub first to not feel so chilled. The lifeguards were probably not happy about having to leave their little enclosed area to freeze in a chair but they were always good sports. There were very few people attempting the hot tub so had it to ourselves one day - it was very nice, so glad it was open (but closes at 4:00 and only one of two hot tubs open) This was our seventh different hotel in Vegas and it ranks right at the top. I would definitely stay there again, especially at the price ($75 Saturday night, $55 others). It was easy to get around in the hotel and I never got lost (unlike staying at MGM). You were always offered a drink in the casino, all staff were very friendly - we even had a note of thanks from our housekeeper for the modest tip we left! As stated before - location cannot be beat and now with the tram open from Bellagio to Monte Carlo it is quite easy to get to the far end of the strip.

We had to make several trips to the front desk to explain that our package was purchased through the chapel and that we indeed have credit to our room included with this package.

The casino is very beautiful but very spread out. It's a long trip from the parking garage to the front desk and back to the rooms with a full load of luggage. The staff is very courteous and the bartenders are flawless, however the wait staff and front desk needs completely cleared out and restaffed. My wife was forced to come down to the front desk in her wedding gown when my room key de-magnetized because we didn't use my credit card on the package reservations.

The casino area feels very dark, as the theme is Parisien/French and the lighting is very low, and the casino was not that busy. Preferred the atmosphere you get down Fremont street area, have a look at the Golden Nugget, great casino. Maybe that was because I won there, though. The trip up the Eiffel tower is fantastic, go just before dusk, by the time you get up there the light will be changing, but you go up there for the day time price.

We have been to Vegas a number of times and stayed in the Luxor, Wynn, Excalibur and friends in the New York New York and Encore. This trip we wanted to stay somewhere in the centre of the strip within walking distance to shops etc we had visited Paris on our last trip and loved it. (More the girls on the trip than the guys) We were drawn in by the beautiful chandillers and ceilings within the lobby and casino and were told the breakfast buffet was amazing We booked this trip and got a good deal on ebookers. We wanted our trip to Vegas to be all fun for 5 days, we enjoy the nightlife, drinking, eating out, sitting by the pool, shopping, buffets, my husband likes to play the tables. Checking in was fast and no problems, staff were friendly but nothing special, they didnt go out of there way to make you feel special like other hotels have. Our room in Paris was just ok the decor is old and its just ok. It was a bit dark and dingy, the bathroom was nice. The casino didnt seem to have much of an athmosphere, we like a vibrant feel with lots going on, the people in there seem a little older and it was just lacking that Vegas fun feeling. We were there for Haloween and there was not much party effort made and there were not many people dressed up (well not like us anyway) We played slots for hours and there seemed to be only 2 people in the while casino serving drinks, we had to wait an hour atelast for one drink and the women that came round were rude. The buffet was also disappointing although they had lots of sweet pastries etc there was not as much choice as in others. The pool was basic and sold out of food when we went to get a sandwhich - this I didnt understand as it is a big hotel, surely they could have got bread and filling from another part of the hotel! We ended up spending most of our time in Ballys as we wanted to stay local and that had a better atmosphere. We still had an amazing trip as you cant not in Vegas. Other friends were staying in the Encore and when we went to visit them it was like another league and the price they paid was not that much more. Once we had met them we actually upgraded to a suite in the Paris as we realised what difference the room meant, the suite was lovely and made a difference but it was much more and the bed was so comfy. I think the fact that we have stayed in other hotels made us more disappointed with Paris, you may not think so if it was your first stay in Vegas. My advise to anyone who is young and wants to enjoy the nightlife and have a scream in Vegas is not to stay in the Paris! It is a beautiful hotel to visit and if you want more of a relaxing experience, definately go for lunch or for a look round. I dont think it was the hotel that was the problem it just wasnt right for us. Most of the reviews are really positive on here which is part of the reason we booked but I just wanted to make people aware that it is not for everyone.

My fiance and I are planning on making Vegas a yearly trip for us. Last year we stayed at Harrah's and after walking in every casino on the strip we knew that Paris was our next destination! The only complaint that I have was when reserving the room I indicated we would checking in around 10pm. Our flight was delayed and we did not get to Paris until around 10:45pm. When checking in we found out that they were still cleaning our room and it wouldn\u2019t be ready until around 11:30pm. We grabbed a drink at the bar and waited to go back and pick up our room keys. When we went to pick up our keys we politely asked if there was anything they could do to compensate us for the inconvenience of our room not being ready (a credit, meal voucher etc). She said very rudely that I could ask the manager but she assured me that there was nothing he would do for us. We weren't the only ones that this happened to and that when we first went to check in we insisted on a room with a king bed and non-smoking. Those words never came out of my mouth however that was what I indicated on our online reservation. She proceeded to say that they could have given us a double bed smoking room but they wanted to accommodate us. We asked what the point of having a reservation request was if they didn't want to follow it. We asked for the manager and she came back 10 minutes later with an even bigger attitude saying that he was too busy and that we could check back tomorrow if we wanted to speak with him. Other than that our stay was amazing. The room was very nice and they cleaned it daily, I was a little surprised that the TV\u2019s in the room have not been updated to flat screens. The casino in itself was well kept and the staff was friendly. We ate dinner at the Eiffel Tower restaurant which had a great view and romantic atmosphere, the food was delicious. We were able to lay out by the pool in the morning and afternoons. We had friends that also came along and stayed at Bally\u2019s. The good thing about this was there was a walkway in between the two hotels that connected them. This made it very convenient to go back and forth. The only other down fall is if you are into sports betting their sports center is not the greatest. The TV's are outdated and there is really only space for those who are betting on horse races, it's not really a lounge to hang out and watch the games.

It was lovely and romantic. The food in the restaurants was delicious. It was a little pricey, but not too high. They have a lovely restaurant that you take an elevator upstairs and it overlooks the fountains of Bellagio and another one where you can eat outside on the porch on the Las Vegas strip. The Paris Las Vegas hotel is made up like a movie set of Paris, France with a ceiling painted light blue with white clouds like a daytime sky. It's beautiful and great for a romantic stay. We arrived on a Wed at 10:15PM and had no wait time to check in. We checked out at the front desk on Mon at 10:45AM and had no wait time. I've read other reviews where people had to wait, but I guess we came at a good time. You can go up in the Eiffel Tower for $10 per person and take pictures. If you want internet in your room, it is $15 per day. If you want a refrigerator, it is also $15 per day. We had a mini bar in our room that was refrigerated and had a small amount of space for food if you have left-overs from the restaurant. There is no charge for the mini bar unless you take something out of it. From the ad, I thought all the rooms had whirlpool bathtubs, but they don't. Our tub was separate from our shower, but the tub was not a whirlpool. The whirlpool tub was a $50 per day upcharge, so we didn't get one. The Paris is centrally located on the strip (across from Bellagio), which is a bonus because you do so much walking in Las Vegas. Paris is a little fancier and pricier than Bally's, Harrah's or Imperial Palace, but it's not as pricey as Venetian or Bellagio. We stayed 5 nights at Paris and 1 night at Imperial Palace. Imperial Palace is not fancy, it's just basic. Our TV picture was fuzzy at Imperial Palace and we had plastic glasses. I have champagne taste on a beer budget, so the Paris suited me. We paid $470 for 5 nights at Paris before tax. I would stay there again because it's nice, clean and pretty and not as expensive as Bellagio or Venetian. There is nothing wrong with staying at the cheaper hotels in Vegas if that's all you can afford, but if you can afford Paris Las Vegas, I recommend it. If you can only afford a cheaper hotel, I would stay in Bally's, Harrah's or Imperial Palace. I wouldn't stay at Hooter's because their casino is ugly and they are too far away from the center of the strip. I also wouldn't stay at Circus Circus or Stratosphere because they are too far from the center of the strip. If you stay at Hooters, Circus Circus or Stratosphere, you will spend too much in taxi fares in my opinion. I usually try to stay toward the center of the strip for convenience sake. Paris is a nice hotel and I would stay there again. I highly recommend the \"O\" Watershow at Bellagio. Also, make sure your suitcase doesn't weigh more than 50 lbs or you will get an overweight bag fee if you are flying. Carry-on bags are limited to 40 lbs and certain size and liquid limitations. Bring tennis shoes because you will walk, walk, walk. You can print your return boarding passes at the business traveler's center in Paris.

However..the room itself was large and very clean, the beds were extremely comfortable and the there was no noise from other rooms or outside. Very peaceful! The amenities in the hotel were varied and although smaller than some of the other popular hotels on the Strip there was enough variation to suit most tastes.A visit to the Eiffel restaurant is well worth it for the fantastic view of the neon Strip butalso the romantic ambience. One disappointing experience was on our last night. We went for a drink in Le Central (the lobby bar) and my husband (age 36) was asked for I.D, something we had become used too when we have been in the States.

We were originally supposed to stay at the Wynn, but our arrangements were made by corporate folks who probably didn't know the difference between some of the Hotel/Casinos on the strip...big mistake. This hotel, like many others on the strip, has taken its theme of \"classical French decor\" and turned it into a horrible parody of itself. Everything about this place was gauche. Check in was marred by the fact that no King bed was available, despite a request weeks earlier. An indifferent shoulder shrug was our consolation for this inconvenience. The check in folks were clearly immersed in their roles as annoyed French locals and didn't break character the entire stay. Amazing! The room is on par with the finest 2 star hotels in rural Arkansas....dirty, small, poorly furnished and dim. The beds are an absolute joke with awful linens, mattress that rivals my pullout couch at home, pillows that smelled oddly like eggs. The shower water pressure is like an 80 year male with end stage prostate enlargement. No coffee machines, electronic amenities are circa 1986....old TV kept switching off every 20 minutes for no reason, limited stations, Wifi? Mais non, there is nothing remotely business worthy of a hotel that is supposed to cater to the conventioneer or business person! Room service took over an hour for a simple breakfast order and I think I saw plates lying in the hallway for two days before they were collected off the dingy carpet. Did I mention the carpet looked like floral and paisly threw up on each other? Mmmm, this place just keeps getting more French every minute! The only restaurant we visited was Mon Ami Gabi, which was actually very good! Eat outside on the patio for a great view of the Bellagio, where you will invariably want to stay after this place leaves its stain on you. Otherwise food and drink are predictably overpriced, and the cocktails were incredibly weak....much more so than any other casino we visited. Stick to beer and wine and you'll be fine. I am not much of a gambler, so I can't really comment on the experience...suffice it to say that if you are not a smoker, you will not like walking around this place. Paris is ventilated like hermetically sealed tupperware....even for an occasional smoker like myself, my eyes and lungs burned like a raging UTI all weekend. The only, and I mean ONLY thing this place has going for it is the location. Centrally located along the strip, I spent most of my time in other hotels and casinos that far surpassed the Paris experience. Of course, that would have meant paying a bit more, but this place is an absolute joke. If you have any travel experience whatsoever, you'll know that this is a Howard Johnson with cheap \"French-like\" amenities, substandard cleanliness and spotty service From what we saw, I'd really recommend the Venetian, Bellagio, or Wynn.

I would highly reccomend the lunch buffet at the bellagio, it was excellent and a really great value. the pool wasnt the best...it was overcrowded and not that big. the location is excellent, you are in the middle of everything. there were no nightclubs or lounges open at the time we were there, so we went to the bellagio and caesar's at night.

We knew things were not going well as we approached the room. There were holes kicked in the wall in at least three places and the whole floor seemed kind of shabby. The room was non-smoking, but only if you believe that non-smoking means \"no one has smoked in this room during the last 20 minutes.\" Complained, but was told no other rooms were available. This room was along the lines of a 2.5 star room. Thin towels, older furniture, no coffee maker, smallish. Certainly not worth paying more than $50 per night. There was a refrigerator, but it was stocked with overpriced booze and munchies and set to automatically charge you if you moved anything. After complaining again the next day, we were upgraded to a mini-suite for the remainder of our stay. Better, but still not great. The room was quite large and had a sofa, chair and wet bar with a usable refrigerator. There was a separate corridor leading on one end to a large walk-in closet with a lighted make-up table. At the other end was an oversize bathroom with a separate shower and jaccuzzi bath and a separate toilet room. This time, there was an in-room coffee set-up. The carpeting in the room was tired. This room still had the same thin towels, no bathrobes, and neither room had a 21st century TV. There was some serious nickle-and-diming. Want to use the gym (above average, but nothing great), $25 per person, per day. Want internet access, another $15 daily gouge. Had room service twice. It was overpriced, but decent. Expect 1.5 hour delays on breakfast unless you order the night before. The breakfast buffet downstairs, however, is great value at $15 per head. There is a vast selection, including omelet, crepe and belgian waffle stations. We ate there twice. Ate at the steakhouse. Again, overpriced for what you got. There are far better steakhouses in this town. We also had a meal at the burger-oriented sports bar, which was fairly priced an had great service from happy, friendly servers. One major disappointment was the Louis Cafe, where my wife was ignored for half an hour, which was probably the high point of her dining experience. Thereafter she was treated to shabby service, cold food, and a watery drink. As a tip, she wrote on the check, \"AWFUL DINING EXPERIENCE!\" Hope they get the message. All-in-all, Paris was a poor choice for a convention hotel. Judging it from the point of view of a casino hotel, it was just OK.

It's a large hotel but has a more intimate feel than some of the other large casino hotels, and a guest is least likely to get lost. Check-in formalities was handled at the Diamond check-in room as I was a conference attendee. The elevators are close to check-in, which is nice. The regular check-in area wasn't too busy early in the morning but developed a queue after 12 pm. The room is comfortable, large and nicely appointed but not luxurious as a 5 star but is a solid 4 star, which is what most publications rate this hotel. The room I stayed in showed a little bit of wear and tear on the lounge chairs and the desk area but overall it was above average. The view from my room was towards the Bally Hotel, so it was nothing to brag about, and the windows were actually quite filthy with dust. It made looking out the window rather painful. The bed was comfortable for me and I had no problems with the bedding or pillows. I thought that the wall between the bedroom and the bathroom should have had a picture or something to break up the starkness of that particular wall. The lighting in the room was adequate for leisure and taking care of business work. The television was the standard issue that one finds in most 3 star properties; a flat screen would have been a nice upgrade to the room. The closet space is contained in the television armoir cabinet. It wasn't my favorite arrangement as I prefer a separate closet, but was efficient I suppose. There was the standard ironing board and iron. There was an in-room refreshment bar if you get the hungries. Also, 24 room service is available. I thought the prices were fair for room service at a Las Vegas hotel. The bathroom was solid 4 star, lined with marble, with a separate bathtub and shower enclosure. What the bathroom could have used was a little more light, especially in the shower enclosure, where it was rather dark and hard to see. Water pressure is very low with a water saver shower head so don't expect taking long, luxurious hot showers; drought plagues much of the US Southwest. A nice bath would probably be the better choice if you have the time to fill up the tub. The bathroom toiletries such as shampoo and conditioner have a very pleasant smell that works well for women but maybe a little to flowerly for men. I found it to be so mild that I doubt it would be an issue for men. The airconditioning system was easy to use and worked well, and was very quiet. The rooms in general were quiet with no noise intrusion from my next door neighbors. Being on a non-smoking floor, I didn't have to worry about obnoxious odors creeping into the room from under the door or the a/c system. I ate at the Eiffel Tower and Le Artiste Steakhouse. Both had very-well prepared foods but the Steakhouse opens up to the casino so smoke was somewhat of an issue for me. The Eiffel Tower Restaurant was excellent, and I would patronize this venue for dinner on my next trip. I love the buffet at the Paris. Granted, it's a hotel buffet so the quality of the food dips a notch below plated service because of the mass quantity preparation and the standtime in the steam trays. Still, the overall quality is very good and the variety of foods from various parts of France make this an adventure for those who like to try something non-conventional versus the typical Las Vegas buffet offerings. The public areas are reminiscent of Paris, which really appeals to me. It may be too \"Disneyesque\" for many but I think it's well thought out and easy to understand. Most of the hotel casinos in Las Vegas are rather gimmicky anyways. The casino and main walkway through the hotel casino is a little easier to navigate due to one main walkway from the front of the hotel to the back. Walking distances at this hotel are minimal if you want to get down to the action of the first floor or if you're the type to get out of the hotel and explore other places along the Strip. In fact, the central location of the Paris makes it easy to walk most other casino properties in 15 minutes or less.

It's a nice hotel, I'd say it's on par with MGM, but not quite to Bellagio or Venetian standards. My only problem was with the bedding. The mattresses were bouncy and you could practically feel the springs, the sheets were the roughest I've ever had in a nice hotel, and the pillows were lumpy and awful. The feather pillows, you could feel the feathers poking out, so I had housekeeping bring some foam, and they were incredibly lumpy. Very disappointing as the rest of the hotel was fine. The friends I was traveling with mentioned this, as well, and they are not as picky as I am. The room was big, the bathroom was pretty with a separate marble shower. Everything was very clean, and I am a picky traveler. The blow dryer was a \"real\" dryer, not the usual hotel \"breath\" dryer. The pool was nice, although too cold to really enjoy in October. I guess it's a seasonal thing, but the pool didn't open until 10a. Even though it was chilly in the mornings, I still would have liked to have my mornings there. There were only a couple of waitpeople working the pool, even though it was a holiday weekend and got pretty crowded in the afternoons. The shops in the hotel are nice, plenty of choices for snacks and dining, and it's small enough to get around easily. The location, in between Ballys and Planet Hollywood, is not great, in my opinion, as neither of those hotels interest me. It's not too hard to get to Bellagio and the Caesar's complex, though.

The hotel is beautiful and very well-done, but the best part is its location on the strip. It is very central and you do so much walking in Vegas that this kind of a location is at a premium. Also, the hotel itself is not too big and it is easy to navigate. We used the pool both days and rented a cabana. The pool is large and never seemed the least bit croweded. The cabanas were great, but a bit more expensive than those I've rented at other properties. If you have 6 people or so, then it is totally worth it. I had a massage at the Mandara spa. The therapist was wonderful. DH used the steamroom on the men's side and thoroughly enjoyed it. Overall the service and amenities were great. The staff was friendly and very accomodating. We were in 1034 (premier) and had a great view of the Eiffel tower and some Bellagio fountain views. The sheets on the bed could have used upgrading. They just weren't smooth and soft. The shower felt like a sprinkle, but what can you do???? The room was clean and nice, otherwise. We didn't eat at the buffet, but we did try Ah Sin (just okay) Mon Ami Gabi (very nice) and the pastries place for breakfast was wonderful. Also, our friends had the concierge room added to their plan so I tried that once or twice. I think it is worth the upgrade. You can easily get your $40 worth if you at 2 people and have breakfast their and take advantage of the free drinks (incl. alcohol.) BTW: I didn't gamble here. Instead we went to Bills, 2 doors down.

The room was generally clean, with the exception of mold clinging to the grout in the shower. The design and size of the room was adequate, (even if they had to stuff two queen size beds into it), however, why do the beds have to be situated so close to the walls that you have to climb over the bed to turn on or off the lights mounted on the wall next to them. In addition, in a city that depends on it's convention business, why can't there be at least one wall plug situated near the desk in the room in order to plug in a computer.

However, this most recent stay at Paris Las Vegas, was a little disappointing. Before our arrival we called to confirm our reservation and to inform of our arrival time, we upgraded our room to the Premier Room with a view of the pool and the water show at the Bellagio, across the street, as well as, the Eiffel Tower (a $55 a night upgrade). When we arrived to our room, we had noticed the room with a view had to have the dirtiest windows, looked as though the windows had a film/water spots, etc. (very cloudy), not very appealing for the room with a view. We had also noticed clutter from the previous visitors on the floor, which was left throughout our entire three-night stay. In addition, two of the four light bulbs were burned out in the bathroom, again all three nights, as well as, plumbing problems with the toilet (We called for maintenance, it took an hour to show up).

We decide to take the lounge access upgrade since it sounded like a decent deal ($60 per night for breakfast and drinks / food at night). We checked in late (11 pm) on Thursday. Somewhat surprisingly there was no king room available (had requested), but were told we could switch on Friday. The check in lady was useless. Her main purpose was to try to up sell -- She did not tell us anything about the hotel (elevators, lounge location, what the hotel charge slips were). The room we had overlooked the pool and was dated. The windows were in a major need for cleaning and the entire room had seen better days \u2013 the alarm clock was broken, hair dryer was useless, TV was old and not good, etc. On Friday morning we went to the lounge for breakfast, after calling the front desk to find out where it was (our keys did not work, but the rep in the lounge fixed them). The breakfast options were very basic (fruit, cereal, bagels, coffee, OJ) \u2013 no hot items. We left and went to the front desk to change rooms \u2013 the rep was helpful and arranged the change. We also told them we did not want the lounge access anymore and she made it clear that we would also lose our upgraded view \u2013 we did not have a problem. We could keep the old room until we received a message to change rooms (around 3pm). Later in the day we returned to the room and no message light \u2013 around 3 I check and found we had a message (the phone light was broken) to change our room (the room was ready 10 minutes after we were at the front desk (makes me wonder of it was available the night before).

This was our first time in Las Vegas. First, the Paris: We arrived at the Paris at 3:45pm and waited in the check in line for 20 minutes. Farida, who checked us in, was EXCELLENT! We got the room we requested (Luxury) on a non-smoking floor. Farida was very personable and friendly and the person you want to be greeted by after a long day of traveling. The reason for the long check in line was 1300 conventioners checking in that day. Farida asked if we would be using the mini-bar and said no. We had no problems with any unauthorized charges for the mini-bar on our credit card. Remember: this is not a fridge for your personal use so if you buy any beverage at a store, go to the ice machine on your floor to keep your drinks cold. The Paris was a very clean hotel, from the lobby to our room (#1693), to the restaurants. We don\u2019t gamble so we did not spend any time in the casino. The hotel is located mid-Strip which makes is accessible to many hotels close by (Bellagio is across the street; Ceasar\u2019s Palace just down the road; Flamingo across the street; Planet Hollywood is next door). The monorail is great for traveling to the hotels further afield (such as The Venetian, the Sahara). It runs from Ballys which is connected to the Paris. The cost is $5 for one single trip; $13 for a full day pass; $30 for a 3-day pass (they sometimes have discounts on these prices). We ate at Le Village Buffet on the first night for dinner and the food and variety were excellent. We only ate there once as we do not eat a lot food to get our money\u2019s worth at buffets. We ate twice at Mon Ami Gabi \u2013 lunch and dinner. We were lucky to be able to get a table outside on the Strip watching the people and the Bellagio fountains. The food at both sittings was very good. We had breakfast at Le Caf\u00e9 each morning as we only have cereal or toast and tea. We had dinner there once and had a bad meal \u2013 bad as in they advertised one thing but brought something different. Sent it back and ordered something else but the dinner was spoiled because of that and the waiter\u2019s attitude didn\u2019t help either (he was the only person at the Paris that was rude). Check out was a breeze. We checked our account on the tv each day to ensure there were no charges on the card. You can check out on the tv between 7:00am and 3:00pm (I think I got that right). Attractions: 1) Bellagio Fountains: they were great, a must see especially at night. We went to see the botanical gardens at the Bellagio but it was being torn down that day as they were changing from their summer display to the autumn display. 2) Secret Garden & Dolphin Encounter (The Mirage) \u2013 the Secret Garden holds lions, white tigers, a black panther, and a 10 month old leopard. The Dolphin Encounter does not provide a dolphin performance \u2013 it\u2019s a research and training facility and you can watch the trainers with the dolphins. 3) The Venetian Hotel: you must go and see the lobby and look at their ceiling \u2013 magnificent! We took the gondola ride ($16 per person for about 15 minutes) and enjoyed the experience. We had dinner one night at Canelletos \u2013 excellent food. We ate outside (actually inside but it looks like you are eating outside with the ceiling painted as the sky as you will see in some of the hotels) and we were entertained by singers. Shows: We went to the Terry Fator and his Cast of Thousands show at The Mirage. What a laugh! He and his puppets were hilarious. A must see! The only bad experience in Las Vegas was the people standing on the street flicking cards constantly and trying to give them to you as you walk by them \u2013 these cards are promoting girls and sex. I\u2019ve been told (whether true or not) that the city can\u2019t get rid of them as they have claimed \u201crestraint of trade\u201d. The cards are thrown on the ground and left there dirtying the street. I say make them pick them up.

Walgreens and CVS is just 3 blocks south of the Paris (they are very large blocks), it's the best destination to stock up on bottled water and accessories. The Miracle Mile adjacent to Planet Hollywood has an ABC store which is affordable as well. Try to stay away from the hotel gift shops for water if you don't mind a 5-10 minute walk. My wife wanted to shop at the Premium outlets near downtown/ Fremont street. Rather than renting the most basic car for at least $50/day, we took a cab which was about $20 each way to the outlet. We later found out the some of The Deuce's routes, the double decker bus that runs up and down the strip, also goes up to Fremont street. For only $7 for a 24 hour pass, this is the way to go. If you work out, the gym in the hotel will cost you ~$20 a day (forgot the exact price); internet access within the room will cost you about $15. They'll get you for everything. Overall, we would stay at the Paris again; but I do wonder, what are the other hotels like?", "Date": "September 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Coal Township PA", "Title": "\u201cJust Okay\u201d", "Author": "sb1967", "ReviewID": "UR41950071", "Content": "First we did have to wait in line to check in but not long.

We have been 5 times and stay at different hotels every time. We are always greeted with a smile and friendly front desk staff. Not at Paris. We arrived on a Wednesday before Labour day long weekend. It wasn't busy, yet. When we were called up to the front desk, it felt like I was back at the airport waiting to go through security. Jenny, the desk agent bellowes out \"Next\" We were excited to be there and was expecting the typical warm greetings, but she had nothing to say to us besides the least she could to get us on our way. I requested a king bed and a strip view when we booked over a month prior. We were told they offer this and that the request is put in. When I asked Jenny, she simply says not available. The strip view can be purchased at an additional $55. I think this should have been told to us when we called last month. Call me crazy, but any time I have stayed somewhere if you request a king bed, you get a king bed. It's like requesting a non smoking room and getting to stay in an ashtray. Anyway, I had to ASK Jenny how to get to our rooms, so I wasn't about to ask her any other questions, since most agents will politely point out on a map where to go. She obviously isn't a people person (good place for her to work). We got to our rooms and had 2 queen's not a King. We were told we could switch in the morning. Super....not! We also requested a late check out for Sunday at 5:00 for a fee of $100. We were told this wasn't a problem. Well being a long weekend, we called the day of, and were told absolutely not. The hotel was 100% capacity and there is nothing they can do. At this point, we were mad. There were lots of other things leading up to this, such as a rude hostess at the cafe, my wife not getting a drink in the casino that she ordered at least a half hour prior, no coffee and half the draught beer out in Napoleons lounge, etc, etc. Mostly little things, but they add up when positive ones don't start happenning. One would think in a time of a recession, a business would extend a warm hand to want guests to return, as we all feel the pinch. Paris must want to extend the pinch to their guests as well. I phoned to speak to management. After being on hold for several minutes, I was hung up on. Finally I got through to Nikki. She was the only staff member who made this trip worthwhile. She deserves a raise as she was friendly, accomodating and relaxed. I was only on the phone with her for 3 minutes starting to describe the stay, and she let us stay in our room until 6:00 for no extra charge. We will not be staying at Paris again.

However this hotel is NOT gay at all...not to say they are anti-gay or anything like that but there is zero evidence that they are gay-friendly in their signage, events, or anywhere. So we kinda felt dissapointed in that respect but despite this, we thought the hotel was AWESOME. The location is centre strip with so much going on to the north and the south that you really get the true Vegas experience. The rooms were clean and the housekeeping staff (in fact all staff) were very friendly and the service was consistently good. Our room was the basic room on the 20th floor and the view was non-existent (we were looking out on a building rooftop) but you don't come to Vegas to stay in the room all day. I would say that this hotel is better for couples and older adult groups because the vibe is very different then some of the more well-known gambling hotels like Ceasar's or Bellagio. The Paris Casino is quite ordinary and not that engaging and small compared to other places. We found that we only used the hotel casino for when we were waiting on dinner reservations, killing some time, or when you get that \"i gotta bet some money\" urge at 3am. If having an awesome casino in your hotel lobby is important to you then stay someplace else. The pool is on the 3rd floor but is outdoors. Large area with lots of chairs and clean. The FOOD is DELISH! We ate at the Village Buffet which to be quite honest was the BEST buffet we ever had. High quality food and well-prepared--highly recommended. We also ate at the hotel cafes and ordered room service and everything was delicious! However the prices are higher then maybe 3 star hotels which is why I'm assuming there were few children/families staying there. I wish they had a like a fast food court or something in the lobby like other hotels like New York New York because sometimes you don't want to spend $10 on a danish and coffee. I would highly recommend this hotel if you are looking for the Paris feeling (maybe you prefer sightseeing or shows instead of gambling), good food, centre strip at a good price (ie not Bellagio) and enjoy a laid back vibe.

Was offered to upgrade to a suite for an additional $70 a night, declined as $210 would have been about 1/3 of the entire trip cost, including airfare. Our room was 852 and was one of the \"older\" rooms. It was in good condition and clean, the only issue was the wallpaper slightly peeling in one corner of the bathroom, the bed was comfortable and the sheets were clean. The room view was to the southeast and over looked one of the Bally's buildings, not much to look at but I wasn't there to look out a window. As far as food goes I would recommend JJ Boulangerie's, very good deli style sandwiches and decent pizza as well. Le Burger Brasserie was very good as well. We ate at Mon Ami Gabi for breakfast, it was $30 for two, but was very, very good. We never tried to buffet or Cafe Ile St. Louis, lines to both were always very long, the buffet hasn't received kind reviews here, and at $25 a head we passed. The dualing piano bar was very fun and entertaining, get there early as seats go fast, buy one get one beers from 4-7 or so I think. Went to see Anthony Cools the hypnotist, highly recommended, very, very funny, also very adult so don't bring kids, or if you don't enjoy adult/filthy humor. As you may know booze is very expensive in Vegas, we had our cabbie stop at the 7/11 behind Paris and grabbed some beer there, there are constantly people bringing in cases of beer so dont feel like you will stand out, either way north or south down the strip there are a few liquor stores as well, although pretty far in each direction. Went to the pool one day, was very nice, and big, right under the tower which was neat. This place has a great location, right across from Bellagio, I have a few recommendations if you venture out, House of Blues at Mandalay had a great lunch, FIX at Bellagio has the best wings ever, no kidding. Margaritaville was pretty good as well, the line was long but moved very fast.

Once we got the the hotel (7:30 PM), there were only a couple people in the check out line, took less than 10 mins. I got to the counter and asked if they had a complementary room upgrade available. The man was quick to give me a free upgrade to a Red Room (27th floor). It had a great view with a side view of the strip. It was amazing, HUGE TV, beautiful bathroom (shower and tub), a coffee pot, hairdryer, iron and board, and the MOST comfortable bed I have EVER slept on. The only thing I didn't like about the room is that there was no mirrors outside of the bathroom, and the sink was not separate from the shower/toilet. (Although there were 3 mirrors in the bathroom.) Maid service was wonderful. The Providential restaurant in Paris is wonderful!! Tons of bread and delicious Lobster Bisque. The Le Village Bufftet was wonderful. (make sure you ask the front desk for a coupon book, there is a $5 off per person) Also, take advantage of the 1/2 Price ticket place. We got 2 tickets for Criss Angel, 2 for V- Variety show, and 2 buffets and 1 other meal. We saved a TON of money. From Paris, go to Bill's Gambling Hall the day of the show (some shows you can even buy ahead of time). Paris is a pretty calm hotel. There is a nice casino, but not what I would call a \"gamblers\" casino. If you are going to Vegas to stay in your hotel and gamble, I would not recommend Paris. If you are going to see different places, sight see, have a wonderful vacation, and eat great food, Paris is the place for you! The location is PERFECT! In the middle of the strip, really close to Planet Hollywood, Bally's, Flamingo, Bill's, Bellagio, and Caesar's Palace. There is a nice casino bar that we had drinks at every night.

Paris was a great deal for $69. It has a perfect location on center strip across from the Bellagio and Caesars Palace. Parking was easy enough with a large garage that was attached to the hotel. There is quite a bit of walking involved though from the parking garage though and dragging your luggage through the shops and casino just to get to the desk is a work out. The lobby is beautiful and check in was fairly easy even though there was a long line. The lady that checked us in was nice but a little preoccupied in closing out her shift. We had room 2087 on the 20th floor but had a view looking straight into rooms at Bally's. Elevators are quick and the hallways are quiet. The room was a decent size with some nice furniture, calm colors, large windows, and even a fully stocked mini bar, though quiet pricey. The bathroom was beautiful with it's separate shower and nice vanity. Quite large too. Wireless Internet costs $15 for 24 hours so I ended up bypassing that for the evening. The beds are comfortable but are not as comfortable as a pillow-top. Just a personal preference. The casino area is nice and has lots of great restaurants surrounding it and in she shopping area. Beautiful architecture adds to a nice ambiance. We only ate at one restaurant in Paris as it was the most economical for both breakfast and dinner; Ile St. Louis Cafe. Just like any restaurant in Vegas, quite pricey. $4.50 for a glass of orange juice? Though the prices for food in Vegas is rediculous, quality is never an issue. Very good food! The buffet always had a LONG line each time we walked by so we did not get to try it. As for shops, there are some interesting shops and neat bakeries, all with a neat French theme. The pool is on the third floor and has a great view of the strip. The pool is just a basic round pool with lots of seating. There are two nice hot tubs set in a garden area and plenty of towels are available. There's even food by the pool. I did get a chance to go up the Eiffel Tower for a beautiful view, but the weight was an hour and a half. I spent the extra $10 for the express option which gets you right up. Well worth it instead of waiting in line. Beautiful view!! Overall a great stay for the price though the food prices are horrible. Great location adds to the appeal for any Vegas traveler.

The person at the hotel desk made it out that I was given the correct room and I had to explain to her that there was a mistake made by the hotel since my booking was for a twin share. Luckily that problem was solved! The second glitch pretty much tainted my view of the hotel. As noted by a previous reviewer, he/she also encountered the same problem as me, in which they were erroneously charged for the use of the mini-bar. Prior to checking-out, I noted from the TV check-out screen that I was charged for the use of the mini-bar that I didn't even use. The hotel staff explained that there was a misundertstanding for the charge since I had used the mini-bar to store my own beverages!

There was a large mirrior on the bathroom wall that was very helpfull in getting ready to go out for a night on the town. There was a sitting area next to the good sized closet for doing make up or placing your lap top on. I was very happy with the suite. When you walked through the casino you felt as if you were out doors in a little town with blue skys, shops, reasturants, and the bottom of the eiffel tower showing through from the roof.

So if you don't feel like walking through cigarette smoke while you shop and eat (but don't want a hotel that's so big you get lost) this is the place. It's a beautifully quaint hotel; rooms are a nice size with a sitting area, marble bathroom, separate shower and tub. We had a basic room and were very happy with it. Look for deals by going mid-week; it's much cheaper than weekends. In the morning the breakfast croissant is delicious, then get to the buffet before 3:30 for lunch pricing. This buffet is less expensive than many of the others. Rio's buffet is our close 2nd favorite. The Eiffel tower trip is a neat experience, go at night about 8 p.m. to avoid long lines and see the Bellagio fountains from a front row view. The pool and hot tubs were great, never overcrowded.

It had both tub for soaking and a shower. It was a little difficult for two people to get ready in front of the mirror at the same time, but not too bad. I would definitely recommend this place to others. Within this casino, we ate at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant (anniversary dinner $$$) and Mon Ami Gabi (breakfast $$). Both restaurants had excellent food. The Eiffel Tower Restaurant was a real treat. We made reservations ahead of time for our anniversary. They had dusted the table with rose petals and we had the best seat in the house, overlooking the Bellagio fountains. The wait staff were very attentive and our waiter offered to take our picture with personal camera several times. We ate chocolate/bacon waffles and French Toast with blueberries at Mon Ami Gabi. Both dishes were to die for! If you have never been to the strip, I can tell you this is where you want to stay, as it is centrally located. TIP: stop at a gas station on your way in and buy a case of water to keep in your room. It is much cheaper than buying bottles in the hotel convenience shops. It is extremely hot this time of year and you will need it to stay hydrated. Also, don't forget your lip balm and sunblock if you plan on doing alot of walking down the strip. Also, rewetting drops are essential for those of you who wear contacts. The sun and wind are fierce! If any of you out there are motorcyle riders, then I HIGHLY recommend a motorcycle tour with Todd Harbach of Vegas 2 Wheel Tours. We took a one day tour (8 hours) of REd Rock Canyon and Mount Charleston that was so AWESOME. He also treated us to a local summer theatre group at Spring Mountain Ranch, where we saw Westside Story, the night before our day tour. The show ended after dark, so our ride back to the trip was amazing. Nothing like riding under a full moon back into the lights of the Strip! This was by far the highlight of our Vegas trip.

Five minutes after getting off the phone, I hear a knock on the door, its the supervisor of housekeeping asking me about my complaint and she had an attitude. While the room was lovely, the cleaniness was certainly a factor and customer service is lacking, definately not a top rated hotel at all. We rented a cabana for a day and again, the cleaniness of the cabana was bad, The staff working was bored and customer service again lacking.

VERY hot outside 108 and sitting in a black car waiting for valet to get to us was not really the way to start the vacation. They had only two people working the valet at noon and not blaming them but they were walking very slow when going to cars. There were about ten empty cars ahead of us and each of them had to be parked prior to anyone even talking to us. Okay now we move to the inside which is very cold and the checkin went pretty smooth. We were asked if we wnted an upgraded room for an extra $40.00 per night so we said sure. The lady checking us in was nice, but we to ask how to get to the elevators as no directions were given to anything. The way this hotel is laid out getting lost is easy to do. Made it to the room which had a good view and the room itself was very nice. As we were unpacking room service came in and put a $8.00 bottle of water in the mini bar as she had forgotten earlier. Found out had she not done that we would have been charged for the water. Three days here turned out to be ok but not special enough to return. The check out was a nightmare at 9:15am went to the front desk to check out because we could not see the bill on the TV. After a short wait stepped up to the desk and the lady working it just looked at me as if I was intruding in her life. I had to start the conversation by telling her I was checking out, at this point she told me the computers were being upgraded and I could not see the bill nor have a copy but would just need to trust that it was correct and they would send me a copy of the FINAL bill if I really wanted it. Ever leave someone a blank check and hope they don't take all of your money? I gave this lady my fax number and ask her to send my bill as soon as possible. Two days later I had to call again to try to get the bill, guess what the computer system had not beeen upgraded it was just broken, big difference.

We are no-frills type of people who are rarely in the room anyway, besides their basic room is more than adequate. We were given a King, Non-smoking on the 8th floor. Not much of a view but we did see a little of the Bellagio. Bathrooms are gorgeous, all marble, stand up glass shower, great toiletries. Wonderful Beds, the best sleep I had of our entire two week vacation. I highly recommend the Paris, the location, restaurants, casino are all fantastic.

We took the Showtime Shuttle from the Airport - $12 per person round trip. I have always used Showtime and find them to be prompt, reliable and affordable. Only issue is that you get dropped off by the side door and have to walk a bit to the lobby. A cab drops you off right at the main entrance. We arrived around noon and checked in right away - no lines and our room was ready. We selected a Red Room without a view. The room was okay - not as nice as the Augustus Tower at Caesars, but it was less expensive. The bathroom has a small tub, shower and toilet all in one room. Augustus Tower room has a separate water closet and jacuzzi tub. But - how long are you in the bathroom in Las Vegas? The shower door didn't quite close all the way and therefore water leaked and the toilet ran a bit ... again, not big issues, but just small things that kept me from giving Paris a five star review. The room was fine for what we needed. The pool is on the third floor of the hotel and that's nice because you don't have to walk through the casino or shops in your bathing suit like you have to a Mirage, Caesars or MGM. The salon and spa facilities were fine - I had a manicure and got my hair styled for my wedding. My husband used the steam room and liked it - although it wasn't anything fancy. The restaurants, cafe, and shops are all located together and that is also nice because you don't have to walk all over the place to get a coffee in the morning. It's easy to get in and out of the hotel and there's a walkway through Bally's to get over to Bellagio. Once you figure out the path, it's very easy to navigate. The casino was fine for what we needed, not as big as others, but I never had a hard time finding a slot machine I liked. My husband frequented the Sports Book and always received friendly service. I had never bet on sports before and the associates were very patient and friendly during my learning curve. The best thing about Paris is the location. It's right in the middle of the Strip and easy to walk to the other hotels. We'll stay somewhere else when we go back, but only because that's part of the adventure to try out different hotels. I definitely recommend Paris. A few other notes of interest: Peepshow - take it or leave it ... \"O\" - finally saw it, it's excellent!

This is my second time at the Paris and was just as nice as previously stated. With that said there were some disappointments but nothing to stop me from staying again. The disappointment that I spoke about was my travel documents. When I booked the room through my travel agent I received a run of the house room. Now I was hoping for a red room which is there nicer rooms. Although the room we had was nice, deluxe room, I would have really preferred the red room. When I asked for a free upgrade, all they offered was a $40 a night more for the room. I respectfully declined. So next time we stay I will book the red room through the website. (use the hot price to get really good rates, also sign up for e-mails.) This time around the valet was awful. I went to Utah to Zion and after a three hour drive back all I wanted to do was go back to the room and take a shower. Not only did it take 20 minutes to get from MGM to Paris it took another 20 minutes to park the car it seemed nothing was moving!!! Was it a fluke, probably, but it got me on a wrong day... If you bring a laptop be prepared to pay 15 bucks a day for internet and 25 bucks a day for the gym, unless you go to Mandara Spa then fee is waived FOR THE DAY. So your wondering , would I go back? Definately and I would pay for the red room. Do me a favor when traveling to Las Vegas, find out if a convention is staying there. We had a convention with for the deaf.

This time just us two and first time at Paris. We got in so late because of plane problems 5:00am that our non-smoking room was unavailable which was our only gripe. All hotels seem to be first come first serve for the rooms and that is wrong!! We had to accept a smoke room and change at 11:00. The smoke room was an upgrade to a Red-Room, but when we did get our lower rate Luxury room , it was almost just as nice #731. Separate nice shower(bathroom appeared the same), 27\" TV, but who watches in Vegas, but maybe a little news(did not try the adult movies,lol) Overall atmosphere is wonderful at Paris with many shops and eateries and the architecture and detail is great along with the Eiffel tower!! Casino was laid out good with plenty of room to walk. Although we did not win we had a great time. Bally's next door was also nice, but I think we had the most fun just walking up north and stopping at all places. Every casino was fun and different! Everywhere has different drink prices and atmosphere so hard to say which was better. A beer and shot of house Tequila was $6 at Bills,but 10 or twelve up the road? I think most people know that drinking on the strip can be pricey! A night spent downtown at Freemont street is a must for Vegas. We had a great time with all kinds of entertainment and people to watch! We took the Duece Bus $3 one-way or $7 for 24 hrs(good deal) Took about 30 minutes, but the ride is fun with good views if you can sit on top and in front part. Another night we also tried the monorail down to MGM and went to Excalibur, NYNY and Tropicana and had a great time $5(one-way) We also rented a car for 2 days and hit the local resorts during the day around Vegas. I will do this again next year! Boulder Station was our favorite for wins and atmosphere, but also nice were Sams Town and the upscale Red Rock Casino & Resort. Arizona Charlies had great food. There are quite a few to hit . I took a $6.50 shuttle ride from Paris and picked up the car at LAS car center and then dropped it off when we left town. I booked ahead with Priceline and got an SUV for $37 The new car center and buses to the airport are great and quick (7min) with plenty of signs to show you where to go! Stop at The \"Welcome to Las Vegas \" sign just south of Mandalay Bay on Las Vegas Blvd for pictures! Last year stopped at Hover Dam and South rim of grand canyon and would also recommend!

A little background. This is our 3rd stay at Paris. Last one was for one night last September and another trip a few years ago. We typically stay at Bally's. There were 3 of us: me (mid 40's), husband (50) and daughter (mid 20's). Check-in took about 25 minutes or so. We got in line right before noon when several people were checking out. Clerk was friendly, got checked-in and off to our room. If you aren't familiar with Paris, there are 2 or 3 different banks of elevators that go to various floors. Each bank has about 8 elevators. We never had to wait long to go up or down on the elevator. We were in room 437. It was a little over 1/2 way down the hallway. View was of a roof and looked toward the Paris balloon. A view would have been nice but I didn't want to complain about the view because most of our nights were comped. The thing that was not so great was that the service room was right across from our room. The service room was where housekeeping got towels, blankets, pillows, etc. So there was quite a bit of noise and chatter going on every morning. The room has 2 beds, a desk with chair, 2 cushy chairs, a cushy footstool, a small glass table, night stand between the beds, lamps on each side of the bed, a lamp on the desk, and a stand up lamp. There is an armoire that has a closet on each side of the tv area and below the tv are 4 dresser drawers. There was a small refrigerator in the room that I think was stocked and we didn't touch because we didn't want a charge. There is no closet and no luggage stand. There is an ironing board and iron. The bathroom has a blow dryer, magnifying mirror that pulls out from the wall, and large vanity with 1 sink. The glass shower with glass door is separate from the tub. The room is a bit smaller than I remember. No problems with our room being cleanly. The one day I accidentally left the Do Not Disturb sign on the doorknob, they called and left a message to explain why they didn't clean. I called and they came up later when we were ready for them. When we first arrived we needed called for extra blankets and towels. They were delivered within a matter of minutes. The pool is on the 3rd floor so that was a bonus of being on the 4th floor. Take the elevator to 3rd, walk a very short distance, and you are at the pool. The pool was busy on Sunday and Monday due to the holiday weekend but was less busy as the week went on. There was a DJ on Sunday but music only the rest of the time we were there. Saw the cocktail waitress a few times. Never had trouble finding a lounge chair. We tried to go to the pool in the early afternoon most days but a couple of days we went later (around 3:30). By that time the sun has definitely shifted and you have to be strategic in finding a lounger or place in the pool that is in the sun. We didn't gamble a lot in Paris, just not enough time. I went to the casino one morning while waiting on husband and daughter. Found a blazing 7 penny machine. After playing it for about 30-45 minutes, I hit the jackpot! Needless to say I was very happy. We did not eat at Paris. We did eat at Ballys Sidewalk Cafe. Disappointed to find out it is now only open 6am-2pm. The RIO shuttle picks up outside the door (side toward Planet Hollywood). It's free but we tipped $1 for each of us. Monorail station is located on the lower level of Bally's, back near the pool. We like staying near the center of the strip so Paris was perfect for us. We had to catch our plane at 11:00 so checked out around 8:00 a.m. Only waited in line about 2 minutes. Check-out clerk was not a friendly person at all. We wanted to apply any comps to our room charge. Husband had already packed his Total Rewards players card away and she said they couldn't look it up.

We were upgraded from a regular deluxe room to a \"red room\" on 28th floor. From touchdown at airport to entering our room took 40 minutes.

Certainly not inexpensive for breakfast as eggs benedict and coffee for two plus tax and tip ran $40. Crepes and coffee for 2 including tax $26. Cafe Ile St Louis had a great dinner special of filet mignon Oscar, about 6 oz of meat, veggies and roasted potatoes for $12.99. Waitress who served us our first dinner there remembered us two nights later, even our names. The night we ate at Mon Ami Gami they were featuring chateneuf du pape for $40 rather than their usual $90. Of course we ordered a bottle. Pool was ok, water around low 70's. Got a 12 oz plastic glass gin and tonic at the pool bar - $12. Felt that was a bit of a rip-off. Walked, walked and walked. Didn't do any gambling, wife blew $40 on slots in about 10 minutes, nor did we take in any shows. Next time we'll do that.

First, the location is very central on the Strip. It is across from Bellagio, between Bally's and Planet Hollywood. There is a monorail station at the adjoining Bally's hotel. You decide if this is a convenient way for you to get around, but the fact is that there is a station in easy striking distance. The \"basic\" room and bathroom are spacious and very clean. Two small closets flank the TV set (NOT flat panel) in an armoir-like case. There are three drawers in the unit, and more drawers in the nightstand -- enough room to stash a fair amount of stuff. Two comfy armchairs, a table, and an ottoman outfit the room. There is a mini-bar, but one of those with spring-loaded bottles and cans that incur a charge when jostled. Still, we could manage to find space for the odd piece of pizza or fruit, but not much. There is also an ironing board and iron. Lots of nice toiletries in the bathroom -- shampoo, conditioner, lotion, bath gel. The bathroom has a separate tub and shower. Room 630 looks out the back, but we got a good rate and were on the go, so that was okay. The pricier rooms look out over the fountains of Bellagio and the Strip -- nice if you need a special view. The pool here is really nice. First, you are in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower -- such goofy fun. It did not feel at all crowded. There are more than enough chaise lounges for everyone, and the staff do not over-crowd the chairs, i.e. some are kept in reserve and put out when it looks like things might get a little crowded. This made the area seem very nice and spacisous, compared to the crowded pool areas at other hotels. For those who don't want full sun, there are potted trees around, and some parts of the pool area are shaded by the hotel itself at different times of day. There are also private cabanas for rent. A poolside cafe can supply food and drinks at your chair, or you can have lunch under a scrim-rook (I wish it was more shaded -- too much hot sun gets in.) We really like the lobby amenities here. The casino decor has all of the kitschy cliches of Paris -- more goofy fun. There is a really nice range of restaurants from quite expensive fine dining (Eiffel Tower) to moderate places. Mon Ami Gabi, Ah Sin (Asian,) the Cafe, and a steak place all have atmospheric setting, even if off the casino area. Back down a hall are a casual ITalian place; a crepe stand; the buffet; and a breakfast/lunch spot. The find: go to the Lenotre cafe that is very near the elevator bank and newsstand. The morning coffee is slightly less costly than the other breakfast spot and better, and Lenotre also has wonderful pastries and muffins. Also: I don't think people see the very good sandwiches and salads in the case here. You can eat at tables, or grab these items for a quick lunch on the go or when you need to get work done in the room. There are also good ice creams. There are a number of good shops to poke around in. Gustav's bar is a good place to park yourself with a glass of champagne to view casino action, and there are other good spots for drinks throughout the lobby. Service was uniformly nice and friendly throughout the hotel, whether at the check-in desk or business center or pool or on the casino floor. Downsides: internet access in the room is $15 a day -- very annoying in this day. Also: the pool has no charge, but the fitness facility will cost $25. I didn't want to use it, but this always feels like nickle-and-diming. Managed downside: There was one day when a DJ appeared in later afternoon, cranked up some music, and gave away free items, but the next day it seemed like someone (thankfully) asked that the noise level be turned down. So far, Paris has NOT adopted that tacky promotion of fencing off a \"European\" sun area (read: topless sunbathing, often for a surcharge of the priviliege of being in that area, and/or ogling.) I hope it never does -- that would spoil the nice setting. To sum: while we still might check out other hotels on future stays, there is a strong preference to stay here.

We remember having a lovely experience with a nice congratulatory staff, this of course was when I was a Diamond card holder. When we returned this May to celebrate our one year anniversary the experience was not as pleasant as before, in fact it was drastically different. My Diamond membership that renews every six months renewed in April 2009 prior to our stay. Due to the poor economic times I wasn't able to gamble as much as the prior year and my card was re-established as a gold member (lowest tier) after holding Diamond status for the past 6 years. We were treated significantly below average after this happened, the staff was rude and Not gay friendly, we did not receive one anniversary congratulations from any of the Paris staff after informing them that this was the reason for our return, they simply looked away as if we didn't exist. The room we were assigned was old and run down. Our Le Artiste dinner reservation was lost, the food quality was poor and extremely overpriced in all areas of the property, and the staff was rude and unorganized. The gaming was terrible taking without even the smallest return, overall the Hotel was understaffed and inefficient. This was worst service I have ever experienced in the past 15 years of my travel and gaming in Las Vegas. I don't know what has happened or why they would allow their hotel to be run so poorly but it was BAD. I am also a player at the MGM/Mirage and I will be booking my stays with them in the future and I will spend my money there as well. The MGM now owns half of the strip and I always get treated very well at their properties. I am sorry to say that Harrahs seems to want Gay travelers to book at Paris and spend large amounts of money there without returning the favor with even as much as a smile.

You can find breakfast for 8.95 which includes ham and egg croissant and coffee. That's good value.

But compared to other hotels, the Paris's ventilation system does a poor job of clearing the air. I wouldn't spend any time in the casino for that reason.

The pool does not get sun until noon, so the water is very cold (even in the summer). The drinks are way over-priced at the pool area. Cocktail waitresses at the open stage in the casino are never nice, so we have stopped going there.", "Date": "April 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cardiff, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel in all departments\u201d", "Author": "buzz6872", "ReviewID": "UR28806186", "Content": "We stayed at the Paris Hotel in April, our second vist to Vegas, last time staying at a different hotel.

I would certainly recomend the buffet breakfast at only $17 each for all you can eat and with a vast choice of food to choose from certainly sets you up for a busy day sightseeing. But I would recommend to get there early as the queues can be quite long to get in but they do more quite quickly. We found the rooms spotless and well furnished comfy bed and with a huge flat screen tv.

The Paris has comfortable, quiet rooms with roomy bathrooms, luxury mini bar for those who would endulge in them and an exceptionally warm feeling. When you enter you have a casino area but it is modest and doesn't send you into some kind of slot machine noise hell like some of them can. The larger casino is in the back connected to another casino. Inside is a gorgeous setting like being in the middle of old France. The detail is remarkable! The food is great and the staff is friendly. This hotel is HUGE, we were there for 3 days and I still couldn't see all of it! I went into every swanky hotel there just to see them and they all had something to offer but the Paris by far made me feel comfortable.

It is not one of the best in town (though not the worst either). Most people say they love Las Vegas but wouldn't want to live there. I can now say the same about this hotel - Great place to visit and check out on your trip, but not to actually stay at. Why do I say this? Well firstly the actual hotel feels very crowded and cramped. The casino and shopping area are always bustling with 'passers by'. There are no quiet spots to relax in. We found it extremely noisy, cramped and confusing compared to most other casinos. There is no sense of sophitication or elegance that one might associate with all things Parisian. Worst still it permanently feels like it's the evening in there. Not great when it's a bright sunny morning outside. There is absolutely no natural light in the buliding at all. Not even at reception. The cafes and restaurants almost always had long lines, so even getting some breakfast felt like a chore. One night (2am) we decided we wanted a cup of tea. We waited in line for twenty minutes to be seated, only to find the cafe actually half empty. Why on earth we had to queue is anyones guess.??? (By the way - They do NOT know how to make a decent cup of tea either) In the end we resorted to McDonalds for our breakfasts. Where we had less of a wait, better tasting tea, and a much smaller check! The rooms are average for Las Vegas. Probably seem amazing to anyone who's never been there before, but take it from me they are nothing special. The bad design of the building also means 75% of the rooms face either the side of Bally's or Plant Hollywood. The adjoining hotels. If you want a strip view it will cost you $65 extra a night. Not worth it in my opinion unless you can bag a room higher than floor 15. Otherwise you basically see the pool and Eiffel Tower. Speaking of the pool - again distinctly average. Only one big round pool. Only 3ft deep even at the centre. No umbrellas to shade anyone, so you'd better want to fry in the sun. On the plus side they do have a nice cafe area there. This can only be accessed by guests, so less busy and actually fairly pleasant. If the management had any sense they would utilise this in the evenings too, with pool side dining and music. Lastly I have to say the service overall was not very good. The exception to this was the buffet where we found all our servers very pleasant and accomodating. I can't reccommend this hotel to anyone really. If you want better casino environment opt for Bellagio, Monte Carlo or Venetian. If it's a great pool you want go for Mandalay Bay, Caesars, Pallazzo or Flamingo. If great shopping is your thing opt for Caesars (for Forum Shops) or Wynn, Pallazzo or Treasure island (for Fashion Show mall). If you want a young, slightly more urban feel opt for Planet Hollywood on the Strip, or Palms or Hard Rock off the strip. Can I think of a single overriding reason why you should choose Paris? Sadly no.

This was my third stay at Paris Hotel & Casino and my least favorite. . I don't think the rooms have changed since they opened as they are now showing signs of wear, dated decor and old tv's with a poor cable package. The bathrooms are still very nice but the hallways to the rooms on my floor smelled of old carpet with years of trapped chemical odors. { I have asthma so I am very sensitive to overuse of carpet cleaners, chemicals & smoke.} I had one morning that the hot water for the shower was barely luke warm. If you do not plan a lot of time in your room then these are ok but not luxurious. Check in was a breeze here {about 5 minutes} but I always plan my arrival in Vegas a little early, [usually between 12 & 1. I have found from 2-4pm most of the Las Vegas Hotels have pretty long check in lines. The location of this hotel for 1st time visitors is very good, as it is near the center of the strip across from the Bellagio and connected next door to Bally's. I used the Las Vegas Monorail at the back entrance to Bally's to get down to a convention at the MGM each day and this worked out pretty well. It was a pretty good walk from the Monorail to my room at Paris but it certainly a good option for getting to the other ends of the strip. The pool area at the hotel is ok, but for those wanting a pool scene this would not be on my short list of great vegas pool areas. Try Caesars, Mandalay Bay or even the Flamingo Hotel & Casino if pool time is your top concern. And always make sure to call ahead to see if the pool area is open. I do like the Casino here more then many in town as the high ceilings make for a little less smoky atmosphere. I have eaten at many of the Paris restaurants. The bar atop the Eiffel tower has some terrific views for a cocktail. Mon Ami Restaurant is it quite good and the atmosphere terrific. I have also eaten at Les Artistes Steakhouse and found the food to be just ok but the room itself quite stunning. In the walkway from Paris to Bally's you can find the less expensive food {bakery, crepes, buffet, etc} along with a spirited bar that had dueling pianists on one night of my stay. I did notice during my stay the buffet line looked ridiculously long each morning when I walked by. All in all Paris is in a good location but the rooms are getting a little tired. If you are going to stay here make sure you get a really good rate. If you need 5 star luxury in your room and would like a smoke free environment check out Palms Place {the high end resort attatched to the Palms Casino.

I really enjoy this town. This was our first experience at Paris. Here is our review! We booked to go Easter weekend and decided to stay at Paris because it was the only Harrahs property we had not yet tried out. We got two nights comped and paid $57 for Fri. and Sat. night, so the price was right for four nights. We arrived late (about 11:30pm) on Thurs. night of the long weekend. The check in line had about 8 people in it and we waited for about 10 minutes. The young man who helped us was very polite. He told us unfortunately all standard King rooms where gone so we were going to get a free upgrade, but would have to settle for two queens the first night. He offered us a much bigger upgrade to a King suite (1000 sq. ft.) for an extra $85 per night so we said that is just too much for us this time. So, he put us into the queen upgrade. Strangely, I decided that since he treated us so politley I would tip him $20 as a thanks ( I know, you should do this before he assigns the room). He quickly put it in his pocket and as we started to walk away he motioned us back. He said he really appreciated the tip and was going to put us in the nice King suite for free!!!!!!! It was a really nice room. Great space, furnishings, the bedroom had a wet bar in it with an empty fridge for us to use, business desk and armoire with a TV. Even in the suite the TV was only a tube one, but that didn't bother us! We had a granite coffee table with some nice chairs around it and a couch to sit on. It was nice when we had our other two couple friends to entertain. There was a corridor which came to a \"T\", one way led past another desk (where we kept our laptop) into a walk-in closet with the in-room safe. The other way led to the beautiful, huge bathroom!! Lots of marble, wonderful big shower and a separate jacuzzi tub, two vanities, mirrors, etc. No T.V. though!! Then of that room was a door leading to the toilet and the second porcelin toilet which was the one to wash your butt on!!..LOL Who would ever use this?? Very funny. The view was nothing special, 11th floor overlooking the roof with a side view of Planet Holleywood. I WILL ALWAYS USE THE $20 TRICK FROM NOW ON!!! What a great room upgrade for four nights for $5 extra per night!!! The casino was fine! We didin't gamble too much here but we could have. Our friends were both at the Rio so we spent some time over on that part of town. We had a ball playing at the Gold Coast. I did play some Keno machines at Paris and did ok, making about $200 profit. We didn't notice too much smoke. It's actually a pretty nice casino. We only ate at Mon Ami Gabi at Paris and it is as advertised...outstanding!!! You can eat there for reasonable prices as well if you want. The couple we went with only paid $60 for their meal, tip included. I had just won a $200 Keno jackpot outside the restaraunt waiting for the others to arrive so I splurged on filet mignon and it cost us $100. The service was great, I made our reservations online a month before we left and noted to them then that I had celiac disease so I would need gluten free food. When we arrived at the restaraunt they had a special menu for me with all gluten free selections on it...nice service!! We had to wait 15 minutes past our reservation time for an outdoor table cause we wanted to see the view of the Bellagio fountains!! It was great!! The pool area is fine, nothing special bet nice. The view of the Eiffel Tower right in front of you is cool. The two hot tubs where kind of secluded from the pool and big...very nice. Maid service was perfect, we needed a couple of foam pillows delivered as I am allergic to feather and we needed a new remote for the TV as ours did not work. They brought both up to the room 10 min. after a quick phone call from me. All in all it was a great location, room and hotel. Oh ya, we NEVER waited more that 20 or 30 sec. for an elevator either.

There were too many minor issues and there are too many other awesome hotels in Vegas! For instance, the Mirage is usually about the same price, it's not much farther up the Strip, and the rooms are FAR superior to those at the Paris. That said--I will start with check-in. We arrived sometime between 4 and 4:30 PM on a Thursday and they only had TWO people working the \"regular\" guest check-in line, which meant we waited about 20 minutes, a bit much in my opinion. When I stayed at the Mirage we had to approach the front desk numerous times during our stay, for check-in and otherwise, and we never waited more than a minute or two. Also, the Paris casino is something of a maze and very difficult to get around in! Much more so than the ones at Mandalay Bay and the Mirage. Anyway, on to the room--we stayed in a standard room and let me tell you, at the Paris, you get what you pay for. Although the room was nice and big and the bed/sheets/pillows were soft and comfortable, I had the following issues: -There was no comforter on the bed. I like to \"sleep cold\" (with the A/C on a lower temp) and if I hadn't had someone to cuddle with, it would have been AWFUL. -The carpet was very worn and there were random marks all over the walls. -Even though we didn't watch much TV, the other Vegas hotels I've experienced led me to expect a flatscreen. Not so at the Paris--if you have a standard room, expect a crappy, small, old tube television. -It was annoying to see the usual sign in the bathroom about how the hotel is trying to be \"green\", so \"hang up your towels\" etc. \"if you want to re-use them\". Personally, I don't mind using my towels/washcloths for a couple of days and usually hang them up to save water etc. at hotels. But at the Paris this is impossible because there is only one TINY towelbar in the entire bathroom! They really shouldn't have those signs at all, considering. -I brought a travel-sized container of facewash with me that happened to be the same size and shape as the shampoo/conditioner/lotion etc. containers that the hotel provides. They threw out my facewash on me because apparently every day they take all of the slightly used containers out of the shower and toss them! This is both silly and frustrating because I had to go without facewash because of it. Otherwise, I will say that the bathroom was awesome! Very big, with a separate shower and tub. Much nicer than the bathroom in my room at the Mirage, which was tiny. We ate at four of the \"restaurants\" at the Paris during our stay there. The Lenotre Bakery has great food but crappy coffee. My latte tasted more like water than coffee and my boyfriend's cappuccino wasn't much better. The bakery was also pretty expensive. I ate at Mon Ami Gabi for the second time and was just as impressed as the first time I ate there. Not cheap by any means, but awesome food and service! We had breakfast at Le Cafe on our second morning there and it was just okay. The hollandaise sauce on my Eggs Benedict was questionable, my boyfriend's bagel with eggs and salmon was average, our cappuccinos were the same blah ones that we had at Lenotre, and the service was ridiculously slow. Finally, we had crepes from Le Creperie and while they were tasty--don't expect anything like a REAL French crepe. They were too thick, first of all, and they felt the need to smother my Nutella Crepe with hot chocolate and whipped cream on TOP of the Nutella. A bit much. Check-out at 11 AM on a Sunday was a long process, as is to be expected. The luggage storage service at the Paris was great/easy, though!

Holes in the walls of the hallway, someone puked in the hallway and it was not cleaned up. Another room had ordered room service and left their cart in the hallway when done. That is fine, however something smelled rotten and it was left in the hallway for over 24 hours so the entire hallway stank like BO. The TV in the rooms were old 19\" boob-tube. There were about 14 Asian channels and only 8-10 English channels. The pool is less than to be desired. It is basic and no frills. It was filthy as were our windows looking out of the room and directly below to the pool. When I spoke to the manager, all they offered was a comment card. I told them for a 5 star hotel, they were no better then a Motel 6 and he just corrected me, that they were only 4 stars. As far as I am concerned they were no better then 2 stars, and we will NEVER go back to this hotel. Completely not worth it! There is nothing here that you can\u2019t get at another hotel and spend a lot less. The furniture is cheap and shabby, beat up and missing pieces. I could have saved our money and stayed elsewhere on the strip, but we wanted elegance and fun. This hotel held neither. Entertainment was less than to be desired. We spent most of our trip gambling elsewhere.

When I complained they said they had just layed off staff. Come on, really? You have 4,000 people checking in and 5 staff is the best you can do? The room and bath were spacious but the bed was uncomfortable, more like sleeping on the floor. My husband remarked it was their way of getting people to go to the casino. We waited almost 30 minutes at Le Cafe for breakfast the next day and never saw the waitress. The buffet (our second \"breakfast\") was a mess, they didn't keep up the food so it was over cooked and cold. But our biggest complaint was the ubiquitous smoke. The Paris hotel is not that old but our eyes watered from the smokey casino at the door. Everything had to be dry cleaned when we got home. Other newer hotels have figured out better air ventilation, Why can't Paris? We did manage to escape to the pool every afternoon around 4:00. The pool area is large, the pool was not heated and there was no cover. We cherished our shady spot under the \"Eiffel Tower\". Shortly after we arrived each day the pool staff began relentlessly and noisily stacking the chairs. When we complained they said they were getting ready to close. Really? The pool hours were until 6:00. Was that necessary, policy, or just plain rude? I will say that Mon Ami Gabi was an excellent restaurant but pricey. Stay away from the all you can eat sushi deal Wed-Sunday at the other signature restaurant, it was awful sushi.

Far more comfortable feel to hotel than what we envisioned by viewing the website. Service for the most part was excellent and being interconnected with Bally's was a bonus as the two Casino's have quite a different feel to them. Right in the heart of the strip and convenient to most other big named locations. Walked both directions on different days to see each and every Casino. That only reconfirmed that we picked the right hotel to stay at to begin with for our tastes. Two things that were sub-par was beverage service while playing at the tables and our room (no upgrade chosen) that faced south-west towards parking garage and airport). Did not care that room did not have a great view but McCarron Airport is quite the busy place and with planes arriving late and taking off early, facing this direction is a major nuisance unless you live close to an airport and have learned to live with this noise. Facing north or east (strip) would have been much preferred and offerred a more restful, longer sleep. This problem would exist though for all hotels in the south end of the strip with many even worse off than Paris! Vegas can be an in your face, overwhelming place, but the Paris L.V.

For those of you that gamble there were NO blackjack tables under $10 per hand minimum. I was surprised to see a lot of penny slot machines...maybe and sign of the economic times perhaps. FYI: The cab ride from the airport was about $20 plus tip. I liked that the Miracle Mile Mall was right next to the Paris. Once you go inside that Mall you walk and walk like it goes on for more than a mile. There are places to eat in there too if you do not want to eat in the Paris. We walked to the Monte Carlo since they have a brew pub there but it was a farther walk than we had anticipated but well worth it. I've posted a picture of the view from our room #1222.

On check in, the lady started chatting and asked if we were there for business or pleasure. I said it was my husbands birthday (that day) and it was our first visit to Vegas. Extremely friendly lady and she told us she had given us a room with a view. When we arrived to our room on 27th floor, she wasn't kidding. She had also upgraded us from a deluxe room to a P room. We had a view of the Eiffel Tower and the Bellagio fountains. If you are a light sleeper and get a front view, bring some ear plugs, as the fountains do go on until midnight and on the first night there we were extremely tired and crashed out at 8pm (4am our time) but the music and noise from fountains kepts me awake. They have 3 separate groups of elevators to different floors. This way there is never lots of people waiting for the lifts. The room was kept very clean thoughout our stay and had more than enough toilettries for us both. There was a HD widescreen TV in the room, mini bar, ironing board, iron and in room safe. The bathroom was marble with separate shower and bath. There was also a hairdryer in here. Extremely comfy beds too. We had two buffet breakfasts at the hotel and they were really very good. On both days, that breakfast lasted us well into the evening before we started to feel peckish again. There was bacon, eggs, omlettes, pancakes, crepes, waffles, fruit, pastries, yoghurt, cereals, bread, bagels, etc etc. It was huge and had something to appeal to everyones taste. Coffee and juice were plentiful. On the first day (due to the time difference) we were awake very early and were at the buffet for 7am with very little wait. The following day we got there for 7.30am and waited for around half an hour. The next day, we didn't go as the queue was huge. My advice would be to get there at 7am each day if you can. It is worth it. There are lots of lovely shops in the hotel where you can buy souvenirs to designer clothes. There is also a small hatch where you can purchase a souvenir container (Eiffel Tower or the Paris Balloon) and fill it with drinks such as Pine Coladas for $15. You can walk directly from the Paris, pass their shops, and into Ballys Hotel and the casino. This casino is bigger than Paris'. They also have more shops downstairs, plus access to the Monorail. Right outside the Paris is a deuce stop. Very convenient way of travelling the strip for $7 for 24 hour pass. There are several restaurants, bars and cafes in the hotel. The only one we tried was the Creperie. I had a lovely crepe, but it was huge and I couldn't finish it all. The location of the hotel is amazing. Right in the middle of the strip, opposite the Bellagio, next door to Planet Hollywood, and minutes from The Flamingo, Caesars Palace, New York New York. The casino is good, but not as big as other casinos. The slots that I liked (Wizard of Oz and Monopoly) they didn't have. They did have most other slots and table games. Waitress service was good at The Paris and would bring you any drink you asked for. Plenty of ATM machines in the hotel. On departure, the hotel has a room whereby you can leave your luggage after you have checked out. The bellboy gives you a slip for your luggage, which you give back when you want the luggage back. They they put it in your transport (taxi, shuttle etc) for you. We throughly enjoyed our stay at The Paris and would go back in a flash.

I think the biggest complaint I had was that we arrived at the hotel at about midnight and we waited 45 minutes on line to check in. To us, it was 3 am our local time and we were exhausted, due to not being able to sleep on the plane - so having to wait so long to check in was an annoyance. I'm not sure if it was just an unusual thing for the hotel to have so many people checking in at that hour of the night or what, but every night that we passed the lobby, I'd always peek to see how long the lines were and they were never anything like the night we checked in (which was a Tuesday night). A positive thing though was that we were upgraded to a suite - without even asking for it (and no, we didn't even complain that we were waiting so long...we were too exhausted at that point and just wanted to get to our room). The view was nothing spectacular...not much of a view really, but the room was nice.

One window faced the Eiffel Tower, and the other faced the Bellagio where we watched the fountain/light show over and over all weekend - what a treat! :) This alone would have been worth the $60/night, but the upgrade also included access to a wonderful cafe on the 31st floor for both breakfast (8-11a) and cocktail hour/dinner (5-8p). We thought the food selection was great (even had pasta dishes at night) and we ended up eating every meal there because of the comfort and convenience!

Queue at Dollar RentACar was VERY long and slow...but we eventually got our car. Arrived at hotel on Monday afternoon around 2pm from airport via rental car for 4 nights. Used the free valet parking. Luggage was taken by bellhop and we were given a ticket and told to call the desk when we arrived in room. Check-in was smooth and quick...although by the time we had finished, there were about 10-15 parties waiting to check in. We had booked this trip thru a travel agent with a \"standard\" room...I \"tipped\" the very pleasant desk clerk $20 and politely asked for a complimentary upgrade...we ended up in an upgraded \"red room\" on the 28th floor with the 50\" plasma and the ultralux kingsize bed. Luggage delivered to the room with no problem. Everything was very clean and new. Bathroom was excellent with good water pressure. Elevators were quick (there were express elevators to the 26th floor and up). I looked spa/gym...that was very nice-->but there is an upcharge to use it ($25/day or $65 for 3 days). It was too cool for the pool...but it looked fine. We did room service breakfast x 2 mornings...it's relatively reasonable when you stick to a continental breakfast \"for one\"...it was enough for two to start the day. There was a free coffee maker in the room and an \"honor\" bar-->we brought food/drinks into our room because of the outrageous prices. I think the little airline bottle of JackDaniels was $8 ...but a 375ml bottle in the hotel gift shop was $15. There are plenty of convenience stores/pharmacies in the neighborhood. Paris Hotel venues: We ate at Le Proven\u00e7al...that was very good...and reasonably priced when you used the coupon. We did some serious drinking and carousing at Napoleon's (dueling piano bar)-->the drinks were wicked expensive...but we had coupons for that too!! La Creperie had good coffee and desserts. There was also an chocolate/ice cream shop right in the hotel. We went to the top of the Eiffel tower for the view...but the restaurant was VERY expensive so we skipped eating there. The more casual restaurants and the buffet at the Paris do NOT take reservations...and we did not care to wait on line to check them out. We also ate dinners at McCormick/Schmick's Seafood and Pinot Brassiere (at the Venetian). I burned some AmEx points to get gift certificates to these establishments. The meals/drinks were very good. We went down to Fremont St--I was not impressed. However, our cabdriver told us to get dinner @ Tony Roma's...they have a lobster/steak combo for $12 after 9pm...so that was a bargain. We did casual lunches (Food court @ NewYork NewYork was very good) in a variety of places. We did 2 day trips..one to Hoover Dam and one to Red Rocks Canyon. Both very nice and well worth the time. The valet takes about 10 minutes to bring your car up. If not for these day trips, you do not need a car...plenty of cabs, trams, and the monorail to take you around Vegas. Warning: Our first two cabdrivers took us on an \"safari\"...we learned to tell them to take a direct route. Paris location is PERFECT...right in the middle of the Strip across from the Bellagio. There is plenty of sleeze on the Strip--you have these guys in red tee shirts handing out the \"business cards\" of the hookers. I came back with a decent collection! We could walk to all of the major hotels...and each one looked great (with the exception of the run-down Strastosphere). MGM, Venetian, Bellagio, Luxor, Excalbur, Bally's, Mirage all looked great. Lots of stores with $5 teeshirts and $1 souveniers...so that was good! Gambling: We gambled a little bit. I got lucky at the roulette wheel for a while (I forget which casino)...but ended up losing about $100 for the whole trip. Shows: Barry Manilow-->Very good show...a true Las Vegas experience (Cher/Elton/Bette were dark during our stay). Expensive and pretty short (1.25 hrs). Cirque de Soleil: LOVE (Beatles theme) OUTSTANDING show. Try to sit in the middle tier...you will miss stuff if you are too close. Well worth the $$. Jubillee: Traditional (topless) Las Vegas showgirl show---worth seeing with the 2 for 1 tickets. We sat up front (table service) with a bunch of Asian guys...we had a blast. That was the night my blood alcohol level exceeded 0.15 (at least). So the bottom line: Paris was excellent. Most of the major hotels on the strip would be fine. Try the $20 front desk trick. Look for coupons...they are all over the place and when you use them wisely lyou can lower your costs without lowering your standards.

We went to Vegas with friends who stayed at Stratosphere and they were so far from the other hotels on the Strip. We were halfway between Mandalay Bay and the Wynn, which made walking between all of the hotels much easier. Paris is one of the most distinctive of the hotels on the Strip and has a unique feel when you walk into the casino...it does feel like you're walking down a street in Paris with all the boutiques and cafes. Before our trip I had read other reviews about the hotel rooms and was not expecting much; the room was better than I had anticipated and was kept very clean by the staff. We requested a room overlooking the Bellagio but the upgrade would have been an additional $65 per night. We decided not to upgrade because there is so much to see in Las Vegas that we knew we wouldn't be spending much time in the room. We got to see the fountains at the Bellagio several times; the best show was from the top of the Eiffel Tower at night! Our first night in Las Vegas was Valentine's Day as well as my fiance's birthday. We had an amazing dinner at Les Artistes Steakhouse; the veal forestiere was the best veal I've ever had and my fiance loved the filet mignon. We definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone! Friends had recommended the buffet at Paris; we had dinner there one night and weren't impressed. The best part of it was the crepe station where they can make dessert crepes with fruit and chocolate. We tried the breakfast buffet on our last day there and that was much better. The omelette station was great and they still had the crepes available. One other thing we would have enjoyed on this trip was an indoor pool. The pool was outdoors and wasn't open during our stay.

Before this trip I have spent tons of time on TripAdvisor and read different hotel review every time I changed the choice based on sale or discount offered at times. I really appreciated members\u2019 feedback on a wide spectrum including restaurants, shopping & etc. I wish I could come up with a format to simplify the pros and cons. However, all the tips learned are worthy if you have time while planning your trip. I settled at Pairs for 4 nights ($90/night regular room) due to the 4th night was free but I WILL NOT return if no discount was offered. Here are pros and cons: Pros: It\u2019s at a considerately convenient location close to Bellagio, Caesar\u2019s Palace, & Planet Hollywood if you like shopping in addition to gambling. As many members stated before, you can inhale less second hand smoke in-and-out the hotel and self parking garage is within a reasonable walking distance from the rooms and navigation through the premise is fairly easy. Cons: The reservation is based on double occupancy and $15 for each additional guest even kids. You need to do the math to see if this makes sense to your group. I requested two interconnected double beds rooms at reservation but was told to call back when time gets closer. I did call one week prior to my first day of stay but still was told no guaranty. Finally at the check-in, the staff told me there is NO such room layout at the entire premise. All the interconnected rooms are one King size bed and another two double beds room. Apparently, many staffs were not aware of this either. Each room stay comes with one coupons booklet contains half of those are 2-For-1 drink and another half are Harrah\u2019s own other properties but NONE of the coupons are for Pairs. I complained to the concierge and was given a $2 off coupon per person to the Tower. I later signed up Total Rewards card and was given a similar coupons booklet with one of them is \u201cBuy one ticket; get one free\u201d to the Tower. I can understand the marketing strategy but for four days stay with NO coupons at Paris really throws me off. By the way, save your trip to Flamingo and Harrah\u2019s Buffet restaurants or you\u2019ll be sorry. Housekeeping starts considerably early (around 7 am at 8th floor). I found broken pieces of glass on the hallway by 9:30 am and told one of the crew. She immediately went picking up large pieces by her hands; however, small pieces were still there by the midnight. That would be a big surprise for people coming back from pool bare-footed. There is a small refrigerator full of pricy beverage and snacks that you\u2019ll be charged if you open the door beyond certain time without consuming anything inside. I personally felt that\u2019s ill-minded design. One of the elevators from the lower levels has mal-functioning sensors that will close the doors regardless the loading is still in progress. We\u2019re in there twice for the 4-day stay. Apparently, it was not considered a maintenance item. Neither theater nor night club inside for entertainment should be considered as a con for most people visit Vegas. Parents consider Vegas a family vacation should really give it a second thought for the younger children. Side note: I have no affiliation with them but a trip to Tkx4Tonight is a must. In addition to show tickets, they also have discounted restaurants vouchers. They close at 8 pm which I missed twice.

We had a great view of the strip (one of my colleagues was not so lucky, though, so don't expect all rooms to have a great view). The bathroom was gorgeous and the shower water pressure great. Go out of the room, though, and you really have to do some walking just to get out of the hotel -- does anybody else miss places like the Boardwalk that were reasonably sized and easy to get in and out of? The walking was good, though, because you have to pay extra to use the fitness center. My girlfriend spent the $25/day fee, but I didn't think it was worth it. You also have to pay extra for the internet ($13, I think), and I'm sure there are plenty of other amenities that aren't included in the room rate. I personally can't stand the extra fees at places like Paris, a hotel which, after all, isn't exactly cheap.

The bad: I did not like the old-school tvs - no flat screens. The bizarre: There are no closets. The location: Fabulous. The safety problems: We moved to a handicapped room (my mother used a scooter) and the bathroom floor, when wet, becomes a skating rink. Did no one consider that someone with mobility problems to start, should not be on a frictionless floor? Also, the makeup mirror is about 5 ft off the ground - in a handicapped accessible room. The restaurants: Cafe Ile St. Louis - Terrible. Want to be rushed out like you're at Friendly's, but pay $80 for a meal for 3? This is your place! They come by, take your entire order (drink, appetizer, meal, etc.) in one shot. Runners bring you your food. Then you don't see your server again until the check comes. The food was mediocre. Le Burger Brassiere - This is an example of fast, but in a good way. Our server was constanly asking if we needed anything, then she'd get it for us in about 4 seconds. Maybe 5 seconds if she was really busy. It was a little pricey ($11 burger plus $3 for fries), but the food was good so I was happy. Mon Ami Gabi - Totally worth the splurge. Service was unbelievable. If you make reservations ahead of time you'll probably get a great table. Steaks were out of this world. I got the Steak Roquefort - if you like Roquefort (similar to Gorgonzola or a block of Bleu Cheese), you will love this. Definitely get steak - the fish, I'm told, was only so-so. So... do I recommend this hotel? Depends on the deal you can get. At $100/night you're going to feel like you got your money's worth. At $200/night you're going to be walking around wondering where they hid the closet and flat screen tv.", "Date": "February 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cNo Healthy Option\u201d", "Author": "Carmel32", "ReviewID": "UR24076261", "Content": "Booked Paris Las Vegas for the Superbowl.

I visited Las Vegas with a family gathering a few years ago and had the opportunity to walk through Paris and had dinner there one evening. It was lovely and I thought it would make a great vacation spot for my husband and I after our children were grown. Well, the children are now grown so we decided to celebrate New Year\u2019s Eve at Paris in Las Vegas. We expected mostly adults, maybe younger or older, but adults. What we discovered is that it must be marketed a bit different outside of the US because there were people from all over the world \u2013 nice - with their small children - not nice! The children were not so much in the casino areas but they were EVERYWHERE else! Babies in strollers, toddlers, young children, adolescents, and teens, most not understanding English. Then on New Year\u2019s Eve, some well-meaning planner came up with the bright idea to close the main street on the strip but not let people walk freely up and down Las Vegas Blvd. So you could not walk from one side of the road to the other. Then to make matters worse, they fenced off the strip hotels leaving only small access gates for thousands of people to pass through. Plenty of drinking with single serve pitchers of beer for $15, an Eiffel Tower of daiquiri for $19, and other similar drunk fest drinks and still small children all around the area. Minutes after midnight as my husband and I were making our way back to Paris after unsuccessfully seeking out the non-existent fireworks that we were told we could see from the front of the hotel, we found ourselves pushed and shoved and I ended up being a shield for two small children with their parents trying to get to Paris. A security guard finally opened another section of the fencing to let them in and fortunately I was able to pass through as well before they closed it off again. My husband and I mentioned the incident to 2 other Paris security employees that just stood and watched the action and nodded that it was an unfortunate situation but offered no solution to prevent further problems. It was sad and our entire New Year\u2019s evening was quite disappointing. Our observation is that Paris in Las Vegas wants to have it all and they are missing doing anything exceptional. Let the kids go to Orlando and let Las Vegas serve adults. Or if they want the young families, build a Disney Paris near Las Vegas. But for God\u2019s sake separate the drinking and gambling from the kid activities! It is bad for the kids and it is bad for the adults that are trying to enjoy an adult vacation without children.", "Date": "January 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Midwest", "Title": "\u201cTheir Motto is 'upgrade' !!\u201d", "Author": "greatexpectations076", "ReviewID": "UR23052505", "Content": "We stayed at the Paris from Dec 22 until check-out on Dec 27. We planned a holiday stay to accomodate one of our children's work schedule (performer at Bally's, had to work over Christmas). We chose Paris primarily because of its location, especially in terms of proximity to Ballys. My review is based on my comparative experiences of similar hotels/resorts across the US. I made reservations for our family getaway back in September and after revewing prices and options on the website decided to call the Paris reservation agent number for some assistance. I requested and reserved 2 connecting rooms, newly renovated, with a view. I was sent an email confirmation of my reservation, outlining my request. My BIG MISTAKE was in not printing a copy of the email confirmation to bring with me. Upon check-in we were surprised to be told that I had booked 2 standard rooms, with no view, and that was what I was going to get unless...(drum roll)...I wanted to UPGRADE! When I told the desk agent that I felt misled by the reservation process she became hostile and said they could pull the original telephone call to see what the agent told me. That's fine, but she said it in a manner that implied that I was lying and trying to get a deal that I hadn't reserved. We had a lunch reservation we didn't want to miss and asked her to please check the details and we would be back after lunch. The second agent was more helpful, but extremely condescending. We got the same song, second verse, with the accusation that we must have made our reservation through a wholesaler. The call was pulled and the agent told us in a curt tone that our request would be granted, EXCEPT they had no rooms available that met my orignal request! Then she tried to convince us to take the 2 standard rooms with a view of the back. Guess what? We ended up having to UPGRADE to a suite with a connecting room, for an additional $135/night. Due to the nature of the holiday and our desire to have a nice family time, we agreed. The suite was quite large and supposedly refurbished, but lacking in some details you would expect in a suite. The mini-fridge in the bar wasn't working and obviously hadn't been for months. We requested a new one and it was promptly delivered. It was ancient, like the first one and wobbled so badly we had to hold it steady when opening. After a few days it didn't work very well either. (Why refurbish the room and not include a new $100 refrigerator?). The TV's and internet connections worked off and on throughout our stay and we had to call tech support and maintenance several times for repair. Suites usually include bathrobes, but not at Paris apparently. We had a lovely view and lots of space, but it was the most ho-hum suite I ever stayed in, especially since I UPGRADED under duress. We ate at the Mon Ami Gabi restaurant several times on this trip and like all other visits it was fabulous. The hotel was packed and the line at the buffet was so long we never bothered eating there. My biggest complaint with Paris is that I felt like I was duped by the reservation process and that desk agents operate like sales staff at health clubs; they are expected to get guests to upgrade and use a list of unpleasant behaviors to make that happen. I wouldn't be surprised to find that they are getting a commission for every upgrade they sell. My family has traveled extensively and we've rarely had desk agents with worse attitudes. I wouldn't stay there again unless I was willing to take the cheapest room with the worst view and call it a day.

We have stayed at many of the resorts on the strip. Last year, we splurged and stayed at Bellagio. This year, because of my previous two trips within 2008 to Paris, I was comped almost the entire week. Our final bill was just about $200 for 7 days. I find Paris to be just what we need for a fun Vegas adventure. I LOVE the location -- right in middle of the action, front and center on the strip. A nice walk down to MGM, NY NY, Bellagio, Caesar's, Ballys and Flamingo within a 5 minute walk, and a nice walk up to Venetian, Wynn, TI and MIrage. I think the location is the #1 reason why I kept going back to Paris, along with the great room rates. The rooms are nice. Yes, they have an upgrade sheet at the Front Desk that tells you how much and for what sort of upgrade. I also get an email about a week before arrival with an upgrade opportunity. We always pass the upgrades, figuring we aren't in the room but to sleep and would rather spend the money saved on gaming or eating out at a nice restaurant. This time, we had a nice non-renovated room on the 7th floor. Our view was of the rooftop and parking garage, but that was ok -- we didn't expect a view. The room was just like the one we had in September and in April, and was in good shape for a non-renovated one. Our room was way on the other end of the corridor from the elevators, so it was very quiet in our little corner of the world. We played a lot in Paris, but found that we did better and had a bit more fun over at the connected Ballys. Since it was below average temperature wise when we were there, it was nice that Ballys is connected to Paris -- no outside walking in the cold and rain. I love the gaming atmosphere of both properties and we did pretty well both on the slots as well as the table games. We had the Paris breakfast buffet almost every morning we were there. For $14.95, it is a good deal and good food. I love the eggs benedict. They also have a cook to order egg station and cook to order crepe station. We ate a sensible breakfast, trying not to stuff ourselves, and found we weren't hungry until dinner. Don't forget to show your Total Rewards card when you pay for breakfast, you can earn points by eating as well as playing! One evening, we ate at Mon Ami Gabi. We requested, and received, a table out on the terrace underneath the heated poles. We had a fantastic view of the Bellagio Fountains, which made the dinner even more special. The meal itself was out of this world. One of the best dining experiences I've had in Vegas. Very nice! And the price was within reason for Vegas standards. We also ate a few nights at the Bellagio Buffet -- I would recommend that as well. I can't wait to go back and already planning a trip for April with a girlfriend. Since I will probably get comped again and with the awesome location, it is a safe bet we'll end up at Paris again! If I had to make one constructive criticism -- the pillows were not that comfy...but the king-sized bed had a swarm of pillows and after a night or two, my husband and I had found the pillows that were right for us!

One of the best things about the hotel is that you did not have to walk through the middle of the casino to get to the room elevators or to the reception area from the main doors. There were also a large variety of places to eat within the hotel (including a great chocolate shop, a good creperie, and a nice bakery). Bally's was a comfortable walk and also had several places to eat (the portions at the Sidewalk Cafe there were enormous!). The free shuttle to the RIo also stops right outside. Food was a bit on the pricey side, but this is Vegas. I thought the Crepes were reasonable and the cafe and bakery were not bad. My mom and I starting splitting meals, which was not a problem with most places and provided more than enough for both of us to eat. My only complaint was that we were there during a very large conference, and I felt that I was constantly getting run over while walking in the hotel. The theming in the hotel is awesome, and it is true to Europe in the summer: small pathways and lots of people makes terrible gridlock! Also, there are timeshare salespeople hanging out in the middle of the most crowded throughway, and they made it worse! Overall, I would come back to the Paris again for a good price. It is probably not worth the non discounted rack rate that they charge, but the theming, food variety, and location make it a solid overall choice. I would highly suggest sitting on the patio at Mon Ami Gabi at night and watching the Bellagio fountains while eating one of their incredible desserts!", "Date": "December 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jensen Beach, Florida", "Title": "\u201cExpected More\u201d", "Author": "doloresandjeff", "ReviewID": "UR22749820", "Content": "Arrived 12/7 for 5 night stay.

We were told that because of low occupancy, rooms at end of hallways has trouble with hot water (we were in 3024). After 2 nights of this nonsense we asked to move to a room with hot water. We were changed to 3030 which was on the back side of the hotel where I enjoyed watching the planes. This was also supposed to be a renovated room but the chipped chocolate paint and terrible caulking job made me think of a Motel 6. Flat pillows, holes in the sheets, face cloths made of cotton and polyester (which were dingy white) and the mattresses all left me wondering why this hotel was rated as 4 star. The buffet was good, the atmosphere in the gaming area was nice, and housekeeping staff accomodating. It seems many hotels have renovated to the modernistic, asian type decor. I didn't like it and felt it wasn't a good fit with the theme of the hotel.

Our room was fine, but not great. For our cheap rate we got one of the older rooms, with a view of a parking garage. ( We had to re-check in when our departing flight had problems. The desk clerk took pity on us and gave us an older room, but with an Eiffle Tower, strip and pool view for only $90/night. Fabulous. Pay extra money for this view if you have to. We left the curtains open the whole time to take it all in.) There are newer, updated rooms that are more chic, and less \"shabby Versailles\" which is what I would call ours. If you look on their website, the featured room is one of their updated ones (a friend of ours stayed in one, very nice.) Our beds were comfortable, the bathroom was large with a nice, glassed-in shower. The toiletries were not really up-to-snuff for a hotel that promotes itself as 4-star. The worst thing about our room is that after the second day, it got a \"dirty diaper\" smell ( not the good view room.) We didn't complain as we we thought it might have come from some leftovers we brought in (though we realized later it didn't) and we didn't notice it after being in the room for a little while. So, we didn't give the hotel the option to make it right. The casino was so smoky that we didn't spend much time in it. I have spent time in several of the casinos on the strip. MGM Grand and Bellagio in particular do a great job of filtering out the smoky smell. Not Paris. Me and my non-smoking friends got scratchy throats and burning eyes if we spent too much time in this casino. The food options in the hotel are really quite good. Mon Ami Gabi, with it's heated patio facing the Bellagio fountains, is a nice place to eat in the evening, and you can hear the music from the fountains, so it is really fun and festive. The food is good, too. Not spectacular, but definitely worth the price. The 24-hour cafe served up great fish and chips, and burgers with fries late night. The pastry shops have really nice bread, and I got a wonderful prosciuto crepe at the creperie one morning for breakfast. There are also some nice shops in the fake European village that takes you through the back and into Bally's (another horribly smoky casino.) Although we did have a nice stay here, it is not really suited for people looking for a hip, happening vibe. Every time we came back to the hotel, we commented on returning to the \"grandma\" place.

Having traveled to France and Europe before, I have to say that when you are in Paris Hotel, you think you are really in France. You have to do the Eiffel Tower at Paris. It is so nice. I enjoyed eating at one of the best buffets ever, \"Le Village Buffet\" in Paris. It is about $25 p/p and worth every bit of the money. The dessert station is decadent and the service is top notch. The french cuisine is so good. You must also try the crepe station!! I would highly recommend this hotel to everyone. The hotel sits in the center of the \"Las Vegas Strip\" and are close to everything. If you want to go to Rio (another Harrah's property) there is a free shuttle from Paris that will take you there. Once you get to Rio you can take another free shuttle to Bally's and Harrah's. Paris is right next door to the new Miracle Mile shops and Planet Hollywood (the old Aladdin hotel and casino).

The room had a seperate shower/tub, huge lcd and hipper decor, that was nicer, yet still warm. After check-in, we went to a nice little cafe in the corridor leading from Paris to Ballys where we both had good quality and very generous portion sandwiches (lox & roast beef); Following this, we hit the Paris gaming hall, where the cocktail servers were super impressive in terms of efficient offerings and the gaming areas are well spaced. Friday morning was a run down to the book, where the older gentlemen working there were personable, but the younger guys had indifferent attitudes; Breakfast was at Paris' buffet (they have awesome java and desserts), where we enjoyed a good meal and drink service was impressive (special note: If you game at a Harrahs location, sign up for a free card, as it will enhance your entry shall you reach a higher level); Following this, we headed to the MGM via the monorail to pickup our fight tix (Re: the monorail, if you will use a few times, get the 3 day pass, well worth it). We gamed at MGM and their drink service was slow and it was extremely smoky and really hot in there. We left there and headed back to our hotel to game and take a rest before getting ready for a evening dinner at the Eiffel Tower restaurant. When arriving at the restaurant at our reserved time, we were met by smiling personnel who were also professional in demeanor; We did not know that we were to be in for a truly signature meal at this romantic place; Our seating was overlooking the fountain show, which is a marvel in itself and the service and food, particularly the filet/crab and bleu cheese pudding soufflet appetizer, were just dynamite (special note, if you drink vino, the bottles are on the pricey side). This meal was a gem; If you enjoy fine dining, this is a MUST-DO and is not simply a restaurant based on the vanity of the Tower experience, which is really cool in itself; Following this, we gamed on the main floor and headed to Ballys (conveniently located through a connecting tunnel with shoppes/restaurants) where we had a fun time listening to a fun, versatile band in the Indigo lounge (free, so-so waitress speed, though they were spread thin) and let me just say that the people watching was second to none. You name it (demographic), we seen it, in a fun way! We closed them down and walked through the walkway, past our favorite novelty slots and headed to our room. The next morning, after hitting the sports book for a minute, we returned to the Paris buffet and enjoyed mimosas and great service. We had just went to Bellagio to view the beautiful Christmas displays and peek in at the boutiques (where there were sales galore); Following breakfast/lunch, we gamed and got ready for the fight, where Oscar subsequently got beat and quit. We did get to see a scumbag wannabe gangster rapper at the MGM try to instigate a fight with a much older man after the fight, who was classy and ignored the thug. We took the monorail back to Paris and gamed yet again, where my girl celebrated her Pacquaio winnings (1st book bet ever for her!). After gaming and more speedy beverage service, we called it a night. Sunday led us to field trip to Harrahs on the monorail where we walked over to Venetian for a lunch and were told there was no buffet there, so we went to Wynn, where we waited an hour (would never do for food again), yet had a high quality assortment of food to choose from and have to say, it made the wait worth the time...thankfully! We enjoyed the walk out of the Wynn, as there is some great mosaic tile to view amongst the gardens etc... We went back to Paris, and hit the Ballys gaming floor where the return was generous and the atmosphere was old-school fun Vegas, and I would say everyone should play here at least once. After a fulfilling night, we slept a couple hours, did quick check out (dropping keycards in a box right outside the elevator) and jumped on a plane where it is recommended to fly out early, especially if on a sun/mon, as the airport becomes a zoo quickly. The personnel there were efficient and personable. Overall, the trip was a pleasure and Paris contributed quite heavily to that!

So, on a Saturday night I couldn\u2019t unpack and ended up sleeping in my room - your loss Paris. Sunday I was busy moving and unpacking - so didn\u2019t bet on football games - your loss Paris. I lost a day of my vacation. I was offered a smoking suite for 1st night at an additional $235/night. My husband is a Harrah\u2019s Platinum Level Player. Rooms 1st night room with double beds was cramped. Bed skirt was so wrinkled that I sprayed some of my Downy wrinkle releaser on it. Room given 2nd day was better. Comfortable chair and French styled bench loveseat. Same room they show on web site. View was of a half concrete wall which was probably put there to block the spotlights on the ugly roof below. Could have had room with a view for $60/night. Amenities? No coffee maker, no refrigerator. Called & informed no coffee makers unless you are on floors 6 & 7 or floors 12 and above. My recovering broken toes were not going to hobble at 6 a.m. downstairs for coffee. \u00bd mile down the Strip is a Walgreens - my hubby picked up a coffeemaker for $10. We brought our own Starbucks from home. There is NO Starbucks at Paris or Bally\u2019s. I also brought along a fold flat insulated cooler. Mini Bar is huge and you cannot store anything in it or you will be plagued by the mini bar lady or charged. Big note on supplies - Next door at Miracle Mile Shops is a store called ABC. Very reasonably priced soda, liquor, beer, coffee - you name it. Food Small Food places such as Creperie, Pastry shop & JJ\u2019s - expect $10 per sandwich or crepe - very tasty & Big. Le Burger Brasserie was great. If you are a sports fan, the main TV screen is HUGE. You can get a burger for about $10 & up but they are BIG. Buffet - disappointing - $25 for dinner of dried out food under a heat lamp. Their little quiches are enough to turn you off of quiche for a lifetime. Eiffel Tower restaurant - want to save money? Go there for lunch - very good food. Room service was OK for breakfast but the hash browns were horrible. Food next door --- Paris is connected to Bally\u2019s - There\u2019s a walk up Deli sandwich place called \u201cThe Nosh\u201d $3. for breakfast sandwich, $7. for lunchtime sub which was so big I could only eat half for a meal. Good thing I brought that cooler. Other side of Paris is Planet Hollywood and Miracle Mile shops - they have a Trader Vic\u2019s outdoors where you can see the Bellagio fountains. Happy hour is 3 till 6 pm. $5 baskets of chicken wings and calamari. 2 for 1 well drinks. Get a map at Miracle Mile & there\u2019s a coupon for 2 for 1 Mai Tai\u2019s at Trader Vic\u2019s. Food other places this trip. There\u2019s a Mexican Restaurant at Luxor that is fantastic - best Margarita I have ever had & water glass size. We also went to Batista\u2019s Hole in the Wall behind Bill\u2019s Gambling Hall on Flamingo that was old style Italian, lots of fun with plenty of wine and classic old accordion player that was a hoot. Casino Slots were tight at Paris - I heard there were 2 Royal Flushes hit the 1st night I was there after a long previous dry spell. Had better luck at Bally\u2019s. Gustav\u2019s video poker bar was typical video poker bar. Le Caberet was better. Female bartenders - Tiffany & ??? were fun and gave fantastic service. The music at Le Caberet was great - the band was called Odyssey. They also have Dueling Pianos at a club called Napoleon that has a cigar area. Sports book bar is a joke. They have TV screens around the perimeter of the bar up at the ceiling. I think it would take a day to un-crink your neck if you watched a game there. Shows - we checked out the Price is Right stage show at Bally\u2019s - FUN. This past March we saw Bette Midler at Ceasar\u2019s which was fantastic. Transportation Shuttle from Paris will take you to Rio (have stayed at Rio at least 10 times - 650 ft. open room suites). Rio has shuttles to Ceasar\u2019s, Harrah\u2019s & Paris. We took Presidential Limo from airport because Vegas\u2019s new method of renting cars stinks. However, on the way back to the airport, the limo driver dropped us off 5 exits from our airline. I wrote them about it upon my return - no answer as of yet. Big shout out to Trans Air Airlines - 1st time flyer with them. Upgrade to Business Class is $99. Free Cocktails and comfy seats. If you\u2019re going to do cocktails - drinks are $6 in coach - so figure how many cocktails you want and the price reduces! Ha Ha. On my 4 hour flight out to Vegas, I was able to reduce my price pretty well. They also have Satellite radio on board for free for all passengers - Nice! The Stews were awesome. Miscellaneous My MAJOR advice to anyone who stays at one of the 6 Harrah\u2019s owned hotels in Vegas on a regular basis is to get the Harrah\u2019s Total Rewards Visa Card. Every Dollar you spend gets you a bonus point on your players card. We pay for regular living expenses through our card and end up with lots of Total Rewards points to cash in. Then in Vegas, charge everything to your room and then apply your points to your bill before you leave. We lived very well for 6 days and everything we charged to our room was paid for by our points. (over $450). In addition, our rooms were comp\u2019d for 5 days because of my husband\u2019s platinum level playing. I really do like the ambience of Paris\u2019s Casino & Restaurant & shopping area. Old European cobble stone streets and walls that look like you are in a Paris Village.

Check-in went smoothly - - less than 5 minutes. At the time of the reservation I requested a standard, non-smoking, renovated room. At the time of check-in, we were told it would be an additional $40/night for a renovated room. We turned this down. The room we got was quite comfortable although did show some wear. Definitely nothing fancy and wouldn't have been fancy at the time of opening in 1998, but it was clean. We found the mattresses to be hard even though my husband and I have a firm mattress at home. The bathroom has a separate tub from the shower and it's nothing special. There is a blow dryer and typical amenities such as shower gel, shampoo and conditioner. Be prepared to pay for anything you move in the in-room refrigerator. We didn't get sucked in but have read about it in the other reviews of this property. EVERYTHING is very expensive - - not just at Paris but all over Vegas, especially on the strip. We ate at the LeCreperie 3 mornings. A crepe is $9 and that is all you get is the crepe with whatever filling you choose. Your drink costs extra (minimum $3). The breakfast buffet is $15. The buffet line was very long every time we passed by it at various hours. We did not eat at the buffet so cannot comment. We ate at LeCafe for 2 evening meals and although the food was above average, it is VERY expensive. Beware that bottled water is a minimum of $3 ($4 for a large) everywhere on the strip unless you go to a CVS or Walgreens. The same size water downtown is 2/$1.00. No kidding! We say head downtown even if you stay on the strip. We did the $5/day (24-hour period) Deuce (bus) on and off privileges and found it very accommodating. We had the best prime rib meal we've ever had at Magnolia's at the Four Queens (downtown). Prime rib, potatoe, vegetables, dinner salad and rolls for $7.99. You won't regret it. Excellent! Four Queens also gives you a deck of playing cards for signing up for their player's club. Over at Binion's, you get a free Vegas photograph of yourself and/or spouse, a deck of playing cards and it's easy to win a t-shirt. I think I played less than $20. Also, the Plaza is easy to win a t-shirt for playing little. There is nothing for free (even if you gamble) on the strip. In my opinion, Vegas is going in the wrong direction. There is no money to be won and there are NO freebies like it used to be even 5 years ago, let alone 20 years ago when we went for the first time. Also, there is no need to take dress-up clothes because you will look out of place. Everyone is in jeans or sweatpants - - even at the high end places. As for shows: We saw Jubilee at Bally's and it is quite the production of old-time Vegas. Well worth the time and money (if you use the 2 for 1 coupon you receive upon check-in). We also saw Mystere at Treasure Island and it was fabulous, if you can afford it. Actually the best value for your money is to be entertained by the shows in Vegas and forget the gambling because you won't get anything in return. We didn't see anyone win any significant money - - $5, $25, maybe $100. Plan on losing anything you gamble and plan on spending a lot of money to be fed. Have fun and enjoy!!!!!!

Arrived at the paris about 2pm after a 5 minute cab ride from the airport(15$)and asked about upgrading at check in to a renovated room(well if you dont ask you dont get).Had read other reviews about the 20$ tip but we were quoted 60$ per night and decided to take a look at the standard room.Our room was located on the fifth floor room 349 and we were pleasantly surprised with what we found.Although not the greatest view in the world the room was clean and tidy with a fab bathroom.The tv had a few news channels,weather channel,vh1 music and if u.s football is your thing(im a big fan)you can catch the game on c.b.s or espn.Didnt touch the mini bar having read other reviews! The casino in the paris is certainly one of the smallest on the strip which we didnt mind one bit although we tended to walk through to ballys(connected to the paris)most days, we seemed to have more luck there.Didnt eat in the paris at all but the buffet always seemed quite busy(discounts at tix 4 tonight on the strip)and most of the other restaurants(eiffel tower and mon ami)were very pricey.The paris is all about the location which is the best on the strip by far. Restaurants- P.F.CHANGS Located in the planet hollywood hotel you simply cannot afford to miss this place.The best chinese food i have ever tasted,great service and great value(100$ for the four of us!!).If chinese is your thing you must try this place. CHINA STAR BUFFET Stay away is all i can say.This place is the pits, walked out after five mins after discovering the entire buffet was stone cold and looked days old.Should of realised as we were the only ones in there! PLANET HOLLYWOOD Located in the forum shops at ceasars palace.Mediocre and a bit pricey.Wouldnt put you off but wouldnt reccomend either. MIRACLE MILE SHOPS We ate in a small italian restaurant located opposite the v theatre inside the miracle mile shops at planet hollywood.The pasta here was great and this place is well worth a visit. We ate our breakfast most mornings in mcdonalds for convenience(why cant we get hotcakes in the uk)and one day we ate lunch at panda express which was fab. SHOWS/TRIPS- PAPILLON HELICOPTERS Had been reviewing the grand canyon helicopter tours for weeks before we left and this company had some bad reviews.We booked our tour on the strip when we got there and paid 334$ per person to go on the sapphire skies trip.Picked up on time by limo we arrived at the airport and to my horror discovered we were flying with papillon(had booked with grand canyon helicopter tours).Had nothing to worry about the whole experience from start to finish was unbelievable.Were originally going to book to land in the canyon but discovered if you dont you get more time in the air(1 1/2 hours).This is a once in a lifetime experience and i fully recommend the sapphire skies trip. STEVE WYRICK-REAL MAGIC Couldnt decide which show to see but on the strip there are five tix 4 tonight booths were you can buy show tickets at half price on the day(hence i wouldnt book any shows before you go).Were planning to see lance burton(no half price tickets)originally but decided to save $40 each and see the steve wyrick show which was a mistake in hindsight.The theatre wasnt even half full(holds 500)which wasnt a good sign and although it wasnt too bad i would pay the extra next time and see lance burton. EIFFEL TOWER My girlfriend had this on her to do list but unfortunately it never got crossed off.Due to inclement weather they closed the eiffel tower for the last two days of our stay and we never got a chance.so dont put this off get up there while the sun is shining. Overall my first las vegas experience was fantastic and i cant wait to go back.Although i would stay in the paris again i would probably choose planet hollywood next time as it is still a great location(right next door)but a bit more modern.If money is no object and you want the best the wynn and the palazzo were out of this world but not in the best location.", "Date": "November 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cWaiter tried to rip us off.

We had to change rooms once as she gave us nonsmoking after asking me 3 times what we wanted. Room service was nice & fast but expensive. We did not touch anything in the spenda-bar as there was no price list. Ate at the caf\u00e9 right outside the elevators twice, the food is always good there.

It took a lot of arguing to fix a $15 tip for a $18 meal??? Finally she took it off my bill after screwing around for 20 min. Wouldn\u2019t comp anything else though for the trouble or anything. After gambling over 2k between Harrahs properties you think I could have gotten a $60 food bill comped. Also had to fight with the rewards people because SOMEHOW 5K of my points keeps disappearing. Thought we had it straight but still not fixed. This actually started last year. The casino was cheap once again because of G2E I think, as I was there again today & was actually winning.

I don't know where the idea of tipping the front desk clerk $20 for an upgrade comes from. They have published rates that they keep behind the counter if you want to upgrade. I got a good price on a consolidator website, but the upgrade to a view room is $65 per night and if you want one of the remodeled rooms you'll pay $100 per night more. We did this and had a great view of the Bellagio fountains. The standard room was small for the money, regular sized bath tub was disappointing, separate shower was nice. The food selection in the multiple restaurants was great and the Eiffel Tower Restaurant dinner experience was pricey but worth it. Go early, get a window table overlooking the fountains. The pool is heated but definately not warm (every guest who ventured in within earshot commented on the temp). Sterile surroundings, all concrete with little privacy landscaping. The Nov days were unseasonably warm (high 70's) and they only had one side of the pool open. The lone \"lifeguard\" yelled from her perch at anyone who dared to go in the other side having not seen the small posted sign that that side of the pool was closed. The pool restaurant was closed even though there were more than 100 guests at the pool and the bar was closed intermittently because the bartender \"had to take a break\". It makes sense to limit offerings when they are not in demand. But for the price guests were paying they should have found a way to staff the pool and f&b outlets.

The location is in one of the nicest areas of the strip with Bellagio and Caesar's Palace across the street. We received a $50/night decrease in mom's room rate by using her Harrah's Total Rewards number when making the website reservations. I think the meeting paid $164/night for our room. The professional check-in staff was able to assign us adjoining standard rooms on the 16th floor (1668 and 1670), a non-smoking floor. We were offered rooms on the newly remodeled floors for $40/night extra, but declined and were glad we did. The rooms we had were lovely, with tasteful French decor, not new, but not worn, and had nice fabrics. One a king, the other two queens (that's how all the adjoining rooms are), spacious, room safe, mini-bar, very comfortable beds, exceptionally clean, no odors, no noise from other rooms, and a pretty bathroom with new marble-tile shower and separate tub. Had a regular tv as opposed to flat screen in the remodeled rooms, but that didn't matter to us. Maid service was unobtrusive. Room service (two breakfasts) was quick and the food good. Seems like a well run hotel. Our only complaint was the loud two booms every 30 minutes from the water show of the Bellagio across the street...I wouldn't have wanted to be in the wing of the hotel closer to the Bellagio (imagine the music accompanying the show would have been annoying). The models of the Arc di Triomph and Eiffel Tower are impressive, and beautifully lit at night. They are 2/3 and 1/2, respectively, the scale of the originals. The Versailles Hall of Mirrors decor in the check in area was also beautiful. The French theme is well done in the shopping mall and restaurants, tho' the continuous French music is a bit much at times. All the staff in the cafes and shops were patient and friendly. We ate early dinners twice at Mon Ami Gabi, the sidewalk cafe, but chose the lovely inside seating because of the traffic noise on Las Vegas Blvd. Good atmosphere (linen tablecloths and candlelight), great wait staff, and the shrimp cocktails, crab cake, and fish and chips were excellent. Dinner with wine came to about $120 without tip for the three of us (would have been more except that mom-in-law only ate salads). Avoid the Le Village Buffet restaurant; ate there twice for lunch: much of the food was cold and tasteless, or else over-spiced, and it was noisy and hectic. The casino was pretty with the three-story sky painted ceiling and outdoor cafes lining it. Cigarette smoke was faintly detectable, much better ventilation than previous trips years ago to Vegas, tho' our eyes were slightly reddened the entire trip. The casino and entire hotel were clean; after a trip to the seedy Riviera to see La Cage, we appreciated the Paris even more. Mom spent a good bit of time on the machines and got excited when she won $120 on a penny machine...it made quite a bit of noise and took a long time to ring up 12,000 pennies, which thrilled her. The convention center rooms were beautiful, elegant, like Versailles, and well run (good audio-visual dept). My husband didn't like the charge for the business center use, came to $50 for five sessions. Spent one afternoon at the lovely, spacious pool area. Weather was 75 degrees with low humidity; it was peaceful (no kids), and very good pina coladas. We would stay at the Paris again; they do a good job for the convention attendees and had a more professional clientele than some other hotels. Beware the taxi rip-offs of driving blocks out of the way to run up the fare; I posted on the forum site about this. It shouldn't cost more than $14 for the trip in from the airport.

I was glad we chose the Paris as it was in the perfect strip location, central right opposite the Bellagio, and we found the hotel itself to be superb - very smart and well looked after! The check in (Thursday afternoon) was quick and easy, no queue and the staff friendly. We booked a standard room and we were on the 21st floor and found our room to be perfect - comfortable, clean, spacious and well tended to by our maids all week. The view wasnt great but why pay extra for that when you dont spend much time in the room anyway - there is too much else to do and see. The casino was large and we found the dealers to be friendly and talkative, the drinks ladies were good and seemed to come round quite regularly and we also had small wins on the slots in the Paris once or twice. A tip for the dealers if your winning and the drinks ladies when your drinks come is appreciated. Roulette tables at the Paris are mostly minimum $10 bets so if you dont want to gamble that much go to Bills round the corner which are $5. Breakfast buffet is good, long queues at the weekend but not so bad during the week. They change to lunch at 11am so try to get there before 10am to get a better selection. It is $16 - eat all you like. On the one morning we decided against the buffet we bought a croissant and a juice each in the Boulangerie but that came to $8 each which we thought quite expensive so opted back to the buffet after that. The Italian restaurant opposite the buffet is divine for dinner - lovely pasta dishes!!! Eating out in Vegas we thought was pretty expensive in general. Pool was large on the 3rd floor roof terrace and there were plenty of sunloungers and room to put them out and the hotel supply plenty of clean towels so no need to take your own pool towels. Eiffel Tower view from the pool is fab and we found it all to be clean and well kept. Things like snacks and water in the hotel and mini bar are very expensive so get them outside of the hotel when you can.

All employees we came in contact with were pleasant, and they didn't use the fake French accent! The passageway to Bally's is very convenient, and the location just can't be beat.

We understand it was an accident (the housekeepers are the only staff that were friendly) - but the dissapointing part is how we were treated when we reported the problem. Not only did they blow us off, the Managers yelled at us on the phone, blamed us, and hung up on us --- very rude!!! People here DON'T CARE. We requested for a return call to resolve the problem but no one did. Don't bring back left over food - they charge $2.00 for each borrowed item (fork, spoon, knife, plate, glass, etc).

No': their is no coffee service in the rooms any more, to remedy that I traveled with a small coffee pot ,packed my coffee in plastic bags and my cup was ready in the morning. No big deal. Yes,. the buffet seems to be missing something but where are you going to get that kind of selection for that price. The lines were long every day, so the price must be right. Now I did not say perfect. The Italian restaurant accross the walkway was this time absolutely horrible. They must have changed hands or something it was bad. The only good part was the wonderful tennors that sang. They deserved thier tips and I'm sure they are not getting enough of them. Now on to the gambling in the casino, tight, tighter and winning at the slots is almost impossible. Paris and Ballys, you my as well take your money and throw it on the floor and leave. Everyone was complaining. They are not letting you leave with even a little bit. My husband and I had a car rental and headed to freemont street where we ended up having a ball. We won every night. We also were surprised with a wonderful restaurant in the Golden Nuget called the Grotto. The food, service, waiters were outstanding. We ate their 3 nights the food was that good. Also would not hesitate to stay at the Golden Nuget. It was the diamond of the district. The casino, restaurant, pool, aquarium and the warmth of the whole place was great. You also have all of those casinos at your feet without having to get back in the car. So the location of the Paris is still great I will say it's not what it was but take a look at some of the other casinos in that price range. You'll still pick the Paris and no matter it still has the bang for the buck. Here is hoping that they meaning the casinos realize that we travel their to gamble be treated like a king and queen and walk home with the feeling I want to go back. That feeling is only if I win the lottery . So Las Vegas, please wake up. The middle class is what built that town. We would like to come back and I know you want us.

I knew it was early, but since I'm a diamond member I thought I'd see if the lady in diamond services might accidentally have a room available. To my surprise, one was available and she put me in a remodeled one at that. The room itself was very nice and clean. The bathroom had a separate bathtub and standup shower. Not as nice or large as the bathrooms at Caesars Palace Augustus Tower, but still very nice. The bed was more than comfortable enough and the room also had a small couch which I only used to pile my suitcase on. It also had a very nice flat screen television, mini-bar (I never opened having heard all the horror stories) and a safe which I made use of. I tried two restaurants at Paris, one being the buffet for breakfast which I found to be nothing special. I also had breakfast one morning at a basic cafe next to the buffet which was also adequate. Not a whole of restaurant offerings at Paris which appealed to me to be quite honest. I found the gambling to be pretty similar to other Harrah's properties on the strip. Fifteen dollar tables were hard to find at night. Most everything was 25. I spent a lot of time at the poker bar and putting down the beers. Actually did fairly well at them. Saw several people hitting jackpots, unfortunately I wasn't one of them, though I didn't do too badly. I enjoyed the poker bar in the race and sports book, though they put the TV's very high on the wall in there. It's kind of like sitting in the front row of the theater.

The air conditioning was wonderfully cool. The beds were comfortable. We didn't hear any noise from neighboring rooms. Housekeeping did a fine job daily. The elevators were quick. Check-out was hassle-free and done via the TV in the room. As for other aspects of the hotel, the pool was nice with lots of available seating. The water was very cold though...probably the coldest pool I have ever felt. We ate the buffet almost daily. We enjoyed it for breakfast because it had an omelet station and a variety of other items. We didn't care for it as much at dinner time because it had very unique foods and we would rather more plain cooking. Also, alot of the items seemed cold at dinner time. It's a deal though because for the price you get everything including your drinks. The crepes were a nice treat. The casino was very smoky but otherwise fine.

We went to 14 casinos in our 5 nights there, but the atmosphere and people there leave something to be desired. First, it was our honeymoon and we were first time visitors. We are both well traveled and being from florida, we know what is good and bad service. Ours started out the latter, with check-in. The valet, bellmen and front desk clerk did not give us any info on how to recieve our bags, and after 30 minutes, we called to find out they didn't bring them up to us until we call. Now it wasn't busy 6pm at check in and you think they might have had a better system in getting your bags to you. The clerk at check in (Jorge)seemed bored, unattentive and he seemed to just be on autopilot. We were the only people in the 10 minutes it took to check in, to need anything from the front desk. Second, I have read the rooms evidently on the higher floors were renovated recently. Well , ours was on the 15th (1574) and we had one that was warn and beat up. Mind you the view was of the partial fountains and pool area, and was pretty. We stayed for 5 nights and after the 3rd night we started to find things wrong in the room. Towels had mold, stains and holes on them. Garbage was found in the nightstand (used kleenex and soda bottles) and behind the towels in the bathroom. Floors were dirty and sheets were worn and had holes in them. We notified the front desk and eventually the housekeeping floor super came by to see. She was a non factor because after being told it would be better cleaned, the garbage remained for two more days. There's a good chance it could still be there. Front desk was not very helpful either. On our second to last night, we were gambing at the connected casino (Bally's) and due to review guidelines, an incident happened that we can't mention, but made national news. Check it out online. Now its not the hotels fault but the security could be better and keeping incidents like this one from happening so close to the guests and lobby.

This web site has been very helpful in choosing my upcoming vacation. Thought this information on this recent trip to Vegas and other trips to Vegas would be helpful. My wife and I love Las Vegas we go mostly for the pools and the nightlife not so much for gambling. It\"s a quick 4 day vacation, we have stayed in many different Hotels, the best Hotel has been Ceasars but right now there is construction going on, building a new tower by the pool do not know if the tower will block the sun. If you stay there I recommend you stay in the (Palace Towers) it is right by the pool entrance, you don't have to walk through the Hotel to get there like many of the other Hotels. Pure Night club was very expensive, no seating at all unless you go for the bottled service, starting at $400.00 per bottle, you will get a seat and a hostess to wait on you. recommend cleopatra barge no cover charge live band and can sit and dance. Paris hotel our last visit rooms not so clean, the pool was very plain, but roomy. Most Hotels set up chairs so close you can't move, so this was nice about Paris Pool. We took a small cooler this trip, the best thing we did, filled up with bottled water and beer with plastic cups. The drinks again at the pool are quite expensive. MGM pool is nice but long walk through everything just to get there. Had good time at Studio 54. Luxor, bad experience , hallways and rooms not cleaned, had to keep asking to clean. Went to Ra nightclub it was really good. The Rio Hotel has a great bar called the Voodu Lounge it's very high up and overlooks the city, beautiful at night. Everything seems to get more expensive, one more recommendation, taxis at airport seem to take the long way to Hotel, but on the way back to the airport the short way.

I was really looking forward to staying at the Paris for the first time. Previously I had stayed at the Mirage and Venetian. We booked a Calais Suite for just under $700/night. This is not chump change. We walked into the suite and found it to be rather small. As others have mentioned, the furniture and carpet were so shabby and dirty, I wouldn't let my dog sit on it. The sofa was particularly disgusting. Buttons were missing from the tufted upholstery and fabric was pilling on the chairs. The thing that really got me was that for $670/night you did not even get a robe or slippers to use. The design of the bathroom was strange. There is a tub in the main bathroom, but to shower you had to use the guest bathroom. We called to the front desk to convey our disappointment about the condition, size and lack of amenities in the suite. A very nice person named \"Brie\" said that there was a larger suite available for a \"nominal charge. \" She checked with the general manager and said the \"nominal charge\" would be an additional $250/night! We said that adding $1000 to our bill was unacceptable, so she suggested we take a standard room. Why would we do that? We headed to the pool and couldn't believe that they use the cheapest of cheap chaise lounges; the kind with plastic straps across the frame that often break. Yes, many of them had broken straps in stragetic places, if you know what I mean. Instead of eating and balancing food on my lap, I decided to go over to the poolside restaurant for lunch. The decor is very low-end with cheap furniture and a basic sunshade overhead. I ordered a cobb salad. The waiter brought it to me in a plastic take-out bowl complete with plastic lid. I said, \"Doesn't it come on a plate?\" He replied, \"This is basically fast food here.\" I was flabergasted. I remembered many a lovely lunch I had at the Mirage poolside restaurant under a gorgeous palapa served in style. The salad wasn't very good; using common mixed greens that were not crisp. Overall I have to say that this property has somehow managed to fool the general population into believing it is a nice upscale property when it's not. Your money is much better spent on properties that care about their reputation and offer some value like the Bellagio, Venetian, Mirage and others. The one positive I can say is that the breakfast buffet had good variety, quality and value.", "Date": "September 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ankeny, Iowa", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel service and location\u201d", "Author": "Abeach4me", "ReviewID": "UR20365031", "Content": "We stayed at the Paris hotel in Las Vegas for 5 days over the weekend of September 20, 2008. The first thing about the hotel is it's great location. Directly across the street from the Bellagio, the Paris is in walking distance (long walks, Vegas style) to Caeser's Palace, New York, MGM Grand, etc. Connected directly to Bally's, the hotel offers first class accomodations and finishes. We spent the weekend with friends, and each day enjoyed the weather by the pool. The pool area is extremely well done, sitting on the roof in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower. Because of its location, surrounded on two sides by the hotel, and the Eiffel Tower on the 3rd side, you are able to enjoy the sun, and also use the shade from the buildings and tower when the tan starts to turn to burn. Well laid out, with plenty of room to have private conversations, and more chairs than were ever used. The pool service was fantastic, with a different waitress each day, all of them were personable and very attentive to our needs. I read on this site that drinks by the pool were expensive, however, 16 oz. Bud Lights were $7 each, or a bucket of 5 for $30 (of which we consumed many). As usual in Vegas, there were no hassles, no ID required, plentiful towels, and an outdoor restaurant (try the nachos). Check-in took us 5 minutes. Request one of the remodeled rooms, as there is a great difference in the quality of the finish. While all rooms I was in were clean, our remodeled room was beautiful and included a 42\" plasma HD TV, while the non-remodeled rooms were slightly dated and had a 27\" tube TV (not that you'll spend much time watching). Breakfast took a wait in a line at the buffet restaurant, some of the smaller specialty shops weren't as bad. We found ourselves going off site all but one day to avoid the lines. There are many assorted shops available, a quality cigar stand, a bloody mary and screwdriver booth in one of the shop halls during the mornings. We listened to a fantastic rock band at one of the bars one night, and found all of the dining areas to be well staffed. Checkout, of course, was painless, done on your TV in the room. Our limo driver, Brad, was unbelievable. If you want a limo service, contact me and I will give you his number. Funny, friendly and quiet when you wanted him to be.

We upgraded to the Eiffel Tower view which was well worth the extra $50 per night because we were also able to enjoy the Bellagio water show. The lovely lady that checked us in to room 2605 said the room had been recently re-decorated. The 26th floor was perfect because we had a bank of elevators that serviced from the 26th floor to the top floor, so we were always the first stop going up. The only stop coming down was for the floor the pool was on, and the only time we stopped there was because we chose that floor. We always had an elevator arrive in about 30 seconds. For another additional $15 per night, we upgraded to a concierge package which included a continental breakfast (fruit, sweet rolls, bagels, yogurt parfaits, cold cereals & juices) on the 31st floor and hors d'oeuvres (fruit, shrimp, finger sandwiches, hot pasta dish & desserts) and two alcoholic drinks per person from 5pm to 8pm each evening. There was an honor card to fill out to have your alcoholic beverages charged to your room. At check in, I recalled being told our package included two alcoholic beverages per person. I asked the concierge and he looked in his computer and said our package did include the beverages, so we did not need to fill the form out, so keep that in mind if you go with this package. You serve yourself from the buffet line, but you are expected to leave a tip on your table. I thought the room was very nice. The decor was not traditional \"French\" decor. It was decorated in tans, browns and reds with contemporary furniture instead of the blue and cream Victorian type furniture I saw on other floors. The bathroom was the first room off the entry. It was roomy and had a marble vanity with one sink and marble stand alone shower. There was a separate standard tub, and I did not notice any jets in it. There was a lighted magnified make-up mirror on the bathroom wall. There was no mirror outside of the bathroom, so there was no place to style your hair or put on your make-up while your partner is using the bathroom. We had a large flat screen TV, and a large armoire with closets for hanging clothes on each side. I hung all clothes on one side and stored the empty suit cases in the other. There was an in-room safe that you programmed with your own entry code in one of the closets. We had three pillows which were very soft and compressed to almost flat once your head was on them. On the second day, we twice requested an additional pillow and were told that there were none available and they would send one up once they had one. We never did receive a pillow. Watch out for the in-room mini-bar refrigerator. The mini-bar refrigerator is designed with two spaces with rubber bottoms for each type of beverage they stock. There were three empty spaces, so we placed our own bottled water and sodas in there. We rearranged two of the mini-bar drinks to make more room to keep our drinks cold. When it came time to check out at 11am, we started our check out on the TV. There were mini-bar charges for each day we were there. We only had house-keeping come in one day, so I wondered how they would think we were consuming their beverages each day when we had not been. We had to go downstairs and wait in the line to check out in person to ask why we had mini bar charges when housekeeping had never had to re-stock our mini-bar. The lady behind the counter told me that the pads are pressure sensitive, so if you pick up a product to look at it, and then decide you do not want it and put it back in the same spot or even put your own bottle in an empty spot, you are automatically charged for the product. I said that it would have been nice to know ahead of time and asked where they provided guests with that information. She said it was printed on the mini-bar pricing list (which was placed in an inconvenient spot behind the Paris glass balloon souvenir - the biggest item in the mini-bar). She then printed the bill and presented it to me to sign and it had all the mini-bar charges. I asked if I had to pay the mini-bar charges even though I just had explained that I did not use a single product. She then called housekeeping and asked them to check the room's mini-bar. She waited a minute and after receiving no response, she took the charges off the bill but said she transferred all mini-bar charges to a different bill and if housekeeping found some items missing, I would be charged for them. I told her if housekeeping is not restocking items, I do not see how they think they should be charging me. There should be a checks and balance between the pressure sensitive pads and the inventory housekeeping is restocking to the mini-bar. Paris is penalizing you for putting your own drink in their refrigerator instead of buying their $5 bottle of Aquafina. We ate breakfast one morning at the cafe by the pool. I thought the menu said O'Brien potatoes, but we were served French fries with our eggs. I consider O'Brien potatoes to be diced with onions and peppers, not shoe string French fries. We had dinner at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant which is about on the 11th floor (not at the top). We had very good service and a spectacular view. The captain will place your napkin on your lap for you. Be prepared with tip money if you visit the restroom because there is an attendant on duty to provide you with a paper towel and there is a tip jar on the vanity.

It was one that I was very curious to see. Since this was a business trip, I can't speak a word about the pool, the actual eiffel tower experience, etc. - only the hotel itself, rooms, restaurants, all of which i was not impressed with. All that said, i work in the luxury hotel industry so i am likely overly-observant when hotels that bill themselves as 4 star luxury are not. Check-in was fast. I was there around 11am and happy they had a room for me. Woo-hoo! The room was clean and a decent size for a standard guestroom. The bathroom is a nice size. However, no bathrobe/slippers, coffee maker...all standard items for any luxury hotel. They had analog TV which surprised me because I've been reading in all of the trade publications how lack of LCD tvs is causing people not to book properties who haven't upgraded. The Paris is even below that standard! The bed was just AWFUL. The matress felt cheap, like the one you'd find on a college dorm bed that is covered with thick plastic. The pillows were on the worn side and the blanket was cheap. And while they do a great job keeping the furnishings in the style of the entire hotel concept, the drawer on the desk was broken. With regard to food, while there are plenty of restaurants there, most of them are not open for lunch. If you want a sit down place (granted, I was only there during the week), your choice is a buffet - where the line was out the door - or a hamburger place. You can get a crepe to go elsewhere but again, I wanted to sit down and unwind after my flight. I chose the burger place - it was good. Can't speak about anywhere else though, as it was the only meal I had in the hotel. Checkout was also fast. There is no denying that the staff is wonderful. And there is absolutely nothing WRONG with the rooms. But, if you are expecting a luxury hotel, don't stay here.

The Room: We had a room on the 23rd floor that overlooked the pool, the Eiffel Tower and the Bellagio fountains, very nice. The room itself was clean however the sheets were a little worn to the point there were some holes in them. The bathroom was a nice size, larger than most. The Pool: The pool gets plenty of sun, we were in the sun by 10:30 a.m. Doesn't seem to get very crowded which was nice. But by most Vegas pool standards, it was a bit quiet. And here is the part of the hotel I didn't like...the drinks at the pool were expensive. I got a large (but not that large) Bloody Mary and it was $18. Later I took that cup to have some ice put in it and they want to charge you $1.50 for ice. Never heard of such a thing and I hate being nickle & dimed. If I'm paying to stay at the hotel and paying $18 for a drink I feel I should be able to get ice without having to pay for it. This totally turned me off of this hotel. I have never stayed anywhere where you had to pay for ice. If seemed to be a general complaint of most people around the pool. Some people were going to the ice machines on the floors and coming out with ice in a bag. The food at the pool restaurant was okay but the service was horrendous. The waitress could barely speak English and seemed to have trouble understanding it, she had to bring someone over to help her.

Just ask to be changed if you get these seats and you will enjoy. We asked but no other seats available at that time. Never got a chance to eat at the buffets, to crowded to long of a wait. Pool area... after reading some of the negative reports we thought we would be disappointed in this area, Having stayed at other hotels on the strip with amazing pools. I have to say we enjoyed the pool. Always being able to get lounges no matter what time of day and moving them from place to place, sun to shade with plenty of room around you. I will say sometimes the area could get bogged down with rubbish from the lunches being served, and a couple of windy days some of the trash would end up in the pool... Yuk... they could improve in that area .Also if you want to rent a raft make sure you have a credit card with you or the paper they give you at check in... your room key or room # is not enough.

I posted a long review of a bachelor party trip to Las Vegas, and it magically disappeared without any notification from TripAdvisor. It's great to see that you let users post honest opinions and experiences. During the trip in May 2008, we were robbed inside our room while sleeping at the Paris Hotel. My advice to anyone is not to stay at this worthless hotel. Nobody makes any attempt to check ID at the elevator, and anyone can come and go to any floor. The security did little to nothing to help us once we were robbed in the middle of the night. The insurance company refused to pay us back, saying that the Paris did not demonstrate \"gross negligence\". Ok, I fail to see how not following through on any security investigation, not checking cameras or IDs, or not returning calls regarding our filed reports does not constitute gross negligence. Furthermore, we were robbed by a man who apparently was just released from jail for robbing other people at the Paris Hotel! He was only caught last time because he jumped off the roof and broke his ankles. We were also told that some of the doors do not shut or lock properly, and people can push on the doors in the middle of the night. This seems to be an ongoing problem that the hotel has not resolved. So, why don't you fix it??? The hotel did not send anyone up to the room from management to see if we were ok after being robbed. A worthless security guard came up later, and he was amused at our situation. He did nothing to help, and recommended that we call the police. Another worthless investigator named Dorothy Stewart was \"on the case\". She works for the hotels, so she apparently did not believe our story. Thanks for your help, \"Dot\", and not getting back to us about anything for months. The police detective that was supposed to help us did not return phone calls. He mysteriously was out of the office for a month after we were robbed. Needless to say, I will never stay at this garbage hotel again. If you want to get security to do something, apparently you have to take a chip out of the casino. In that case, they will have SWAT all over you. However, if you happen to stay at the hotel and lose a few hundred dollars by getting robbed in your bedroom by a repeat offender, then don't expect them to help you with anything. Yes, we did use the safe, but you can't keep everything in a tiny safe when there are four people in a room. Furthermore, I shouldn't have to worry about all of our belongings while we are sleeping in a supposedly decent hotel. Anyway, thanks for nothing, Paris. There are many better places to stay where you don't have to wake up in the middle of the night to the sight of a man crawling on the floor at the foot of our bed.

Arrived on Monday at noon. Check in was very quick no wait at all. Requested a smoking room with two queen beds. Room not ready and would not be ready until 4pm. We flew from the east coast to Vegas. We did not want to wait so we took a non smoking room (Room #2949). We went to the room and it was a remodeled room. Very nice decor but had a bad smell in it and the air conditioner did not work in the room. We called down to the front desk and they relocated us to (Room #403) not a remodeled room but had a better smell and the air conditioner worked great. The view was of the pool but there were two trees blocking the view. Overall the room but was very nice. The machines at Paris were extremely tight and did not win anything there. Went to the Cafe for several meals nothing special about the cafe but a little pricey. Played in Ballys,Bills gambling hall, Circus Circus, Tropicana no big wins there at all. Went downtown played along time at Vegas Club and went to the Four Queens played along time also no wins but had a good time and actually was able to play awhile. Went to the MGM Grand and played there for along time played the new Gamemaker HD machines and hit TWO Jackpots within 20 minutes of each other. First game was blazing 7s and hit the 5 blazing 7s for 1000.00 and switched games on the same machine and played double double bonus poker and hit a Royal for 1000.00 so overall the MGM Grand was a great place to play. We also rented a rental car the car rental building is 3 miles from the airport but they take you there by bus so it was easy. There was 10 people in front of us so it took awhile to get to the counter. The rental was 60.00 for 5 days it was a great deal until they add all the taxes and misc. charges and then want to charge you 10.00 per extra driver. So finally cost was 111.00 not that big of a deal but they should let you know when you do the reservation what your finally cost will be instead of the surprise you reach the counter. THIRFTY CAR RENTAL just beaware of this. I have been to Vegas many times and this was the first time with a rental car. It was a great idea you can come and go as you please and do whatever you want. NO waiting for busses or monorail or anything like that. I actually drove the whole strip and had no major issues at all. Went to the Hofbrauhaus it was okay the beer was great but the food sucked. I expected real german food but it was not like that at all. Went to the Cher concert at Ceasars the show was great even the 17 outfit changes that Cher did in the 90 minute show. I thought it was a little much doing all those outfit changes but everyone else said it was expected. Went to Texas Station and Gold Coast they were okay.

We took the deal but regretted it; apart from the trouble of packing/unpacking and traveling back and forth we had the unpleasant experience of having a Caesar's check-in clerk who was not happy to have to give us a room for just one night so he gave us what i am sure must be the worst room they have, in the Roman tower. The room was dusty (because i'm sure they don't rent it out very often), filthy, in bad repair, and had a view of a concrete wall. So it was a very pleasant relief the next day when we got our room at the paris. The room was clean and had a nice view of the mountains and part of the airport (we could see planes taking off/landing but never heard one). The overall hotel is kept very clean and there is a good variety of places to eat, most of which are relatively expensive, with one exception being J.J.'s boulangerie (bakery/deli), which is cafeteria style and served everything from breakfast to late night snack. Line ups at the buffet were usually quite long; we sometimes ate for less at Bill's casino across the street from Bally's (the Paris is connected to Bally's by interior walkways), or at a very nice and affordable food court at Caesar's (forget the name of it...they call it something-street and it includes one of those Java-something coffee shops. Being centrally located it was very easy to take the 'Deuce' bus and visit the strip in either direction; there is also a monorail station at Bally's. The Deuce goes all the way downtown to the Fremont street experience but it can be slow; take the monorail as far as you can go before switching to the bus.

If you go there, there's no choice -- smoke and nicotine will be your companions. The (very few) small areas that were non-smoking were poorly marked and the signs were ignored.

We decided to splurge and get upgraded to a suite, and the receptionist was so accommodating she put us in a high-level \"P\" room with a view of the Bellagio fountains and the pool. For $185 a night, it was worth it. Check-in took about 20 minutes so despite the long line, they were zipping through us pretty quickly. Even so, I would have preferred airport check-in which they got rid of earlier this year. Our room was lovely. There is a half bath, parlor area, dining area, and bedroom that is separated by french doors. The bathroom has a jetted tub (wish we had time to use it), stand alone glassed-in shower, and separate commode room. The toiletries were of generous size and of good quality. There was a lovely scented potpourri in the room so those with environmental sensitivities may be put off. I was not a fan of the bedroom TV consul which raised and lowered via remote, nor of the marble coffee table with multiple sharp corners that stabbed my husband and I on numerous occasions. Maid service was excellent and they even left a little chocolate on the pillow - a nice touch I have not seen in a few years. Internet is about $14 extra for 24 hours and they offer both wireless and jack. We don't really gamble but we did hang out in the casino quite a bit and enjoyed watching others win big. Our cocktail waitress was a doll and gave us the lowdown on the service industry in Vegas over the past 20 years and well as some great drink suggestions. I also love the collectable ceramic Paris balloon goblets you can get when you order a frosty drink. We did not see any of the showgirls walking by or little dancing girl shows that we remembered seeing in the casino when we walked through on our last visit. The pool scene looked like our kind of mellow, but it was 105 degrees out so we preferred to stay in the A/C. We ate at several restaurants inside the hotel and enjoyed every one, especially the Eiffel Tower Restaurant. Because our room was so high, we opted out of going to the top of the tower (have to save something for next time) and enjoyed the view from our room. I wish we could have tried the sushi place and hung out in the dueling piano bar, but there is only so much you can fit into 2 nights. We had two snags during our stay. Our room keys stopped working the first night and when we went to get them re-keyed that receptionist said we were not registered at the hotel. It took 10 minutes to sort out but we were exhausted and not in the mood. Meanwhile, a somewhat drunk and belligerent guest was making a scene with the manager and I have to commend how the manager handled it - I would have blown my top at the stuff the guest was saying to her. We were also billed for a fax that was sent to a guest at the beginning of the month, but it was quickly taken off on request. Overall we were pleased, but not ecstatic with our stay.

The bathroom is absolutely gorgeous, albeit a little lacking in counter space for three people (two of whom were women), with a separate shower and plenty of marble. The safe was a welcome addition - especially after my friend won $2700 playing the slots! The only free TV programming is a non-stop infomercial from the Harrah's corporation, but of course they would rather you get out of your room and into their casino. The food court has a bounty of options, all at inflated prices; however, I do recommend getting a crepe for breakfast at least once during your stay. Lounging by the pool (something I never do in my \"real life\") was a treat - there was something about gazing up at the facade of the hotel against the bright blue sky, with the miniature Eiffel Tower at our backs, that was beautiful and serene in that odd Vegas way. All in all, I would gladly stay at the Paris again, if I could afford to and didn't feel the urge to check out a different hotel.

I live in the second most popular vacation destination (Orlando), so I suppose I have high expectations when it comes to \"wow factor\". I have been to Vegas only once prior to this and was eager to stay at Paris because it looked like it would be very opulent and romantic. We arrived on a Friday morning around 11am and the check-in desk was swamped. We had a very friendly and helpful staff member check us in. She assisted us with an upgrade to a room with a view of the Strip (and Bellagio's fountains, although they won't say that) and offered us an upgrade to the Concierge level which gives you a continental breakfast each morning of your stay and a Happy Hour with 2 alcoholic beverages and a heavy appetizer buffet and as much non-alcoholic beverages as you care. That was a deal, really because nothing is too cheap in Vegas anymore. Definitely worth the extra if they can offer it and you like a drink before dinner or don't need a huge breakfast every day. We weren't able to get into our room until after 3pm, but we found plenty to keep us busy and the bellman kept our luggage (which they later delivered to our room). The room was on the 25th floor (plenty high enough for a good view), but it was a 2 queen bed room, instead of a 1 king room as requested (it was a romantic trip, after all). Unfortunately, there was nothing available that was comparable with a king bed so we didn't move. The bathroom had the pink marble and the separate shower and tub that other reviews described, but certainly nothing unusual or \"wow\" unless you live in a home with a dinky bathroom (I don't). The bath products were nothing special either (you would think they would provide some fancy French milled soaps or nice lotions/shower gels). The towels weren't particularly thick or soft and they will only bring robes to the room if you pay for them upfront-forget trying to ask for one from maid service...not happening! Another thing I should mention is the \"fancy\" drink/snack refrigerator: we had brought back 2 bottles of soda to the room and displaced a couple of beer bottles to make room for them. The refrigerator automatically charges you for anything that has been moved from it's spot for more than 45 seconds! We had to request those beers be removed from our bill, as well as a \"romance kit\" that contained KY and condoms that we had laughed about for at least a whole minute. The pool- it was only open to 7 or 8pm (still too hot in August to attempt that water which would actually feel cold compared to the 107 degree air). There were a lot of folks making a day of it there, though. The day we went to check it out (just before closing time) we were apalled. There were dirty/used dishes and glassware, food bits and trash all over the pool deck. It appeared that the wait staff had delivered food/drinks, but not bussed the remains. At the very end of our trip around the deck there was a large area where some partier vomitted his/her excess of the day and it was not cleaned. To be fair, we reported this to staff and wrote a complaint card which made it to the hotel manager the next day. As a result, we were allowed to check out late (6pm) which was helpful, since our flight wasn't due to leave until 1am. The casino_ I'm not a gambler and it's not my focus when I have gone to Vegas, but the casino is rather small. We won NOTHING and they don't really comp anything (free play) like some of the other places on the strip. They didn't really do well masking the cigarette smoke there either. Many of the other hotels work hard at making the evironment bearable for both the smokers and the non-smokers...not here. My husband sneezed every time we entered the Casino. The design of the casino floor/lobby was very pretty and different. It was confusing finding the various places you needed to find however (the check-in desk, the elevators, the path to Bally's). We didn't eat at any of the cafes, but we did eat at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant for dinner our last night. We had a spectacular view of the Bellagio fountains and the Strip. The wait staff seemed to say \"thank you\" just a bit too much, but they were very attentive. The food was delicious, although pricey (like I said, not too many inexpensive places for good food anymore). We made it to our last show of the stay (Anthony Cools-hypnotist) with only moments to spare, no thanks to a line of folks at the Will Call line picking up tickets for their ride on the Eiffel Tower (they really need that to stay separate) and staff members unwilling to \"bend the rules\". Anthony Cools' show was very funny, but very adult. If you are easily offended by vulgarity or sexual inuendo...this is not for you. Thankfully, neither my husband or I were hypnotized, but it was very entertaining watching those who were. They were extremely good sports. The last staff member we encountered was the bellman in charge of our luggage until the Gray Line shuttle was scheduled to pick us up. He was very helpful and was patient despite the fact we were his last set of luggage of his day.

I did notice a slightly foul smell when running the sink but I've found this to be common in Las Vegas. The shower was slow to drain but I did not report it. I also noticed some moldy grout below the shower door but overall, it was clean and nice. There was also a high quality blow dryer which in a city like Vegas where I like to style my hair in the evening was a plus. The bed was nice and comfy! My husband and I were both pleasantly surprised at the cost of room service as well as the availability of reasonably priced food in other areas of the hotel. Continental breakfast, which included coffee for two, fresh squeezed juice and a nice assortment of pastries was only $13 and the service was quick. We also ate at the pool and once again, very reasonable - quite a few choices under $10. We split a turkey wrap and fries which was huge and delicious! Mon Ami Gabi is a favorite of mine and we had a nice dinner there as well.

At the ck in desk I told the nice lady that we would like a room on a high floor that had been renovated, non smoking. ( I had also made this request when the reservation was made by phone a few months prior.) I mentioned to the lady upon ck in that it was to celebrate my mother\u2019s 81st birthday and that we were willing to wait awhile until a nice room became available.

With that, we went to have lunch at the cafe across from the lobby. A word about the hotel now.....it\u2019s very impressive when you first see it...very tall and has an impressive replica of the Eiffel tower out front and the Arch de Triumph. The casino is the first thing you walk through on the way to the lobby ck in....very tall ceilings painted like the sky with clouds, at dusk, old fashioned street lamps, Parisian music in the background, sidewalk cafe adjacent to the casino and a long passageway of shops and restaurants that leads to Bally\u2019s next door.....I felt like I was in Epcot Center the way it was done...but indoors....The Eiffel Tower base is actually on the casino floor and goes up through the roof beyond the ceiling....a bridge hovers over the casino floor that leads to the tower elevator......the lobby is done up like Versailles with gold and white walls, marble inlaid floors, and many brilliant ornate chandeliers. Our room was ready by 3:30 pm....with over 2000 rooms, it takes awhile to get them cleaned. We ascended to the 28th floor, which turned out to be a non smoking floor and entered our room....wow!

The cafe at Paris was great for breakfast and lunch. We like table service so it was great, but the hotel also has other options...self serve cafeteria style eateries in Parisian themes...and a walk -up Crepe station shop with adjacent seating.

When we checked out of Bally\u2019s and walked over to Paris check in there was a long line for people checking out and no positions indicating check in. We asked and were told to get in the line. The line moved pretty quickly and after 15 minutes we were talking to the desk agent. She was rather rude and abrupt. When my wife\u2019s credit card was denied she was extremely condescending. When we tried mine, it too was denied, and she was even more condescending and told us to come back when we could pay for our room! We got out of line and called the credit card company and they said Paris didn\u2019t even attempt a transaction! So we got back in line with the same girl who then tried my wife\u2019s card again and it was denied. When we explained what the credit card company said the agent said it was against hotel policy to manually type in a credit card number but she would try, and it worked. Of course her card reader wasn\u2019t working. The people she helped after us had the exact same problem. A very unnerving way to start a stay. We got a room on the 12th floor facing the airport. We just dropped off our bags and headed out for the day. When we got back my wife asked to talk to a manager at the front desk. She explained that the agent was very condescending and rude, and the manager said what could he do to make it better. My wife only asked for a room on a higher floor. The manager gave us a room on the 28th floor, facing the Eifel tower and Bellagio's fountains. The second room was the same size as the first, but was much, much nicer. Both rooms had separate showers and tubs, marble and granite in the baths, but this room had an individual cup coffee maker which the other room did not. It also had a HUGE flat panel HDTV. Also red leather embroidered head board on the bed and Ipod docking station. The whole room seemed to be a notch above the first. There was shampoo, conditioner, lotion and body wash in both rooms. Looking down from our room the pool looked huge, but when we went swimming it didn\u2019t seem that big. We found chairs easily by the pool. We did go up the Eifel tower at night to watch the Bellagio fountains with the lights, really pretty. There are little vents that you can pull up on the windows and you can hear the Bellagio music. We ate at Mon Ami Gabi, and even though they were out of one dish, and ran out of one kind of wine, we had a very nice dinner. We also stopped in at Napoleons bar because we had a coupon for buy one drink, get one free. It was a pretty nice place, and the coupon really helped. We also bought a soda at the gift store by the elevators, and the clerk was extremely rude.

I don\u2019t know if they are trying to be like that, but I could do without the rudeness. Overall, our room was very clean and comfortable. The view was great.

We booked the basic room with a spa coupon code on the internet and were quoted 76/76/80 a night for a Sunday - Wednesday stay just after 4th of July. Booking a stay just after 4th of July is a great value and seems to rank right up there with the week before Christmas as a time to get some great rates. For the price, the room was a great value. Paris' room was very nice with updated furniture, TV, and internet access. The bathroom had a standalone shower and was a good size. The housekeeping staff and the rest of the service staff at the hotel were very pleasant and friendly. Compared to other places we've stayed such as NYNY and MGM, I was more impressed by Paris for value and quality. We used the spa which was nicer than NYNY's (by way of comparison) and my wife was happy with her spa services (stone massage and manicure/pedicure). For gaming action, I preferred to walk to Bally's which was connected without having to go outside. It seemed like the Bally's slots were looser and the tables were more friendly. I also like to play Poker and found Paris' room to be lacking. They have a 730pm NLHE tourney for a $65 buy-in which was a decent/standard tourney. However, I didn't like the cash games. With the poker room located in the sportsbook, cell phones are not allowed and it is annoying to deal with the management constantly reminding players to shut their phones off. Games also didn't last very long there (poker room is not open 24hrs)...Instead, I really enjoyed playing at Bally's Poker room for constant action and a good influx of players since it is located right on the casino floor. Anyway, in sum, I would avoid gaming/Poker at Paris. On the upside, I thought that the shops, restaurants, and buffet were nicer at Paris and provide for a good time when going out with your wife for the night. Paris is also conveniently located on the strip for access to Caesar's, Bellagio, etc.... The Paris pool was not fancy but serviceable...the nice part was that it was not crowded so it was a good place to relax without dealing with the crowds. So, overall, I would recommend Paris. However, I am only giving it two stars due to my issue below (long post): Now, for the bad part which was probably just unique to our situation: We booked through the hotel website using a spa code and ended up with discounted rooms. When we showed up, the desk clerk printed out a bunch of comp coupons for drinks, etc.. and one of them included \"2 free stone massages.\" When my wife tried to use the coupon at the spa, the spa personnel seemed confused as if they had never seen this coupon (apparently, it was a newer promotion). They made some calls and told me it would be settled at the end of our stay. I should have known better. Since we had to settle the coupon up at the end of the stay, we had to go to the front desk vice using express check out which is a pain to start off with. When we tried to use the coupon, the front desk clerk was also confused and told us that we didn't have the spa package. She was friendly enough and got the manager to assist us. The manager told us firmly that we didn't have the spa package and asked to see our email or online printout. I didn't bring these with me on the trip and I found it annoying that I was being asked for proof for something in their computer system. Then he recalculated what the cost would be with the spa package and the bill came up to be $280 more even though my wife only did one massage for $170. So, now the manager was trying to charge us $280 more than what we had bargained for (including the \"free\" massage we were no longer getting). After arguing to no avail that we had booked at 76/76/80 (as the front desk clerk told us at check-in and what I reserved online) and arguing that we were given the free massage coupon by THEIR front desk, the manager was sticking to a charge of $280 more for a $170 massage! I told him that was unacceptable and that I would have been at least better off if I had just paid the cost of the massage and basic room night charges. He seemed confused because when he compared to the two bills he forgot to apply our deposit and finally figured it out. Ultimately, we ended up paying for the massage plus the 76/76/80 rates. Not only did we not get the \"free\" massage under the coupon provided to us at check-in, what I found most annoying about the experience was the manager's attitude towards us. He implied that we were lying to him about what we had booked and generally could care less about our concerns. From our perspective, I felt like we were \"baited and switched.\" We booked at 76/76/80 online, the front desk gives us a \"free\" massage coupon, we use it (only half of it), and then they try to hit us with an extra $280 charge for the $170 massage. My wife would have probably gotten a massage anyway without the coupon, but the whole billing mess and the manager's condescending/could care less attitude really upset us. When I asked how I could provide feedback to his company about the apparent bug in their online code system, he seemed to cast me off and said you can fill out a comment card. No matter how decent a value Paris Las Vegas was----- I will not stay there again because of the management's treatment of our situation.

We immediately called the hotel\u2019s security office before boarding our plane to report the incident and I was later contacted by an investigations company, Cannon Cochran Management Services Incorporated (CCMSI) who basically sent us a letter two months after the incident, closing the case and attached a copy of the \u201cNevada Revised Statues\u201d, they misspelled \u201cstatutes\u201d.

Our room faced the construction, but we could still see MGM, Mandalay Bay, and PH. It costs $65 to upgrade to a room with a complete view of the strip, but we didn't do that. We were only in the room to sleep or change clothes, so the view wasn't a concern. Pool: Some people in past reviews complained about the pool, and I see why, but it was still amazing to me. The pool wasn't anything fancy like some of the cool designs of other hotels' pools, but it was still amazing just because of the view. The pool is a big octagon with plenty of surrounding space & chairs and fun, current music. It's right next to the Eiffel Tower (the base of it is literally right next to the pool area), and straight ahead of the pool you look at Caesars (it's not behind the hotel like most pools). It was a very nice setting, even though it didn't have a lazy river or cool waterfalls. I loved it because laying out is one of my fav. things to do, so it made the hotel worth staying!! You get a free towel by the pool and drink/food wait staff too. Tips: If you're going to watch TV a lot (which I assume few people will!), don't stay here because other than FOX and a few crappy sitcom channels, you only get Asian speaking channels, Paris hotel promotions channels, and channels that teach you how to play different games/slots. Also, my mom is a huge coffee drinker, and the room did not have a coffee pot. It cost her $13 to order a pot of coffee! As for the stocked, in-room fridge...be careful! If you take any item out of it for 45 seconds or longer, you automatically get charged for it because it has sensors that detect when items disappear. My mom bought a bottled water downstairs (there is a little convenient shop by bottom elevators) and put it in an empty slot in our fridge (from a bottled Gatorade I previously drank), but when she took it out to drink, she got charged for it because the sensors assumed she took a fridge item out, not something we already bought! So, needless to say, you cannot store anything in the room fridge. Casino: Everytime I went to the casino, not many people were playing cards, but they always were at Bally's. The slots weren't very loose, so we hardly played there. Overall: I really enjoyed it because of the atmosphere and pool. I would stay again, but I would look at other hotels too because hard beds are just ridiculous, and I want a fridge where I can store my own food/drinks because it's too expensive to buy every drink/food from a pre-stocked fridge or restaurant. If you see random people on the walkways selling bottled water for $1, take it! It's just the cheap spring water they prob. get for 30 cents a bottle, but it beats paying $5-6 bucks elsewhere! Just make sure the safety cap hasn't been busted! :) It seems like the hotels try to get you to pay for every little thing, which is ridiculous, because we would spend more money gambling if we weren't paying outrageous prices for other things!

The rates were great - about $80 each night booked directly through the hotel's website, using a link I found on Facebook. (I wasn't able to find this rate just searching through the Paris website, which was a bit frustrating.) This was my 3rd time in Vegas -- other times I stayed at the Venetian (on business) and MGM Signature (for my bachelorette party). I was really looking forward to staying at Paris, but was disappointed. We were on the 19th floor - a nonsmoking floor. But, our bathroom smelled like cigarettes. Same issue for one of the other couples with whom we traveled. It was almost unbearable the first night. I think the smoke traveled through the vents, and housekeeping had our bathroom door closed, so it was \"stuck\" in the bathroom. Once we kept the door open, it dissipated a bit on the other days. We couldn't change rooms because they didn't have any other king rooms available (which seemed odd). There were certain things that I expect of a hotel of this calliber, but were missing: robes and coffee machines in the room. There are also extras that would have made it better - not necessary, but \"would be nices\": a little refrigerator that we could use (the minibar was timed, and if you moved anything, within 45 seconds you'd be charged for it) and an iPod docking station. At MGM Signature, every room gets 2 bottles of water a day - really nice when it's 108 degrees! Also, being in the desert in June/July, I would have assumed that the hotel would provide body or hand lotion (along with the shampoo, conditioner, etc.). While I brought some, my husband was not too keen on using my \"glittered\" body lotion! It'd be so easy for them to provide this!While none of these are obviously deal-breakers, it was frustrating that we were at a \"Luxury hotel\" without any real luxuries - even missing basics that I could get at the Courtyard by Marriott! The parking garage seems to be really far from reception. I'd recommend valet parking. We ate at 2 restuarants there: the deli-type place, where we had a chicken salad sandwich & soup, and at Le Village, the buffet. The deli was disappointing. How do you have a french deli without a brie sandwich? I'll be posting another review for Le Village, but I would definitely recommend it (just pace yourself!) We spent the first afternoon at the pool. It's on the 3rd floor and can get a bit windy. We rented 2 rafts ($15 each) for 4 of us to share. The pool was much more subdued than the one at MGM - different clientele, apparently. The frozen drinks were good (a bit pricey at $18 each for a large) -- just be sure to drink it before it melts -- once that happens, it's like drinking strawberry syrup... The very central location was great, and the bloody mary at the little kiosk bar in the little village was fantastic! I also really enjoyed my strawberry daquiri in the ceramic hotair balloon! Overall, for the price, it was definitely a steal. But, for a higher price, I'd prefer to try something new or go back to MGM Signature.", "Date": "July 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wellington, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cGreat central location near bus stop\u201d", "Author": "yeowon", "ReviewID": "UR17478957", "Content": "We were a family party staying in three rooms for three nights. Our rooms averaged $144 per night incl tax, booked through the hotel website. We got 8th floor rooms facing the Eiffel tower and pool, no view of the strip as too low down however you really do get the atmosphere when you get this view as opposed to other parts of the complex that don\u2019t look out towards the tower. The check in person said we could upgrade to views of the Strip for an extra $70 per night. We declined this offer. Good central location near bus stop and opposite the Bellagio fountains With the 100 degree heat everyday we were there the best aspect of this hotel is the central location, there is a bus stop just outside the hotel that has the Deuce, double decker bus that takes you up and down the strip and into downtown \u2013 tickets $5 for 24 hours. By having it right outside you don\u2019t get too hot and bothered before your day has even started. The other great thing about this hotel is that you can catch the Bellagio fountains across the road several times. These fountains must be the most beautiful fountains in the world. The highlight of the trip for us was seeing those fountains. They go from 12pm till 12 am. Half hourly until 6 I think and then every 15 minutes. We quite often would go out for the evening and then get back to the hotel about 11pm and watch a few sessions of the fountain. Food outlets are decent The hotel is midrange, the food outlets are pretty good, buffet breakfast was great for $14.99 incl drinks, a bit of a queue at 10am when we went down. This cleared quickly. The crepes restaurant opposite is also very good. Extras at the hotel are pricey The only think I didn\u2019t like about the hotel is that there is an obvious drive to clip the ticket at every possible moment. Eg no coffee maker in the room so you have to go and buy a drink, nowhere to sit down in the reception and common areas so you have to buy a drink, there is a machine in the lift entrance for printing airline boarding tickets, this costs minimum $5 access fee and $1 per printout, so could get pricey for a big group, internet access for your laptop is $13.99 per day!. There were a couple of maintenance issues in our room, one being the air con didn\u2019t work well, however once the filter was changed it was fine. The maintenance people came within 20 minutes every time we called them. All in all I think the hotel is good value, if you book early enough ( I noticed the rates on the website went up considerably in the 10 days before our arrival \u2013 may have been due it being booked out by the moose conference that was staying there.)

Room number was 623. We're not big on gambling so the casino was not too much of an interest to us but should say that it's probably the smallest casino on the strip. There are several restaurants inside the hotel but we only ate at two of them because every time we went downstairs, there were long lines. For breakfast, you should visit La Creperie and for dinner, Mon Ami Gabi which is an excellent and romantic restaurant with very accommodating wait staff. Another great place to eat is at Rio's Carnival World Buffet. We ate there twice. With so many different choices of food and desert, you will soon realize why even the toughest critics rate it as the best all-you-can-eat in Vegas. We also spent a lot of time just hanging out by the pool. It's big enough to accommodate a large group of people. Water was warm but it helps when the the weather is between 104-108 degrees. Paris Hotel is conveniently located near many of most desirable locations on the Strip. It's close to the Forum Shops and it's right across from Bellagio Fountains and right next to Miracle Mile Shops which has a convenience store where you can actually get bottled water for $.99.

Here are the facts: the room was nice and large and had ample sitting areas. We had a view of a concrete top to the casino so I can't review on the view. The TV was not a new flat screen like so many places now have. The bed was very flat - I am learning I am spoiled at home with the thick pillow top I have! So many hotels do not have pillow top beds and it really affects my sleep in hotels. The bathroom was large and nice. The charge for Wireless internet was around $15 for 24hrs and I found that to be a bit much, but it didn't bother me. There were TONS of sightseers at the hotel/casino and made it difficult to get around. The casino was nice and fun but I found that I had more fun at downtown casinos where the minimum at the tables weren't so high. I really enjoyed the lovely bathroom. It was large and had a nice bathtub and separate shower. The shower was very nice - a little bit of mold but I think it is to be expected. The cleaning staff occasionally left things in the room - when we first got in the room there was an empty bottle of cleaner next to the phone. The next day a used cleaning cloth was next to my sink. Little things that really didn't matter too much but did stay in the back of my mind. The bell hops were great - one did mention a good way to get downtown was by the shuttle system. It costs $5 per person (I think for a 24 hr day). It did take a while to get downtown (35 min) since it stopped at many major hotels but definitely worth it when you consider the cost of a cab ride would be about $40. The ride back was considerably longer (1hr) because it was about 4:15 in the afternoon and EVERYONE was going to the strip. Going downtown during the day was a great idea. We stayed there all day - Fremont has that wonderful awning(?) and I didn't feel the heat of the day at all. I was very surprised. The crowds were non-existent, unlike the strip!

We're an early 20 something couple but we act like we're 40. We really enjoyed Paris, we had a great room facing the Eiffel Tower and the Bellagio Fountains. Many a night we spent on the little sofa by the window watching the fountains. The room was nice, luxurious king size bed with down pillows. The room was clean and everything was replaced each day (except sheets, which you had to ask for). Room had a 42\" plasma in it which was nice, and there WAS HD programming. The concierge was helpful, booking us tickets to see \"O\" (which you MUST see, I don't care what TA says it is the best thing to see in Vegas) and by letting us know to go to the Bellagio buffet before 4pm to pay lunch prices and get switched food at 4. Overall the Casino isn't bad, it seems a little small and I prefer the casino at the Bellagio if you like it a little upscale. We didn't do much gambling, spent most of our honeymoon checking out all the free things to do and took in two shows. The monorail was a great idea. Paris had a great atmosphere that I would recommend to anyone (especially younger folks) looking for a great place to stay that isn't the best casino and isn't the best early 20s party club.

The rooms were nice and open. Beds were very comfortable. Had a nice view and felt at home in the room. Pool was just ok for me. Not big enough to accommodate the crowds really. Food was above average especially Ah Sin, the Asian restaurant there. Really good and is has outdoor seating. I'd avoid Le Provencal as it's overpriced and just average. Stick to the top tier places to eat there. Front desk was a little slow and only had 2 people working with a long line. That always irritates me as other hotels on the strip are not like that. Overall it was just average. If this hotel was anywhere else, I may give it a higher score, and let me tell you why.

The reviews were pretty good so we thought we'd try it for our first time to Vegas. The hotel is very pretty, classy looking & centrally located. The king sized bed we requested, was not available the day we arrived but they said call back to the front desk the next day & they would se what they could do. We did & we accepted an accessible ( handicapped) room. It had a tub but not a separate shower like most other rooms. It was fine w/ us. That room was large & comfortable. Housekeeping was prompt & friendly. We had an ok view but nothing great since we did not upgrade. We did not use the pool but we checked it out 1 day & there was not any loud music like listed previously by a reviewer. The hotel & casino lobby is one of the busiest we saw on the strip. It was always very crowded & very smoky. Including cigars. Yuck, but the smoking is like that all over. Plus, Paris has a cigar store in house too. Once you get thru that, its not too bad. The elevators were different since we're not used to staying in high-rises. It had 2 sets of elevators one for floors 1-15 ( or so ) and the other for 16-25, in different locations. Kind of confusing since there is so much to look at there. The self-parking garage is in the rear of the hotel & is free, like most in Vegas but if you arrive late in the day like we did, jet lagged & exhausted, its hard to figure out. When you turn into the hotel, and want to self park & not use bellhops, keep to the far right & the garage is on the left. There are elevators that go to the casino but its a good haul & probably worth it to have them bring up your bags but we were too cheap! Our biggest issue was when we wanted to do a late check-out since our flight was not until after 10 pm. We called days in advance to see if this was possible & no one would give us a straight answer. It was always call back later. Finally, I got mad & questioned the person who answered the phone & said this was the 3rd time we called to no avail. She said that I had to call back after 7 am of the day of departure & then its up to the manager on call and it depends on if they are @ full capacity. She couldn't or wouldn't tell me how much it would be. Once again, it was up to the mgr on call. We finally gave up. Also, use the hotel tv for express check out. Lines can be awful there checking in or out but we noticed this is a common problem where ever we went. We ate @ one of the restaurants in Paris, it was one right by the casino. It was one of the more reasonably priced places there. We got sandwiches & appetizers & it was very good. We ate @ LaSalsa on the strip too and it was very good as well.

Our room was on the 27th floor, the view wasn't great (we looked out on other hotels and the mountains were in the distance), but we weren't there for the view. Our room was a decent size, spotless, the bed was very comfortable, the bathroom was above average size, there were plenty of drawers and closets for storing everything, and there was a coffee maker and safe. Housekeeping was in before 1pm every day and was exceptional. There were never any trays left in the hallway for any length of time. When we left in the morning, if there was a breakfast tray in the hallway it was gone when we returned a few hours later. All the employees we encountered were very pleasant, helpful and always had a smile on their face. The only problem was the wait for drinks while at the slots (but this seemed to be the same in all the casinos we were in) We had breakfast at Le Village Buffet, which has everything you could possible want on it, and the food was very good (especially the crepes). There were always lines to get in, but again, being a diamond card holder we never had to wait. We also had breakfast at Cafe le Parc, which was also delicious. We ate dinner one night at Mon Ami Gabi and sat outside, which I think is the best place to be. The French onion soup was great and the creme brulee was the best. Service was excellent. The location of Paris is perfect. We did walk alot of the strip and also used the monorail a couple of days.

It cost $14 to get to Fremont Street and $17 to get back to the Sahara. If you need to print a boarding pass for your return flight, use the business center (between Paris and Ballys). They copied our flight information and the day before we left they printed it and we picked it up. They charged $5, and it was well worth it. We also did a pre check out the night before and all we had to do was leave the keys in our room, which saved time. I can't compare Paris to any other hotel, since this was our first trip to Vegas, but I can't say anything bad about it.", "Date": "May 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cSafety is now a concern ...\u201d", "Author": "BostonBeans1", "ReviewID": "UR15716488", "Content": "We've stayed many times at the Paris Las Vegas, but our most recent stays have seen the place go down hill. Because this hotel does not require room cards to access the hotel elevators, we saw female strangers knocking on doors trying to get into rooms. They ran down the corridor when I inquired what they were doing. Hotel security was somewhat slow to respond on the first day, but security was present on the second day. They escorted away an incoherent transient, who was \"looking\" for his room key on our floor. The security people knew him by his first name, so he'd obviously been around the Paris rooms before. We're surprised Paris has let the situation go so far. The room (at over $200 a night) had what I thought was a musty smell, but my spouse said it was a residual formaldehyde smell from the new carpets. Not the greatest for one's health. The smoking from the casino patrons was also exceptionally bad this time. Not enough air filtration to handle the crowds. Our favorite in the past was the Village Buffet, which has now cut back or eliminated several dishes. The staff doles out small amounts of some pricier food items, so the buffet is constantly running out -- even on a slow Sunday evening. Dinner at the Eiffel Tower restaurant was outstanding, but very expensive. We'll be looking to stay next time at the Venetian or one of the newly opened hotels in Las Vegas.

The Paris is a location we spend a lot of time at so we thought we would try it. Check In: No problem, we used the phone in service and our room was ready. We asked for a renovated room which had a view of Bally\u2019s, no up charge. Room: Clean, well decorated however it was renovated and still looked old and a bit tired. Beds average for comfort. Daily service no concerns. This is one of two main concerns was the rooms are bland and in need of major upgrading. To me it depends what you pay. We average 150 per night so no complaints however if I was paying 250 and upwards I would not be happy with these rooms. Casino/Services: All great, friendly staff clean. Restaurants: Good choice of restaurants particulary the filet at Mon Ami and sitting on the deck. Room service was fine, slow, of average quality. The brassiere had good pub food however there are so many great spots in Vegas to eat so we tend to avoid the casual spots. Try Daniel Bouchard in the Wynn. Spa: Treatments great. Atmosphere poor. The front desk woman chatted and the quiet charis/lounge are right beside this. Also new guest present to this desk and you can hear it all. Bright and not relaxing. Spa area was very dated d\u00e9cor. Gym was fine. Pool: Fine d\u00e9cor and size however as most hotels in Vegas they play music all day. Mid week I was used to it and could read and fall asleep however on the weekends starting Friday they bring in speakers and loud house music with a DJ. I know the atmosphere is for a party however they need to advertise this as this was why we stayed away from another hotel. If you want to read and get some sun it\u2019s impossible, it\u2019s even hard to hear yourself talk so if you don\u2019t want to party and are nursing a hang over the music is LOUD. By day 2 we just went with it and had drinks but it was annoying as I see the pool as a relaxation place. Overall I would stay here again if the price was right but I would chose another hotel if the rates were high. For example the Bellagio was average 215 and I would try there before coming back to the Paris. I would also look for a hotel where the pool music is optional for the party scene.", "Date": "May 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hartford,CT", "Title": "\u201cGood mid-range hotel, good central location on the Strip\u201d", "Author": "fjpanda", "ReviewID": "UR15629587", "Content": "The location is excellent on the Strip, in that it is very centrally located. Good for checking out all the well known hotel casinos, in any direction from the hotel. Paris Las Vegas is interesting/different - very pseudo (fake) Paris which you may like, you may not, depending on how you feel about Paris, France and what your expectations are for Las Vegas. It's a good mid-range hotel. Many restaurant choices, something for everyone. We especially liked the bakery, the creperie and the breakfast buffet. I only have one of the 3 names at my finger tips, LeNotre. We were disappointed in one restaurant. Mon Ami Gobi, recommended for the views of the Bellagio fountains. The French onion soup was not authentic and rather awful, really. We loved the central location and walked all over the Strip checking out many well known hotel/casino properties. We also took the free shuttle to the Rio to see Penn and Teller. If you want to explore the Strip, you need very good walking shoes and lots of stamina, each property is HUGE, or, you will need to take short taxi trips. You cannot just walk across the Strip from any location, there are barricades/medians/divides and lots of heavy traffic. It's a very long walk to a crosswalk or a pedestrian bridge. You may need to take a taxi to get across the street (Seriously.... down one side and then a U-turn) Or, you can spend all your time in Paris Las Vegas, (and on the same side of the Strip) it's a self-contained, full service resort. You don't need to leave unless you want to explore. If you want to shop, the Miracle Mile, your typical mall is next door. Upscale shops are in nearby properties including the Bellagio and Ceasar's Palace (but they are \"across\" the street). Again, plan on lots of walking, through crowds, or very short taxi trips. The hotel pool area is very large, plenty of room for everyone. As another reviewer mentioned, loud music was played in the late afternoon which drove me back indoors. The hot tubs were small, a little crowded and a little worn/worse for the wear. The deluxe room was OK, on the 17th floor, bathroom extremely large and probably recently renovated. We declined a check-in offer to pay an additional $80 to be upgraded to a room with a great view of the Strip and so we had a lousy view out the back - but that was our choice. We felt we had already paid what we wanted to, for a room. Another reviewer mentioned an express check-in which can be arranged only on the morning of your arrival, by phone and which cannot be used 11 or 12 noon. (Study previous reviews/hotel website carefully). Definitely make arrangements for this expres check-in (by phone) in advance of your arrival, or plan on waiting in a line for a good 15 to 30 minutes or more when hordes of people descend upon the front desk. It's just a very, very large resort. If all stations are manned, the long line should move quickly. Very similar to a long check-in at an airport. Plan on lots of time for check-out as well, or, use express check-out. Each day, review your bill on the TV screen so you'll be prepared to use express check-out. It's really, really easy to get lost in the lobby, casino, hallways and boulevards. Plan on lots of extra time for getting lost, walking in the wrong direction (indoors) and especially for meeting up with others. Plan on group meeting points, cell phones and lots of asking the staff for help/directions. It's all very confusing. We liked trying out the Monorail one night, taking it from one end to the other and back again to see all the lights at nighttime. Again, LOTS of walking. The closest stop/entrance is in the hotel next door (Bally's), but it's a very long walk from the front of Bally's hotel to the Monorail. It runs all along the BACK of the properties, quite some distance from the hotels. It would be OK, if you can walk a great distance from the front through to the back of the properties with stops on the route. If you're not actually going to a hotel directly on the route forget it, and use the sidewalk out front or a taxi. We thought it was fun to try out one night to see the lights at night, but otherwise, too far out back to be truly practical. There are many escalators involved, so it did not seem to be wheelchair accessible. Finally, maid service, very prompt on the first days (mid-week), really, really late on the weekend (as in mid to late afternoon). Again, it's a large place. Try calling housekeeping to see if you can get improved service. Try tipping well on a daily basis and speaking to the maid directly. It might help, it might not. Room service - we had a good lunch in the room mid-day, but here is another issue a previous reviewer mentioned. Each morning we would see room service trays/plates/carts outside many rooms in the hallway (many people did not want to wait in the long lines at the restaurants). All day we went in and out of our rooms and the used trays/plates/carts remained in the hallway all afternoon, leaving an odor and obstacles to step past/around. This is where the most improvement is needed, clearing away the dirty dishes and carts from the hallways much more promptly. I've stayed in hotels where you were requested to phone for removal as soon as you were finished. The hotel knows who ordered room service.

When it comes to the view it provides, I don't think nothing beats Paris. Let me explain from my experience. Whenever I visit Vegas, I try different hotels to see how I like them. The first time I went to Vegas was back in 2000. I didn't know anything about it, and I stayed at a hotel called Sahara Hotel. It was actually very affordable and very close to Hilton (where the conference was held), but when I tried to reach the main part of the strip (Bellagio fountain, Forum Shop...etc), I had to walk to the point I got soaked with sweat and my legs got numb. Second time, I stayed at Harrahs, which turned out to be OK. Nothing to brag about, but close to where the major shows are and very affordable. Caesars Palace was a big disappointment. It's much more expensive than other hotels in the area, but the room I stayed was very generic (with ordinary bathroom and beds) with a dismal view of the parking lot. Come to think of it, most rooms at Caesars Palace seems to have same kind of views. Unless you are ready pay a lot of money and stay at the rooms of the Augustus Tower facing Bellagio, this hotel does not provide any views of any kind. Venetian, less expensive, was OK. All the rooms are suites and the basic one I stayed at provided enough space and the bathroom looked gorgeous (better than Bellagio, and probably the best on the strip). And this hotel is scented wonderfully (kind of magnolia/lilac-ish). The problem was the view, again. You can look down on the Mirage volcano, but other than that, virtually no views at all. Deluxe Lakeview room of Bellagio was OK at best. the room was not that large and the window was kind of small in size. The bathroom was mediterranean (sort of), but the artificial vases looked weird and after experiencing Venetian, it's just plain-looking. You can look down on the fountain, but the window is so tightly built in that you don't hear a thing from outside. You have to turn on the TV and turn to some channel to listen to the fountain show music. It felt weird standing at the narrow window looking down on the fountain \"down there\" while listening music coming from the TV set behind.....Never again. When I got to the front desk of Paris, I asked for a room in the northwest wing (as north as possible). The room I reserved was called Premiere (as opposed to Luxury) and they're the more expensive rooms and they're facing the strip. Based on what I learned from this trip, the Premiere rooms are numbered XX23, XX21.....XX03, XX01 then XX76, XX78.....XX94, XX96, from south to north on each floor. My room was 2196. I was pleasantly surprised by its view! Just because Paris is shaped like a cross looking from up above, none of the premiere rooms provide straight-forward view of the Bellagio fountain. The views are a little bit oblique. And unfortunately, the maintenance people don't seem to keep the window (outside) clean, and you'll find some dirts on the outsideof the windows. Looking at the Bellagio fountain and the Eifel Tower through my window, I quickly learned that though you choose Premiere rooms, you may have bad luck having the Eifel Tower in your way blocking the view of the fountain! Looks like the center of the Bellagio (shaped like a tripod) and the Fountain is about 1/4 block more north than the center of the cross-shaped building of Paris and the Eifel Tower. So, (this is my guess with IQ of 164 based on my own observation), if you stay somewhere between XX13, XX11...... XX03, XX01, probably, the Eifel Tower will be located in the dead center of your view. If you go all the way south towards XX15, XX17......XX23, you'll have a decent view of the Fountain with the nothern part of it being blocked by the Eifel Tower. Actually, the view from my room (2196) must have been better than any other Premiere rooms on the same floor, because the Eifel Tower is far left in your vision and it does not block the view of Bellagio at all. I thought it was the best view, having a full view of the Bellagio fountain with Eifel Tower and the arc of Triumph on its side. I loved it. Actually, there was another surprise waiting for me. I must have dozed off in bed (looking forward to the shows that night). I was waken up by the sound almost like thunders. I thought it must have started to rain.......wait. I'm in Vegas, where it almost never rains...... Turned out it was the fountain show. The windows of Paris Hotel are kind of dirty, but it's not firmly built like Bellagio, and you can actually hear and feel the fountain show from your room! At night, the Eifel Tower is illuminated, and the fountain shows looked enchanting! If you're looking for a hotel which is affordable and comes with a great view, I strongly recommend Paris. Book Premiere Room, and ask for XX94 or XX96 on the higher floor. The lower you are, the less great view of the fountain since the Eiffel Tower gets thicker towards the ground. You need to expect some dirts on the window (not that bard, though), and a very unremarkable bathroom and beds. But once you enjoy the fountain show from there, you'll agree with me!

Our suite had a newer flat-screen TV, a separate jacuzzi tub & shower & even a bidet in the water closet! The linens on the bed were slightly scratchy, but overall, the bed was cozy. The downsides: No water bottles in the room! I think better hotels chould stock water for their guests - even if they are for purchase. Tap in Vegas is not pleasant. Le Central bar did not offer bar snacks, but told us we could go purchase them in the sundries ship. Strange. Worse: When I called to request a cabana, I was told that the rate posted on the website was wrong, ($250), that they were actually $300. Because the cabanas were currently booked, we were placed on a waiting listt. Then, the next day I got an e-mail saying the rate was now $325, and would I still desire the cabana? The reason I am willing to pay for cabanas is because I have had skin cancer in the past, and I prefer to sit in the shade. We ended up in a \"Villa\", which is really an outdoor room, but the lounge chairs are all in the sun. When I requested an umbrella, I was told they had none!! I sat with my lounge chair plastered against the side of the villa in the only shade it provided. When my husband requested fruit, they brought us the $9.95 fruit plate with yogurt & cut up fruit, but we had to ask for plates & utinsils to eat the fruit. 1/2 hour later, our complimentary fruit basket arrived. I wish the waitress had told us that we were getting the basket when we ordered the fruit plate. The very worse, was the tip, which was apparently included, but we were not informed. We gave our server a very generous 40% tip, and then, when we checked out, we realized that they added a 20% tip to the original bill, then added our 40% tip to that, meaning that we actually paid a 60% tip - I am a big tipper, but that was ridiculous.

This was our third visit to the city; the last one being 11 years ago. We had previously stayed at the Luxor and the Monte Carlo. In comparison, the Paris hotel is smaller and therefore, easier to get around inside. The lobby of the hotel is configured to look like a village square with a gazebo in the centre (Gustav's bar). A 'Main street' with shops and restaurants streams away from the lobby and toward Bally's hotel. The 'Main Street' is where you find the buffet. The designers have done an excellent job of recreating the 'feel' of Paris and small-town France. If you've never gone to France, this is a good facsimile.

There was no view unless you consider the garage rooftop a view but it was quiet. I think if we were paying top dollar we might have been more fussy. Food: There is a Sweet shop next to the elevators (as well as a convenience store) which is good for coffee, etc. Further down the 'Main Street' there is JJ Boulangerie (a cafeteria style deli) which also has outside seating. My husband and I both had the tuna salad special. Big mistake. There were two icecream scoops of tuna salad on a baguette with a potatoe salad side. ($6.99 ea.) The food was good but way too much. Many couples were ordering one serving and splitting it in two. Try this approach if you're not a big eater. Across the 'street' is the Village Buffet and there are also a couple of restaurants. There is also a large outdoor cafe which overlooks the lobby. We ate there for our first night. The food was blah. I ordered penne pasta with pomodore. What I got was disintegrating overcooked pasta with a can of stewed tomatoes dumped over top. ($12.99) Excellent service however. The following morning we tried the Village Buffet. The line-up was 50 people deep. The Paris Hotel is owned by Harrah's Group so upon registering with the hotel, you should get a book of coupons with discounts entitling you to eat at the buffets at one of their other hotels. Regardless of which hotel you go to, breakfast buffets are $14.99 each, lunch $17.99 and dinner $24.99 each. We decided to go to the Flamingo buffet. They gave us a discount of $5 dollars EACH so, in effect we were paying $10 each for a full buffet. Harrahs buffet was so-so. We had the lunch buffet at Caesar's. The waiter tried to scam us and only took off just the $5. After some confrontation, he did us a 'favour' and compted us the other $5. We also decided to try the 'Nosh' in Bally's for a quick bite. We found it to be a great place to grab a coffee and toasted bagel. You can get to it as you come out of Paris into Bally's, turn left and left again and follow the back wall to the escalator. The Nosh is at the base of the escalator. For our last night, we decided to eat at the Bellagio's dinner buffet. ($27.99) For a few bucks more, it's worth it. King Crab legs, sushi, roast lamb, etc. The best buffet we've ever had. Oddly enough, we never went to the Village buffet. Every time we passed it, there was a line up. Size-wise, the buffet is small which may account for the line-ups. In comparison, the Flamingo buffet is large and spacious so the line-ups move fast. Even with 20 people in front of us, we were inside within 7 minutes. In general, most of the hotels on the strip have long line-ups at meal times. If you're prepared to eat off-hours, like 2 pm or 8:30 pm, the wait time, if any, is considerably shorter. In general, our overall experience with the Paris hotel was pleasant. The staff was always efficient, courteous. The location is fabulous. You're in the heart of the 'strip'. The Miles of shops is next door. Great shopping and many eateries. For a good selection of general souvenirs, try the ABC store. Note: Paris hotel does not offer free internet access. You need to pay a surcharge of $35. However, there are internet access machines which look like ATMs near the elevators. For $0.35/min ($5 minimum charge), you can access the internet, if you want to confirm / book your seats, etc. online and you can print your boarding pass too for $1 each. (Although at the airport, they tore up our boarding passes and issued their own instead so you might want to save a buck.)", "Date": "April 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlantic Beach, Florida", "Title": "\u201cNice Stay at the Paris\u201d", "Author": "arubbound", "ReviewID": "UR15069975", "Content": "My boyfriend and I just returned today from our second stay at the Paris.

We had decided to stay there after having a poor experience at the Excalibur several years earlier. Our impression of the Excalibur was that everything was understaffed except the casino. We booked the Paris 5 months ago based on its star rating and the reviews on Expedia. In the last month I discovered Tripadvisor and was very chagrined to find a number of negative reviews. To be honest, after reading many of the reviews, we weren't sure what we would get. As a teacher and an accountant we are unfortunately members of the \"firmly indebted middle class\" and therefore not \"big spenders\" or \"high rollers.\" Many of the reviews left us with the impression that poor service, room assignment and inflated expenses awaited us. The Paris did not disappoint us, we were treated very well. The service was excellent for the entire stay. We arrived in Las Vegas at 8:30 in the morning and taking the advise of another traveller, phoned the express check in. The man was very friendly, he told us to come directly to the hotel rather then assigning us a room later in the day. He mentioned that they had rooms that were not rented the previous night and he was pretty sure they would have something available. We were at the hotel by 9:30 am and were assigned a room. It was a fantastic start to our holiday. We easily could have received the popular \"check in time is 4:00pm\" Our room on the 16th floor, was clean and nicely decorated. The bed was very comfortable and housekeeping was friendly and thorough. We have no complaints. The room did face the back of the hotel and the parking structure but the views of the mountains were nice. People who book in Vegas and most other places need to realize that 65% of a hotel's rooms are either going to be too low down or on the backside of a wing to get the sought after view. Those going in with the attitude \"Give the person in front of me a shitty view and give the person behind me a shitty view, but give me a good one or else I'm going to complain\" just set themselves up for irritation and disappointment. Unless your paying $800/night , accept the fact that room assignment is going to be a proverbial crap shoot We ordered room service for lunch. The service time was reasonable (30 min) and the food average. The cost was high. It was $56 plus tip for a soup, a sandwich, a hamburger and a three cup carafe of coffee. Again though, reasonable expectations will lower your probability of disappointment. Don't stay at the Paris, Caesar's, Wynn etc if you want to save money. OF COURSE THEIR EXPENSIVE their four and five star hotels in the middle of the Vegas strip. We often walked over to Planet Hollywood where many of the restaurants were lower priced. Breakfast omelettes could be had for less then $10. Although our experience was that after the omelette, juice, coffee and tip, the average price of breakfast or lunch climbed upwards of $20/person. We realized after our third day, that often you get more variety for basically the same price by doing the buffets.

The hotel room had lots of space and the bathrooms were spacious as well. It was also clean and the decorations and furniture were pretty new and cute. I spent a few afternoons at the pool and really enjoyed my time lounging there. DO NOT get a drink from the bar though! It was a total rip off since I was basically drinking syrup. They put barely any liquor in the margarita I ordered and didn't mix it up at all. The location of the hotel is perfect since it's pretty much in the middle of the strip and right across the street from the Bellagio. You can see the fountain show easily! You can also get back to your room easily at this hotel. It's very nice after a long day of walking. Some of the hotels force you to walk thru their large casino in order to get back to your room.

Since I enjoy the center strip area she made hotel arrangements at the Mirage which I had never stayed at, however, as I do with all trips I checked out the reviews on Trip Advisor where I've never been misguided whether for domestic or international travel. Boy am I glad I did, there seemed to be many complaints re: the Mirage needing a make over so I checked out Paris where there was a more positive consensus. I had our agent rebook us to Paris. The price was the same!!! We arrived at noon Sunday & had to wait in line at checkin for no more than 5 minutes. I asked for a strip room but as seems the case was told it would entail an additional cost , I opted out. She offered a room on the 6th floor which was ready I asked for higher & she pleasantly found one on the 18th floor that the maid was just finishing up in. She gave us a number to call back & we did so about 10 minutes later, the room was ready for us! The room 1871 was in the back of hotel looking down at a parking lot roof below , however it had a beautiful view of the mountains as well. Who cared, we spent little if any time in the room anyway. The room was recently reappointed with great furniture & the batth was brand new ,all tiled with both a glass enclosed stall shower & a separate tub. The place was immaculate, & the service from housekeeping was phenominal. We did have to call for service since the shower had a slow drain & the iron wasn't working. Both were handled immediately. The hotel is centrally located on the strip & a short walk to all major hotels & malls. The monorail is just behind it & Paris is connected to the Bally's Casino next door without having to go outside. The layout is a theme of the streets of Paris & you really feel as if you're walking on them, including the blue sky & clouds above you on the ceiling. The restaurants are very good & reasonably priced. The breakfast brunch we heard was great but you really need to be there by 8 am. Anytime around 9 & all the restaurants have long lines. We ate breatkast at a small bakery & sandwich shop just across from the brunch & it was unbelievable, the rolls were the best I've had . We met couples who came from the Bellagio to Paris each day for those rolls. (Olive & Tomato rolls) They were from New Jersey as well & know what good bread is! The staff is consumer friendly , if we asked where something was located ,they didn't point, they brought us there, despite our saying 'Its Ok you don't need to do that\", they continued with us until we were where we wanted to go. Now thats 5 star service. This service was afforded by all staff from security to maintenance! The only bad thing is the machines were a bit thrifty on me, however a young newly married man did win a million + on a $1 Wheel of Fortune progressive on Monday evening the 17th. It was St. Paddy;s day & O'Shea's at the Flamingo was \"nuts\" however, their usual $3 & $5 tables were not to be found this day. Oh well supply & demand, the place was JAMMED to the gunnels! It was a little windy & brisk so the pool was not an option until Thursday the 20th. We went & found courteous staff, pleanty of chairs & towels.

We loved the place, the location, the efficiency and the friendliness of the staff. We even opted for the view of the fountains with the breakfast and appetizer package and I am really happy that we made the choice to upgrade! We ended up getting one of the newly renovated \u201cdiamond\u201d rooms on the 29th floor and it was absolutely beautiful. There was so much space, a beautiful view of the strip, Eiffel tower and the fountains, a ton of space and a great large bathroom!!! Just keep in mind that the maid service will come and clean as well as make your bed, but if you want your sheets changed you will have to specifically ask for it with the card that they give you in the room. Although the Paris was always busy, the minute you stepped into your elevator the madness seemed to melt away. Room service was quick, but the food was just \u201cok\u201d \u2013 we had wings and a burger. The food for the breakfast and the appetizers (up on the 31st floor) were excellent and contained fresh fruit, parfait, bagels, cream cheese, lox, fresh juice and many pastries and cereals. For the appetizers (from 5-8) there was cocktail shrimp (sooooooo much of it!!), a variety of cheese, crackers, bread, pastas and kabobs and an optional bar (which you can pay for if you decide to drink \u2013 and you pour your own beverages!). I also did the pool for a day (one of the last days we were there and it was really nice. There was an abundance of reclining chairs, so there was plenty for everyone and the pool was enormous. Although the pool has hours from 9-6 it seemed like the shadow overcast the pool around 4:30 so arrange your lawn chair on the immediate side of the pool if you are going later. There is also a bar and waitresses that you can order from, as well as tables by the bar and cabanas that you can rent out for a day. The hotel provides you with towels once you get down there so no need to bring one to the pool. The location of the Paris was perfect \u2013 only a few blocks away from everything and a short duce (the double decker bus) ride away from downtown Vegas with Freemont Street. The duce ($5 all day for a ride or $2 each way) stops right in front of the hotel if you are going downtown and you can also catch the connector bus to the Outlets about half way to down town. We did not visit any of the restaurants in the hotel but a couple looked great. The restaurant at the Eiffel tower was closing for lunch the day we decided on going and the As Sin restaurant looked great (if you like sushi) , but we had already eaten elsewhere. Mon Ami was always busy but I had been there before and had a terrible experience where I will not go back. As for the gambling experience the Paris seemed extremely classy. Tables were as low as $10 to play depending on what you wanted to do and the craps tables seemed hot. Waitresses were everywhere and no one was without a drink. Also, the waitressses weren't getting tipped much so when we flipped her $2 she came back every 5-10 minutes. We had multiple drinks readily available!! Only one suggestion for those that are checking out in the morning \u2013 don\u2019t go around 10 or 11 because it is when everyone is checking out and they have the least amount of staff at the counters. If you do want to check out at that time be prepared to wait 20 minutes in line OR use the express checkout if you can. Also, keep an eye on thier hotel site - after I had booked my stay with them, the prices went down. I called them to see if I could take advantage of the prices that they were currently offering and they ended up saving me $200 without any hassle!

I talked to one of the maids, and she said they've figured out it must be the new carpet that smells. It's a darling houndstooth print in black and tan, and I think the dye has an odor about it.

When we stayed at Bally's we walked through the connecting hall (which is ALWAYS crowded) and into the Paris casino but didn't gamble there. We did eat at the Le Burger Brasserie Sports Grill that trip (it is right next to the Bally's entrance) and the food was great and pretty reasonable. After that trip to Bally's Harrahs sent us offers for free nights at both Bally's and Paris so we decided to stay at the higher end hotel of the two this trip. (If the rooms weren't free we would not have stayed there-it's a little out of our price range) Everytime we go to Vegas we pick up little tidbits to make the next trip easier. Paris offers Express check in. USE IT!! Just call [--] and choose option 6 at least two hours before you arrive and tell them what time you expect to get in. I think they start answering the phones at 6AM. You will need to give them your name, the credit card that you booked the room with and what time you expect to arrive and they will have everything ready when you get there. (I called a couple of days early and asked some questions about the procedure and the person I talked to was most helpful.) We landed at 10:30 AM. We took a cab to the hotel (forget the shuttles), and checked our bags with the bellman. He told me where the express check in line was. I went inside and there were at least 80 people wound through the ropes waiting in the regular check in line. The express check in line had one person ahead of me. In fifteen minutes I was in my room and my bags were on their way up to me. Great room, strip view, best and quickest check in in the five trips we took there. It was a great beginning. The maid servce was wonderful-I did leave a $2 tip on the bed each day- so we had no problems with that either. We didn't eat at the buffet although there was always a line so it must be good- but we did eat at Le Provencal one evening- I had soup and a sandwich and it was really good. We also got our coffee at a little place to the left of the elevators (Lenore I think) but beware-the pastries taste better than they look. Most mornings I had to have a delicious treat along with my caffeine fix! In the afternoons the shelves are filled with fresh made desserts of all kinds and are out of this world. (I have never been to France so maybe that is what they are used to) The casino is pretty dark compared to most of them and it is beautifully decorated as most are. The poker room is relatively small but has restrooms attached so there is no need to walk clear across the casino to use the facilities. Planet Hollywood (right next door) has wonderful shopping that is a very short walk. If you go to the Fashion Show Mall take a cab as it is farther than you think. (especially if you have packages) We were at both ends of the strip when stayed at TI and MGM and Paris is right in the middle which is really nice. The night before we were to leave around midnight I went to the front desk and had the gal there pull up my bill just to double check it.

After a night out, we put the \"DO NOT DISTURB\" sign on our door before going to bed. The housekeeper come by three times to knock and see if you wanted the room cleaned. When she kept getting turned away, housekeeping CALLED our room. When my boyfriend told her that we had a \"DO NOT DISTURB\" sign on our door and had not been able to sleep for more than an our at a time, her response was \"The sign doesn't say DO NOT DISTURB AT ALL.\" I have never seen one of those. We called the front desk. BIG MISTAKE. The manager on duty had to be one of the rudest, most ignorant, and ill mannered creatures I have ever had the misfortune to communicate with. We ordered room service and EVERY SINGLE TIME, our order was late, missing something, and virtually inedible. We got coffee and no cups, food with no silverware with which to eat it, breakfast for one when we had ordered two, and cold, soggy, or dried out items that had not survived the hours between being cooked and delivered. On one occasion, I called housekeeping and, upon getting the enthusiastically barked \"HOUSEKEEPING,\" I said \"Hello, how are you?\" and got a lovely \"uh huh\" in response. Asking for turn down service, I was told it was not available on our floor at all. Another \"manager\" said it was available after two days, and yet another said it was available, but having spent so long trying to get the right answer on the matter, it was now too late to get done that day. Requesting bathrobes, which EVERY hotel provides, we were told that they would be sent up, then told that we had to get them at the spa (huh?) then that we had to BUY them, then informed that we had to get passes at the spa to get them, and finally, the hotel does not provide bathrobes to its guests. When my boyfriend called room service once, the response he got to his \"Good morning, I'd like to order room service\" was \"Where are you from?\" Apparently he had an accent no one else had managed to pick up on. EVERY SINGLE THING ABOUT THIS HOTEL WAS AWFUL! I cannot get over the terrible treatment , bad manners, lack of respect to their guests, absolutely unacceptable behavior of management, and utter disrespect one receives at this miserable hotel. When we told our friends and family about our stay, those who had been there laughed and told us they had warned us, those who had not thought it was a joke. We always stay at the Wynn, which is, without a single doubt, THE ABSOLUTE BEST hotel in Vegas, but had thought to try a new place once. Sorry, Wynn. We've learned our lesson and will never stray again.

The Paris was always on my list of places I wanted to stay. In October, 2007 I finally stayed there and was less then impressed. Let me start out by saying I got married in Vegas on 10/20/07 and had 60 of my closest friends and family out there with me, most of which stayed at The Paris as well! The Paris is a beautiful hotel! The outside is FULL of gorgeous detail and style. The inside is awesome, like the streets of Paris. In my opinion the most beautiful area inside The Paris is Registration, it's gorgeous! However, The rooms are less then impressive! Honostly the rooms at Hooters (which are half the price) have more bells, whistles, and comfort. The rooms are small and don't have closets which can be a real pain in the rear especially when you have more then two people staying in your room. I also had a situation with the staff the night of my Bachelorette party. I was locked out of my room and my fiance (at the time) was sleeping \"soundly\" in the room and didn't wake up to my knocking or phone calls. I went to the front desk where I was talked down to and told unless I thought he wasn't breathing they would not let me in. I showed them ID and everything and yes, the room was in my NAME! When I became \"appropriately\" upset. The man at the desk told me I was being unreasonable! Maybe it was because it was the week of my wedding and I wasn't comfortable lying/pretending that I thought my fiance was dead ....just to get into my hotel room (that was in my name, whice I had paid GOOD MONEY FOR)! I appreciate security however, I don't appreciate someone pulling rank and being difficult just because. Basically it took me approaching a less \"unreasonable\" staff member to finally get to the bottom of the issue and get into my room. I think this situation was a huge turn off for me.

As it turns out, SuperBowl Weekend is one of the busiest times in Las Vegas. I was skeptical about Paris as our Home Base, however given its location, and proximity to Bally's, Caesar's, and Bellagio...how bad could it be? Not to mention as a Total Rewards member, the room nights were comped. So, who's complaining. Well certainly not me. We ended up in the Lemans Suite. Upon arrival the room, we discovered someone else's belongings in the room. The staff worked quickly to fix the \"problem\" and gave us another LeMans suite on a higer floor that had been renovated. The room was basically a large ~ 700 square feel complete with 50 in. flat screen HDTV with a King bed and the room connected to another room with 2 queens and another 50 in. TV. It is the appoximate size of a normal room ~ 350 Square Feet. This was plenty of room for 2 guys. The casino was really nice with high ceilings. I liked the theme and really enjoyed gambling there. Drink service was great. Never had to wait. We played golf a Paiute Golf Club, which is about a 25-30 minute drive. It was about the most affordable course for Super Bowl Weekend. They have 3 courses there, and they're designed by Pete Dye. We played the Wolf course complete with Island green. GIR, but 3-putted. We payed about $135. Nice clubhouse and the course was in good shape. Greens were brown, but rolled fast and true. I was floored by this. They looked terrible, but were the kind of greens you expect when you pay this kind of money. Anyways, the diamond lounge is very nice and convenient to the casino. We ate breakfast at the restaurant next to the buffet. Can't remember the name, but it was pricey. About $40 for 2. It was good, but would have been happy with a Denny's, Waffle House, or Cracker Barrel type of breakfast and price. Long line for buffet. I have read this in the past, so I don't have a good solution for this. I liked being connected to Bally's. We gambled there as well. Sometimes they will offer lower table limits. $15 on craps (one table) and $25 on the others. All the tables at Paris are $25 and during busy times will have one that is $50 or $100. BTW, on Sunday night after the game, all the craps tables at Caesar's were $100 and only one $25 table. All of the tables were full. The crews/dealer's at Paris were very pleasant and helpful. They would get into the action, but the boxmen/pitbosses were mostly standoffish. I like interacting with these guys, but they hardly spoke, even when engaged. It appeared that they simply wanted to be somewhere else. But, they ARE at work. And everyone has their days. Housekeeping was great. I called down at 5 PM for service, went to dinner and 2 hours later had a clean room. I would recommend Paris to anyone who wants to be in the heart of the strip and likes to gamble in a unique setting. Service, hotel employees, and facilities were great. BTW, we were lucky enough to get some armbands for their VIP Superbowl party and it was amazing. Can you say, 8 x 20 ft. screens, and all the food and drink you can stand. AWESOME!!!!

Initial impressions were good - we were efficiently and quickly checked in and offered an upgrade to a \"strip view\" for $45 extra per night. I wanted a view of the Bellagio fountains so agreed to the upgrade. I was initially disappointed with the room itself. It did not appear anywhere near as luxurious as the room we'd had at the MGM Grand, however after a good nights sleep I had a good look around and the room was actually quite well appointed. I think the old fashioned decor is by design to give the rooms a \"olde world parisian feel\". The rooms have everything you need - even the mini-bar was reasonably priced. (Beer out of the mini-bar was actually cheaper than in the bars in the casino). My only gripe would be that there was no free internet access which I kind of expect nowadays. We had one issue with a blocked toilet, however we went out in the morning and this had been fixed by the time we returned. The hotel and casino itself is much easier to navigate than the MGM Grand. The whole place is quite compact by Vegas standards which makes for a nice atmosphere (plus your legs don't hurt as much from walking around).

I must say that all of the employees were exceptionally cordial. There was always a greeting or a smile as you passed by. When you asked for directions they were more likely to walk you to the location than to simply point it out. It really made us feel welcome. There were some very nice restaurants. The dinner buffet at \"Le Village Buffet\" was above average. The food was appetizing and nicely presented.

My original reservation was at the Orleans, but after experiencing a number of problems there the first night (beds too hard, the sounds of slamming doors at 7 a.m.), I decided to book my second night at the Paris instead. This was the weekend of the Monte Carlo hotel fire, so many guests had been displaced, and most other casinos were unexpectedly on overload. Arriving at the Paris shortly after noon on Saturday, I expected that I'd have to leave the bags and come back after 4 p.m. to check in. Instead, a very nice lady greeted me, was sorry to hear that I had a bad experience at another casino, and immediately gave me key cards to the room, which was on the 12th floor and had a nice view of the Bellagio fountain and Paris' Eiffel Tower (also a lot of construction and cranes, but I was forewarned about that). After explaining that the bed was too hard for me to sleep on comfortably at the other Casino, she said to call Housekeeping once in the room, and they would cover the bed with a \"cell foam pad\" to make it softer. That turned out to be a 2-part process: A very overworked housekeeper dropped of the cell-foam in a giant plastic bag, then said someone else would put it on later. Four hours later, another housekeeper arrived to \"install\" it, but I had already put it on myself. It did make the bed very comfortable, and I got a great night's sleep the second night of my stay. The room was decorated in classic French-style and was immaculate. The windows were double-pane glass, but I could still hear the music playing from the Bellagio fountain after 10 p.m. I was concerned this would keep me up, but either the music was turned off later, or it wasn't loud enough to bother me (and I'm a pretty light sleeper). Paris has a great breakfast buffet, which was $14.99 the Sunday morning I was there. After 11 a.m., the price goes up something like $10 more for \"Champagne Brunch,\" but I thought the regular breakfast was excellent! Included all drinks, including juice, and a glass of juice that size would cost almost the whole price of this breakfast at IHOP! I know that it's all a facade, but I like the French feel and environment of the Paris Casino. It draws a lot of European tourists, many who were speaking French while there.

It was my first time in Vegas so it was a great experience to be at the Paris for the first time. After arriving at the airport we were taken to our hotel via shuttle bus. I believe a shuttle is a great way to get around vegas since you don't really need to go off of the strip for anything. Paris is connected to Bally's Hotel and you can pick up a free shuttle to Rio hotel from there. This will allow you to have a peek at some other hotels that are off of the strip. Since we were in Vegas during a time when there were no major conventions and very few people in Vegas we requested an upgrade to our room...a strip view. We requested this at the time of booking and were granted our request with some bit of additional coaxing. I'm sure if we slipped the attendant a $20 or something she would have given it to us without hassel. Staying at the Paris like I said is a great place to be on the strip because it's central. Walking the strip can be a real chore after awhile because it takes so long to get from one end to the other. Staying central means you can walk one end...then come back to your room. Rest a while and then hit the strip going the other way....or wait the next day to go the other way. Looking at the strip I didn't think the walk would have been that difficult...but believe me it is! Take some good shoes with you because you end up walking forever. Unfortunately Paris doesn't have free wireless internet in any points in the hotel. You have to have a hardline to the internet so take an extra network cable with you. Being that it was January Vegas was on the cold side so we didn't get a chance to try out the pool. It looked good though...but if you ever find yourself down there in January pack an extra fleece jacket. The nights are cold. For food Paris has several restaurants to choose from including its own Buffet and 2 restaurants we tried. One of them you can get a good breakfast and pick up some coffee. I can't remember the name of the eatery, must be a bistro, but for $2.00 bucks you can pick up a good med coffee since the rooms don't come with coffee pots. There is another JJ's Boulangerie that sells sandwiches and plate food for cheap but I don't recommend it...you can pick up some eats outside on the strip somewhere. I would recommend the eiffel tower views plus visiting the restaurant there. Its a must see when you are there.

So I went straight to my room at 1:02 PM and took my nap - no need to store my luggage and wait! I love the bed - eiderdown duvets, as in Europe. The slots were good to me and they have the best restaurants. Nothing beats the Village Buffet in variety, price, quality and service. And of course, you gotta know how to play it to get the best deal, pricewise. They have lunch running from 11:30 -3:30. Dinner starts at 3:30. Lunch is $7 less expensive than dinner because at dinner, they bring out more elaborate food, roasts, etc. Some of you are way ahead of me here - but, for the others - what you do is get there at 3:15 - you pay the lunch price, and 15 minutes later, all the lunch dishes are still there, plus they bring out the rest of their complete dinner menu!

Of course, you can enjoy free drinks while you gamble, but if you're just walking around, check out the shift shop for booze.

We had complicated requests that cannot be handled over a web site. We were celebrating my Dad's 85th birthday, and we required three rooms. A handicap accessible room for my Dad, with a connecting room for his caregiver, and a separate room for my husband and I - all non smoking. The internet rates were $99/night per standard room and with our AAA discount it was more like$88/night. More comments see below. I give the Hotel an A+ on location, and the convenience of entry from Las Vegas Blvd. Some properties, make entry to casino/hotel more challenging and require lots of walking just to get to the front door. When pushing a wheel chair you think of these things. I give them an A+ on room service, it was quick, delicious, generous portions, and the Coffee is really delicious. Dining: I loved dining at Mon Ami Gabi, we had a mid afternoon lunch, and the service, menu and food were all excellent. The hotel cafe was moderate and pricey, but convenience was important. We wanted to try the Creperie, but found out you have to wait in line, no table service. A minus for them. We also dined across the street at the Bellagio Cafe one evening and had a wonderful meal, with excellent ambiance, varied menu, and acceptable prices, not to mention excellent service.. I gave an A+ for the property in general. I know it's not the most elegant of properties. It is charming though and the theme was fun, the size of the property made it large enough to find new things, but not so large that we felt exhausted exploring through crowds of people. We loved the Boulevard just for the ambiance, and the ride to the top of the Eiffel Tower was a fun experience. I also gave an A to the Conceriege, who helped us effortlessly with the purchase of tickets to see La Reve at the Wynn, an amazing show. The biggest negative in my opinion was the bed and the bedding. The bed is very firm, which I would overlook, except that the hotel does not use fitted sheets on the bottom mattress. (A trend throughout the industry.) I hate the way the sheets become un-tucked when you roll over, which you have to do because the mattress is so uncomfortable. I was sleeping on lumps of bedding - which was very annoying. The top bedding was much better... two higher thread count flat sheets enveloped a decent down comforter. The look is clean, but no where near luxurious. Note sheets will not be changed out unless you call housekeeping to request the clean sheets. They only remake the bed instead. The towels were soft and large enough to be passable. I agree with everyone about the TV's in the rooms, they are not flat screen. They are the old style - not HD. In the case of my Dad's room, which was the Suite, the TV was so far from the bed that he would need binoculars to watch it from bed. They'll have to figure out something, since all their French styled armories hold the TV's, and they are NOT wide enough to hold a flat screen. My thoughts on the Accessible Room issues: I have to say that making reservations for Wheelchair accessible rooms is always an experience. \" Requests can be made but no guarantees can be promised.\" Once again, we arrived at 2 PM (one hour BEFORE check-in) to find out that there were no more rooms meeting our requests. This happens to us SOOO often as we travel quite a bit with my father. I have tried every method I can think of to get the hotels to guarantee me a room, it usually doesn't work. In this case I called to the Hotel direct 24 hours in advance reconfirmed the reservation, and underscored the importance of getting the accessible room etc. (The girl at the desk did hint that checking in mid week or early Friday we would stand a better chance than on a Saturday as we did. Go figure.) So our reservation assistant got to work, searching their system for something that would satisfy our needs. We eventually settled on an accessible suite ($85 upcharge) connecting to the two queen room, but both were smoking rooms. We were offered these rooms for review, and if not acceptable they would hold the non smoking rooms with everything we wanted but they were not connecting. (The connecting issue is a big factor for us) Anyway, after reviewing the smoking rooms, the smell was clean, and Dad loved the suite - so we accepted those rooms. I give our Reservation Desk assistant an A+ for effort, however I know from experience, that copping an attitude when they are beginning to tell you the bad news gets you no where. You have to act sweet and patient, even though you might be boiling underneath. At least we ended up with something accessible. My last Hotel experience, I personally had to go out and purchase seating for the toilet and shower so my father could use the bathroom, as they had NO accessible rooms left! Since we were attending a WWII reunion, going to another hotel was not an option. I have to say that the reservation clerk tried for over 30 minutes to meet our needs, and even offered to move us on day two, but that would require us to stop our plans mid day and make the move ourselves, not worth the effort! The three days spent in those smoking rooms was not a problem for my Dad or the caregiver. One further note, the accessible rooms were on the 4th floor, which offers no view. Our room was on the 23rd floor, and we faced Planet Hollywood. Honestly it wasn't the best view either. I guess, if the view was the only thing that was important I would have started there, but you always have to compromise somewhere - right? Yes, I would stay again, but only if I got the same price on the rooms, otherwise I'd try a different property and hope for a more comfortable bed.", "Date": "January 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Virginia", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, great location\u201d", "Author": "bb24aka", "ReviewID": "UR12696555", "Content": "If you get an upgraded room, Paris is a great hotel.

Thoroughly enjoyed our last stay and was pleased to see that not too much had changed, for the worse. Arrived late at approx half past midnight. Long queue at check in with some rather disgruntled guests looking either to check in or out, only 3 check in desks open. Some guests said they had been waiting for an hour; maybe it was their complaining that speeded up the process as we were through in 20 mins. Management said they were short staffed. Room on 21st floor, not one of the newly renovated ones, view not particularly inspiring [Hey, how much time do you spend in your room when in Vegas so the view was no problem] but it was clean, well appointed and during our stay, well serviced by housekeeping [Contrast to our last trip to Vegas in 12/06 staying in Bellagio where the room was filthy and housekeeping was v poor]. Bathroom was nice and big and my wife was pleased that the hairdryer was decent! The other member of our party was initially on the 8th floor but check in were good to their word and had her transferred up to the 21st floor the following day; nice room wth a strip view. All in all, staff were helpful and polite. No problems on check out, the express service via in room TV worked fine. Casino was lucky for us, no problems getting drinks. Tip......expect to pay a lot for drinks at the bar. $30 for 3 gin and tonics; from the waitresses in the casino, say $6, do the math! Took breakfast most mornings in the cafe st louis, good food, good service. Alternatives were the buffett or the various coffee shops or creperie. The thing we like about Paris is that it's well sited on the strip , spend a few days mooching up the strip, the next, down the strip. The link to Ballys next door is convenient for the monorail link. Were in Vegas to experience the New Year festivities. Have experienced 'large' events in London and Edinburgh and have to say that Vegas was on a par, fantastic fireworks and really nice, happy, even if inebriated partygoers. Had dinner at Smith and Wolensky's on New Years eve, they serve steak to end all arguments, highly recommended. Have eaten before at the steakhouse in Paris which was awesome as well. The only problem we had was trying to get back into Paris on New Years Eve. There was no advance notification given to guests that there would be access restrictions that evening (other hotels, like Bellagio had notices everywhere). As a result, there was an unholy crush to try and get back in and there was only one access through the barriers operating; at one point, mounted police came through the crowd to ease things. Security weren't allowing famillies and children over the barriers even when they were able to produce room keys. I guess it's all part of the experience but maybe next time, the management could do to revisit its' planning. Anyhow, that won't detract too much from what was overall, a really enjoyable stay.

Sadly, neither is true of this hotel/casino. Here's a list of our problems in a short 2 day stay. 1. Not so sweet suite - We asked to upgrade from the standard room to a suite, we were told that we could do that for just $85.00, which seemed like a deal because we were told the standard price for the suite was $550.00 per night. We were slightly disappointed in the size when we opened the door, for a suite it's the smallest one I've ever seen. In fact, it's not even as large as a large regular hotel room in many hotels. Add to that fact the small 25\" non digital useless TV, and we were glad that most of our entertainment would be outside the room. 2. Holy bedsheet Batman! That's right, holes in our bedsheets. The first set was fine, but when they changed the sheets they put on sheets with holes in them, large enough holes that my wife's toes got caught in one as she slept, lol. If these are the sheets for the 550 a night room, I wonder what the standard rooms get, plastic tarps? 3. Shocked again - The outlet by the sink in the room tripped it's GFCI breaker any time something got plugged into the bottom plug. 4. We wanted to see a show in the hotel during our stay, so we went to the shows and tours desk when we first arrived. We were informed that the cost of the show was $58.00 per person, and no discounts were available. We told the person we would wait and come back, she informed us that we'd better hurry because the show sells out quickly, we distinctly got the feeling of a hard sell being pushed. We went back to the same desk a few hours later, a different person was working, and we inquired if show tickets were still available. She said they were, and she asked if we were staying at the hotel. When we said yes she said we get a discount of two for one. 5. Our second night no turndown service, no towels were picked up, no nothing. 6. Worst of all, when we presented this same list to the front desk as we checked out, it was blown off completely. The clerk said \"I'll pass it along to the manager\". No apologies, no nothing.

We went to the Spa by mandara at Paris the day we arrived. My Mom had never been to a spa and I was a little disappointed that this was her first experience. I told them we had never been here and still no one showed us around, they just pointed and said \"the lockers and showers are back there\". I had a facial don't get me wrong, it was AWESOME, but the rest of the spa is just so-so. Upon check out I asked to talk to a casino host but I was told that we didn't need to. I gambled well over $2500 at Paris alone and always used my card, but I was informed we had only accrued $20 in comps. It would have at least been nice to talk to a casino host. We ate at the buffet which was great, and at Mon Ami Gabi, which was also great (a little expensive) and the burger brasserie which was excellent.

However, once you actually start to look inside the book, some less than favorable things will start to surface by the end of the first chapter. The positives? Paris is one of the few hotels on the strip that really shines when it comes to establishing a theme and carrying it through. The common areas are beautiful and do a great job of making you feel like you've traveled across the pond to France. There is a great amount of attention to detail and the casino common areas and promenade between Paris and Bally's are just lovely. Overall the food is quite good. The 24-hour cafe and selections from room service were very tasty. The Burger Brasserie, situated just outside Bally's, was a great, quick choice with burgers and fries that kept us coming back several times during our stay. And best of all, the Burger Brasserie's prices are a great value for the quality and amount of food you get. Also, the drink service in the casino area was among the best I've ever encountered, you never go thirsty while playing and the cocktail servers are very, very sweet and professional and remember what you like to drink day after day. Mon Ami Gabi is just a magical place to eat. If you can sit outside, it's worth the effort and wait. Dining while the fountains are dancing across the street is unforgettable, and the food and drinks are among the best for the dollar. The business center staff are to be commended. Unbeknownst to myself, two of my credit cards and my social security card fell out of my wallet while I was rummaging through it at the business center. The clerk found them after I left and called by room to let me know. So nice to know honest folks still exist. The negatives? Quite a few I'm afraid. 1. At check-in, you get the feeling you're at a used car lot trying to get a good deal. Make a request for a room upgrade (even when willing to pay extra for it) and you'll find that they're \"totally full\" and \"nothing's available.\" However, the mere appearance of a $20 bill in your hand subtly placed on the counter causes miraculous things to happen. I'd read about this trick from other's experiences on this board, and sure enough, once I let the front desk person notice the folded bill, we went from having a low floor, bally's roof view to a 28th floor fountain view, recently renovated, corner \"p\" suite... at no extra cost. I feel bad that I helped promote this practice, but it did work. Ultimately, it's just bad business for mgmt to allow this to happen. First come, first served ought to be rule. 2. The place just can't handle crowds. The shopping/dining promenade between Bally's/Paris simply can't handle the traffic with numerous bottlenecks that make you feel like you're in line for theme park attraction. Want to eat at the buffet? Be prepared for at least a one-hour wait for (at any time of day, even 2-3 pm). Aside from breakfast, it's a buffet experience that's as average as they come. At one point, the line stretched from the entrance of the buffet to just before the Burger Brasserie, which is about 50 feet from the Bally's entrance. According to the signs, that would be at least a 2 hour wait... for a buffet. These lines for the food establishments also exacerbate the crowding of the walkway and trying to navigate the crowd will quickly try your patience. This lack of sufficient dining capacity is a major, major miss for a hotel this popular. 3. Daily upkeep. On our first night (Monday) we ordered room service. Once finished, we placed the tray outside our door as people normally do and rang room service to have it picked up. The next morning, it was still there. And guess what? It was STILL there the next morning. The tray sat there until 11:30 am on Thursday and it was joined by no less than 2 other trays down our hall section (both there for more than a full 24 hours). That's just unacceptable. Not even the maids acted on it. Imagine the pest problem that could lead to. Inside the room, there was an obvious white stain on the red coverlet on the bed. Any maid paying attention to what she was doing would have noticed it and replaced it with a clean one. We called and asked for a replacement and never got it. We removed it from the bed and each day we found it placed back on the bed after the room was cleaned, the stain still as obvious as ever. 4. Prices. For room service, a burger/fries and two soft drinks came to $28... and gratuity was not included (as most hotels do). Complete and utter rip off of the guests, especially when the same meal at the cafe or burger brasserie is less than $16. 20 oz bottled soft drinks? $3 each. 10oz glass bottled soft drinks from the mini-bar? $4. 5. The 31st floor lounge. Huge rip off. $45 a day for two guests gets you whole/sliced fruit, croissants, toast, coffee, juice and some less than edible smoked salmon for breakfast. For evening, you get cold cut finger sandwiches. Glass of wine? nope. That's not included. Save yourself the money. Have a 3rd in your party? It's $10 per extra person per visit. All in all, I just felt totally taken advantage of at Paris and not well cared for or appreciated. I've stayed at most of the larger properties on the strip, and I won't go back to Paris, except maybe to play and to eat at Mon Ami Gabi. It's such a shame. There's a ton of potential and you WANT to like the place.

The bath area was very large (15'x15' ?) and had a separate room with toilet and bidet. There was a large jacuzzi tub, but not quite big enough for two, and a separate shower. Negatives: Decor was pretty spartan. Walls were almost bare of decoration and everything was done in shades of dull beige. Lots of nicks and chips in the furniture, paint, and moldings; wallpaper was dirty and lifting in many spots . . . overall it just looked worn and tired. Bathroom amenities were skimpy and on par with your average Holiday Inn. I guess I was expecting a Paris suite to have robes, fancy soaps, designer towels, etc., and I was disappointed when it didn't. My biggest complaint was the TV. Just a single, standard 21\" color TV. A suite that size screamed for a couple big screen plasmas in the living area and another near the jacuzzi. Casino is huge and disorienting. I have been in there on several other trips and I still have a hard time finding my way around. Lots of table games, but $15 minimums for BJ with the majority of tables at $25 and up. Very few video poker machines, and they had horrible pay tables. Mostly 7/5 for $1 Jacks or Better. I saw a few 8/5 for $2 and $5 machines.

The only major setback we had was when we checked in we were given a room that was absolutely filthy. There were very obvious \"stains\" on the bed linens, the couch and a chair. I was appauled that they would even give out a room in that condition. We immediately went to request another room. The staff, however, were not thrilled with our request for another room, nor were they overly apologetic about the condition of the room. The lady we dealt with was, in fact, rather rude, and almost threatened us with the removal of the \"special offer\" to upgrade if we were going to be picky. We complained to the manager about her conduct, but they didn't really seem to care too much. We then had to wait for another 2 hours for our room to be ready. Having said that, the room we were given was absolutely gorgeous, so it was worth the wait. It was a brand new room (had just been remodelled and had only been available for occupation in the last month). Unlike the traditional decor and overly ornate room (tassels anyone?) we had at first, this room was chic, modern and simple. It was something you would expect in a boutique hotel, except, as it was a suite, it was just enormous. The decor was red and chocolate brown - simply divine. The bathroom was adorned in limestone had a glass enclosed shower adjacent to a whirlpool tub. There was also a separate powder room which was next to a closet - every woman's dressing room dream.

I did not do the $20 dollar trick as a result and we ended up on the 6th floor with a view of the air vents and Ballys so we kept the curtains closed the whole time but we did not come to Vegas to sit in the room. The room was really nice and the bed was comfy. The bathroom had a giant tub that was great to relax in after a long day out. There was also a bidet in the bathroom and I hadn't seen one since the last time I was in Europe and had to explain what they were used for to my partner. Maid service was very good and she restocked the ammenities which was nice and we never lacked for towels nor was our room run down like some have complained about on here. Only noise we heard was from the room next door when the kids woke up and where running around the room yelling. We had gone to the buffet on prior trips but not this time as there was a huge line all hours of the day, so we went to Rio for the Carnival World Buffet that was pretty good had the usual Thanksgiving fixings. We did eat at the creperie and JJ Boulangerie and the crepes and sandwiches were delicious also the chocolate twists were great for a snack as well. We saw Anthony Cools show at Paris and it was hilarious to see the things he made people do and he put on a good show but he does have a foul mouth so if you are offended by profanity this show is not for you. We also saw KA which was great other than Love it is my next best show on the Cirque line. I don't really have any complaints love the connection between Bally's and Paris, only minor gripe would be the slots were extremely tight at both casinos but we would definately stay there again though.", "Date": "November 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manhattan, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, Great Hotel, Great Casino!\u201d", "Author": "nymark2", "ReviewID": "UR11079908", "Content": "I stayed at the Paris Nov 22 through 25 (A Thanksgiving Holidays getaway).

I witnessed very friendly staff to other people when checking in and out. The room was on the 27th floor, so it was remodeled. It was very nice. The flat panel TV is great; the view was not of the strip, but still nice. The bathroom was huge. Maids were very friendly. Elevator is express and fast. I ate at the buffet for breakfast and it was very good. Pros: one of the Best locations on the strip. Right in the middle of everything. Can get into Ballys without going outside. Rooms are big, quiet, clean and the remodeled ones are modern. Bathrooms are huge. Staff is friendly. Casino is clean and nice. There are many restaurants to choose from. Here's a few cons: the line to the buffet for dinner was way to long (all nights). The casino gets very crowded at night. I couldn't find a quick place to grab coffee or a sandwich for lunch. Same slots as all of the other Harrah entertainment group hotels & I got tired of them. The bottom line: I have stayed at the Luxor, Monte Carlo, Alladin and Golden Nugget.

I also had asked to get a room on the 25th room or above but at time of check in she said nothing was available. She noted to try the next morning when people were checking out. We got room 1950 - it was actually pretty nice - it was a bit dated but for the 99/night it was pretty good! The bathroom was really nice actually - very clean and elegant looking.

While we were there I decided to ask about getting a king bed and a room on the 25th floor or higher (we weren\u2019t going to b/c the accommodations we had were fine) and we got room 2952 (for free - no extra payment)- which was super nice. Only rooms from 25-30 are renovated- and they are nice rooms! They are just fancier and newer looking. The large screen TV was awesome and the view was better since we were higher up. Overall we loved the room and we didn't hear much noise or anything (and i'm quite picky). Overall everyone at the hotel was super friendly and very helpful. We book tickets to David Copperfield through the concierge (although not a show I recommend - better spend your money on cirque du soleil). We loved \"Le Notre\" which is a pastry shop right beside the elevators!! They had the MOST amazing deserts - and the prices were reasonable. 5.50 for these deserts which are pretty big! but by the end of the night they do run out of most of them. We also got a cheese platter which was awesome. We basically bought things from there every day and it was well worth it. We also tried the restaurant \"Ah sin\" - and that was awesome as well - prices were pretty reasonable- we had sushi, shrimp tempura rolls and won ton soup -service in the restaurant was impeccable.

It is a corner room that is slightly larger than a regular room with two windows with two different views. Upon entering, we noticed that our room was tucked in at the end of the corridor, away from the elevators. Nice and quiet! The room is nice and give a feeling of being in France with hues of blue and yellow. The bed was comfortable. There was plenty of closet space. There is a safe in the closet. We had a sitting area and a desk area. The bathroom has nice marble floors. The separate shower and tub gives it a nice touch. We didn't get a Strip view but we didn't pay for one either. However, we could see the mountains and the airport. Las Vegas is a very busy place! The location of the Paris is the best. It is center Strip and close to everything. One evening we had dinner at Mon ami Gabi and we sat on the terrasse. The food was good and we were serenaded by Bellagio's dancing fountain right across the street. It was beautiful! We also had an upscale dinner at the Eiffel Tower restaurant. The food and service was top notch. The view up there was incredible! It was quite the experience! The casino was a bit smaller than some of the neighboring hotels but that was ok for us. We are not high rollers. You could always find a slot machine or a seat a poker table even on the weekend when you notice more people than ever. Our friend won $1500.00 on a slot machine. We were so excited! They came over and asked a few questions and asked for ID. When they came back, they explained that the casino keeps 30% of winnings over $1200.00. He ended up with a little over $1000.00. Not too bad for our second day there! The rest of our group won $100-$200 each but ended up loosing it again in the machines. Our new saying is \"The money we gambled in Las Vegas, stayed in Las Vegas!\". We had fun and that's all that matters. The waiting time for a drink in the casino was 5-10 minutes. Pretty good!

We were a little starstruck but we did not talk to him. He still looks the same as 20 years ago! He plays in a musical \"The Producers\" at the Paris. We saw it and it was pretty good!

Instead it is very uninviting:not a single flower arrangement, not even a bench to sit down after a long flight.

That didn't happen! The High Roller already there decided not to leave! I guess they figured we had a nice room (over looking the Bellagio right in front) but they were adament that I could NOT smoke in that room! So we asked to be moved to Bally's. We got a really crappy room that reeked of cigar smoke. I went to the desk and asked them to move us... told them that even though it wasn't their fault, we had been in a much nicer room. They moved us to a newly renovated room that was much better. My husband was not happy dragging our luggage all over the place! Anyway, I went back to Paris in March and took an elderly Aunt. We were on the 8th floor overlooking air conditioning vents and roof, but the room was nice and it was a smoking room! They also gave us a room close to the elevators because my Aunt has a few mobility problems. She didn't fare very well on the walkways in the lobby/eating areas due to the cobblestone-like floor,so we rented a wheelchair that cost $45 for 3 days! We both enjoyed the casino though...which is why we go! She dropped a wallet out of her purse on the last day there(no money in it thank God!) and the Security guard at first was a little \"funny\" when I said I didn't know if it was dropped or stolen. He got a bit huffy and told me I could not say it was stolen if I didn't see it get stolen! Lo and behold, someone found it and turned it in, although my Aunt had to come down to ID it herself (I had taken her back to the room because she was so upset I thought she was going to have a stroke!) The same guard went to the room with a wheelchair then and brought her down himself, and was very nice! The last time I stayed was in Aug.'07 and again we were on the 8th floor with a crappy view but nice room! No smoking room issues this time. We enjoyed the pool, although it was SOOO hot outside the second day (107!)we couldn't stay out very long! Very pretty area with all the greenery around the Eifel Tower...a break from the concrete jungle that Vegas is! The casino had been changed around a bit since March and I noticed that they \"upped\" the price on some of the former penny machines to nickels... making the max bet $5 a spin! It takes your money quick! Didn't win anything there on any of the trips and spent a ton of money! I definitely like playing at some of the smaller casinos for more pay back. We ALWAYS rent a car...found out the hard way the first time we went in '03 that you spend the same amount of money taking cabs as you do for a rental car.

Of course you can take the Tram, but we like to go up to North Las Vegas(not Downtown!) Didn't like the new rental car garage when we went in Aug....takes 10 times longer to get your car. And I had checked in on the internet, which was supposed to take me right to the car. Not anymore!!! Plus you feel like your 20 miles away from the airport now! Back to Paris... the thing I do not like about it is NO STARBUCKS! The coffee shop is very expensive and not so good. We ate at the cafe a couple of times, it is also over priced and so-so food. Bally's (which is actually connected to Paris) is a much better bet for food! And don't go to the new burger bistro down towards Bally's... it is just burgers and fries for beaucoup bucks! And we waited forever to get the food. A little known place I stumbled upon was the shopping/eating area down an escalator at Bally's. They don't really advertise it is there, but there is a pizza place and and a sandwich shop, as well as a Harley shop my husband wanted to go to but it was closed by the time we found it.", "Date": "October 31, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portsmouth, OH", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay at the Paris Casino\u201d", "Author": "Psychrus", "ReviewID": "UR10411877", "Content": "Stayed three nights at the Paris during October 2007.

She welcomed us with humor and excitement and found us an immediate room to check in to. While she was processing our information she advised us that they had just renovated some floors and would check to see if any of those rooms were available. She found us a room on the 26th floor and it was OUTSTANDING. The room was very clean, had a huge flat screen TV, a wonderful bathroom with glass enclosed shower and seperate bathtub. There was an iron and ironing board, coffee maker, IPOD jack and internet jack. During our stay, housekeeping was great and it was VERY QUIET. The beds were INCREDIBLE and comfortable. There is nothing negative I can say about this Hotel. Now, we are not HIGH ROLLERS and we try to hit Vegas once a year, I have never had a bad experience at PARIS and this year was even better then last. The casino is just the right size, food is great and there are shops inside the hotel also. Just a note: While we were walking the strip, we stopped into the VENETIAN hotel. This hotel is beautiful but they are pumping a air scent into the casino that smells like Coppertone lotion. While gambling there, the scent was so overpowering inside the casino that my wife and I had the leave. We both could taste the scent when we left. Again, we are not HIGH ROLLERS but just average Vegas visitors, but just thought we would share this with you. So, If you are wondering where to stay in VEGAS, stay at PARIS.

I stayed the first night by myself and felt totally safe there even though it is a big hotel. I was joined then by friends for the reminder of my stay. The location is great as it is in the center of the strip and is opposite the Bellagio with its fab fountains. Caesar's Palace is nearby too so you don't have far to walk to see some of the bigger hotels. I booked this hotel because of its location and would definitely recommend it for its location but it is easy to get around the strip so even if you are staying at one end of it you can still visit each hotel easily. My room was spacious and very clean. I had looked at many reviews on this site and asked for a room above the 25th floor to ensure I got a renovated room. I was staying on the 26th floor and was very happy with my regular room. The TV was a bit annoying in that I couldn't get regular TV at all. I was only able to look at the channel that tells you how to use the casino and also to pay for movies. I only wanted to watch the news so it wasn't too much of a disappointment that it didn't work properly. I didn't find my room to be too noisy with people passing by late at night and I didn't find the casino area smoky at all and I hate smoke so I would have noticed! One thing that did get to me a bit was that there is nowhere in the lobby/downstairs area to sit down. Often my friends and I would be waiting for each other downstairs but there is nowhere to just sit down for a minute or two. They want you to sit at the casino or bar areas so don't have any regular seating areas so we sat outside to wait for each other. The breakfast buffet was great and kept us going for most of the day. It cost us $17 each. I found it strange that there wasn't much information in the rooms relating to getting around the strip and things to do etc., except of course for what was on in Paris Hotel. I had read on some sites to get the 'Deuce' which is a bus that brings you up and down the strip for $2 one way (regardless of how far you travel) or $5 for 24 hours use. The Deuce departs outside most hotels on the strip and is a great way to get around when your feet start getting tired! I had to ask the concierge exactly where the Deuce went from and he then gave me a leaflet on it. I just think this should be placed in every room to inform all guests. I also had to ask the concierge for a map of the strip showing the location of all the hotels and I think that this also should be placed in each room. Overall, I would definitely recommend the Paris Hotel as I throughly enjoyed my trip and will definitely return to Las Vegas.", "Date": "October 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat Vegas Vacation\u201d", "Author": "YoungGun", "ReviewID": "UR10134490", "Content": "Stayed in the Paris Las Vegas during a 'lads' 4 night stay from 27/09/07 - 01/10/07. Had previously stayed here before when we came to Las Vegas in 2004 and we're swayed by its location on the 'strip' and the fact that we had such a great time. So let the holiday commence, which it did unfortunately with lengthy delays to our flights both from Manchester and our connecting flights from Philadelphia to Las Vegas. This meant that we were nearly 6 hours delayed getting into Vegas and not arriving to the Paris Las Vegas until just before midnight. It then seemed to take an eternity to get checked-in as they appeared to not have many rooms left, at least not many non-smoking rooms available. After legthy conversations and attempts to try and get my party an upgrade if no suitable rooms could be found, I finally got the party booked into the three double rooms that we had booked. A bit of a bad start to the holiday, but we were determined to not let the delays and problems with the allocation of rooms deter us from having a great time in Vegas. Of the three rooms provided, one of them had a part view of the strip and the Bellagio on the 7th floor, the other rooms were facing the back of the hotel - not a problem as we weren't planning on having much sleep on this holiday. All the rooms were nicely decorated and furnished with large Queen sized beds to help get over the jet lag. The bathroom was nice, albeit no bath, but a walk in shower which was nice and powerful to wake you up in the morning. All rooms had a safe and the TV showed all the necessary stations to catch up on the final weekend of Baseball action - go Red Sox!! With sleep deprevation setting in following our marathon journey, and the fact that we probably hadn't had any sleep in over 24 hours we all met at 'Le Central Lobby Lounge', which is one of the Bars located in the casino. Bearing in mind it was now gone 1am, we all settled down in the comfort of the Bar and surrounding Casino and drank our first 'US' drinks - I think most opted for either Bud Light's or Corrs Light - refreshing and hopefully the start of a great vacation. Without boring you all too much about 'My Diary of Las Vegas' - we ended up having a fantastic time in both Paris and Las Vegas. We made full use of 'Le Village Buffet' every morning for I think $16, it was worth the visit as we normally ate enough food to last us through until the evening. There is so much selection and a you just end up eating so much!! Within the Hotel, we made full use of the pool in the afternoon after what was normally a tiring morining walking up and down the strip visiting the other casinos or going to the shopping outlet villages. The pool was of a good size, although busy, you could always find yourself somewhere to lie down and soak up the sun, which considering it was approaching October the temperature was in the 90's. Beware if you ever buy drinks buy the pool - they are expensive, $4 for a bottle of coke!! Once inside the hotel, we liked the Paris as the gaming floor is a nice size and one that if some of your party wander off, you always find them within a few minutes. Our group enjoyed playing the Roulette, Black Jack and Poker - all with their own success and failure stories. All the gaming tables were fun and you never felt intimidated and this made for a good atmosphere and helped while away the hours and dollars!! Overall, another fantastic and enjoyable stay in Paris Las Vegas and I wouldn't hesitate in coming back to this hotel again on my next visit, which for me is next February, but I'll be on a budget as I'm doing a West Coast tour and I'll probably have to opt for a cheaper hotel next year.", "Date": "October 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, WA", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Paris\u201d", "Author": "tiffanyg54", "ReviewID": "UR10090840", "Content": "We stayed at the Paris from October 10 to October 14.

I did wish that there was a place to put your luggage. We ended up using the ottoman and the small lounger for our suitcases. We have stayed many places in Vegas-Tropicana, Mirage, Flamingo but I enjoyed the Paris most. It was nice to hop in the elevator and you were instantly close to food and the casino. No treking from one end of the hotel to the other. We ate at the Creperie, le Notre, Cafe ile St. Louis, and the Burger Brasserie and enjoyed the food at all. We gambled at the casino at Paris and Bally's. We did not hit any huge wins but we got to play for awhile. We did gamble a lot at Bill's Gambling Hall next to Bally's and did quite well. The waitresses there also come around quite often if you like to enjoy a cocktail while gambling like we do. The only low point of our trip was that we ate at Raffles in the Mandalay Bay one evening after a concert at the HOB. The next day, I wasn't feeling well and it turns out I had food poisoning. It was the only place that I ate that day. For those of you who complain about the beds at the Paris, I say that you are wrong. I spent 20 hours in bed and while I can't say I was comfortable, I definitely rested well. I will never eat at any restaurant at Mandalay again. I lost nearly 2 days of vacation not feeling well.

When I inquired about our reservations for a king, we were informed that our reservation does not guarantee what we are asking for and unfortunately, they did not have any other rooms. I informed them that this was our honeymoon and we really did not want separate queen beds, we were told by the rather lackadaisical counter worker, \"sorry, but if you call down tomorrow we will see if we can move you\". It was late and we decided to take the room for the night with the hope the room will get changed the next day. Needless to say they did change our room the next day, but I do have to say these were some of the most uncomfortable beds we have ever slept on! We even had a hole in the sheet! I had expected much more from a supposedly four star hotel. These were very average hotel rooms. We have stayed at better hotels for a fraction of the price. And the fact that they did not care it was our honeymoon? Who does that? As for the rest of the property, the gambling was horrible. Slots did not pay out, good luck finding room at a decent limit craps table, and the only blackjack was a brutal 6-5 single deck. Before leaving, we asked for a late checkout, we were told \"no\". We asked for two extra hours and were again told \"no\". Our checkout time was 11 a.m. and for the guests arriving, the check-in was 3 p.m. and they could not have given us 2 hours? How long does it take to clean a room? To sum up, I will have to say that if the service at Paris is terrible, the workers not accommodating at all, and the gambling is not good, why spend your money on this property?

We had just got engaged before coming to Las Vegas so decided to take the upgrade and spoil ourselves. We were so glad we did! We got a suite on the 16th floor overlooking the Eiffel Tower and Bellagio. The suite was huge, with its own living area complete with dining table, king size bedroom, and his and her bathrooms! It was well worth the upgrade price and about five times bigger than the normal hotel rooms. We didn't have to queue for the elevators at all and once called they arrived in just a few seconds. Paris itself is small enough to know your way around without getting too lost! It has a good range of places to eat, both fine and casual dining, as well as 24/7 eateries. Breakfast wasn't included when we booked but this was no problem as there is a Boulangerie and a Creperie on site which did great breakfast items; muffins, crepes, coffees etc. The hotel is in the middle of the Strip and provides a fantasic base for exploring all Vegas has to offer. If you do get too tired (and when we arrived it was 100f, so we did!) the monorail stop is just next door, at Bally's casino (which is a kind of sister hotel to Paris). Check-out was quick and easy.

My therapist (a young woman whose name I cannot remember) gave me one of the best massages I have ever had. I would highly recommend the lime ginger Elemis treatment -- it includes a full body scrub (30 min) followed by a 50 min massage ($185, an 18% gratuity is automatically added to the bill). After the massage, I was able to relax and enjoy tea, juice, and fruit at the spa. I would highly recommend it. We went to the pool in the morning, before it got too hot. Contrary to some other reviewers, we enjoyed the pool. It was not crowded, and there was enough room to swim for about 1 hour. (Of course, this is not comparable to the pools at the Bellagio, but not bad at all.)

Room- 1411 Had a nice view of the pool and Bellagio. The room safe did not work properly. There were also a couple of times that we had to get the room keys reset as they did not work consistently. This became an inconvenience. The air condition did not work well. Staff- I was taken back with some of the pool waitresses and their attitudes.

This time, (I wish I got her name), my wife and I asked politely for a menu. we were given a menu.

Some miscellaneous problems we seemed to encounter consistently: Morning breakfast at that pastry shop- Over charged for (2) pastries- $12.00 when it was suppose to be 6$. Money was refunded but no apology. Spa- Overcharged for a massage. I brought it to the managers attention. He rebilled me. When I got to the room to check the account folio, it showed a double charge from the spa. I had to make another call to get things straightened out. Some positives: The casino and hotel are still easy to navigate. Compared to other hotels such as Caesars and Venetian, Paris is comparable. My Host (Mr. Sierra) took care of everything. To conclude: As with anywhere you stay, you may have some problems. It just seems that it is becoming more consistent that Paris is consistently having more problems. I may give it another chance but will consider somewhere else next time. We had the opportunity to see the Blue Man Group- If you have to pay full price, you may be dissapointed.

I have stayed everywhere over the years in Las Vegas. Strip, Downtown, off-strip you name it. I wanted my Son to experience Vegas from mid-strip and that is where the Paris is. Right in the middle of a lot of action and can easily walk to a lot of Casinos like Caesars, Bellagio, Flamingo, NY NY, MGM, Tropicana, Excalibur and the Luxor. And the monorail is right there in Bally's, which is actually connected to the Paris. We were there 8 days and booked the room for $1,400.00. I probably and foolishly let them talk me into an upgrade on the room for $50.00 more per night but after watching my Wife and our Son stare out the window of the 27th floor most of the times that we were in the room, I figured it was worth it. A perfect view of the Paris swimming pool and the Bellagio Fountain but how many times can one watch that noisy fountain. So now the room costs us $2200.00 for 8 days. 3 massages at $135.00 a pop. Buffets at $25.00 a piece. I suggest going to Ballys for the Buffet because there is never a wait and the food is just as good versus Paris where you might wait an hour to be seated. I played a lot of Blackjack and do so by the book but had terrible luck but thats on me. The Slots were the tightest I have ever seen anywhere. NOTHING! I suggest if you want to play Blackjack, cross the street to Wild Bill's Gambling Hall and play there. At least they still let you hold your cards in your hands while playing. Paris really pushes you to play $25 a hand and there are few, if any $10 tables. I like to play $15 a hand. And whats with a BJ only paying 6-5 now! Rented a Pool Villa at The Paris for $250 for the day. That was a ton of private fun but Pricey!! To me it seemed they were jamming you up for service charges everywhere and still wanted tips added onto that too. Room service for 3 hamburgers (albeit very tasty) was $70 smackers! Be sure and check the goodies refrigerator when walking into the room as they were gonna jam us up for stuff other people ate and not had restocked before we checked in.

We asked to have a renovated room and were told that we could only have that if we paid an addtional $85/night. We went ahead and did that because we still wanted a nicer room. We were given one of the \"P\" suites with a view of the top of buildings. The room was nice with a very comfortable bed and nice decor, but I was dissappointed after reading the other reviews here about the free upgrades other had received. A year earlier we had earned free airfare and free rooms we never used... so much for loyalty. Anyway, the hotel and casino are very nice and plush. Unfortunately, never witnessed anyone winning on any game (slots, craps, blackjack, etc). The poker room was descent and was the only place any money was won. Other than that, we did well at Harrah's and Casino Royale.

We took a cab from the airport instead of the shuttle and after talking to our friends who showed up a day later, turned out to be the PREFERRED way to get to the hotel. It took us only 10 min. to get to our hotel from the airport using a cab, whereas it took our friends an hour and a half (because they had to wait for the shuttle first and then stop at all the other hotels before getting to their own). Check in was quick and painless. After reading other reviews we tried to do what they did by asking for a room \"on the 26th floor or above\" not realizing that NOT ALL of those rooms are renovated, but even though our room wasn't renovated it was very large and clean. We weren't facing the strip either but it was no big deal cause we were barely in the room anyways. We didn't sit by the pool at all because for us it was WAY TOO HOT and wanted to stay indoors as much as possible (being from Canada, the +44 weather was pretty unbearable) but we went to check it out and it looked awesome. We were a little disappointed with the restaurant selection after visiting alot of the other hotels on the strip. A lot of times we were interested in just \"snacking\" foods and Paris doesn't have alot of that to offer. Actually, they pretty much only have their buffet (that always had a huge line up) and a few other places (where the menu showed $25 or higher entrees). Most of the other hotels had \"food court\" settings with way more variety. I have no complaints about Paris whatsoever but will probably not stay there again.....just because there's so many other places to explore. Our friends stayed at the Wyn and ended up getting a phenomenal deal through Expedia paying less then us and that hotel is breathtaking!! We were able to check out their room and WOW!! If we don't stay at the Wyn, we'll probably do the Bellagio or Venetian. On another note, we went to a show every night we were there. First we went to Penn and Teller (at Rio) and were disappointed. The second night we went to Jubilee (at Ballys) and LOVED IT!! It's a classic vegas show and well worth it. The third night we went to Wayne Brady (at Venetian) and laughed our heads off.

This was our fifth time to Vegas so we felt we had something to compare our trip to. I was very excited to stay at the Paris and we got an excellent package deal thru Northwest Airlines. Of course, the location of the hotel was wonderful... but sadly it goes down hill from there. The stereotype that French people are rude, must have been taught to the staff during orientation--just to make it seem more realistic. On several different occasions various staff members seemed bothered or irritated at your mere presence, let alone if you actually needed something. At check in we nicely asked if there was any way to get a view of the Bellagio---the unfriendly staff person curtly replied, \"Yes, for an up charge of $60 a night.\"---then nothing else--after we declined she just kept pushing buttons and then told us our room number and handed us the keys. If I were training the staff, I would have said something like, \"OK, so if you don't want to upgrade, let me see what I can do to give you a higher floor room to help you out.\" We ended up getting a room on the 18th floor anyway, but if she had actually spoken to us in a pleasant manner we would have felt better about it and we would have thought she was on our side. Instead, she made us feel like cheap skates that she didn't want to waste her time on. Other problems included: 1. Rooms Rooms were a nice size, but the details of luxury were overlooked. The mattress of our king bed looked and felt like it was broken down and cheap. The sheets were a low thread count and had holes in them. The way they made the bed the sheets kept coming undone and exposing the bare mattress. The towels were fairly small and a quality I would expect at a travel lodge. 2. The Pool I had seen pictures of the pool and was very excited to go. I guess fantasy is better than reality. Granted it had been a windy day in the morning, but the pool was still full of leaves and I even stepped on a plastic cup at the bottom of the pool in the afternoon. There was no one even trying to clean it out the whole time I was there. There was trash, (left over drinking glasses, paper, cigarette butts, leaves, debris) every where on the ground around the pool. Even though I saw plenty of young people on staff, no one was cleaning only talking and giggling with each other. In fact, I actually witnessed an employee ignore the trash. It appears it was his job to pick up left over towels on the lounge chairs, so he stepped over a turned over empty bottle just to get the towel---he seemed to be a \"it's not my job\" type of employee. Besides, the pool itself is only one depth-3 1/2\" and it hit around my stomach so I thought I was in a kiddie pool the entire time---either that or a country pond with all the debris that was in it. 3. The Buffet We ate at the breakfast buffet and waited for over 20mins in a stuffy, hot line of other hungry diners. Not so bad in Vegas until we realized it was not because they were so overly busy---just completely mismanaged. There were plenty of empty tables and servers---just not enough common sense to get us seated efficiently. On a personal note: No biscuits and gravy in this buffet--how sad for my American stomach. Went to Caesar's Buffet for breakfast the next day--same price, no wait, excellent service and great food (with biscuits and gravy).

The room was nothing to write home about. In fact, our toilet ran if you did not jiggle the handle. No big deal but, you'd expect more from Paris considering its popularity. While playing the penny slots, we waited almost an hour for the \"free drinks\". When I moved to the $1 slots, my waitess showed up right away and she made sure I was playing those slots before she took my drink order. Who goes through all that? Just give me the drink lady. Then, when we were at the pool, a waitress by the name of Kharen took our order and she was so dispondant, I had to tell her that I thought her attitude was not pleasant. I probably would not have said anything to her if the waitess that I originally flagged down had not snubbed me so badly by informing me as she walked, that she did not \"serve my area of the pool\". She said it in passing so I had to ask someone else \"what'd she say\"? So, rude. So, it just gives credit to some of the others who posted on this website that Paris only caters to the high rollers and not your average person who pays $200 a night for a room instead of it being comped. I wish customer service was still a thing of the present instead of a thing of the past. Vacations are expensive enough, more so in this tough economy, I would expect more from a destination so dependant upon your money to survive given all the competition in the area.

This, incidentally, gave me a great view over the \"Arc de Triomphe\" as well. I really appreciated that. (I say largely fulfilled on the noise front, though, because it was quite close to the housekeeping equipment room, so I did hear semi-constant comings and goings of the cart...not terrible, though). MINUS -Whatever industrial-strength cleaning solvent they use in the rooms gave me a heck of a headache. It was a very strong odor. -The hotel has something like 4,000 rooms.

I read a lot of the reviews and took on board asking for a room above the 25th Floor. We stayed on the 27th floor and looked onto Planet Hollywood. The room was fantastic and very spacious. The bathroom was amazing and the beds were sooooo comfy. Read some of the reviews about the check in service being very lenghly, it took us around 20 mins which in my opinion wasnt very long and when going into hotel like the Luxor etc the queues were horrendious. When we first arrived to the Paris it was lunch time and we decided to start our honeymoon with lunch at the Eiffel Tower restaurant looking over the Belagio, which was fantastic. We ate at the buffet which was lovely however after day 3 were sick of all that food for breakfast. We ate out at several places along with a beautiful cafe in the Venetian which was superb. However to top the holiday off we booked the French Steakhouse in the Paris sitting outside again looking over the Belagio fountains, this was the perfect end to a perfect holiday it actually brought tears to my eyes. Over all Las Vegas was an amazing place with lots to do and see, oh and I thought the pool was lovely at the Paris. Very hot so a great place to cool down. I would go back in a heartbeat and definately stay at the Paris again.

Such a beautiful hotel! But beware, if the thought of hearing and seeing Paris-themed stuff 24/7 freaks you out, stay somewhere else. For me, I loved it! If you're going along with your significant other, you should stay here, it's so romantic! I must warn that this review will be extremely lengthy so please bear with me. The room: After a couple room changes, I was upgraded to a renovated strip-view room with a view of the Eiffel Tower and the Bellagio fountains. All the rooms above the 25th floor are renovated. If you want a room that has a perfect view, get a room thats towards the end of the hall in the 90's and make sure it is an even number(i.e. if you are on the 26th floor, make sure your room is 2692, 2694, etc) . These rooms are towards the right side of the hotel and the Eiffel Tower won't block your view of the Bellagio fountain show which is sooooo awesome at night but yet you can still see the Eiffel Tower on your left. I'm the kind of person that needs the perfect room, so I hope this info helps some of you out there. Oh yeah, and I did see how the old rooms looked and trust me, you HAVE to ask for a renovated room. The old rooms were really old, torn, and dingy. In the new room, the beds were heavenly, the down comforters were nice and the feathered pillows were fluffy. The plasma tv, on the other hand, had a life of it's own and it took forever to turn the tv on/off or switch channels. All in all, the room was great! The pool: The pool is pretty boring but it really is sufficient. I went there twice early (9ish in the morning) and there weren't many people there even though it was warm enough to get into the pool. If you like to do laps in the morning, this pool is great. The casino: The atmosphere of the casino was extremely beautiful. The slots on the other hand, sucked, but hey it's Vegas. I never once got offered a drink (like I said, I played the slots). I also liked how the hotel was not a massive monster, and you could easily walk to the slots or to the parking lot without getting out of breath. Make sure you sign up for Total Rewards if you haven't yet. You can get coupons for $5 off the buffet and 2-for-1 rides for the Eiffel Tower. I highly suggest using the buffet coupon for breakfast, especially on a weekday when the line isn't so long or earlier in the morning. I got to use the buffet coupon on a Friday morning around 10:45ish and I got to eat both breakfast and lunch for 10 bucks which I paid through comps. I also found a trick for the Eiffel Tower coupons. It says that you can only use the 2-for-1 coupon before 5 pm but here's what you do: buy the tickets before 5 pm but use the actual tickets at night when it's really pretty; the tickets they print out are regular tickets that are valid for a year or so. Oh yeah, you also get 10% off in the stores with Total Rewards. Bally's is also connected to the Paris so sometimes I went there to gamble. If you're not a big spender when it comes to food, the Paris very much lacking in that department (sometimes, you just want some chicken nuggets, you know?). On that note, my bf and I went across the street to Ellis Island where they have 4.99 steak dinners and 2.95 breakfasts. Planet Hollywood, next door, also had some cheap eats in the Miracle Mile Shops. Shows: I'm too lazy to write separate reviews for the shows I watched, so I'll just give some short opinions: 1) V Variety Show: (Planet Hollywood) You must watch this show! It's a great deal! You can find coupons online (2-for-1, etc). You basically see magicians, a juggler, comedians, impersonators, acrobats, everything! I laughed my pants off, seriously! 2) Mesmerized Hypnosis Show (Planet Hollywood): This show had the potential to be great but maybe since I went on a Thursday night, the crowd was dead. It was hilarious though. Again, look for good deals online. 3) Riviera Comedy Club: DO NOT WATCH THIS CRAP IF DOM IRRERA IS PERFORMING BECAUSE HE SUCKS! His jokes just weren't funny and it seemed like he did not want to be there. The two ladies before him were so much more funnier than him. That casino is just so icky, don't go here. In fact, I suggest watching Second City, a comedy show I watched in May, which is SUPER funny. Again, look for discounts online. 4) Cirque du Soleil Mystere (TI): As always, this show was magnificent. As a tip, for those of you who are active military, you get 50% off all of the Cirque du Soleil shows in Vegas. I don't know how long this deal with last but shoot, I had awesome seats! I highly suggest not sitting right at the front but sitting towards the middle since a lot of the tricks are in the air. 5) Price is Right (Bally's): Make sure you show your hotel key card when purchasing tickets at Bally's for a 25% discount. The Price is Right was really fun, but I wish my name was chose to play Plinko hahaha. Getting around (no, not like that): If you're using a car during your trip, I know a \"secret\" place to park. When you go up the ramp into the garage, turn left at the first entry where it has a sign for Hertz. Here, you'll turn left and go all the way around and all the way down to the other end where there'll be so many parking spots and it'll be a couple steps to the door to the casino. You won't have to use any elevators or struggle to find parking. I think most people don't try parking at this level because of the Hertz sign that throws you off but hey, I discovered it by accident. Also, AVOID using Las Vegas Blvd. When accessing the hotel, exit Tropicana, turn left on Koval, right on Harmon, and right on Audrie. Use, Koval and Paradise Rd (accessed from Harmon) to access all other casinos on the strip. Trust me, I'll save you like an hour of commuting time. Oh yeah, Fremont Street is disgusting. The end. In conclusion, I highly recommend this hotel. The only reason I did not give it a perfect rating was the fact that the whole hotel has not been renovated. Once the whole hotel is renovated it'll be perfect! One more note: visit the vegas4locals website for inside tips, coupons, tickets, and great bargains!!!

Even if you skip the rest of this review, please note the following: If you're gambling at the Paris casino and you like roulette, you MUST find a table where either Brian or Jose is the dealer. (And someone said there's more than one Jose. He's the one who knows every baseball statistic since the beginning of time.) They were the two most friendly, most entertaining, and most informative of all the dealers there. And the rest weren't bad either. The drink servers were pleasant, but service was slow, especially at the slots. And I once waited over an hour at the tables before a server came by. About the hotel... Pros: The wide-screen TV was enjoyable, although it wasn't working right. The safe in the room is an appreciated amenity, especially in Las Vegas. The room decor in general was very modern and attractive, especially the bathroom with its marble tile throughout. Thoroughly enjoyed the availability of the computer/printer kiosk by the lobby elevators for printing out our boarding passes. Maid service was thorough and unobtrusive. Cons: The room was quite small. The air conditioning didn't work very well. We had it set at 67 degrees at all times, and eventually we would be comfortable, but it probably never went below 72 degrees, so if you're looking for a quick cool down after coming in from the desert heat, you're out of luck. Additionally, the bathroom didn't have an air duct for the A/C, nor did it have a vent fan. So be prepared to primp in a sauna-like environment. The TV was very uncooperative. It kept locking up, and so we had to keep powering it off and on, although we did get prompt service from engineering to try to fix it, which they did, but then the problem just started all over again. It was the fourth day before we figured out how to reach the regular TV channels with ease. BEWARE: Make sure you read the note in the mini-bar fridge, especially the part about the $50 cleaning fee if you store your own items in there!!! About the restaurants... Every single restaurant had a French theme, and so it was all a bit too French for me, which meant it was difficult to find a sandwich on just regular sliced bread. All the sandwiches in all the restaurants were served on hard, crusty French bread. But you MUST try the restaurant Le Burger. I had the lamb burger and it was the best burger I ever ate! Overall, I would stay at Paris hotel and gamble at Paris casino again in the future. But with the exception of Le Burger, I would plan to eat my meals elsewhere.", "Date": "July 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Istanbul, Turkey", "Title": "\u201cPerfect stay\u201d", "Author": "handecan", "ReviewID": "UR8249872", "Content": "Perfect two days in this incredible hotel.

I arrived at the airport at 7am and after catching a shuttle, arrived at Paris at 9am. First impression of the hotel was just ok....we were taken in a side entrance so didn't get a chance to see the front until later on. Check in: A lot of people checking in and out when I arrived, apparantly Monday mornings are very busy for the hotel. Spoke to a nice lady about getting me into my room early after an overnight flight. I said I would give her a tip if she could get me into my room early etc...told me to come back in around an hour. I did just that and she got me into my room at 10am, on the 28th floor, fantastic room overlooking Pool and Eiffel tower as well as the full view of the Bellagio fountains! I gave her $20 and she was happy with that! Room: It was room 2803 and i would highly recommend it. It was obviously a newer room with big plasma TV, otttoman in front of window, desk with coffee maker, a great big King bed and fluffy pillows. All in all very happy! Room service: I ate in a couple of times and found the food to be warm on both occassions, though the delivery time and hotel staff service was good. Price looked good until they add around $5 room service charge to it! Pool area: Fresh towels were always available and 5 lifeguards on duty which i thought was great for just a hotel pool. Waiters were hard to get when I was there and I paid $17 for a large Margerita!! I liked the pool area though, weather was hot but not so crowded. Saw Ballys pool on the monorail and it was tiny compared to Paris. Food on site: Ate at the buffet once....heaps of choice, but i thought the desserts were horrible...basically just some cheese cakes and creme brulee which i ate. No fresh fruit at all which was disaapointing. I didnt go to any of the other eateries at all. Most of the other places were always busy and the food looked fresh. Casino: I found the casino to be less crowded than Ballys and the drinks were forthcoming as well as friendly attendants. I won a little on the slots as well as on roulette which was good. I signed up for Total rewards and got $28 off my hotel bill at the end. There was little smoke around and i found it got much quitier after midnight which i liked. There are plenty of gift shops and also the walkway to the Ballys casino and shops which is a very short stroll away. Elevators were always quick on my side, not sure about the opposite ones for the lower floors. The heat was unbearable outside, took a cab to the factory outlets which was fun, didnt do much else as my trip was short and I enjoyed just being around the hotel. Also took the monorail to the Forum shops at Caesars which was ok...had to walk through Imperial Palace and Harrahs to get there. Much preferred the walkways of Paris to these hotels which simply were claustraphobic and very busy. I agree with previous reviews about the fake french accents getting on your nerves, they should do away with it. I also found it amusing that a lot of the TV channels were in Spanish, but coming from Australia I guess there are so many Spanish speaking people in the USA. Checkout can be done via your room or in reception. They overcharged me on the mini bar which i had to get fixed. I also dont like the fact that they put a hold on your credit card for an extra amount even though they got all their money. Would i stay again?? No. I would like to stay in other hotels, and go when it isnt so hot.

Our room on the 17th floor was absolutely great with two large windows with different views, a king size bed, several comfortable chairs, and a very large bathroom that included both a shower and a tub. Also, likely because Paris is a smaller hotel, the elevators are very convenient to the registration desk, casino and shops/restaurants. At $139/night (Wednesday and Thursday) the room seemed well worth it. We had a rental car and parked in the garage and found it was not as long a walk to the hotel as we might have expected. We also valeted the car once which is likely a better option if you don't need to be getting stuff out of car and such (valet and garage parking are both free, although you need to tip the valet). Our booking came with several coupons for various free and 2-for-1 offers, although we wound up only using the one to go to the top of the Eiffel tower. It has a great view of the strip and all the surrounding areas. Only thing we did wrong was not realize that the Bellagio water show (across the street) would not go off when we went up (the shows started at 3 pm). We did eat in Mon Ami Gabi for dinner and the cafe for breakfast and found the food and service good in both, although the prices were a bit high--although that was somewhat expected. We were disappointed that the Napoleon bar no longer served hors d'oeuvres as it used to due to a new Nevada law (they allow smoking, so cannot serve food is what we heard), but we still enjoyed the champagne.

We had a fabulous time! This was our 2nd trip to Vegas together (last July we stayed at the Aladin - now Planet Hollywood). There really isnt much more you could ask for from a hotel that is priced in the \"moderate\" price range for Vegas. We loved this hotel! The them is obviously of Paris and you can really feel that everywhere you go in the hotel. It is a smaller casino than others but we really enjoyed that. Everyone seemed very friendly. We played the blackjack tables and met some wonderful people. We arent huge gamblers and Paris still offered Blackjack tables with a $10 minimum which can be hard to find! Some hotels the minimum for blackjack tables is $25/bet!! I didnt find this casino snobby at all like some of the higher end hotels. The lobby is easy to get to as are the elevators to the hotel rooms. Some other hotels are soo large that you can get lost in them and just finding your room can be a challenge! Our room was very clean and quiet. Paris is an awesome location on the strip. Bellagio and Ceasars are just across the street with Bally's on one side and Planet Hollywood on the other. The only restaurant we ate at in the Paris Hotel was the buffet. I actually dont recommend it. Out of all the buffets I have had in Vegas this one was probably the worst (with same prices as the others). I just found there wasnt as much selection for the price you pay. Another note... upon checking in we were offered to \"upgrade\" our room to a \"VIP\" package. This included a view of the strip, with access to the VIP room which included continental breakfast every morning and drinks/appetizers every night from 5-8pm. This was all for a cost of $60US. But be aware! This is $60US/per night which we never realized until afterwards. Our view from our room was amazing though. We could watch the Bellagio fountains from the comfort of our room! We could also see the swimming pool as well as a good portion of the strip! The continental breakfast included all types of pastries, cold smoked samon, yogurt, cereal fresh fruit and drinks. The appetizers at night could be an entire supper! Peel and eat shrimp, pasta, sandwiches, skewers with steak and non-alcoholic drinks (drinks with alcohol had a charge). So if you dont mind paying the extra $60/night - this really wasnt that bad of a deal if you make use of both meals! So overall Paris was a wonderful experience for us. I wouldnt be suprised if we stay there again next year when we return to Vegas. Couple extra Vegas notes: Ride the Double Deus bus. There are a bunch of buses that run up and down the strip. $2/trip or $5 for a 24 hour pass. We didnt wait more than 5 minutes for a bus and it runs all the way to Freemont Street. Also we had an awesome meal at Cheesecake Factory! (in Ceasars Forum shops). If you like pasta and seafood I highly recommend the Shrimp Bistro and if you like steak - the Hibachi steak was awesome! 2 Great meals with a bottle of wine was $65!

This review will be lengthy, but hopefully it will help. We stayed at Paris July 7 thru July 13. We didn't have any problems at all. We checked in at 11:00 a.m. and it was very quick and they had a room available at that time. I inquired about an upgrade to a renovated room but everything was sold out due to 7/7/07. They said they would have one available the next day and they would hold for me if I would like. I wanted to check the standard room first as I didn't want to pay an additional $60 nightly if not necessary (even though we only paid $350 for the six nights including tax thru casino marketing). Well, the standard room was fine. It was a little dated, but very clean and well kept. The only bad part of the room were the linens. They were worn, a little torn and one had a little stain on it. We were going to keep the room and just request new linens. However, the next morning I decided to go back and check on the renovated room (as it would have had a view of the pool, Bellagio fountains, etc.). Well, I was pleasantly surprised to be offered an upgrade to a renovated room on the 26th floor (room 2641) at no additional cost (it just didn't offer the front view, it was a view towards Planet Hollywood and the south end of the strip). Yes, there was some construction in view, but there is construction all over the strip so that was not an issue at all. The room was in the corridor where the employee elevators (for room service etc.) are and the housekeeping rooms and I was concerened about the noise from these areas. Absolutely nothing to worry about, it was never a problem. The renovated room was wonderful. The beds (and bedding) are amazing and it was very quiet. I slept better than I have in years any where. The casino is fine and if you really pay attention on your first walk through, you will be able to navigate very easily. It is a little confusing at first. The pool area, is standard in comparison to the Mirage and MGM, but it was very clean, quiet (they played nice music) it wasn't all parisian as it seemed to be inside and there was always ample seating (and not on top of each either, as you find at the Mirage and Treasure Island. We were concerned about the pool area as we like the more tropical feeling in a pool area, but we really ended up enjoying this pool area. The only thing was the sun is blocked by the building until about 9:30. The first sun hits around the bottom of the tower, so you will want to sit over there (between the cafe and the tower leg. However, it was so hot when we were there, it was very comfortable being shaded. So I guess it depends on what you are looking for. The staff was all very friendly. We are not in the Diamond Club and didn't get great comps at the end, but we were never looked down upon as some of the reviews have stated. The restaurants were pricey and we weren't overly impressed with them. They did not have any cheap dining (every once in awhile you want to grab a quick inexpensive bite to eat and this resort did not offer that). We ate at the Buffet for breakfast which was very good and we highly recommend it and we ate there for dinner but did not feel we would eat there for dinner again. If you sign up for the players club you get a coupon book with a $5 off coupon for the buffet...use it for breakfast. We did have room service one evening and the french onion soup was wonderful and the french dip sandwich and fries were very good, the bread was amazing and the service was very good and the table was removed from the hallway by the next morning. We found this resort to be extremely busy and loud with through traffic to Bally's. As it is a themed resort it gets alot of walk through traffic and being connected to Bally's makes it that much worse. We did struggle with that sometimes. It wasn't bad later at night and it was nice to have the inside connection to Bally's at that point. The pro's and con's of the inside connection. We did have our 17 year old son with us this year and I would have to say, if you are bringing any children in their late teens, I would recommend the MGM. I think he would have enjoyed walking around there much more than Paris. As for adult couples, I would recommend Paris. All in all we enjoyed Paris and would definetly stay there again if the price is right. I have to say, we stay at the most decent place that gives us the best offer. Just a little added info on dining. The Top of the World revolving restaurant at the Stratosphere was wonderful. We ate lunch there as they have a dress code for dinner and we didn't want to dress up, plus lunch is obviously less expensive and you have the daytime view of the entire area, instead of just the lights at night (which would be very pretty, too). It was $111 for three of us, but my son and I had the three course chef's choice which included prime rib and an amazing desert and my husband had the four course chef's choice and he had steak and shrimp and a different wondeful desert. It was very good and really not pricey when you deduct $33 from that (as that is what it would cost for three to go up to the observation deck without lunch/dinner). We enjoyed the observation deck inside and out after lunch and feel it is well worth the price of lunch there at least once. Ellis Island is on Koval Street behind Bally's to the right. It is a little local's casino/restaurant and we had steak dinner's for $4.95 and it was very, very good. A tip that was given to us by one of the customers (and she was right) is order your steak a step down from the way you usually eat it, if you like medium, order medium rare and it is done as medium, etc. We heard about Ellis Island on the travel channel and also read reviews online. It truly is good! We will be eating there again when we return in October. Also, when we go to Vegas we generally stay a week and rent a car. We go to Walmart and buy a 12 cup coffee pot for $9 - $10, coffee, filters and dixie to go cups...we spend about $17 and have coffee for the week (we drink multiple cups a day) and it is a huge savings of $ and time from purchasing it in the hotels. We then just dispose of the coffee pot there and don't travel with it. Also, Dollar is the best car rental we have used out there. We now use only Dollar and you can rent it from several locations (no matter where you are staying) and drop off at a different location if you choose at no additional cost. we have never encoutered any type of problem with Dollar.", "Date": "July 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "falkirk", "Title": "\u201cA great hotel\u201d", "Author": "falkirklimos", "ReviewID": "UR8207013", "Content": "Stayed at the Paris hotel for our honeymoon was advised to take a room 25th floor and up as these have recently been renovated and ended up on floor 27, two queen beds 42in plasma screen tv and a very clean, big bathroom with seperate shower area.

The room wasn't huge, but it was nicely appointed and clean. The housekeeping staff was very good, and the one night when it appeared that a group of kids were left unattended and reaking havoc in the next room, the front desk was quick about sending up security to quiet them. My husband rented a cabana for my birthday and we spent the day by the pool. The cabana was wonderful. Not only did it provide shade, but it gave us a little privacy as well. Inside there was a table and chairs, a fridge stocked with water, soda, & juices, a phone, a tv, a sofa lounge & a ceiling fan. Outside there were 5 lounge chairs and misters to cool you. The cabana rental also included a lovely fruit basket and 2 free raft rentals. The cocktail waitress was very efficient and we had breakfast and lunch served in the cabana. Paris's pool may not be as fancy as some, but it's large and does a great job of cooling you off on a hot day. There seemed to be plenty of lounge chairs free too. It's definitely worth the cost of the rental, imo. Paris has some excellent food options. The 24 hour cafe and the buffet are excellent. Le Burger Brasserie is their new sports bar where you can get decent food at reasonable prices. Napoleon's is a beautiful lounge where you can listen to dueling pianos and try one of the many champagnes they have to offer.

We checked in at the airport when we arrived. I know it has been commented on before here, but it was at check-in that it was made clear how much the hotel values its \"Diamond rewards club\" members over the rest of us riff-raff. I asked to stay above the 25th floor in one of the renovated rooms and was told by the clerk flat out that those rooms were reserved for the Diamond members of the rewards program and she would do \"the best she could\". We were lucky enough to get 2 rooms on the same floor, but not connecting like we asked nor facing the strip as we asked. We weren't even offered an upgrade by the clerk. It seemed pretty obvious she wanted to get rid of us quickly. One of the rooms did turn out to be a room at the end of a corridor and had a partial view of Bellagio's fountains, but the other overlooked the back of the hotel property. Here is a tip...if you get the hotel transfer to and from the airport by bus, make sure you call to arrange your pickup right after you get to your room. We didn't and we ended up paying for a transfer back to the airport that we never got (we ended up taking 2 taxis). You are probably better off doing the taxis anyway because the cost to and from the hotel isn't that more expensive if you have a group of 4 or more like we did. Also, be prepared to wait in line for the buses, which was mighty fun considering it was 110+ outside when we arrived. We had rooms on the 20th floor. The hotel is showing its age...we saw many ceiling and crown molding cracks in the rooms and hallways. Our room had 2 queen beds with torn covers and stained sheets. The room was clean and smelled ok, but the linens definitely need to be updated. The bathrooms were the best part with nice soap, shampoo, etc and beautiful tile. The shower was separate and very roomy. The water is hard, so don't expect to get that desert sand feeling off you with foamy suds in the shower. The room service came daily and cleaned up nicely, but were lax about leaving new supplies especially even one extra roll of toilet paper. We had to go get paper from the carts on more than one occasion. The hotel charges $12.99/day for hi-speed internet access. They also charge up to $12.99 for hollywood movies. The tv channels are sparse and there were several outages and pixelated pictures on some channels. There are 1-2 spanish channels and something like 5-6 asian channels. No HBO or other movie channels. late night TV watching after a hard day of heat and gambling is definitely not enjoyable. Skip the honor bar too and go to one of the local convenience stores to stock up on snacks. $10 for a jar of freaking gummy bears???? The pool area is way small for such a large hotel. I do not recommend it at all. The elevators are quick. The shops are few, but convenient along the side of the hotel near the elevators and along the way to Bally's. We ate at the Village Buffet twice and it was pretty good and varied. To get in the restaurant, we had to go early because the lines get really long later in the morning through the rest of the day. Register for the rewards program at the desk and they will give you coupons for $5 off the buffet. We ate at Provence (spelling?) which was an Italian restaurant and the service was slow and the food average. We ate at Mon Ami Gabi and cannot recommend it. The food was extremely slow to arrive (1 hr) and undercooked. The medium steaks arrived rare and my pork porterhouse was raw in the center. The slots didn't seem at all loose. I won about $125 on the quarter machines and did much better over at Bally's. The wait for the Eiffel Tower view was hours long on the evening we tried to go up and we skipped it entirely. **Be wary of the kiosk halfway down to Bally's from the elevators...there are 2 elderly ladies there and we thought they worked for the hotel. They offered us maps and free comps, but we finally figured them out when they wanted to take us in a bus to another property to look at rooms there. Turns out it was an attempted timeshare kidnapping. I was smart enough to turn it down or we could have wasted hours just to get a coupon for free food. I cannot say enough how much I hate the diamond rewards holders who can skip in front of you at restaurants and all lines (check-in/check-out, etc). Hopefully, they have diamond reward lines in hell so they can go in ahead of me there too. In spite of all I have knocked the hotel for, the hotel is in a perfect position at the center of the strip and is really lovely to look at on the outside and downstairs in the casino/shop area.

Ended up not checking in until 9pm and by then a non-smoking king was unavailable. No lines that time of night. Not a smoker, so they offered a night in the jr suite 815P instead (offered rest of the nights at $85 upgrade, but declined). I did request a rennovated room, if available, after the first night since I would have to repack and move. No problem - she even told me which room I would be moving to (26th floor). Apparently all the rooms above 25 have been rennovated. Rooms: Jr suites are very large (more square) with wet bar, couch, two chairs, coffee table, desk, armoire. Small hall/entry off the bedroom takes you to the large bathroom with separate jacuzzi tub, shower and double sinks and full-length mirror. Another door takes you into the toilet and bidet. Very large but decor was dated with blue carpet and floral bedspread. Bathroom looked rennovated and very clean. Rennovated room was naturally smaller, but loved the decor. White bedding, red throw, feather pillows, large red leather headboards, granite bathrooms and separate showers and tubs. Plasma TV and upholstered bench/couch at the end of the bed are nice touches. Cool item: ipod radios! Could listen/charge my ipod and even wake to my music on the alarm. Spa: Terrific deep tissue massage from Brian, but the facilities aren't that great. Small and not as luxurious as other spas. Robes were not that comfy and the waiting area/relaxation space was located right in with the front desk - too high traffic to really relax with a bottle of water. Again though, Brian was fab and worked out the knots. Restaurants: St. Louis cafe for breakfast was good, meal was hot and overpriced (as expected). Sports Bar, on the way to Bally's, was yummy and casual. Very good service too. Napolean's had nice dueling piano entertainment and comfy chairs. It's a cigar bar, so the air can get a bit thick, but nice to unwind after a day at the convention. Got in early for a quiet seat and enjoyed a cocktail. Gustav's casino bar was a good place to people watch, but the cocktails were not that great. Just not made right - maybe less experienced bartender? Best bet for casual eat/drink? The Tequila Bar at Bally's tucked in the back behind Indigo. Just awesome - strongest margarita of my life. Burrito as big as your head, super staff. Ended up eating dinner and spending some meet and greet at the bar (needed the extra time to finish the drink). Margarita was as much as the meal, but well worth it. The only downfall was the music. It would have been a real cantina if a little Mexican beat was heard, but all you could hear was the music from the four tops at Indigo. Just took away some ambiance. The gambling: getting pretty hard for a $5 blackjack player to find a table - even in the middle of the day. Had lots of luck on the $5 craps table. I don't play the slots. What's up with some of the scents in the casinos? Are they pumping in air frangrances? May sure seemed that way.

The housekeeping staff was also very friendly and accomodating during my stay (I'm the type that always asks for extra towels, soaps, etc...). 2) Location, location, location. Paris is right across from the Bellagio and centrally located on the strip, so if you don't have a car or don't want to worry about parking, Paris is the right hotel for you. Also, to visit casinos that are a little farther out, the taxi system in Vegas is a good bet. 3) Le Village Buffet is hands down my favorite breakfast buffet in Las Vegas. The made-to-order crepes and French pastries alone are worth the price. I try to stay away from buffets in general, but Le Village Buffet is one that I cannot pass up. The only buffet that's significantly better in my opinion is the Wynn buffet. Cons: 1) Paris is one of the smaller mega-hotels on the strip, so the lobby/casino area can get a little crowded. Also, the front entrance/casino area can get really smoky. 2) Check-in can take a while depending on when you arrive at the hotel.

My first two produced good memories so I felt confident that it would continue along the same lines. Here was my experience. I was greeted by standing in a long line waiting for a room. There were very few reservation agents open at 4:00 PM in the afternoon on a Sunday. My wife and I were finally assigned a room on the 10th floor. When we arrived at the room there were dirty dishes outside the door. We were hesitant to go in (thinking the room was still occupied),however we entered to find it presumably ready for occupancy. Here 's what we found inside the room: Little pieces of paper all over the floor. A credit card receipt on the floor A large dust ball on the wall over the bed A huge stain on the carpet (about 18\" in diameter) Assorted little pieces of \"litter\" on the bathroom floor. Whoever was responsible for cleaning the room apparently did it with a blindfold. The room was really tired looking. I called housekeeping and was told a supervisor would be up to examine the room. After 15 minutes no one had arrived so I called management and spoke to a young ( by her voice) woman who after hearing our story immediately said she was moving us to a renovated room on the 25th floor. In a few minutes a bellman brought up the new room keys (cards) and we went up to a new room. It was really magnificent. New furniture, clean, a fabulous bed, and in fact the whole floor had a wonderful fresh feeling to it. (These rooms are meant for diamond club members) The moral of the story is basically don't expect much if you can't get a room on levels 25 and above. This hotel is badly in need of an entire renovation. (Look at the carpet on the way from the parking garage.) By the way--- after four nights I left Las Vegas for a side trip and returned to the Paris for one night. I was again assigned to the 25th floor and the room was perfect. A lovely room agent at the Paris from Birmingham, MIchigan helped secure a renovated room for our return visit. Forgive me for not remembering her name.

He did run the vacuum cleaner as I was leaving one room to go into our other room (next door). As I now check every bed for \"uncleanliness\" aka bedbugs and such, I found a fair amount of hair on the mattress pad of the room I was staying in, so I went next door, told the \"supervisor\" and asked for a clean mattress pad on the bed I was going to be sleeping in. The fitted sheet on one of my queen beds also had a noticable hole in it. He seemed ok with this request, came into my room after finishing with our other room, and proceeded to tear both beds (2 queen bed room) apart, completely removing all sheets. I knew that this would take awhile, and it did. A maid came into the room at one point, asked what was going on, and I told her that the sheets were being replaced. She said \"I just cleaned this room\" and the supervisor gave her a look, and he and another maid kept replacing the bed linen, top to bottom. As I was planning on unpacking and heading out to the strip, I was a bit put off, as I wanted to get in and out of the room quickly, but it took about 20 min. before my room was finally \"done\" being stripped and linens replaced. The room decor is tired looking, carpet did not look that clean. Bathroom is fine, clean enough for aged property.

We have stayed at Paris numerous times as we travel to Las Vegas at a minimum of twice a year. We liked Paris Hotel for many reasons such as their central location on the strip and the ambiance of the hotel. With the recent takeover from Harrahs Entertainment, I feel that this wasn't a positive move but rather a big negative for the hotel. The management has now discontinued the mimes from walking the streets and casino and the bicycle riders entertaining the guests of the casino and hotel. Now onto the customer service--that is little to be desired. From the time you check into the hotel to the players club to the restaurants, all around the workers at this hotel and casino need to take classes in customer service 101. If you belong to their players club \"connection card\" and you are not a \"diamond member\" well you may as well stay at a different hotel because without being a \"diamond member\" you won't receive customer service, you'll wait in long lines for everything, will not receive a decent room, and will be treated as if you are a second class citizen. If you decide on eating their buffet you'll be asked if you're a \"diamond member\" and if you aren't you'll be asked to wait in the peasant line where you can wait like ourselves between 1 and 1 1/2 hours to be seated with countless people in the \"diamond line\" being seated before us. We were done with waiting in line for their mediocre buffet so we decided on eating at their Italian restaurant and of course the first thing out of the hosts mouth was \"are you a diamond member\". We responded \"no\" and he then asked if we had a \"connection card\" because if we didn't we can not dine their, that the restaurant is exclusively for \"connection cardholders\" only. C'mon who in the world does this hotel think they are? The Wynn, Bellagio, Venetian--I don't think so not even close. I have stayed at Wynn several times, Bellagio, Venetian and I can definitely say you get what you pay for. The rooms haven't seen much change in several years, aleast we haven't seen much upgrades in the rooms or amenities. Food quality has decreased from previous dining experiences with prices only rising. Paris is going downhill and rapidly. I can see Paris being an upscale Imperial Palace at best in a few years. Speaking to several Paris employees in various areas of the hotel and casino have agreed that the service is plummiting at this hotel since the Harrahs change. I really enjoyed staying at Paris years ago and since the recent managerial/ownership change am so disappointed in all aspects of this hotel. It's sad to see what once was such a lovely hotel crumble so quickly. My review on Paris isn't on the room quality alone, but rather the whole experience from customer service at check-in, players club, restaurants, shops, etc. For the money there are many better choices in Las Vegas without spending a fortune.

There is little shade around the pool so you need to keep moving to different spots to get the shade. Drinks at the pool are expensive. Supersize margarita's are $16 and service is spotty so you may need to just go to the bar to get your drinks. Paris is one of the less smoky casino's which is nice. Recommend Mon Ami Gabi for dinner - try to get one of the outside patio tables right on the strip. It's not as hot as you think since they have cold air blowing on you and misters. You also have a nice view of the Bellagio fountain while you eat. I also recommend Olives at Bellagio for dinner although it was very l loud on a friday night and you must make a reservation to get a table.

I also found the rooms to be quiet - no overhead thumping or TV sounds coming from the room beside me. A great spot for breakfast is the outdoor cafe by the pool. We never had a problem getting a table here - it really only got busy closer to lunch time. Downstairs, inside, was a different story. If you plan to bake in the sun, try to get your lounge chair to the side or in front of one of the arbours, or alternatively, along the half-wall in front of the cafe. These spots have misters that will help keep you cool! Room service was inconsistent - painfully slow the first time, exceptionally quick the next. I guess it depends on what's going on.

We also enjoyed the pool, the pool cafe, the casino, the nightly music in the casino bar - - everything.

I mentioned our request for either adjoining rooms, or rooms next to or opposite each other. This was greeted with a look of consternation from our check-in staff member. She looked in her system for a while and then asked if we were interested in upgrading to a suite for an extra $150.00. We said \"no\" so she kept looking for rooms for us. She finally found us 2rooms right next to each other on the 10th floor - a view of the carpark, but then that's what we'd paid for... The rooms were nicely decorated and quite spacious. The bathrooms were very large and had separate shower and bath. On the whole, we were quite happy. The one problem we had was that one room had very definitely had someone smoking in there - the room smelt very strongly of cleaning spray, and then when you'd been in the room for a few minutes you started noticing the smoke smell. It was pretty gross, but since we were only staying one night we decided not to complain - and our noses stopped noticing it so much after about 10mins in the room. We only ate breakfast here - at the bakery the next morning - and it was reasonable and tasty. We did pay for a trip up the Eiffel Tower for us all - definitely a \"must\"if you're staying there.

On arrival, all staff from the bellboys to reception were very friendly & helpful. We got to our room which was pleasant with a reasonably good view of the new Planet Hollywood hotel next door, and a corner view of the Bellagio fountains. Some family joined us 2 days later for the wedding, and were also staying in Paris. They checked into their rooms, and what a difference!! They had been given rooms on a newly renovated floor, and their rooms had plasma TV's, modern designs & were generally just very modern & much more comfy then our room. My husband & I decided it might be worth asking at reception if there were anymore of these rooms available, and I'm so glad we did! We explained to the reception clerk (Joseph) that we were in Vegas for 2 weeks (a very long time by Vegas standards!), and that were in Vegas to get married & have part of our honeymoon there and that we would really appreciate one of the newer rooms. We expected to be told that we could 'upgrade' for a fee, but no! After speaking with his manager, Joseph returned to advise that not only were we to get one of the newer rooms, he was also going to upgrade us to a premium room. This meant that we would have a dual aspect room - one window directly looking at the Bellagio fountains, with Caesars Palace to the right, and the other window looking out onto Ballys, The Flamingo, Mirage etc. We were given a superking bed, and the room was just superb - a hall area, seperate dressing room, HUGE bathroom, chaise lounge, plasma TV - it was fantastic. We asked how much this would cost us, and the response - it was all courtesy of the hotel with their compliments & best wishes for our wedding. Now, we hadnt gambled a single penny in Paris at this point, so they certainly didnt do us any favours because we were high rollers - quite the opposite! The rest of our trip was just perfect - the pool area is beautiful, and a complete suntrap. It gets quite busy at weekends, but we never had a problem getting a sunbed at any time of day. The pool bar is quite expensive, but this is what we expected anyway - most hotel pool bars anywhere we've been have been overpriced. They allowed you to take your own food & drink anyway, so you have the choice whether to pay their prices or not. We ate breakfast in the buffet restaurant a few times - GORGEOUS food, although you have to get there early to avoid the queues. We did go to Ballys a couple of mornings though when the queues in Paris were too big, and that was also good - we liked being able to walk into Ballys from Paris without having to go outside. The bakery & patisserie are also good. We only gambled once in Paris on the slots, and lost. We did find the casino a bit smoky & packed in compared to other hotels, but it didnt bother us as we didnt want to spend our trip in 1 hotel anyway, and spent most evenings going round to all of the different properties. We went up the Eiffel Tower which gives fantastic views of the Strip, and the whole property in general was very pretty. We found everything to be well organised & everyone very very friendly, from the cleaners to the concierge to the valet. It was always easy to get a Taxi if we needed as well which was good, especially in the 105 degree heat! We ordered room service one night as well and the food was lovely & very reasonable. We loved Vegas in general, and this was a repeat visit for me - last time I stayed in the Monte Carlo, and we also stayed there on this trip for 2 nights (we got married in the Monte Carlo), and Paris is in a different league. The Monte Carlo rooms are basic, tired & dated compared to Paris. There is also SO much construction work around the Monte Carlo that it made it impossible to get a good nights sleep, and we were on a high floor facing towards New York New York (away from the construction), and we could still hear it. The pool area has also been reduced in size due to the building works, and sitting out there was no different to sitting on a construction site in your bikini. But this is a review about Paris, and I cant recommend it highly enough.

The view from the other window was not so great; storage for pool furniture...oh well, you can't have everything. We had the same housekeeper everyday, she was very friendly, always had a smile on her face, spoke to us and made sure we had plenty of towels once she noticed we seemed to need extra. The casino was very pleasant and not smoky as some others seem to be. We had lunch our first day at Mon Ami Gabi which was absolutely fabulous. We dined outside overlooking the fountains of the Bellagio, what a great start to our vacation after being on an airplane all day. Also had dinner at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant..what a view!!

The Wynn and Bellagio are our favorites, but sometimes, the price is more than we want to pay. We got a great rate at Paris, and the location is fantastic. We checked in and were given a corner room with a view of the Bellagio fountain. This may have been because our 5 month-old son was with us. You can check in at the airport while you wait for your luggage which I thought was much easier than waiting in line once you arrive at the hotel. The rooms at Paris are a bit worn, but they are well maintained. The pool is nice, but I like the pools at other hotels better. Maybe I just prefer a connection of smaller pools and landscaping rather than one giant pool. We try to eat at the Village Buffet every time we stay there or if we stay nearby. The food is excellent, especially breakfast. We also try to eat at Mon Ami Gabi which is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. This visit, we ate at Ah Sin which I found bland and unimpressive.

You have full use of the workout facilities, spa, hot tub, and sauna included with your service. I did want to add that we used a fantastic sitting service while we were there. We used Grandma Dotti's, and she sent the same nice lady every evening to care for our son. They were reasonably priced, dependable, and I thought our sitter provided excellent, experienced care for our son. We don't normally take our children with us, but we needed to this time.

We ate breakfast at the hotel - splitting a croissant and a danish. We then split a salad for lunch at Mandaley Bay. By 9pm, we were hungry and laughingly said, we were not splitting dinner.

I called the hotel from the hospital as the security person said that they would send a cab to pick us up. From my hospital bed, Paris Las Vegas switched me to a number of people (most of them worked at Ballys as they do not have the switchboard down yet). Finally, the Front Desk Manager, who I think is named John, but I was seriously ill in the hospital, so I cannot be sure, and told me that (1) they would NOT send a cab, that it was not their problem and I had to deal with it; (2) if I wanted to stay an extra night (I was so depleted by then that I could barely move) they would charge me $79. I would say they were rude, but when you are lying in a hospital bed AND THEY PUT YOU THERE, I would call that CRUEL. Then, when I got back to the hotel barely able to walk through the lobby, they said we had to change rooms. HAD TO CHANGE ROOMS? I could barely walk!

The elevators were fast and the walk to the room (ours was at the end of the hall) was not bad at all. The furnishings were average for a hotel in this price range, bathroom excepted. 2. Food. The food at the hotel was excellent. We ate at the buffet for breakfast on several occasions and the food was phenomenal. The wait wasn't band, although we were eating early (8am) because it took a while to adjust to the time change. The \"outdoor\" cafe also had excellent food, as did the room service.

Also, it's not a meat market, so it's better for couples. 4. Location. You can't beat the location: center of the strip, near Bally's, Ceasar's Palace, and the Bellagio. We walked almost everywhere. While the hotel was excellent, we will go elsewhere when we visit again. We didn't have much luck at the casino; the table games were OK but slots and video poker didn't seem to pay out very well.

They are not really themed in any way but hey, all rooms look the same when you turn off the lights right?! Check-in and Check-out was a breeze. The casino is small but a lot more fun than some of the neighboring hotels (I can\u2019t stand the casino at Aladdin which always seems dead). If you stay at the Paris, you have to do the breakfast buffet there, which in my opinion is the best breakfast buffet in town. Overall, Paris is a good hotel and will turn out to be what you expect. It\u2019s nothing spectacular and if you want some over the top Vegas experience, then you might want to try a different themed hotel. It\u2019s centrally located and I have stayed at this hotel more than five times in the last year and recommend it.", "Date": "May 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Victoria, BC Canada", "Title": "\u201cParis Hotel - nicest hotel\u201d", "Author": "Sunbum22", "ReviewID": "UR7430462", "Content": "VIVA LAS VEGAS!!!

Cocktails, Poker, Nascar, and Reservoir Dogs\u201d", "Author": "bean8800", "ReviewID": "UR7394727", "Content": "So, I'll try to cover a little of everything here: My husband and I were turning 30 and decided to invite a bunch of friends and family members to Vegas to celebrate with us. Considering that we had a wide range of people coming-ranging in ages from 22 to 72, with some people being downright crazy to some whose this would be their first time there- we thought Paris would be great. First of all, the location can't get any better- you are right across the street from the Bellagio Fountains. Next store you have Bally's, Alladin (soon to be Planet Hollywood), Ceasers, Bellagio, and also Bills Gambling Hall and Saloon (who can leave that out???). Second- Paris has a smaller, more intimate feel to it. Most of the people who were with us told us that they were so happy that we had picked Paris, since the MGM, Ceasers, and some of the other hotels were way too intimidating since they were so so big. Also, Paris has great little places to eat up and down the cobblestone walkway. You can get a crepe, a latte, or a beer. Perfect. Contrary to what I've read about this hotel, the staff were fantastic-from the concierge to the dealers. Maid service, front desk, & room Service was fantastic and I also got a fantastic massage in the spa. I am very very picky with my massages-especially the deep tissue massages- but this was the most deepest, most in-tune massage I ever had. I can honestly tell you that it kicked my ass. Ask for Victor if you enjoy very very deep tissue massages. It is worth every penny. Rooms- everyone who stayed at this hotel loved the rooms. I kinda thought I might have got upgraded since we had about 20 people come with us for our party and even had our big bash at Mon Ami Gabi their french bistro (more later) but apparently they don't upgrade anyone from what I am told. You can upgrade to the fountain view for $60 more per day, but no one in our group did that. Everyone loved the rooms, though--especially the large bathrooms which include a shower and a tub. Gambling- we didn't do too well our first 5 days but we did win over a $1000 on our last night. We were pleased to see that they started a new poker room recently so we did play a bit there, however, we really enjoyed playing at Bally's which is connected to Paris if you walk down the cobblestone street. They have a bunch of tables that were very friendly. We played 3/6 limit and no-limit while listening to live music playing the oldies all night. It was awesome. Big ol black band from the 60's rockin out--loved it. Would not stay at Bally's, but loved how our hotel was connected to it. Didn't do too well at Bellagio or Bills Gambling Hall, however, we enjoyed the old school decor of the Gambling Hall, and who can beat the 300 pound Elvis belting out Viva Las Vegas? Restaurants-We ate all over Las Vegas-from Mandalay Bay, Bellagio, Ceasers, and Paris- and have to say that our birthday dinner at Mon Ami Gabi (Paris) was the best. Although our dinner wasn't cheap- it was the best service and filet mignon I have ever had. They really really outdid themselves. I work in hospitality myself and was very pleased and impressed with the 5 waiters that simultaneously brought out our food. Lunch at Mon Ami Gabi wasn't as great, but the view outside the fountain show made it worth every cent. We also sat next to one of the crazy guys from Reservoir Dogs-kinda cool. Also, try to have a drink at the restaurant at the Eiffel Tower at night. The view alone is worth it. Also, one thing we didn't do until our last day was go to Le Burger. I thought it was just a sports bar, but this place rocks! Our bartender was so entertaining that I called everyone by the pool and told them to get down to Le Burger as this guy was throwing cherries about 10 feet in the air and catching them on plastic picks before throwing them into a mai tai. Apparently he is the 9th best bartender in the U.S. or something like that. He made me get up on the bar and pour 4 kamikazies at once for me and the family. He was very entertaining, humble, funny, and is not to be missed for a great lunch. Hubby did Richard Petty's Driving Experience (my gift for his bday) and he had the time of his life. You have to do this if you have a true Nascar fan on your hands. I booked this 3 months in advance and it was worth it ($400). I thought it might be cheesy, but no. My husband had the biggest grin on his face for days. He rode his own race car for 8 laps and it was awesome watching him. Beware-leave early-not a lot of cab drivers know how to get there and we barely made it. Did the rumjungle thing at Mandalay and it's fun, but I guess just not our scene. Good food though. Ghost bar is pretty fantastic. We went early (like 8pm) and there was no wait at all. There is hardly anyone there at this time, which was great for us. We had the bartender, tables, and view all to ourselves. Girls were free and guys were $25 to get in at that time. For those that like to shop, I heard that Ceasers and Alladin have the best stores. If you need a sudden Ferrari, they have a dealership in the lobby at the Wynn. Maybe next time. Anyhow, if this trip sounds like your cup o tea, then here are my recommendations: Day one Stay at Paris hotel Lunch at Le Burger Cocktails around 8pm at Eiffel Tower Restaurant Dinner at Mon Ami Gabi (try to eat outside-it's worth the wait) Dinner at Fix (Bellagio) is fun too. Day two Richard Petty's Driving Experience Poker at Bally's See baby Tigers at MGM (you can play with them for a fee) Cocktail at Ghost Bar 8pm Dinner at Golden Steer (off the strip) for a great steak and to sit in the oldest steakhouse in Vegas. Rat Pack used to hang out there and I'm sure the Mob still does. You'll see. Great fun, and there's a strip club next store for those of you who are interested. Anyhow, have fun.

There is so much to do that room location and bed selection is pretty low on our list of expectations sice you're not in the rooms much. The room was very clean but remember this is one of the mega-hotels and the walks to the rooms once on the floor can be a slight distance from the elevators. The self-parking area is a long, long ways from the hotel, check-in and the rooms. Drop you luggage at the front and valet the car if you don't like a long walk. The restaurants were very good but there were a lot of people in town, even in early April, and the wait can be a little long for some.

The location is right in the heart of the 'mega resort' area and handy for visiting other hotels and walking the strip. On arrival, we were offered a choice of upgrades at a very good price. (Suites with jacuzzi etc) but we decided not to take it as our trip so short and although it was affordable for us, there are other things we'd rather spend our money on. After all, in Vegas how much time do you spend in your room? However, for others it might be something you'd want to do. The room we had was super. It was clean with excellent views of the strip, the city vista, the \"Eiffel Tower\" and Bellagio's dancing fountains, which we watched every evening. The view from above was far more spectacular than on the ground and to see it from one's own room was a real treat. I have to be critical of Room Service. That's not to say that when food arrived it wasn't good. It was. And the service was polite and very pleasant. However, when we dialled room service we often found that we were put on hold for a lengthy time and when we did order, there was a wait of about an hour before the food arrived. This was especially a problem in the mornings when all we wanted was tea or coffee first thing. There were no tea or coffee facilities in the room and like most normal people, we like to have a cup of tea or coffee in the mornings when we awake. To have to wait for an hour for a hot drink in the morning is a pain. We ended up having to get showered and dressed and go to the Casino to find somewhere to get a hot drink, which sort of distracts from the idea of being in a hotel and having easy mornings. The Paris should provide facilities in the room for hot drinks. It's also hard to get a simple hot drink in the hotel as the restaurants are set up for huge breakfasts. Sometimes guys, all we want is tea and toast!!!! The housekeeping service was hit and miss. Some days we had a bed turn-down and chocolates and on others they forget to replenish the toiletries. They also spilled rubbish from the bin on the floor and left it. I also stupidly left some chips on the bedside table which disappeared. I suppose that they assumed it was a tip, even though we'd left a tip in the envelope provided. Never mind! Checking in and out was smooth and easy and the Concierge service was excellent. Self parking is convenient. Like all big hotels it's is a long walk to get from one place to another but all in all, it's one of the most attractive hotels on the strip and a nice place to stay.

Paris is not as large as some of the other hotels but it makes up for it in style and location. Check in queues at some times of the day are quiet long but the staff are really helpful and try to deal with everyone as quickly as possible. Pool - nice size and gets lots of sun from about ten in the morning. Choose either left or right hand side of the tower leg for all day sun. Good points ; central location on the strip, decent size swiming pool, great views of the Bellagio fountains. Lovely and quiet rooms and the newly refurbished rooms have beds which are so soft you might have trouble getting out of them!!!. Could improve on pool services, getting a waitress so you can order a drink can be a little difficult on some days because the pool area can get really busy. But there are always plenty of clean towels and sunbeds as a plus point. The hotel is close to lots of shops as the Cesears Palace forum shops are diagonally opposite the hotel. The Bellagio shops and restaurants are across the road. Don't be put off by the Aladin/Planet Hollywood hotel next door which is being revamped you won't hear any noise from the building works in Paris. The shops inside theAladdin are still open until about eleven in the evenings and there are lots of good places to eat in the Miracle mile/passage way too. Go to a Cirque de Soliel show if you get a chance , I found if you go to the actual hotel hosting the show you get a really good deal. The discount ticket places are excellent for the slightly smaller shows rather than the big named ones I found. The new Cirque de Soliel \"Love\" production at the Mirage is based on the Beatles music and it was amazing. \"Love\" and the \"KA\" show at the MGM I found easier to get tickets for than Zumanity and O which were sold out for the whole week. Both Love and KA were totally different but as the Americans would say \"Awesome\" !! The Las Vegas Premium outlets north of the strip is a really nice outside shopping experience and there are great savings to be had. The $12 cab ride to get there was well worth it. Dualling pianos at New York New York were I think the best in Vegas but another fun one was at Harrahs.

If you live a long way from Vegas, that can be unrealistic. At the Race book, they made me buy my racing forms and then get the money back later and get drink vouchers from the betting cage.

And as a note, when you go on the website and you attempt to view the room, you won't get much of an idea.....beware.", "Date": "March 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mississippi", "Title": "\u201cParis Las Vegas Review - March 21-26\u201d", "Author": "marleyJ", "ReviewID": "UR7228136", "Content": "Feel Free to Ask Questions! I will try to cut the commentary and provide some answers that I was looking for before my trip. a little about me and my husband. i am 36, he is 50, we are professionals that travel to vegas 1-2 times per year and gamble on the gulf coast in between. in vegas we have stayed at Mirage, Caesar's, Flamingo and the Hilton and now Paris. AIRPORT ARRIVAL AND CHECK-IN: We checked in at the Paris airport check-in around 10:45pm, Wed. March 21. we booked a king smoking luxury room using comps. We walked out of hotel registration with a 2 queen bed, non-smoking luxury room, and a promise to switch tomorrow. The Premium upgrade quote was $45 a night. We ditched it, we would rather play that $250 at the tables, we moved on to get our baggage. Unfortunately, Not one of our checked bags made the trip with us. We headed for the Delta \u2018we lost all your stuff\u2019 office. Our bags were on a later flight arriving soon so we waited. We got our bags at 12:10am then headed for the taxi line. There were around 75 fares ahead of us in line. The line moved like lightning though, they have really gotten the \u2019herd em out of here\u2019 thing down pat, we were pulling up to Paris at 12:45am. SO, two hours on the money after landing in Vegas, we arrived at Paris, not a great start, but at least we did HAVE our luggage, we headed to our \u2019not what we ordered room\u2019 14th floor, probably a grood view of the fountains but it was too late at night, and staring dead on at the hot air balloon. Not a newly renovated room but clean, not impressive, not so great mattress. SPECIFICS: Cab from airport to Paris - $12 plus tip. However, I met someone at Paris who came was charged $24 for a trip from the airport and only one person was riding\u2026 hmm. Not sure what happened there, but I did tell my cab driver to take us the quickest way, I don\u2019t know if that made a difference or not. Premium room upgrade - $45 per night. The rooms: I read a lot of posts before going to Paris, and everybody sees the quality of Paris differently, here is my take. You get what you pay for, this is a good mid-range hotel. It is a Hilton (or a bit nicer than a Hilton) not a Ritz. For our purposes, it was lovely. It is a clean nice room to sleep in with an adequate bathroom that has a separate shower. I wasn\u2019t that impressed with the view, I have been to Vegas enough to know what the strip looks like and so, for us, we were happy on day 2 to move to the 4th floor and get a room that had the king bed in it. Actually we like lower floors in Vegas, it is so much easier to run up to your room and back down, you don\u2019t have to stop on other floors very often to let others on and off. We always ask for low floors and rooms close to the elevators. We had a view overlooking the pool, which I preferred to the strip view, they are building a new resort next door to Bellagio and if you are on the \u2019Aladdin\u2019 side of the building your view will be of the construction site. Our second room was not renovated, however, I did see a renovated room. They are considerably nicer. Housekeeping and maintenance were wonderful. The room service was speedy and wonderful. We were very pleased with the service in the hotel. Room complaints: There was no coffee maker. Each morning I went downstairs and sat at the bar most convenient to the elevator and paid $2.50 times 2 for coffee, that was a hassle. I bought one cup at Le Notre for $5, and then decided to just buy it at the bar, the lines at Le Notre are long in the morning, and the bar coffee was actually very good. The casino: A great staff. We enjoyed Gustav\u2019s bar for video poker, and did pretty well there. The machines paid off enough to keep us playing as long as we wanted to, the bloody marys were good and the bottled beer was cold. The sports book is decent, but the sports book at Bally\u2019s is better. The walk to Bally\u2019s really added to our trip, it is short and pleasant and provides you with a whole different casino and more browsing. DINING: Le Village Buffet breakfast is $13.99 per person, go around 10:30 in the morning, and it crosses over with lunch so you basically get lunch at a discount. But be ready to wait. We waited around 35 minutes. The food is very good for a buffet. Le Creperie - SO GOOD. You must try it. It really is just wonderful! J.J. Boulangerie - we bought a sandwich here, it was great! We also bought pastries, SO GOOD, don\u2019t miss the cheese danish, and definitely don\u2019t miss the gelato. Room Service - Pizza to die for! And Hubby liked the steak but did not care for the shrimp scampi, of course we are from the gulf coast, so shrimp scampi is a common dish for us and we have had some great ones, so I am not sure if his judgment that it wasn\u2019t great is fair. There is a brand new restaurant called Le Burger Brasserie, it is styled like a sports bar and has a really nice ambiance. My hubby got a burger, it was ok. I got a salmon burger and it was fabulous! They offered lamb and veggie burgers as well, and the best part was we charged two burgers, an order of fries and numerous beers to our room, the tab that I signed was around $60 or so, and it came up as an $8 charge on our bill! I always charge everything to my hotel room. It is always good to test the system! Apparently they charged us for our first round of drinks, I did sign the final bill but for whatever reason it wasn\u2019t put in, I saw the error on the long plane ride back and am figuring it is because the place is so new (only one week old) and still working the bugs out. In short, the food at Paris does NOT disappoint. Eating at off times is recommended. The lines at most of the restaurants were very long at typical meal times. For the most amazing cheap meal you have ever had, Go through Bally\u2019s and exit at the door by the sports book, take a right and walk down Flamingo to the light, cross the street and take a right, two doors down is Ellis Island! Ellis Island: WOW! OH MY GOSH! We have found our new favorite Vegas restaurant. We ate lunch at around 2:30 on Friday at Ellis island, there was a short 10 minute wait, the food was unbelievable for the price, total tab was $14.00. We came back to our room and cancelled our steakhouse reservations. The $4.95 steak special is better than Outback, and the salad and green beans served with the steak are home-grown and fabulous. I have no clue how they do it, but we are hooked. The ambiance is what I would imagine Vegas may have been like a few decades ago, and the place was packed with locals. It is a blue-collar caf\u00e9 with seriously good food and has to be one of Vegas\u2019 best kept secrets! We ate there a second time on Saturday, 11am and waited about 30 minutes, the food was still fabulous! Ambiance at Paris Las Vegas: I loved this place! Vegas cheesy. It made it fun. The details are meticulous and the ceilings make it light and airy. A few tips: we walked about 10 minutes toward MGM and bought beer and a Styrofoam cooler for our room. We were headed for Walgreens but came upon a tourist trap souvenir shop that carried beer first. We paid $23 and change for an 18-pack of Miller Lite and a Styrofoam cooler. The store also offers all the standard tourist stuff if you want to load up on gifts on the cheap. An even better option: Go through Bally\u2019s and exit at the door by the sports book, there is a grocery right across the street - 12-pack domestic cans - $11.99. Monorail: We didn\u2019t even ride the monorail and here is why\u2026 we took a walk and ended up at MGM Grand. We grabbed a cab back and the cost was only $5.70. We realized that the monorail, based on a 10 trip pass would have run us around $8.50. It is overpriced. In my opinion, the only value is if you intend to move about the strip a lot, then the 3-day unlimited pass sold at $40 per person might be worth it, for us, no way.. We will cab it. In short, we were very impressed with Paris. we have stayed at casinos from the top down and for the money it is just great! We are not high rollers (we run $2K-$3K through the casino each day) and so places like Caesars or Wynn are out of the question for us as we just dont get the great treatment there that we get at places on the level of Paris. For us, Paris is perfect, it offers fair room prices and reasonable food prices and has an ambiance of luxury that you do not find at Harrahs or flamingo or bally's or others in that price category. we also love the location, you are just steps from so many other options if you desire. we are already planning to stay at paris when we go next time in the fall.", "Date": "March 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cGo for the upgrade!\u201d", "Author": "jln315", "ReviewID": "UR7225977", "Content": "We booked two nights at the Paris over St. Patrick's Day weekend.

Check in and check out were a breeze. The first night I stayed with family in a room with two doubles and the second night I stayed in a king by myself. The rooms were much nicer than I expected. Since this is now a Harrah's property, I wasn't expecting anything special. The rooms are nicer than say, Bally's or the Las Vegas Hilton, but not quite as nice as Caesar's or the Wynn. I liked the room with two doubles better. It was a nice, cozy room. The room with the king bed was too generic hotel room feeling. We ate at the cafe for dinner and breakfast and the food was pretty good - the portions are huge! There were only a couple of things I didn't like about my stay. First, I really wanted to spend most of my time at the pool. When I booked the rooms, no one told me that the pool would be closed. No one said anything at check in either. We tried to go down to the pool and the elevator button wouldn't work for the pool level, so we stopped at the spa level to find out why we couldn't get to the pool. Come to find out, the pool was closed for renovation. It would have been nice if they would have told us that prior to our stay like any other decent hotel would. I had to walk like five miles to the pool at Bally's. The pool area there was ok, but it must have looked odd to people in both hotels/casinos to have people walking around with wet bathing suits. Also, Paris does not have good ventilation to get the smoke out of the casino. I am a non-smoker and can put up with smoking casinos, but this was awful. Not a good time if you don't smoke. I was surprised for being a newer casino that the ventilation was so bad. Overall, I think I would stay at Paris again if the rate was good. It's not one of my favorites, but it's not awful either.

The crepe stand makes a good sweet crepe. We enjoy Mon Ami Gabi quite a bit and eat there every visit. Napoeon's is a nice place for a drink in the evening. The rooms themselves are average for this price range on the strip. NOthing spectacular. Our bed was uncomfortable but we were on the 8th floor so maybe it hadn' tbeen renovated yet. View of the parkling lot was nothing to get excited about. Didn't find out until we checked in that the pool was closed until the end of March. Bally's pool was avaiable to guests but we didn't feel like trekking over there and entertained ourselves in other ways. I'd stay here again if there were a good special.

Especially when it started to get dark and the lights came on and the fountains started their dance!! The room was very spacious, clean and the beds were comfortable! Since we upgraded to a strip view room it was $60/night, but we had access to the Rendevouz Lounge, which we could get in with our pass key. There was continental breakfast which, if you left hungry, that was your fault. Everything from bagels, croissants, yogurt, fresh fruit, smoked salmon, coffee, tea, juice. You could take bottles of water and pop back to your room. Again at 5pm there were appetizers (I guess if you eat late at night, this would hold you off). There was two \"hot\" entrees, shrimp, cheese, crackers, desserts, and alcoholic beverage as well. It would have cost us alot more to go out to eat. This was more than enough, and we didn't need to stand in line at the buffet to spend money to eat! We were very impressed with this. They always greeted us with \"Bonjour\". It was a nice little treat to our stay. Our son really needed a vacation. He had just finished his cancer treatments and found out the good news that it was all gone just before we came. We were celebrating. As for the hotel itself, it was very easy for him to get around. The cobblestone was a little bumpy for him, but he could manage.

Overall, I really enjoyed the hotel and would recommend it to others. We stayed in a remodeled room on the 26th floor which was a little small but still nicely decorated and clean (except for an unopened beer bottle under the nightstand). The area was quiet in the evening with no late night noise. The staff was very nice and we had no problems with anyone being rude. The hotel is centrally located and convenient. That is important when you start walking around! Paris is nice and the theme is not really overdone. However, it is not as luxurious as Bellagio or Wynn (I have stayed at both). But there is a price difference along with that. The shops are more reasonable at Paris so you can grab some coffee or a snack within a few minutes and be on your way. If you are looking for something more upscale - stay at Bellagio or Wynn. I also recommend those resorts for different reasons. We spent some time in the casino at Paris and I felt more comfortable in that one than the Wynn, Bellagio or Caesars. Might have something to do with the lower limits on the tables - I am not a big gambler. The dealers were pleasant and professional and it was easy to walk from table to table or the slot machines. The servers are also very good about getting you water or anything else you might want to drink. I never had to look too far for service. The buffet was just \"okay\" for the money. However, the cafe was excellent and we played Keno during lunch. Lots of fun. One disappointment was the champagne bar. It was my understanding that it provided \"jazz\" entertainment but I only saw people singing along with the dueling piano players. I had hoped for a sophisticated spot for drinks but it didn't work out. We liked that the hotel was connected to Bally's and we ate dinner one night at the Bally's Steakhouse. Excellent dinner but a little \"old school\" which was fine with us. The Tequila Bar is also a nice spot for happy hour and some light music by Rick Chavez. Also, we always have dinner at Smith & Wollensky Steakhouse when in Las Vegas. Yes, I realize that they are in other cities but it is good with a nice wine selection. We saw \"O\" and it was spectacular. Worth the money and you are completely entertained for two hours. I normally do not like shows but this one is good. We had dinner at \"Olives\" at Bellagio on the patio overlooking fountain. Excellent food and service. I wouldn't want to sit inside as the tables are very close together. House of Blues is good for a drink and entertainment. It helps that it is in Mandalay Bay which is a very large and open casino. You can take the monorail from Bally's down to MGM ($5) - walk across the street to the tram (free) that takes you to Mandalay Bay. Taxi ride is around $10. We also spent time at the Titanic Exhibition at Tropicana. It was fascinating. We then played craps at the Tropicana casino. It was the first time I had played and the dealers were very helpful and patient with us. We actually won! I think that casino gives you a taste of the old Vegas so enjoy it for what it is. Bottom line is that I think Paris is great for a group or friends.

The negative: We were awakened at 6 a.m. (after going to bed @ 2:30 a.m.) to banging. Continuous banging. I called the front desk and they sent someone to investigate. It sopped for about ten minutes, then started again. I kept calling until 7:30 a.m....and they finally told us they were doing construction in the hotel. I asked why they would allow them to start @ 6 a.m. and they said they were under contract to start at that time!!!! I explained we had only gone to bed a few hours before, so they asked if we would like a late checkout at no additional charge. I explained that we had late checkout as part of our reservation. They apologized and offered us $20 off of our room. Whoopee. Everything considered, we had a wonderful trip. ...and if the construction was not permitted to start @ 6 a.m., we would've had a wonderful last day in Las Vegas.", "Date": "March 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "calleefoneeya", "Title": "\u201cParis Pros and Cons\u201d", "Author": "ndfan01", "ReviewID": "UR6897925", "Content": "I've stayed at the Paris twice and under certain conditions (great deal, traveling with an infrequent LV visitor, none of my favorite haunts available) I'd return. PROS: Great Strip location for venturing out to other mega resort properties. It is very convenient to Bellagio, Caesars and Alladin, and other places are walking distance if you don't mind walking a ways. (I've hoofed it from Paris to MGM, Mirage/TI, and Venetian for example and I'm not in the greatest shape...) It is connected by the shopping area to Bally's which is kind of a depressing casino, but at least provides the gambler some variety as the Paris casino itself is pretty small. Another superlative for this resort is the food. Every place I've eaten there was good. Mon Ami Gabi, the Cafe, the Buffet, even room service and the fast food (crepe) place had tasty food. The Parisian theme is well-executed. It doesn't feel as cheesy as some of the other theme based hotels. There are some employees at Paris who are very nice, efficient and helpful. Particularly in the casino positions. The slot club people are very nice. Checking out through the casino guest desk was very pleasant. CONS: I had unpleasant experiences checking in on both occasions that I stayed. On the first occasion I had to wait almost 4 hours for my room to be available. 2 of the hours were after official check in. When I insisted upon speaking to a supervisor and getting in my room, I was downgraded from the superior room I reserved to a lesser room and they absolutely would not acknowledge the change or adjust the rate. On the second occasion I stayed there, I had reserved a 2Q bed room and a rollaway bed as two friends were joining me. We were not told until after we checked in that we couldn't have a rollaway in the room due to \"fire ordinances.\" This was inconvenient and uncomfortable, and frankly we would have chosen a different hotel had we been told of this policy when I specifically requested the rollaway during the reservation process. The guy at the desk was really rude about it. He never smiled, made no conversation, and pretty much just treated us like we were checking into a women's prison. Then he failed to activate two of the three keys to top it off. Not a nice way to start the trip. Room Service was incompetent and unapologetic. A friend had ordered us a bottle of champagne for the room. We received a message to call room service to have it brought up. ( I learned later that we didn't receive the message until almost a day after the order had been called in) When I did call for it, they said they'd bring it but we had to stay in the room and wait. After waiting almost 2 hours, and calling 2 times for status still no show. When I called the third time the lady said, \"we are really busy.\" This isn't a souffle here. Put our champagne and some glasses on a tray and bring it up. Our evening was wasted. We also visited the Champagne bar on the trip. The waitress there was nice but slow, clumsy, and frankly not very bright. She couldn't get our drink order right on 3 tries. We gave up on waiting for the appetizers we ordered after an hour. The valet yelled \"Hey You\" at my friend as she was leaving the area because he needed some information he forgot to ask for when he gave her the claimcheck for her car and luggage. The rooms are kind of small and unimpressive when compared to the competition on the strip, but there are some great views of the Bellagio fountains and the strip if you get lucky. Pool wasn't that great. The spa was pretty, and my massage was good, but I hated that they kept trying to push you to buy the overpriced products. They also somehow cancelled my massage reservation AFTER I checked in at the spa when one of my friends came in later and they needed to know the name on the room (mine) rather than hers. Then they asked her if she was having a massage, and when she said \"no\" they cancelled mine while I was sitting right there waiting for the therapist to call me. Just experienced a lot of dumb stuff like that throughout this stay. In short the hotel and wait staff is inexperienced and untrained to respond to common custumer service needs. This isn't a real impressive resort from the standpoint of an expensive hotel. On the other hand, for the occasional visitor who doesn't want to pay Bellagio or Wynn prices, the Pros make it a reasonable choice for a vacation destination.

The lady was professional, not friendly or unfriendly. I took the $60 upgrade for the room which gave me a great view of the strip; Paris tower and Bellagio fountains across the street. My friend staying in my room lives in Asia so it was nice to sit in front of the window at the little table and have a cocktail and watch the fountain while we were getting ready. The upgrade also included access to their lounge that had breakfast and evening heavy hors d'oeuvres and wine (for a fee.) I would not do that again. Breakfast was OK, but only one night did we make it and they didn't let you take any food or drink out of the room. Wanted to munch on some wine and cheese and crackers in the room while we got ready and we literally had to sneak it out. Room was much nicer than expected. Beutiful bathroom with both stall shower and jacuzzi tub. Plenty of vanity space for two girls. Beds were very comfortable with duvets and fine pillows. Nicely decorated. No complaints. The casino itself is very loud (not just because of the slots) but because the floors are made out of \"cobblestone\" to represent to streets of Paris and sound just echos over them. Not a cozy place, but again fine in this price range. As everywhere, I think, some really nice dealers and some not. Played poker and the poker room management were very nice as were the dealers.

This is the first review i have ever written and it is not good my friends... I recently stayed at Paris las vegas from jan 14 thru jan 17. I was suppost to stay thru the 19th. Just some background on me, My wife and I have stayed in Vegas 8 times... Luxor, Stratosphere, horsshoe, venetian, golden nugget, bellagio, and this past august a parlor suite at Wynn. This is the first time i have ever complained to the hotel management. We checked in on the 14th at about 9 am. We decided to go cheap this time and just pay for a regular room. At the front desk, I asked if they had any upgrades available for a fountain view. The woman informed me it would be 60 per night for that. I already know the drill with vegas... If you want something you have to grease the wheels if you know what i mean. I asked for a high floor and slipped her a 20.. Low and behold, we got a \"P\" corner room on the 24th floor with a great view of the fountains. No extra cost... So back to the hotel.. It was nice enough, not like wynn or bellagio, but we already knew that and werent expecting that much... As the days passed, my wife and i started getting progressively more itchy and i started breaking out on my chest... my wife on her legs.... As the 3rd night came we got back to the hotel at about midnight... As my wife lay in bed, she was complaining of an itchy feeling. She got up, and both her hips were red, she had bumps on her legs,chest, and back. My chest also wasn't looking good. Before this I thought it was just the dry weather, because we're from hawaii, we weren't used to it. I knew now it was from the bedding/furniture. I called to the front desk manager, who sent an EMS guy up. They switched us rooms to a calais suite at 1am... When we got there, we were initially excited... HEY, ITS A SUITE... We took a shower, and were getting ready to go to bed. My wife undid the covers and noticed there were hairs and yellow stains on the pillows. I couldn't believe it. My wife wanted to stay and tough it out, But I had enough... I went back down to the front desk and tolde them we wanted to check out immediately... The manager couldn't even believe his hotel was like that. I called the venetian, they had a room ready and waiting for us when we got there. The Rooms are NIGHT AND DAY... The regular room at the venetian was better than the calais suite at paris... The only thing i was really interested in was a clean bed. I never slept so well that night.... Overall, the Customer service was nice enough, but the paris seems older than hotels twice its age... Harrahs has got to take care of there properties.

We paid to upgrade to a room with a view of the dancing waters and Eifel Tower, and this was well worth it. Also, we were glad we made the decision on arrival at the check-in to pay for access to the all-you-can eat breakfast/snack room guests' buffet (the check-in 'hall' is well worth a photo - it's quite astonishingly rococo/Versailles kitsch). This guests' buffet room was not a zany or excitingly themed space, but allowed us to consume big breakfasts (though things were a little too sugary for my tastes) and big late afternoon feed-ups, and this was all included. So we had plenty of time to spend our money more entertainingly in the casinos and shops (the Desert Passage shops at the Aladin were my favourite for actual purchasing; the Caesar's shops were most fun for browsing). The casino floor at Paris is cute because it's a mock up of the city (with fake 'bridge' and struts of the Eifel Tower). We thought the spa prices were a bit too much for what didn't sound terribly exciting (as treatments go...). The Arch de Triomphe (outside) is amusingly scaled, and overall, the fact that I can mentally revisit the hotel and relive the holiday every time I watch 'Paris' glittering in the credits for 'CSI' is a big bonus! The food in the restaurants surrounding the casino floor was of the big portions/bland variety, but in general, anything involving chips was good. The room service burgers and chips we ordered one evening were very good quality and actually arrived hot. Beds were very comfortable, and there was a good number of well-sized towels.

We did end up paying the extra $60.00 per night to get a view room and use of the concierge room on the 31st floor. Our room was on the 19th floor over looking the tower, pool and the Bellagio water show. The bed turned out to be one of the most comfortable that we have ever had at a hotel. This surprised me because uncomfortable beds were one of the major complaints in other reviews. I asked for extra pillows and they were delivered to us in less than ten minutes. We didn't hear one sound from the renovations although we had a very loud cowboy yahooing in the room next to us! All the staff were extremely friendly and helpful especial in the concierge room. Unfortunately the pool was closed due to some maintenance. We would have liked to have been able to sit at poolside to enjoy some of the suns rays. It was a fabulous week weather wise although a bit chilly to have taken an actual dip in the pool. The casino was only really smokey on our last night (a Thursday). But I have to admit it was just as bad when we strolled through the Bellagio's casino the same night. The Mirage's casino was smokey too so it has to go with the territory. We don't smoke so we really notice it. The casino was nice if a tad small. The one note I must make is that the week of Dec 10 -16th is not a slow week anymore in Vegas. This was our fourth visit in four years and I swear there were more crowds than ever! Even the buses were filled to the brim with people.

Since we had requested a King size bed it wasn't ready but they did offer us a double then we could switch the next day. We decided to wait and check in at 3 or 4 as they stated. We went to check in our bags and was greated with \"Thank you for staying at Paris\". We hung out in the hotel and gambled a while and contrary to the reviews did quite well on the slots. We hit the streets and came back to find that our room was ready but then they offered an upgrade for 60.00 per day. We decided not to do so yet I did ask for a view not of the roof top of the garage as the past reviews had stated that was thier findings. She looked at the room list and then stated if we wait 5 mins I could get a room on the 6th floor with a nice view, room 611, but the maid was in there now. We took our keys and ventured up. Again the service was given with smiles. Yes the maid was just fininshing up and the view was good. We had the Tower, pool, part of the strip hotels and mountains. It was great and not at an extra cost. The rooms aren't as plush but you must remember they are duplicating Paris, France. If you have ever been over there you would find it to be the same. There was construction but we never heard or saw it. Now upon check in I did ask about it and stated that we didn't want to be near those floors.

Nice layout with two seating areas, two windows and a full closet (with safe) in addition to the armoire. As others have reported, the comforters and furnishings are definitely showing some wear and tear but not to the extent that it seemed dirty or rundown. The bathrooms are spacious with separate shower and oddly smallish bathtub. The only fridge in the room is one of those dangerous auto charge minibars. We requested an empty fridge on our 2nd day. Supposedly \"a charge\" applies, however, we were never charged so that was a nice bonus. During our stay, we ate at the Creperie which is a good option if you want to grab a quick (and very rich) bite. We also had dinner at Mon Ami Gabi. This was our third time dining here, first on the patio, and it was excellent as always. I love the feel of the casino at Paris, however, this casino is not the best for video poker so not much time spent actually playing onsite during our stay. We threw a little dough into VP at Gustav's bar while we had a cocktail and waited for friends but, that was about the extent of it. Spent a better part of the time playing at Caesar's near the sportsbook. Much better VP offerings and good drink service. Overall, we had a great stay at Paris.

Upon arrival we were offered a suite upgrade at a reasonable cost that we went for. The suite we got was just beautiful and worth every extra penny. The view, decor and ambiance were fabulous. A few exceptions: We arrived early (noon-ish) and I just ran in to see if we were too early to check in. Because it was check-out time the line at the front desk was extremely long. So, I ran into the \"Diamond\" check-in lounge, which was totally empty of guests, just to ask that question. When I was asked and replied that I was not a Diamond member I was told to leave. SO- I went to the front desk area again. Line was even longer so I walked up a \"Platinum\" line - which was empty - just to ask my question. Again, told to leave as I was not Platinum. So we just left the hotel and came back a couple of hours later and the line was reasonable. It seems like the Platinum and Diamond check-in agents should take overflow one-by-one if they're empty and the regular line is quite long. Second: We ate at their restaurant Au Sin one night. Appetizers were very good but my entree was a nightmare. I ordered the whole dungeness crab - DON'T order that!!! The crab was portioned but the pieces were not cracked. I tried to crack the pieces with the crab cracker but the sauce was thick and slippery and made that very difficult and messy. I told the waiter and he took my dish back to the kitchen to have it cracked. It took so long that my husband's dish was getting cold so I told him to go ahead and eat. He finished his dish by the time mine returned. Still hard to eat; I managed to get a few flakes - but definitely not worth ordering! The waiter was great and \"made it right\" by deducting 1/2 the cost of the dish. Still, I left there hungry and disappointed. All in all we were very happy with our stay.

Since we booked this hotel for a single night, we were charged a steep rate of $269~ for the night. This was my second visit to Las Vegas, but my first overnight stay. The Paris was located in a prime location on the strip - center stage - so to speak. We arrived to a very busy registration area. The driveway was a bit of a mess with car lanes for registration, valet drop off service and drop-off, which then combined with valet pick-up. It was a grand entry, but for all the \"glamour\" it could have been more organized. After visits to other hotels, I found that the Paris actually had a pretty good system as we viewed the absolute chaos at the Venetian. Considering that our $269 book us a standard room, we were very pleased to find that we had been upgraded to a suite. (This could be because our travel agent was my the mother of the owner of my place of business. Somehow, we went from a standard king bed room to the Calais Suite (Room 501P). This suite opened into a grand foyer with powder room/bath and a wet bar to the right and a beautiful crystal chandelier suspended above a four seat round table. Behind this was an entertainment area with two chairs, sofa, coffee table armoire and TV. Off from the living room was a bed fit for a king with sweeping drapes on either side of the bed pulled up to a crown at the ceiling above the headboard. There was ample closet and drawer space. A small hallway off of the bedroom led to to the two baths: one a classic bath with beautiful glass enclosed shower stall, the other a large podwer room area with jacuzzi tub with a separate toilet/bidet room. The room was gran and looked out over the pool and the Eiffel Tower. After visitingother hotels and casinos on the strip, I came to appreciate the casino, shopping and restaurat options atthe Paris. The Casino was large, but not designed to disorientate. It had every gaming option, was nicely themed, but didn't overwhlem the senses in a way that I had found at other hotels (like Caesar's or the Venetion, where I just wanted to escape the noise and maze). The shopping areas were themed as French villages and offered the usual items, albeit in a more human scaled setting. Restaurants were aplenty. I forget the names, but we chose the buffet for diner - Superb! And, another fine cafe for breakfast. The registration area was a mini-Hall of Mirrors of Versailles and the theming was so precise. The only drawback I found was the smoking of guests. It seems even with permission to smoke on smoking floors and in smoking areas, they ignored these delineations and smoked everywhere. It was to absolute annoyance. Our suite floor was a non-smoking floor and we always found smokers lounging about in the central lobby by the elevator on our floor. I would highly recommend the Paris to anyone looking for an excellent hotel, with high quality service, in thye middle of it all. This having been my second trip to Vegas, I can say with confidence that the city airport might be a convenient start or end point to excursions to the many natural wonders and national parks of the area, but in the future I will drive the extra hour or so to avoid the city as a place of lodging. Traffic was a nighmare. The urban sprawl of cookie cutter homes depressing. And, if you don't fancy smoking, drinking, or gambling, there is no \"there\" there. It is just a strip of hotels calling itself a city. A \"must\" on anyone's lifetime travel list - check it off and be done with it.

I had waited quite a few years to afford it, and now that the Wynn and Venetian are in Vegas, Paris had to lower their rates to compete. So, it\u2019s a perfect time to experience an upgraded hotel. First of all, we stayed on a Sunday \u2013 Tuesday, always the best time to visit Vegas. Less traffic, fewer crowds and better rates on lodging. We actually got the Paris room for only $116 for Mon \u2013 Tuesday. (It was still a high rate for Sunday.) The Paris hotel and casino is beautifully appointed with the Eiffel Tower replica growing out of the casino itself. The replicated cobblestone streets serve as pathways throughout the lobby and casino. Above, the sky is painted a pale blue with clouds so you almost feel like you are outdoors in Paris. The stores are full of things like lavender soap actually made in Provence, but also full of things that say \u201cParis\u201d but are made in China. So just beware when shopping. When we arrived we asked the receptionist how much it would be to upgrade since we were celebrating both our anniversary and my husbands birthday. The first two rates she proposed were just too high for our budget. Sensing our ability to pay a bit more, she continued working and found a special package which included breakfast and hors d\u2019oeuvres nightly on the Concierge floor plus a larger corner room with a corner view. The additional price was $60 per night and we took it. Not only did the hotel make more money, but also we were thrilled to have the deluxe room. We were on the 25th floor with a perfect romantic view of the strip in both directions, plus the Eiffel Tower was centered in one window for us. We could also watch the Bellagio dancing waters nightly directly across the street. The bigger excitement was the view of all the red and lavender desert and mountains surrounding Las Vegas, something you rarely see from the ground. We also overlooked the attractive Paris pool. Well worth the additional price. The room had a long entry way with French blue carpeting and beige striped wallpaper covered in blue French fleur de lys. The king bed bedspread matched the wallpaper and there was a giant armoire with not one but two closets for hanging clothes. In between the closets sat the TV with several cable channels. There was a bench seat in front of the pool/Eiffel tower view so we turned it around to face out and sat to watch Las Vegas every time we were in the room for a rest. There were also two stuffed comfy chairs that swiveled for the view or reading. The entry to the bathroom started with a separate room for another closet with a safe and a desk with Internet connection. The expansive bathroom had pink marble on the floor and shower. It included both a shower and a bathtub. There was a great deal of counter space for our bath products, and there were plenty of towels. Our only complaint was the king bed was very mushy and thin and moved every time my husband or I did. I also really dislike an expensive hotel not providing fitted sheets on their beds. Fortunately we always bring our own fitted King sheet, but I really believe this caliber hotel should have fitted sheets. I can\u2019t stand to lie down and have the flat sheets untuck and displace themselves all night and end up sleeping directly on the mattress. These are minor complaints. The view was well worth the price. The room was exceptionally clean. The staff was enormously helpful and quick. The valet and bellmen were terrific. We ordered a refrigerator to keep things cold until we checked out. It was only $10.00 per day. That is a bargain. Other minor hotels in town charge $15-$35 a day. We had room service for breakfast twice and it was excellent, however the second time it was not as hot. But the food is very good. We used both the Spa (only $25.00 a day for guests) and spa services (massages, pedicure and hair style) and they were excellent. One staff doing the pedicure was a bit annoying due to her immaturity, but all in all the experience was great. We lay by the pool one day and discovered the pool is shallow all over, perfect for dipping and back to your beach chair. Waitresses came by occasionally to take orders for very expensive drinks and lemonade. One night I was sick from the food at the Eiffel Tower (you can see my review there) and at 3:00 AM three housekeeping staff came in immediately to take care of our bathroom. They were just wonderful. I can\u2019t say enough good things about housekeeping, valet, bellmen and front desk staff. Food at Mon Ami Gabi and Les Artistes Steakhouse and Le Caf\u00e9 Ile St. Louis was excellent to superb and is far better than the Eiffel Tower. Paris Casino Las Vegas owns and controls their restaurants EXCEPT the Eiffel Tower. The difference in quality and service is unbelievable. The Paris hotel restaurants are truly fine dining. I am writing my reviews on each of them also. Gambling was fun here, especially the new giant \u201cWheel of Fortune\u201d game that seats 9 couples at a time. They are one of the few casinos that have this brand new gambling game. I would definitely stay at the Paris Las Vegas again.

It has some good points and bad points. Good points: 1) Our room on the 26th floor was nicely decorated and it had a huge bathroom. With nice marble flooring and tile. And it had a great view. The bathroom had a full length mirror at the back of the door. That was nice for getting dressed. 2) The elevators are very fast in this hotel, so you don't have to wait long for one. 3) We upgraded our room, for what we thought was $60 a day to be able to use the concierge room on the 31st floor. It turned out to be $60 for our entire stay. In the concierge room, you do not pay for breakfast, but rather you go up for your coffee and breakfast there, and it's open from 7 to Noon. Side note: Our friends who arrived much later in the day, couldn't get the concierge room, as the availability had sold out. The food is mostly high carb in nature for breakfast, but they do offer croissants, bagels, cereal, yogurt, granola, and salmon, cream cheese and fruits. Also, cafe latte etc, for no extra charge. The upgrade to the concierge room also includes happy hour from 5 to 7pm, which basically could be dinner, as we had steak skewers, pasta, some salads and lots of delicious pastries. There is also wine and beer, but you do have to pay $4.00 extra for the drinks. If you are traveling with friends, it's a great place to meet and have a snack before heading out for the evening to a show and gambling. 4) The hotel is a 5 minute walk to the Aladdin Shopping mall, and a 15 minute walk to the Cesars's shopping mall. Great food and great shopping at both. The Paris is also right in the middle of the strip, so it's great to be able to walk to everything. 5) If you check out (-)Parislasvegas.com, you can print off a $25.00 off coupon for the spa. 6) For some free and fun entertainment at The Paris, check out their piano bar. These guys are called dueling pianos, and they are really good and funny, and you can tell they love their job. They entertain from 10:30 pm to 1:00pm I think. 7) The Paris, does have some fun shops and restaurants. Bad points: 1) The lighting is not that great in the bathroom, and not great for women putting on make up. Also, other hotels on the strip provide lighted make-up mirrors, and this hotel doesn't. 2) The bathroom also doesn't have a fan of any sort. So after a shower it remains foggy. 3) The spa is very nice, but for women if you want to stay in the spa dressing area, and put on your make-up in the spa, and fix your hair, there once again are no lighted mirrors. They do provide hand-held mirrors, which I thought was a big joke. Also, the hair dryers are not that great. Mandalay bay does a much more superior job in the spa department, and you are paying the same price for the service. 4) There is no coffee maker in the room. This is something that I get picky about. I just want to have my first morning coffee in my room, without having to get dressed for it. This was also true of the Bellagio. Not sure why these pricey hotels can't offer a coffee maker in the room. 5) This Hotel was very smokey. But other hotels we visited were not. 6) Can't use the refrigerator in the room, because otherwise you will be charged for the items that were moved around, even if you didn't eat or drink them. But heck, it would have been nice to have been able to keep our water and snacks cold. But this service isn't offerred here. All and all I did enjoy my stay here. Loved the location. Our room was clean, comfortable. But if I were coming to see a show and spend time in a spa, this wouldn't be the hotel I would pick. For room design and quality and just plan big, The Rio is very nice, and they provide a coffee make and a refrigerator you can use. The spa's are much nicer at the Mandalay bay, and the Bellagio, and also MGM.

The airport check in, however was efficient and fast. Eat at 'Mon Ami Gabi'.

We checked in at the airport with the $20 'trick' and we were upgraded to a \"P\" room on the fifth floor. We also checked in my brother-in-law (BIL) and his family at the same time and they were also given a \"P\" room on the seventh floor. Room was like we remembered from first visit - just not very good views - ours looked out over a roof that had old lounge chairs and junk on it. We didn't have any shampoo so we called housekeeping who sent some up. The toilet was loose on its setting and the shower had lime build up around the bottom and the door. Otherwise, it was perfectly acceptable. BIL's room wasn't ready until late in the day and they had requested a roll-away bed when they checked in at 3 p.m. which did not get delivered until 10 p.m. after repeated requests. Their room also smelled like smoke (on a non-smoking floor) but that cleared up after the first day. We rented a car from Dollar at the hotel which we picked up in the attached garage. Very convenient. I would recommend valet parking the car - it is quite a hike to run back and forth to the garage to get it all of the time. The only drawback is that you have to pull out of the hotel onto the strip which can mean delays if it is crowded. Returning the car took about half an hour because the clerk was late opening up the rental desk and there were several people in line. We only ate at the Paris buffet one time for breakfast. It was not as good as we remembered with much less variety and choices. Every station had bacon and some form of plain potatoes. Very bland. On a side note, I would recommend Peppermill restaurant for a change of pace - it was across from the Stardust. Excellent food and atmosphere - neon diner-ish. I would stay away from Batista's Hole in the Wall. Bad Italian food and service. The buffets at the Aladdin and Orleans have gone downhill but the buffets at the Bellagio, Rio, and Wynn are absolutely spectacular! We saw Lance Burton's magic show which was fine. My husband, BIL, and niece really seemed to enjoy it. My husband and I saw Popovich's Pet Comedy Theater at the Aladdin. I loved the cat and dog portions of the show (about 15 minutes of an hour and fifteen minute show), but could have lived without the quasi circus/clown acts and too much juggling show. The 'theater' itself was just regular restaurant type chairs on a flat floor. Carrot Top or Mamma Mia are much better values. My niece and I used the pool at Paris one day which was fine. Crowded but clean. Did notice that they allowed people to have glass bottles in the pool which did not seem very safe. Our maid did a less than acceptable cleaning job every day. On our last day, she never came in to clean at all. We returned to our room at 1 p.m. to take a nap and called housekeeping to let them know the room had not yet been cleaned. We told them we would be leaving at 3 p.m. and they could clean it anytime after that. They indicated that would be fine. We left at 3 p.m. and returned at 10 p.m. to a still uncleaned room. We had a message from housekeeping at 3:18 p.m. asking when they could clean the room! We called and told them told them it still needed to be cleaned which they finally sent someone up to do after some argument. They were less than accommodating. We asked to talk to a manager who begrudgingly comped us two breakfasts the following day. I would recommend staying at Ballys on the strip for a better value and access.

This is not something you want to hear after a 10 hour flight, nor do they offer you some complimentary drinks whist you wait for your room to get ready. Its a case of park your luggage and come back later. At check-in I tried to get an upgrade as it was an anniversary trip but alas I was out of luck. I tried to get a strip view but again no luck. I had to pay extra for a view of the strip but I did also get access to the club lounge for my money which included a light buffet breakfast and light evening appetisers. You were also allowed to take soft drinks out with you which made it worthwhile but does not make up for the disappointment of not even getting a decent view for the price you have already paid for your room. However just as i was about to leave the check-in area a room became available, so no waiting around then. The hotel is more compact, the rooms were of a good size, well furnished. The bath room had a separate tub and shower and I did not notice any problems with the water pressure. I agree the hotel rooms are due a refurbishment even though its a relatively new hotel. The room decorations just need to be jazzed up and the bedding needs to be refreshed. The gimmick of the Paris works well. Although the Eiffel Tower and Arc De triomphe looks tacky its also well done. It does not beat the real thing at the real Paris but is a more tasteful hotel than most. The pool area is good, very large and was very popular with families. I would had preferred a pool where the water had more depth at at one end and a separate pool for young kids.

The deli at Bally's is very good, with fresh bread and deli meats made right in front of you. Good pickles!!! GAMBLING: We played mostly the machines and I found the cocktails waitresses to be very courteous and came around often. No complains there!

I had business in the area in late August 2006. After checking the room rates on the Internet, I chose Paris Las Vegas for $119 per night, plus taxes for a total of $129.71. I had never stayed at that hotel before, so I decided to check the reviews on TripAdvisor, and I was a bit dismayed at some of the less-than-glowing reviews. I figured it was only one night, and I wanted to see the place, so I decided to keep the reservation. I'm glad I did! My experience was apparently different from that of some of the other TripAdvisor reviewers. The room was in excellent shape, very clean, nicely decorated, and very quiet. Everything worked properly. The bed was firm, but comfortable -- and I slept through the night, which is unusual for me. The bathroom was immaculate and very nicely appointed -- although the tub was small and there was no light in the separate shower stall. Nonetheless, it was very, very nice, especially for the price. The large casino floor is interesting and well run. It's noisy, of course, but no more than other large casinos on the Strip. The shops are all quite nice, if nothing out of the ordinary (what is these days?), and there are lots of restaurants and other food outlets to choose from. The hotel's shopping mall is connected directly to that of Bally's, which is nice. The Parisian theme is well done, although like other themes hotels, it gets to be a little tiring after a while -- sort of like Disneyland, too sterile, too cute. But that's what theme hotels are all about, and it's fun if you're not overly critical about it not being \"real.\" Since I was alone, I decided to forgo the expensive restaurant in the mock Eiffel Tower and instead opted for Mon Ami Gabi, a Parisian-style bistro. Wow! It was GREAT! Several very nice, large dining rooms, including one facing the Strip and Bellagio's lake, and also an outdoor dining area. The French bistro theme and d\u00e9cor is well done and comfortable. I chose the Steak Roquefort Frites, a very thin steak quickly cooked to medium rare, topped with Roquefort cheese, and accompanied by the best pommes frites (French fries) I've ever had. That was $23. I ordered some asparagus to accompany it for $7, and they gave me enough for two. Wines by the glass were reasonably priced, $6 to $14 or so, and there were several good choices. The dessert choices all looked interesting, and the Bananas Foster Crepe I ordered was great, again enough for two. I think it was $8. Service was attentive and very professional without being annoying, although I had a bit of trouble with my French waiter's accent. All in all, I thought the hotel was a super deal. The room was excellent, the staff was top-notch (Vegas has the best hotel workers in the world, IMHO, largely because the hotels and the unions work well together, the employees are well paid, and most have many years of experience in the industry).

The pool didn't seem to be heated, which in Las Vegas probably isn't necessary, but at 6 pm in the shade it was almost too chilly in the water so we headed in.

We knew it wasn't the real deal, but we wanted some of that ambience. Well, I can say this hotel is nothing like Paris. To begin, the room decor was very tired. Nothing appealing about it. My bathroom was dirty upon check-in, with some hair in the tub. On the second day I realized that there was a dirty glass in our bathroom. It was turned upside down with coke dripping from the bottom. I asked my husband if he got a coke out of the mini-bar and he said no. Apparently the housekeeper put a dirty glass in our room. I went to report it but the ceck-out lines were loooong. So I figured it would be picked up the next day. Nope! It sat there in all it's sticky glory the entire four day weekend. The food is horrible and over-priced. Nothing like France, although they try to make it sound like you're eating French cuisine. Sorry, but French toast isn't served in France. And they will seat you in the worst section if you don't ask for a particular spot. Twice we sat next to the kitchen and listened to plates dropping, employees yelling back and forth, and so on. On our last day at breakfast an employee came around spraying the tables and seats with chemicals and wiping them down right while we ate! He even did the same to a woman who was eating in her booth. He just went right on and started mopping down the seat opposite her in her booth. He didn't even bother to say \"excuse me\" or \"sorry\". We would have eaten at Denny's had we not had an early flight to catch. And speaking of, there are two Denny's on either side of the hotel about ten minutes each way.

The reason is that the afternoon sun streams in the restaurant so they pull down window shades across the whole front of the restaurant to avoid the heat, and no one table can vary this as they are not individual window shades but massive things across multiple windows operated electrically. So even if you want to endure the heat for the sake of the view, you do not have that choice. They don't raise the shades until the sun sets behind the Bellagio across the street at, I would estimate, about an hour before sunset. Everything else about the restaurant is excellent however, including of course exquisite food. However, the pricing is only worth it for the view, and if you book at night, you have less chance of getting a window table. The views are not so great from other tables.So go for the hour before sunset! If you want the best view of the Bellagio fountains (every 15 mins), ask for a window table in the north west corner.

This is definitely a mixed review. We reserved a room with a king bed, but upon checking in, the clerk said they had none; only two doubles. A king bed was in a suite and an extra $85 per night, and facing the Bellagio fountain was another $135 a night for a better suite. I found this unbelievable - since we checked in on a Monday night and there weren't THAT many people milling around, compared to Friday and Saturday when the place was teeming with guests. Since my husband was there for business, his company allowed us the upgrade to the suite for $85 extra. It faced the parking garage, but the mountians in the distance were beautiful, and at night there were still thousands of lights to look at. The bathroom was beautiful, with a bidet and his/her sinks and a jacuzzi tub for two with a separate shower. There was a separate dressing area with vanity table; a sitting area which was nice and the chairs were comfortable, the bed was comfy and there was a wetbar. But it was still just okay - one curtain was ripped, vanity table was scratched and watermarked, bathroom doors had black smudges on them, one towelholder by the sink was broken, the toilet wobbled, and the faucet at the wetbar dripped consistently until I made a tourniquet out of a hand towel and shut it good - for $500, you must be joking. The first day of housekeeping, all that was done was the bed was made and we had new towels. No straightening up, vacuuming, nothing. Next day housekeeping forgot our room altogether. I called and it was cleaned while we went to dinner. I was able to use the jacuzzi tub, which was wonderful, but then it was never cleaned out so I could use it again and I just didn't care enough to call. The water pressure was okay, but not if you have thick hair. BUT... the staff was friendly and helpful, the croissants, gelato, pain aux chocolat and sandwiches (even the coffee) was delicious in the two pastry shops, and the buffet was excellent (it was almost 11 but everything was still fresh at that time). The pool was wonderful, ample towels and space and the waitresses were quick with the drinks and poolside menu. We rented a cabana on our last day which was nice, because a VERY rowdy crowd was having a bachelor/bachelorette party and we had a very nice, smoke-free quiet spot to relax away from it all. I was there most days and it was very enjoyable. In my opinion, the shops left a bit to be desired compared to other hotels (Caesars, Bellagio, etc.). Small, with not much selection. The children's shop was very cute. Also, the Paris is connected to Bally's which is right by the outside escalators to bring you across the street to Bellagio or Caesars, so if it is too hot for you, you can walk through Bally's and keep out of the heat a bit longer. It is a very pretty hotel and the Eiffel Tower is magnificent. I went to the salon one day to get my hair blown out and deep conditioned and it was a whopping $128 (including tax and included gratuity). Since my hair was long, they charged $80 to blow it out. It looked wonderful, but I didn't want to spend my money on getting it done again. So all in all it was just middle of the road.

We ended up on the same floor, but in 3 different wings. Not a big deal, since the one thing I did like about this hotel is that it's never a really loooong walk to the elevator from your room like it can be at the Bellagio. The elevators are in the middle and the 4 wings radiate out. The one thing we were really anticipating was the rooftop pool. Being Sex and the City fans, we imagined ourselves sunning at the pool overlooking the Strip. Well, rooftop means on top of the first floor casino, and you aren't seeing anything of the Strip. Should have done more research on that one, but to bill that boring pool as rooftop is a complete misnomer. Also, don't expect to get a drink anytime soon from the pool waitresses. The quickest way we found was to go to the bar ourselves, bring our drinks back, only to have one magically appear and yell at us for getting our own.

He was actually much friendlier and talked us into an upgrade to a suite. It's twice the size of the regular rooms and has a whirlpool tub. The suite was small and I wondered what a regular room would have been like. And the suite overlooked the parking garage. Save your money and don't upgrade. I think someone else said that too! Upon getting to our suite and getting settled. I need an iron. The one in the room was broken and dripping water everywhere on my clothes. So I called housekeeping and asked for a new one and some extra pillows. The guy came up promptly and sat the pillows on the bed and was starting to walk off with the iron. I said, \" I asked for the iron too.\" He said, \"No this is for another room.\" I said, \" I have a broken iron.\" He left it rudely. 5 minutes later, same guy at the door to deliver pillows. Geez!

The hotel is absolutely beautiful and gives you the feel of being in Paris. However this excitement quickly faded upon check in. Keep in mind I booked my trip for Memorial Day weekend 2006 in December 2005 which included paying for a full night as a deposit when I made the reservation. However when I went to check in, the extremely rude desk clerk (probably the rudest person I have ever encountered at a hotel) told me that the Paris Las Vegas was overbooked and my reservation had been moved to the much lower quality Bally's Las Vegas hotel next door. When I asked the desk clerk how they could possibly do this since I had booked the room 6 months ago and already paid for one night to hold the room, she told me that they can do what they want and it does not matter what deposit I paid or when I reserved the room. She also told me that the airlines overbook flights all the time and bump people off flights and the Paris Las Vegas does the same. So as a result of the fact that I am not a high roller and don't lose thousands of dollars at their hotel I was moved to the much older and much less nice Bally's Las Vegas. I could not have been more disappointed as I was really looking forward to staying at the Paris Las Vegas. In addition to the problems with the room, I found the staff at the Paris Las Vegas to be extremely rude. We ate at the restaurant Mon Ami Gabi (inside the Paris Las Vegas) and stood at the hostess stand for approximately 5 minutes while the 3 hostesses talked amongst themselves before they even acknowledged us, even though I tried to interrupt them. Additionally, the staff at the check in desk was some of the rudest I have ever encountered. Never once did they apologize for situation and were completely unsympathetic. Based on this experience I will definitely never stay at the Paris Las Vegas or any of the related properties owned by Caesar's Entertainment, including Bally's Las Vegas, Rio, Caesars Palace, the Flamingo, and Harrah's. Never have I been treated so rudely by hotel staff. If you are looking for a hotel where the staff ignores you and treats you rudly and you are a risk taker and want to take a chance that you won't have a room once you arrive at the hotel, then the Paris Las Vegas is definitely for you!", "Date": "May 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cRudest staff I have ever encountered (even in the real Paris !)\u201d", "Author": "Huftycat", "ReviewID": "UR5231180", "Content": "I spent a weekend at the Paris with friends, the culmination of schoolgirl promises that we would one day 'do Vegas', some 20 years after leaving school !

The Paris buffet was the worst buffet we've eaten at, not many food choices for our tastes, especially at $25 pp for dinner. During our visit we saw the 'O' at Bellagio, an excellent show that I highly recommend; La Cage was very good (female impersonator show); 'KA' at MGM Grand was boring--not worth the money; and the Ron Lucas show at Rio was okay (would have liked it better if not family-friendly).

We normally stay at the MGM everytime we go to Vegas (because we normally get lucky at their casino) but this year, we said \"let's try somewhere different!\". Boy, did we make a mistake. We choose Paris because of the location and the reasonable deal offered by Expedia. Upon checking in, we were told that the non-smoking rooms we requested are not available and the only rooms they have left are all smoking rooms! My aunt has health issues and being in an enclosed room with cigarette smoke is a big problem. We had booked all four rooms as non-smoking but our main concern was our aunt so we asked the desk clerk to find at least just one room for her and were told there's nothing they can do. We then asked if a non-smoking suite is available and we would just pay for the upgrade and again was told no without even checking. We then asked the clerk what other options are available and she said go to another hotel! It was already around 9 o'clock at night and the last thing we want to do is go look for another hotel after a long day. We asked to speak to a manager because I know that hotels always keep some rooms available for their VIPs who might drop in unexpectly (my friend is a hotel manager in San Francisco). The desk clerk refused and instead said she will talk to the manager for us and see if there's anything. She came back about 15 minutes later and said the best they can do is to comp us for a free breakfast buffet and offered to switch our rooms to non-smoking the next day. At that point we were all tired and without any options so we took it and hope that our aunt would be okay for the night. That leads me to the buffet the following morning. We had to get up early because we technically have to check out of our smoking rooms and check back in to our non-smoking ones. Another big disappointment. There was not a whole of selections and the service was horrible. Rude is the only word to describe them. In fact, that's the one word that keeps repeating throughout the entire Paris Hotel experience. Needless to say, we would not go back to that hotel again due to the rudeness of the staffs .

For first timers, if you can't tolerate smoking, Vegas is not the town for you as it seemed everyone was smoking and drinking, and although not a smoker or drinker, it didn't particually bother me while in the casino. I liked the fact that the Paris casino was smaller as I was very overwhelmed at first. Vegas is an experience for anyone 21 and older. I would not recommend bringing children and could not understand why so many people had their small children there with them with all the partying and smoking, not a place for kids. It's an adult playground! We only had 2 bad experiences while there, one of the gentleman dealers at Bally's was extremely rude and had the same experience at the Monte Carlo with a lady dealer, so we didn't go back to either place. The people at the Paris were great and you can't beat the location.

Kristina gave us a 2-night upgrade to a P-suite, which was very nice, bath and a half, fabulous view. Since I saw both rooms, I can confidently say the suite was much, much nicer than the regular room. The bathroom was much bigger (and the half bath was a nice addition), the jetted tub was very deep (and nice after a long day of walking), there was a fridge (not stocked, which I prefer so it can be used for what you want - water, take-out, etc.) in the suite and a nice, beautifully furnished living space. My husband was most impressed with the tv in the bedroom, as it would automatically rise out of the chest at the foot of the bed. The regular room was what you might find in any Hampton Inn, though the mini-bar was fully stocked with liquor, beer, snacks, lotion, etc and automatically charges if items are moved - clearly displays instructions, so there's no confusion. There is no space for storing any of your own things in the fridge and they request that you don't. We left the tv on a music station too long and were automatically charged $9.95, but when we realized what happened, we called the front desk. Alfonzo was very pleasant, accomodating and immediately credited our account. We found the location to be perfect, just across from the Bellagio, easy access to the monorail (once we realized we didn't have to walk outside to Bally's - just past the restaurants and shops), the deuce, and walking distance to many other hotels. It's also a nice size hotel - not so large that you can't get out to the street or to the monorail fairly quickly. Every staff member was gracious, polite and asked if there was anything we needed. All the restaurants we tried were excellent, La Creperie, JJ's Boulangerie, Le Provencal (parmesan crusted chicken is absolutely fabulous!), the buffet and Mon Ami Gabi (we sat outside and watched the fountains across the street at Bellagio). All the shops were expensive, which is expected, but a short walk next door to the Aladdin shops, there are some regular stores, like the GAP, if you forget or need more basics. The only negative we found is that the air didn't seem to work well in either room at night (we are both warm-natured, and it's only April, so I can only imagine that it's also a problem in the summertime.)

We waited over 30 minutes. Not sure if it was the clerks or it was just busy. The desk next door at MGM was empty. I am pretty certain we would have waited less if we went straight to the hotel, but since we invested so much time already, we just waited more. (2)I had to pay to use the gym. I guess I am used to business oriented hotels like the Marriot where I can run on the treadmill. I had to pay for a spa/fitness center day pass to work out. I had a coupon from their website so it was only $15. Pros: (1) Comfy rooms. Similar to other places of similar price range (Monte-Carlo, Luxor). Not a fan of the low tub. Like someone else mentioned, it is like sliding into a low sports car! (2) Easy late check-out. Normally checkout is at 11am, but we got 1pm checkout without problems.

There was some food that we tried that we didn't like, but the boullabaise was the best we ever had (tons if shrimp, mussels, clams and big pieces of a wonderful fish - don't know what kind but it was delicious).

We had breakfast at Le Cafe one day and spent almost as much as we did for the dinner buffet.

Ultimately our bathroom was disinfected that evening and we got $100 off our hotel bill. Beyond that, the rooms offer a free safe, good tv reception, but the beds are very hard and not comfortable. Also the water pressure in the shower is very weak and takes getting used to. I have been to Las vegas 3 other times and if you can get a good rate, I would highly recommend Mandalay Bay (they have an amazing wave pool and lazy river), Venetian or MGM. I have stayed also at Luxor and think you can do better than this. Keep in mind that Mandalay bay is at the very end of the strip and not in the best location. I would highly recommend renting a car for a few days and driving out to Hoover dam and red rock canyon. Also driving out into the city of las vegas is nice to see how they live and there are beautiful views of the surrounding mountains.", "Date": "February 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NJ", "Title": "\u201cThe Paris was a Delight after a Rocky Start\u201d", "Author": "Redcc55", "ReviewID": "UR4560554", "Content": "We visited Las Vegas over President's Weekend. We arrived at the Paris at 2am after a long, late flight out of Newark. We found that the hotel was completely sold out and would have to go to Caesar's Palace for the 1st night of our 4 night stay. (Even though we had paid for the the whole trip though a Travelocity deal 2 months earlier). We were offered $100 in food & beverage comp, the cost of the 1st night hotel room comped and cab fare to Caesars... until they found out that we had paid Travelocity, whereupon they told us they couldn't comp us the 1st night...so they increased the F&B comp to $200 and upgraded us to a \"P\" room suite for the remaining three nights. The Paris Hotel was wonderful...the room was enormous and had a great view...the casino was beautiful...the themeing (Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triomph, and Hot Air Balloon) was spectacular. No problems with any staff rudeness. Restaurants: The Eiffel Tower Restaurant... spectacular view of the Bellagio Fountains..very pricey menu, although very tasty...we had filet mignon, crusted salmon, two orders of mashed potatoes, two cocktails $127. Ah Sin...spectacular pan-Asian cuisine...sake, asparagus salad, soup, vegetable/tofu salad...4 large sushi rolls..two cocktails...$60. Did not have the patience to stand in the Le Village buffet line (the one everyone raves about)..instead waited in the much shorter line (5 minutes a most) for Le Cafe ile St Louis...good service..good omelets...really good coffee...about $35 each morning. The F&B comp was not applicable at the Eiffel Tower Restuarant nor could it have been used at Mon Ami Gabi..but we used it up regardless. We saw Barry Manilow (Hilton) and Elton John (Caesars) and both were spectacular. Went to the Jubilee show at Bally's because we wanted to see a \"Vegas\" show....we were unimpressed...overwhelming stage sets and costumes do not make up for campy skits and boring story lines...asked many times: is this over yet????...the jugglers and acrobats were the best part...BY FAR. Don't waste your money ($130 for 2 cheap seats)...we moved up 15 rows, the place was half full. Also, I have worked in NYC and go there often socially and use taxi's a great deal, but Vegas taxi's are unbelievably expensive...it will cost you $5 to cross the street...the $10 cab fare the hotel gave us to get to Caesar's was not enough for the round trip (literally across the street)...watch out and walk! Taxi's to ($12) and from ($16) the airport were painless. Tip..have someone go stand in the taxi line at the airport while you get your checked luggage. Went to the South Rim of the Grand Canyon via small plane on a last minute whim..took a bus tour of the area and had a buffet lunch. Nice change from the hustle/bustle...$400...8 hour day trip.

Our experience started off very well, as we were able to check into the hotel from the airport. Paris has a check-in desk located next to the baggage claim area. I would highly recommend checking in at the airport. While my husband was waiting on the luggage, I checked in and received my hotel room key. Therefore, upon arrival at the hotel, we went directly to our room with no waiting in the LONG check-in line at the hotel's front desk. Nice Perk! The Resort was well themed and very nice to look at. The room we were assigned was on the 25th floor and had a decent view given the fact that we didn't pay for an upgraded room. We were able to see an obstructed view of the strip but couldn't see the Eiffel Tower. The room was bright and clean. The bathroom large and well decorated with lots of marble and a glass enclosed shower. The one complaint I had with the room was the lack of a closet. The room contained a wardrobe that housed the TV as well as 2 small areas to hang your clothing. With a family of four, I found the wardrobe provisions a bit small. Additionally, I like to hide my luggage inside the closet during the trip making for a less cluttered vacation room. Unfortunately, our luggage (and we had a bunch of bags) was piled in a corner of the room against the window for the entire vacation. While in Paris, we ate at the Cafe de St. Louis for breakfast twice and thoroughly enjoyed both days. Although the line to get a table seemed long, it moved very quickly. The wait staff was attentive enough and the food came out very fast, which was a plus for us because we are always in a hurry. We also had Sunday Brunch at Le Village and found it to be very enjoyable as well. The wide variety of dishes were all very tasty. One thing we found odd about one of the restaurants open late night (can't remember the name), is that they didn't have take out containers so there was no way to bring food back to the room to others who were too tired to go down for dinner. I guess this encourages more costly Room Services meals. The Mandara Spa on the 2nd Level was very enjoyable as well. The Deep Tissue Massage and Frangiapani Wrap were to die for! Casino was small and we had terrible luck there. My husband gambled in several casinos and won in most of the others but NEVER won anything in Paris. Maybe it was just bad luck on his part but he is convinced it was the odds. Overall, we enjoyed our trip. However, traveling with kids, I wouldn't stay at Paris again. There was not enough \"fun\" stuff to do. My kids really liked the Luxor, NYNY and Circus Circus when we visited because they had more activities.

When you settle into your room, call to have your bags delivered. they will not be automatically brought up. Your room choice and bedding preferences (king , queen, 2 queens) can only be made at checkin and not prior to. what you get is ultimately based on availability. Rooms are very clean and bathrooms are well equipped and relatively spacious. You may read some reviews about the pillows being a little hard, which they are, and walls are not completely soundproof. You will here partying in adjacent rooms (and vice versa). Casino area is fantastic. Very spacious and covers all gaming. Texas holdem area can get crowded and works on a reservation system.Be very attentive also as some of the tables for $1/$2 are actually NO-LIMIT and betting gets in the $100's after the flop. Before getting on the waiting list, walk next door to the Aladdin and sit right down in a very good poker room. Also try the $10 slots. I know, it sounds pricey but the payouts are better and a lot more frequent. Dining is kind of dicey but also very subjective. Le village buffet, like all buffets, is strictly for those in search of mass quantity. Seriously, buffets in Vegas are fairly expensive and overrated because of the sheer size of choices. Every restaurant in the Paris offers very good fare and at Mon Ami Gabi, the outside seating view is the best. You get the atmosphere of a true Paris bistro at night and a free show of the Bellagio fountains every hour. Service is no different than anywhere else. The larger the crowd the slower the service. It's too be expected but, hey, you are on vacation so what's the rush anyway? Shopping? Interesting selection of boutique stores. Most of them fall under \"things I wish I needed\" category and the pricing is typical Vegas. There is also a cigar bar on the way to the elevators that some reviewers have complained about.

Paris is centrally located on the Strip, so we could take either the monorail, walk, or go on a short cab ride to every hotel on our itinerary. This was convenient, since we did not rent a car. Check-in was smooth and fast. We are AAA members, and this allowed us to jump ahead onto a VIP line. Our room was on the 30th floor, and had a partial strip view. It was breath-taking to view at night. The kids had never been so high up, so they enjoyed the view. I liked the atmosphere at Paris and the adjacent Bally's Hotel--they're connected by a short walkway that's also a faux French village. Great smells from the restautants at Paris, although we only ate from room service and La Creperie. It was Chinese New Year, so the casinos were packed with Asian gamblers testing their luck in the new year, the Year of the Dog. Every casino we visited had decorated with a Chinese theme, in particular the high-limit salon areas. The casinos in Paris and Bally's were crowded, but manageable. The smoke in Bally's is worse than Paris, because the latter has a very high ceiling that resembles a sky view. Everything on the strip is overpriced, and Paris is no exception. Our room averaged $175 per night on the weekend. The room service, while good, set us back $12 per person for breakfast. However, we knew what we were getting ourselves into, since my wife and mother-in-law were going to see a concert at the MGM Grand on Saturday night. We chose Paris because of its convenence to MGM as well as sights like the Bellagio and Caesar's Palace. Nevertheless, the rooms were clean and spacious and the bathroom was quite large and sparkling. Room and maid service service was prompt and courteous. My only complaint is that the tap water in all Las Vegas casinos tastes terrible. You'll probably want to drink only bottled water. We saw most of the major hotels on the strip and they each have their advantages. For Paris, its main selling point is the convenience, a \"fair\" price on the strip (compared to others), and a tasteful and well-executed theme.

It was hard to not think about the heavenly beds at the Wynn with the fabulous pillows. Also, the casino is small, dark, and very unorganized. I hate to keep comparing, but the casinos at the Wynn and Belagio are so much roomier and well lit, with large aisles in between sections.

However, I've been going to conferences and business meetings in Las Vegas since the late 80s, and based on my three-day stay at Paris in November 2005, I think I've found a new favorite. Most of the hotels in Las Vegas require you to walk through the casino for EVERYthing; you simply can't escape it. Paris is an exception. If you come in the front door, you can slide around the edge of the casino to get to the elevator. When it's time to grab breakfast before you run off to the convention hall, you can do so without getting your hair full of cigarette smoke. You could *almost* forget that there's a casino around the corner. For the business traveller, Paris is a solid good choice. While Internet access is not free, the extra cost won't take your breath away. The rooms are a decent size, the desk is big enough for your laptop plus papers, and mine, at least, was quiet enough for me to get some work done late at night. It felt like a hotel-with-casino, rather than a casino with some rooms glued on. The location on the strip is good, too, but it won't help you avoid cabs. My conference was at the Mandalay Bay, so I assumed I could take the train from Bally's. All the service personnel at Paris said that I'd be better off taking a cab, because the hike to the train (and then to the conference area at the MB, at the other end) would make the trip about a half hour.

If you're happy to do this, then fine, but if not a polite \"no thanks\" is sufficient. 2 - A couple of good view points are the Stratosphere Tower and in particular the Eiffel Tower at the Paris Las Vegas hotel. If you go to the latter, its good to go just before sunset, that way you can see the area in daylight and then when the sun sets, you see the strip light up. 3 - No matter what you do in Vegas, you have to see the Bellagio fountains - fantastic!", "Date": "January 11, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cincinnati, OH", "Title": "\u201cStay out of Parking garage\u201d", "Author": "HotSlotMama", "ReviewID": "UR4345663", "Content": "Our son was robbed and mugged in the Parking lot.

Over the past year I have read numerous reports about the Paris and was concerned as many were not good but I am extremely well travelled and have stayed in many hotels all over the world and I have to say we all enjoyed our stay. This was a first visit for us all to Las vegas and I chose the Paris as it was in a good central position on the Strip and from a location point of view it did not disappoint. If I returned to Las Vegas I would stay either at Paris, Bellagio or Casears as in my opinion they are in the best location. The reception area is extremely nice as is the shopping area and Cafe/restaurants. We had a room on the 15th floor overlooking the dancing fountains at the Bellagio. The room had 2 queen beds and although not overly large was really clean and perfectly adequate for the time we spent in it. The Bathroom was lovely with the separate Bath and Shower which was lovely and powerful and really woke you in in the morning. Now to the staff - very mixed there but I suppose they deal with so many guests and like everywhere you are bound to get good and bad. On the whole the staff were courteous and I only experienced one lady on reception who was offhand so I would again put this as a positive. The hotel in my opinion is well worth a visit and with all the touches is very parisian ie the Eiffel tower etc and I could honestly say I would stay again and my fussy teenagers were very enthusiastic so again a major plus there.", "Date": "January 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "White Plains, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat Room Only.......\u201d", "Author": "Teach1977", "ReviewID": "UR4312224", "Content": "Our room was lovely, the bathroom big and had a big mirror.

But my husband and I had a very terrible experience which we felt was due to the fact that we are Asians. It didn't matter that we are Asian Americans, just the fact that we were not Caucasian that this one particular server singled us out to abuse us. Please read about our experience at the Cafe Ile St. Louis: Tonight, December 29, 2005, my husband and I had a very upsetting and unpleasant experience at Paris's Ile St. Louis cafe. We were seated on the patio and waited for almost 15 minutes with menus in hand waiting for our server. In the meantime, another table was seated and waited on by a server. A Filipino busboy came by and asked us if we were helped yet and when we said 'No' he went to get our server. Our server asked what we wanted to drink and after our request for a particular mineral water was not available, we opted to order two Pepsi's. The busboy came by about five minutes later and told my husband in confidence that the Pepsi was flat and so we were preparing to inform our server of another drink when he came back to us. Another 15 minutes went by and our server produced no drink order nor came by to check on us. In the meantime, we noticed that another table was seated and said server had gotten their drink orders and was proceeding to take their meal orders. I was livid at this point and my husband urged me to calm down and wait thinking our server would bring our drinks at any minute. I told my husband I did not believe that was so as he got the drinks for the other table whose patrons were seated long after we were. In fact, we felt very self-conscious as we were seated on the side but still in full view of other diners and we were the only patrons who were being ignored! In any event, after the server didn't acknowledge my signal he came over after I called out. I asked why he did not come over as he saw me signal to him. He proceeded to argue with me and insisted he did not see me. Clearly he did and my husband noticed that he turned his face after I signaled to him. I was more upset at this point due to his bad attitude. We questioned him about our drinks order. He was haughty and presumptious by telling us that he saw us speaking to the busboy and assumed he told us that the Pepsi machine was broken. In my husband and my opinion it is the server's duty to inform the patrons of any problems regardless of the fact that the busboy brings out the drinks. By now my husband and I were very very upset and decided that the server was singling us out for whatever reason. The bottom line was that he refused to serve us. We decided that we would not sit there and take that type of abuse and pay for it. Therefore, we got up and proceeded to walk out. The server followed us and shouted to us that if we wanted to speak to his manager he would get him. My husband felt that he was challenging us so we decided to speak to the manager and told him our story. Mark, the manager, apologized for the rudeness of his server and made an excuse for him saying that the server was just coming on shift as if that's a good excuse for his behavior towards us. We said that's not right. The manager said he would be sure we were treated well, but we declined as we were so upset that we did not feel like eating again. We mentioned to the manager that perhaps the server was discriminating us due to our race. We are Asian. It was very presumptious of him to think that the busboy, an Asian, would tell us of any problems. That is a server's job, not a busboy's but the intonation is that Asian to Asian we were speaking to each other. My husband and I feel that the server is prejudiced although the manager claims racial discrimination was not the cause. Whatever the reason-racial discrimination or a bad day-gives no server to treat patrons in the shabby way that this server treated us. As I told the manager, we have travelled to Europe and to other countries and we have never been treated so shabbily before. Ironically I've been to France many times and know that the French are thought of to be stereotypically rude. But we have never been treated rudely there, but we come home to the States and on a visit to Vegas we get treated the same way as how Americans claim the French treat them: rude!

The Deluxe room (queen beds) was very good - with an excellent bathroom - although it lacked a fridge and complimentary tea/coffee making facilities: nothing is free in Las Vegas but we thought this was cheap; room service is just plain extortionate so forget it and drink water. Don't open the mini bar which clocks up what you move after 45 seconds at ludicrous prices. In general, don't go to Las Vegas if you want value for money because you have to pay through the nose for everything; the Paris is no exception. (The hotels don't compete on price, they have formed a cartel and prices are artificially high. That is a given!) As for the Paris, the breakfast buffet at the The Village was very good indeed at $12.50 per person such that we ate there regularly. However, the dinner buffet in the same location was poor - don't bother, there are many alternatives elsewhere. The Proven\u00e7al, with opera singing waiters, was good and very enjoyable unlike Mon Ami Gabi, the bistro at the front of the hotel, which had staff ranging from a typical American over-zealous fawning, to plain arrogance: it appears that we were privileged to be allowed to pay to eat in their establishment. It is also essential during your meal there to work out which member of staff you are allowed to ask for the check, because if you ask the wrong one, wait for the sarcastic reposte - you will not get the check until you you find 'your' waiter, notwithstanding that he disappears for long periods. For an excellent meal, with superb service, try the Cafe Ballagio across the street. Would we stay there again? Definitely yes, at the right price, as a good room is a good room! Would we eat there again? Only breakfast!

The rooms are elegant and tastefully decorated, and the casino and shops are ok. However, the food was a disappointment. There are very few choices, especially for breakfast. Everything was very expensive, there were no value alternatives. So if you stay there, expect to spend at least $10-20 per person extra each day for breakfast. (unless you go to another hotel for breakfast, but that requires a lot of walking time!) All the food is also French, generally speaking. Other hotel/casinos offer many varied selections. The Aladdin next door to us had Tex-mex, PF Changs, Italian food, etc. We would've liked more variety in the dining establishments. My biggest disappointment was some of the employees' attitudes towards children. I would NOT recommend staying here with kids. We went to meet up with my brother-in-law and his family - it was our family reunion for this year. We had 2 two year olds with us on the trip. Some of the staff were friendly and smiling at the kids (who were very well behaved), but unfortunately there were many employees at the Paris who were down right rude to us and the children. One employee (at a cafe) nearly knocked me and my child over trying to get by (even though I was trying to get out of her way), and at the casual restaurant we went to for lunch, they were rude to the kids. They also offered NO kids menu whatsoever. That is a clear indication to me that they do not really want children there in the first place. I cannot excuse rudeness from an employee at any level, regardless of whether it is directed toward a child or an adult.

The checkin procedure was fine---we were offered an upgraded room for $89/night. We thought we'd look at the room before making a decision and decided that the regular room was fine....although if you want to splurge, the suite was really awesome with a large jacuzzi tub and nice sitting area. We also enjoyed the very nice pool area and found the poolside service personable and efficient.

I stayed in a room on the 28th floor, a standard room with nice enough decor - nothing spectacular - the bathroom was lovely, however. I could have stayed forever, just to eat. The $12 Village Buffet breakfast (with 99cent Bloody Mary's before 10AM) was like a dream. Crepe, Omelette chefs on standby - puffed pastry filled with crab, breakfast meats of all kinds, quiche, eggs, fruits. Ate at the Les Artistes Steakhouse Friday - Prawns, filet mignon, and the most beautiful dark chocolate shelled chocolate and white chocolate mousse demi-mound, with dark chocolate ribbons decorating the top and edible gold confetti. Mon Ami Gabi on Saturday night with a poached Salmon in a citrus broth, crabcake appetizer in creamy pepper sauce, and the most exquisite creme brulee. And I noticed that each and every waiter was absolutely top notch, personable, and, in some cases, down right delightful. Even our Buffet wait person was pure 'full service,' for a serve yourself restaurant. She was so very personable and made us feel very special. The Wait Staff at the Les Artiste worked seamlessly waiting on our large pre-wedding dinner party. It was hectic, but they were cool - right there when you needed them and a GQ model of a waiter was particularly kind and attentive to my tired, weepy young neice who just wanted French Fries. He checked on her several times. At the Mon Ami Gabi, my female waiter hooked me up with a delicious Pina Colada with a silver server filled with extra whipped cream. Our primary waiter, a handsome dark-eyed, dark-haired man, was super. When I commented that he was \"wonderful,\" he said: \"when you love your job, you're wonderful. I love my job.\" I wish I had hugged each and every wait staff employee at the Paris. They made every delicious meal even more spectacular and special. The creperie was excellent as I fulfilled an Ohioan's unfulfilled memories of spongey, melt in your mouth French crepes, loaded with blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, strawberry, topped with chantilly cream. My cocktail of choice on the slots floor - (aside: boy I miss the machines that would jangle out coin winnings - the ticket system takes thrill out of it.) I lost pitifully, but was content feeling I evened out with Pina Coladas gratis - heaven help me - topped with real whipped cream. At the Paris, a granola bar, cereal, and Lean Cuisine girl died and went to milkfat heaven. The Paris is worth the trip for the amazing cuisine and the excellent, excellent service. And it is a beautiful casino capturing the charm of ala Francais with faux cobblestone and charming French building fronts. The domed 'sky' is always blue with some clouds - it's always a feel of France right before sunset. Amazing. Wasn't knocked out by the registry workers - a few were sourfaced and one woman directed my family to the hard to find end of the line with no joie de vivre whatsoever. The Paris may want to have wait staff train the desk staff on personality and gentile customer service. The average rooms, the uncheerful checker-inners (mostly applied to the unsmiling, impatient seeming female), take one star away from review.

We used the monorail system (from the Bally's station)a few times to go north, and that's convenient. We got our airline boarding passes online the night before we left and had them faxed for no charge to the front desk.

I played the horses in the Sportsbook. It was probably the only non-crowded spot in the hotel. I was always able to get a table with a private TV. Not enough cocktail waitresses but the drinks were strong and you don't have to ask for those pesky drink tickets. Plenty of screens and helpful cashiers.

We booked through their website and got a room with two beds. It looks exactly as advertised (I've stayed at places that don't look anything like what's posted so I appreciate it when it's near or exactly the same as photographed). The AC wasn't very strong but it got the job done. The pillows are very small and lumpy but it didn't bother us so much since we were bone tired when we went to bed. The water pressure at the Paris hotel is fabulous! After staying at one too many hotels with the dinky water saver shower heads we really appreciated the powerful stream of water (especially great after a LONG drive). We got to the hotel very early (3AM!) and we couldn't check in until 11AM so we walked around the strip area. Since it was the holiday weekend there were quite a few crazy people outside (Las Vegas really doesn't sleep!). I won't go into what we saw but let's just say that it doesn't hurt to be aware of your surroundings. After our long car ride it did feel very nice to stretch our legs and Vegas was still very warm so early in the morning so it was an interesting walk. We heard the buffet at Paris was very good so we tried the breakfast buffet and I'd rate it just slightly above average. Service was good, they cleared our plates quickly and got us our drinks/refills promptly. I guess I'm just spoiled as I've been to Paris, France and the food just wasn't the same/up to par. I'm a big fan of crepes and found these to be just \"OK.\" The breads were ok, nothing to write home about. The eggs were nasty and the eggs benedict was just blah. The english muffin was very hard so it made chewing a chore. I did enjoy the waffles, they tasted like cakes and topped with fresh fruit and whipping cream it was devine-I'm just sad I didn't try it first and was too full to get seconds! Overall, it was an enjoyable buffet, just not the BEST as I've read here and other places. Check-in went smoothly. I called their Ambassador hot-line at 8AM and was able to jump the line (after finding the manager) during check-in at 11AM. I highly recommend you call the Ambassador hot-line 2 hours before you arrive to expediate check-in as the line is a bear! On the second night, we tried the Mon Ami Gabi restaurant and found it very good. I like the carrot thing (I think that's what it is) they give you with the bread! Their Cosmo is actually very delicious (although I love the one from Morton's more.) We ordered the shrimp appetizer on the recommendation of our server (forgot the name of the dish) and it was actually just OK, we don't really recommend it. For entrees: I had the steak with peppercorns and my sister had the lamb both were very good. We didn't try their dessert as we were too full. I'd give this restaurant a B+. The casino: I don't usually gamble as I go to Vegas for the shows and shopping but I did donate $100 to the bank of Paris. Didn't win anything here but I did win at the Wynn and Bellagio.

Unfortunately the suite was nothing fabulous and we decided to wait for a standard king instead. We did not have to wait long when we went back down to reception...we were given a corner king with a wonderful view immediately! This room was larger than a standard room and we had windows all around! It was just magnificent! We opted for room service for most of our mornings and we were glad that we did. As you know - you can't go anywhere in Vegas without it costing a fortune for food, so we were very happy that their $12 European Pastry Basket included 6 croissants and a whole pot of coffee and a large orange juice! It was all we needed to start the day, and at $6 a person - you can't go wrong. Since we were on East Coast time and we were up at 5 am, we opted to take morning swims when the pool opened at 8am and the pool was hardly occupied at that time. Dry cleaning was picked up and dropped off in a timely manner and was pretty reasonable. The casino is not as sprawling as the Bellagio across the street, but we still managed to win! Valet service is lightning fast and the hotel has put in wonderful misters so that you stay nice and cool while you wait.

However, the hotel itself has really gone down. The customer service is extremely poor & the hotel rooms are in desperate need of renovations. We and several other couples checked in on April 28th. A few months before I had made arrangements, through Paris's consigner, for the wedding couple, some guests and ouselves to be picked up at the airport by a stretch limo with flowers for all the ladies and champagne for all. I re- confirmed the reservations and instructions a few days before leaving with the consigner and the limo company. When we arrived at the baggage pick up the chauffeur was waiting and pulled me aside to tell me that she had just gotten the call and had just arrived herself, she didn't have time to pick up the requested items. She wanted to stop at the flower machine in the airport and the at a liquor store with all of us in the limo I said no. The limo looked like it needed a good cleaning and the radio and windows didn't work. When we told the Paris consigner about this we were told that they would get back to us, we stopped back down 3 days later because no one had gotten back to us. We were told that we would be receiving a refund, we are still waiting for this to happen. We did, just the parents of the bride, get a free ride back to the airport. The room we had was old, shabby and in need of a good cleaning. The maid of honors room had a wet carpet and I mean the entire carpet was drenched, actually the whole room should have been hosed down it was so bad. The parents of the groom had a room where the air conditioning didn't work. When a repariman finally came he told them that the hotel had changed some of the cooling systems and they weren't working properly. He told them to open their windows because he couldn't fix the air. It was moth season and the hotel had signs on the desks warning guests not to open their windows. It got so hot in their room they didn't have a choice so at 3:00 in the morning they were chasing moths around their room. They had complained, they even went down to the front desk and they were told Oh Well there is nothing we can do for you. They didn't even offer to comp some of there stay.

We stayed at Paris for four nights and had a wonderful experience. Upon arrival at 10:30pm, we waited only a short time in line to check. After reading many other reviews on this site, I decided to try to get a room upgrade since we had only booked to stay in a standard room originally. First, I politely told the clerk that it was my mother's birthday (78 years young!) and asked if it was possible to be upgraded to a room with a view of the Bellagio fountains. She quickly said that it was not possible... that they did not do that. I told her that this was our first time in Vegas and that I was not really sure how things \"worked \"there. I then offered her a $20.00 tip adding that I read if one tips, one can often times get upgraded to a nicer room. She said she would check with her manager. She left and returned after a few minutes and said that she could indeed upgrade us to a room with a fountain view. I offered her the $20.00 but she graciously refused to accept it saying, \"It is your mother's birthday\". So... we got our upgrade for free. We did not gamble at the Paris. We opted for only playing the slot machines at places like Slots of Fun & The Flamingo and had pretty good luck in both places. We had dinner at the Steak House in Paris... can not remember the name but it was pretty expensive.... $38.00 for a steak, $8.00 for a side of asparagus and $7.00 for a side of french fries. The steak was very large and delicious but I would have been just as pleased eating at the Outback Steakhouse right up the street. We also ate dinner one evening at the Buffet which was wonderful for $24.95. It was worth every penny. A wonderful variety and very yummy! The sheets on the beds were a little rough but I did not find them as horrible as other reviews I have read on the site. The hotel itself was really beautiful and it was nice not to have to walk too far from the check-in desk to the elevators. By the way, we rented a little scooter for my mother and this really added to her enjoyment. She could aget round so easily without tiring out. We went up and down the strip numerous times over our four days there and she had a blast... I got lots of exercise, needless to say. The only other thing I will mention is that we saw the Anthony Cool hypnotist show at Paris. Now, the adverse for his show did say \"raw and uncensored\". I guess I should have realized what that really meant in Vegas. The show started out pretty funny but turned quite vulgar toward the middle and end. This guy actually had people on stage acting like they were --- a chair including my mother. She went on stage and I never, ever would have let her do that had I know what the Anthony guy would have these volunteers doing!!! I felt so humiliated for her. I wanted to complain but they did warn us that the show would be racey. I blamed myself and fortunately my mother did not really remember too much. She asked what she did with the chair and I told her that she had been dancing with it. It was pretty embarressing. Next time, we go to Vegas, I will have the good sense not to book any show that claims to be \"raw & uncensored\". I hope this review is helpful to others.

Again, we were accommodated nicely with an early check-in and decided to just take whatever room we were given. Unfortunately we didn't get the Bellagio water view this time and while views aren't important to me, I have to admit to feeling somewhat miffed when the only view was a concrete barrier in front of our window. But again, I got over it quickly as I was once again flying out the door for more gambling and shopping. Paris is simply beautiful....from the moment you walk onto the cobblestone walkways, to the nice furnishings in the room. Having said this, I quickly remembered the negatives from last year's visit.....the extremely bad acoustics that allows you to hear everything around you - other rooms and hallways. The other negative is not being allowed to empty the mini-refrig. They have built in sensors that if you even move one item, it is instantly changed to your room via computer. But the bathroom is to die for with separate tub and shower....wonderful for 3 women traveling together. We could have spent every morning between the bakery and crepe places, but forced ourselves to partake in other meals such as the steak special after 11 pm. The dualing piano guys along the path towards Bally's are not to be missed....a great way to pull up a seat and enjoy a drink. Once again, video keno was tight and in the case of Paris, they are hard to find many. I much prefer to spend my gambling time at the hotels that I stay in, so this is a concern over the long term as I'm sure free visits aren't in the future if I don't gamble much there. Side trips to casinos were Aladdin which was a new discovery for me and one that I hope to return to over and over (read: they had hundreds of video keno). Tried roulette for the first time on this trip and enjoyed the friendly tables where we got to joke around with people. Shopping was enjoyed at Wynn, Aladdin, Venetian and an incredible cigar shop across from The Stardust in a little strip mall. 4 older cuban men sit there and hand roll them in front of you. Much better prices then what we were finding in shops like at the Venetian (although it was kind of cool to look at what a $300 cigar was).

From the moment we arrived, we felt as though we were actually in Paris, France! The hotel's main entrance takes you through their beautiful casino and gives you the feeling of strolling through the streets of Paris. The hotel was sparkling clean, with very impressive interior decor. The staff couldn't have been friendlier - from their front desk and concierge staff to their chambermaids and casino personnel! Our rooms were located on the concierge floor and had wonderful views of the Las Vegas strip and Bellagio fountains. The Bellagio fountains are certainly spectacular to observe. However, just make sure you're not someone who likes to go to sleep before midnight, because if you are in a room that faces the strip, the Bellagio fountains' sound show will keep you awake until midnight. But hey, who goes to bed in Las Vegas before midnight, anyway?? I never left the casinos before 1:00am and always felt like I was leaving early! It amazed me to see how busy the casinos were all night long! We ate meals in two of Paris Las Vegas' restaurants, Mon Ami Gabi and Ortanique - and enjoyed our experiences in both. We also ate delicious crepes from their creperie located off the lobby and shops area. We found the hotel to be ideally situated in the middle of the strip - making it very easy to go back and forth between hotels. Even though Las Vegas has a lot of spectacular hotels, we felt as though we'd made a great choice by picking Paris! Their pool and pool deck are nice and spacious, however, we never took the time to take a swim. We were a bit disappointed that it cost $25 per day to use the hotel's fitness center (even if you only wanted to use a treadmill for 20 minutes!!). However, this must be the case at all of the Vegas hotels because the Mirage charged a similar daily fee for use of their fitness center when I stayed there a year and a half ago. If you want to jog, you're probably better off following the hotel's suggested Las Vegas strip jogging routes (which are listed in the room guest directories). We highly recommend the Paris hotel based on their high level of service, variety of excellent restaurants, spacious/comfortable accommodations (our rooms had beautifully tiled bathrooms and lots of amenities) and their sparkling clean casino & shops. We'll definitely stay at Paris Las Vegas again. We saw a number of evening shows during our stay (the Danny Gans show at the Mirage, Celine Dion's show and the Rita Rudner comedy show at New York New York). All of us agreed that the Danny Gans show was the most entertaining! (the guy is just incredible with the variety of voices and impersonations he displays). Celine Dion is obviously an unbelievable singer, however, her background characters/dancers were a little bizarre (what's up with the yellow uniformed bellboy and white ghost like characters that seemed to appear in every scene??). Rita Rudner was funny and did a great job in talking about relationships between men & women (although she was squeaky clean with her language and subject matter - I would have preferred her comedy routine be a little more risque, however, the others in my group really liked her show). We were amazed at how well the city of Las Vegas (especially the airport and Southwest Airlines in particular) handle such a large number of visitors day in and day out! Everything seems to run like clockwork! There were people everywhere...if you don't like crowds, Vegas may not be for you - however, its definitely a fun place to spend a few days (and dollars!!!).

I had a great rasberry or apricot puff and coffee every day. Dinner (at the restaurant with a \"B\" like Boulanger or something) was very tastey and well-presented. The fish was melt-in-your-mouth good...And the bread with the meal was terrific. I ate at Spago (in Ceasers) on the next night, but I found the food and atmosphere much better (and more relaxing) at the Paris hotel restaurant.

ROOM: The room was attractive and had a nice marble bathroom with a separate shower and bath. The bathroom never got steamy after a shower because of the unique design. When you close the shower door, the steam is trapped in the shower stall so the mirror stays clear and you can put on make-up or whatever. LOCATION: As everyone has said, the location is great.

All in all, it was an enjoyable experience with only one major problem which I'll mention at the end. First, the room: we stayed for two nights and their rooms are excellent. We had no complaints about the maid service--everything was clean. Our room didn't have much of a view (facing the back and the other part of the hotel), but the room was very nicely appointed, and the bathroom was great. Elevators were fine (and we were on a high floor). In terms of amenities, I can only think of two hotels that were more luxurious in which I've stayed, and they were both more than the $165/night I spent at Paris. Dining: We ate one night at Les Artistes Steakhouse, and it was excellent. This was our Valentine's Day dinner, and it certainly fit the billing with a tasty meal in an elegant surrounding. The waitstaff was completely professional. Don't expect a bargain here, but it certain was a nice experience. We also ate at the more casual and affordable Le Provencal. The ambiance is country French. The food is pretty much Northern Italian, which I prefer to French anyway. Good prices and the service was very friendly, though perhaps a little too kitschy with the singing waiters (it wasn't as obnoxious or silly as you might think, though). Also, Le Creperie had excellent crepes, however there could be quite a wait at times. Atmosphere and Casino: overall, we were pleased. The mood with the cobblestone streets and false sky are pleasant, and while obviously not France, not as tacky as one might imagine. As others have said, at certain times of the day, the casino area can get very crowded and feel a little too rushed (especially in the part of the casino between the lobby and the elevators). I did an hour or two of $10, single deck blackjack one night and found the dealers cool--they dealt with the spirited, largely younger, male (myself included) table in which I sat with appropriate machismo. Cocktail waitresses...some were prompt, others not. All were polite, though, and their French bellhop outfits are a nice touch. I know this is probably obvious, but if you actually prefer alcohol in your drinks, stick with beer or other unwaterable drinks. I think my Tom Collinses were lemonade with a cherry. Now for the complaint: it took--no exaggeration--an hour and a half to check-in. FYI, we checked in around 2-3pm on a Sunday. The woman we dealt with when we finally got to the check-in was efficient and polite, but the line was an unbelievable 90 minutes long. My girlfriend didn't wait in the line with me, but because we had nowhere to put the bags, she still had to sit with them on the floor (can't take a chair in the casino and the three in the lobby were obviously already taken). The shock in most people's faces upon seeing the hundreds of people waiting in line was a downer. I hope this problem will be remedied.

We based our fairly high expectations of the property on the insightful commentary of other TripAdvisors, and are pleased to say that we were not disappointed. This hotel really does have it all. Location means a very great deal in Las Vegas, and it would be difficult to do much better than the Paris Hotel. Everything on \"the Strip\" is within walking distance, but the Bally's/Paris monorail station is also very convenient if your feet are tired, or you need to get somewhere in a hurry. It's also a definite plus that the property fronts on the Bellagio fountains; with a little bit of planning, you can get some spectacular views. We managed to avoid almost all of the \"problems\" that some reviewers have noted; forewarned is forearmed. Definitely ask about Paris's \"Ambassador Checkin\" program when you make your reservations. In our case, calling ahead not only helped us avoid the lines at checkin, but also let us \"block\" one of the hotel's better rooms long before other guests arrived. We asked for, and received, a Premier View room on the northwest corner of the 26th floor. (We didn't try the $20 tip idea; asking nicely seemed to be enough. We also can't speak to criticisms of the porters, since all we had with us was hand luggage.) All of the staff members we ran into were extremely helpful and friendly. The room itself was huge, quiet and lavishly-appointed. We had two windows, each with its own spectacular view of the south \"strip\" and Bellagio fountains. (It would be impossible to put a price on those views. Unbelievable.) Housekeeping, as some reviewers have noted, was uneven - odd in what is otherwise a four-star hotel. We mentioned the fact to the front desk on the first day, and had terrific service (new sheets, evening turndowns) for the remainder of our stay. Paris is a busy place, its intimate surroundings a bit cramped in the middle of the day. To truly appreciate the atmosphere, try sauntering through the Boulevard shops early in the morning, or in the evening, when crowds are at a minimum. We never had to wait in line, though, even for the popular \"Champagne Brunch\" on Sunday. (We asked for a buffet pass from one of the casino hosts, before we'd even set foot in the casino, and breezed right through.) We signed up for Paris's \"Connection Card\" slot club, even though we don't gamble, because they rebate a percentage of your hotel expenses as a \"comp\". (Check the program details.) My wife thoroughly enjoyed the Mandara Spa: pampering at a price. We had a similar impression of our farewell dinner at Paris's Mon Ami Gabi restaurant, where the service was impeccable and the food delicious. (We decided not to try the Eiffel Tower restaurant, again based on previous reviews. We had a better view from our room, anyway.) The regional variety of foods at le Village Buffet was impressive, though, at least for breakfast, we liked the buffet at the Bellagio better. (Again, there's a real advantage in being so centrally located; you can easily shop around.) The pastries at Lenotre were terrific. As with a good many things in Las Vegas, there's a certain artificiality to the hotel's theme; if you're interested in a truly Parisian experience, then France is the place to go. Still, if you're looking for comfortable accommodations in the heart of the Vegas strip, you could certainly do worse than the Paris Hotel.", "Date": "April 7, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hayward, CA", "Title": "\u201cLoved Our Time at Paris\u201d", "Author": "zbeth", "ReviewID": "UR3341109", "Content": "We decided to go to the Paris Hotel for the Slot Tournament and boy did we have fun.

As well, waitresses in the bars and lounges took anywhere up to 20 minutes before they\u2019d come and take an order.

The ability for staff in the buffet to clean tables quickly and re-sit new customers at an empty table was mind blowingly inept.

If they have one, they'll give it to you! It's nice to then tip the clerk, but not required. We asked for an upgrade to a Premier View room (facing the Bellagio fountains) and got it! Then they APOLOGIZED (I love it) that the upgrade room wouldn't be available until our second night. No problem! The room they put us in the first night was a smoking 2-Queens instead of a non-smoking King (we arrived late and it is what they had left). When I said I couldn't stay in the room because of the smell, the moved us to a SUITE ROOM! I had to laugh when they said we could have the room, but only for one night - like I would complain! The suite room was huge with a jacuzzi tub and wonderful, but I liked our Premier View room even better! Not a suite, but large and spacious with an awesome view.

After a long night, and some car problems, at 7AM, my boyfriend had asked if we could check in. At first, it wasn't allow, however, after my boyfriend had explained that we went into car problems, the man said the only room that is available was a smoking room. We had a room on the 20th floor, unfortunately I wanted a room that was facing on the Strip. However, getting a room at 7AM is better than nothing. There were some problems with the faucet, it makes noise when you turn on the faucet. We had to turned on the A/C in order to let the smoke flow out. Lots of smokers in the casino area. Most of the food in the casino were quite expensive. The location of this wasn't bad either, center of everything. There were 5 Chinese channels on TV. Paid $99+ taxes and fees for the stay. NOT BAD AT ALL! Much better than NYNY I would say! A lot of the theme really reminds me of Paris, from the cobblestone on the floor to the shops. The Eiffel Tower looks like the one in Paris, as well.

That seems a bit unfair to me. I stayed at the Paris in January. It was my first visit to Vegas and my husband and I loved both the hotel and the resort. The Paris is centrally placed and within easy walking distance of much of the Strip. The hotel itself is huge, so it is fair to expect that personal service is going to be a bit lacking, but I must say that I found all members of staff that I spoke to polite and helpful, from desk to buffet to room service. We booked in at the airport, and caught a shuttle bus to the Paris - only about a ten minute trip - and went straight to our room on arrival. There were some lines at the reception desk so we saved some time there. The room itself was large and clean, our beds were changed every three days and the bathroom was spotless, with loads of clean towels and new toiletries each day. The bathroom was spacious, with a seperate shower and bath. The casino is large but divided by different elements, eg the legs of the Eiffel Tower, fountains, a bridge, so it doesn't seem overwhelming. The cheapest black-jack table we found was $10 so we went two doors down to the Barbary Coast and listened to Big Elvis while we played which was fun. The buffet at the Paris is good value, especially breakfast and lunch, and so is the buffet at the Bellagio across the road. It is worth taking the trip up the Eiffel Tower - you can see and hear the fountains at the Bellagio and have a really good view of the Strip - in my opinion better than from the Stratosphere which is just too high up and far away to see anything. There are only a few shops in the Paris but there is a really good shopping mall next door at the Aladdin which is worth a visit. To visit the hotels and attractions further away we caught a bus - you can get the 301 or 302, they both travel the length of the strip, southbound from outside the Bellagio southern entrance, and northbound from outside Aladdin or Flamingo. The only difference is that the 302 is an express bus so only makes a few stops - quicker but make sure it's stopping near where you need to be. It costs $5 for a 24hour pass which is really good value as a single trip is $3.

I am in the travel business so maybe I'm a little pickier than most. The Paris is a nice hotel but it does not deserve the 4 diamond rating they rave about. Our troubles started right in the begining. I reserved a room with two double beds and even checked in from home. Upon my arrival, I was told there weren't any rooms left with two double beds. I held this at least four months in advance so I was not happy. They said the next day they could get me that type of room and for the time being, I would have a room with a roll away. I was fine with that and I was told a roll away would be sent right up. I flew in from the east cost and arrived at the hotel 1:30 a.m. which was 4:30 a.m. to my body. To make a long story short, it took an hour to get that roll away. When I called down to see what was going on, I told them I flew all night and it was almost 6 a.m. my time. The girl I spoke to said to me \"I'm up all night all the time\". It was not the answer I was looking for. I did get my new room and they did give a room with a very nice view of the strip. TAll was not good, the shower was never cleaned and there was a clump of someone's hair in the drain. It was disgusting and not something I would expect at a \"4 diamond\" property. I was embarassed to compain again becuase it's not my nature but it was one bad thing after another. The maid service was terrible. The 2nd room we were given had an old Cheeto on the floor from another guest. I left it there to see if it would ever be picked up. Two days, still there....I decided to move it out to make it very easy to see. Still it was not thrown out. I went to the maid to ask if she vacumed, she said she did. I asked her if she was sure, and she started to heistate and say I'm not sure, and that she had 10 checkout that day. That rug was NEVER vacumed. She was worried I would get her in trouble but I never said anything or complained about it. The pulbic areas are nice with a great location. I enjoyed the restaurants and the mall they have.

Next option, stay nearby. Our two choices were Bally's or Paris. Through my wife's influence, we decided to stay at Paris. Unfortunatley, the Bellagio fountain shows were cancelled this time due to high winds and rain so I won't hold that against Paris. Valet: Excellent. No problem with our car and getting all our luggage up to our room. When we checked out, one of our paper bags broke. They packed everything in new bags and still got all our stuff to us just in time for our car to arrive. This was during the peak checkout time around 11:30pm! Check In/Check Out: Good. About a 8-10 minute wait. Everything went smoothly. Room: OK - but all they had was either single bed rooms facing the rear. The only double bed room they had was a handicapped room. I just assumed this would mean there would be bars on the toilet, but what I didn't realize was that it also meant NO BATH. Fine with me, not good with my wife. Nice marble bathroom just like the pictures. Noise was not a problem. Ice plentiful. Good cleaning staff. Our cleaning lady left her phone number on a note. That was a first and I didn't know what to make of it. Was it a mistake? Did she want a date? or was it great service to have a direct line to someone in case we forget or lose something in our room. Gambling and Connections Card: This was the first time for me to use any casino's card and I just can't believe I never took advantage of these before. For several hours of 5 cent multislot, 25cent poker/slot gambling, I could get $28 off my dinner + 2 Paris shirts (comps), $14 dollars off my hotel bill (cashback). I got a coupon printed out at the Connections Card stand before using the $28 comps at the buffet. I don't think cashier at the restaurants/bars/shows, etc. can deal with comps with just your card only. I liked gambling at Bally's better because their slot and poker machines seemed to be more interesting and the Casino was easier to navigate than Paris. Crowd: The hotel was VERY crowded. I don't know if this was because it was raining outside or the popularity of the hotel, but it was pretty bad. There were major lines at all the restaurants and after waiting in line at the buffet around 5:30pm, they just gave us a ticket for a 9:00pm reservation!! For me, the casino was too crowded and smokey to gamble during the day. Food: Paris Buffet - Ok and well priced, but I prefer the Bellagio and Rio buffets instead. We ate a few sandwiches & pastas at some cafe's, but they were just so-so. The desserts were great, but too many people so we couldn't find a table for about 10 minutes and was just stuck walking around with our latte and dessert dish!

Staff was friendly and professional -- they made us feel like they appreciate our business, and genuinely want us to enjoy our stay. The ornate pastries from the sweets shop are amazing, affordable and addictive. So are the crepes from La Creperie. All the food/dining at Paris seemed high quality. We rode to the top of the Eiffel Tower at night, which was a unique experience and worth the money (especially since we were given a 2-for-1 pass upon check-in). We also checked out the Eiffel Tower lounge/restaurant, although we didn't actually eat there. It was cozy and elegant, with good service at the bar -- maybe we'll make reservations to eat there next trip. The slots club worked out well for us. We're not heavy gamblers (typical session is betting $20-40 in 30-45 minutes at the 5-cent poker slots), but we earned enough points to get 3 souvenir t-shirts and a $15 credit toward our room bill. The rooms were slightly larger and more upscale than those at the Monte Carlo. I never thought I'd be willing to pay extra for a \"premium view\" room, and in this case we got lucky because they gave it to us for free, but our view across to the Bellagio fountains was breathtaking. I really would be willing to pay extra for it during future stays. We never heard much noise coming from other adjacent rooms, so either our floor was deserted, or they've got some pretty good insulation in the walls. I read mixed reviews about the self-parking, but it seemed fine to us. You don't have to walk through the casino to get to the rooms. My only nitpicky complaints about our stay: the shower head was a little clogged, so it made a really loud hissing noise; the cups in the room were the cheap disposable kind like you'd find in a Motel 6 (in the Monte Carlo, I believe they are real glass); room service trays and other misc. items seem to linger in the hallways for nearly an entire day before being picked up; only suites get conditioner -- regular rooms just get a shampoo/conditioner 2-in-1 shampoo (my fiancee requested conditioner from housekeeping and they gave her some).

The overhead ceiling painted like the sky right down to the fluffy clouds helped with an open air feeling, was not smoky or stuffy at all. We also felt very safe in the casino, the hallways and all other areas of this beautiful hotel. My husband would not have had a problem with me playing the slots late at night by myself either, as there was no fear that I would have been bothered or harassed by anyone as there was security around as well also.

The lines were long at 12:30 so this saved a lot of time. I had mentioned to the person I spoke with on the phone that we were celebrating a birthday and they were wonderful enough to upgrade both of our rooms to a premium view rooms and one was even a mini suite! We looked out over the pools and the Eiffel Tower and the mini suite had a spectacular 25th floor view of the Bellagio fountains. I didn't hear french music in the elevators so I don't know what that complaint is about, but the great part of the elevators is how fast they arrive when you push the buttons compared to other hotels. The staff was all wonderful - every employee we encountered was helpful and friendly. We ate at the French Bistro the first night and food was wonderful. Our travel companions didn't want to sit outside because it was hot, so we had a table next to the window but found out later they blow cold air on the outdoor tables so we really missed a great chance to dine out doors and do some great people watching while waiting for the fountains to go off. Had one breakfast at the Buffet, which was also very good. The other couple really liked the Bally's Buffet and sort of insisted that we eat there for two breakfast meals and a dinner. We like to eat at different places when we travel so this was a bummer, but the food and service at the Bally's buffet was also very good. Be sure to get a comp slip or a line pass from the club card area - you can use them at Paris and Bally's and you don't have to wait in long lines which is nice when conventions have them snaking through the streets of Paris! Slots were o.k. Nobody won tons of money in our group, but I did sit next to a woman who had won two $10K jackpots and one $2K jackpot in an hour. We were used to Bally's slots being looser and were disappointed at our experience the one night we gambled there so returned to Paris and managed to get back what we had lost. We walked most of the strip and our travel companions had never been to Vegas so we tried to see everything we could in a short amount of time. They thought we had picked the best hotel of all after a day of walking......we agreed. Make sure to show your casino slot card in the shops affiliated with the card - there is a 10% discount. We bought several breakable items and they were kind enough to wrap them securely with bubble wrap so they'd make the trip home safely. We did not go to the pool, but viewed things from our windows above. It gets very crowded and people begin staking out premium chairs early it seems. Health club is an extra charge, but other guests commented that it was good. We didn't try it - I think that when I pay that much for a hotel, I should be able to work out for free so it's just my attitude about it. My only complaint about the hotel was the lack of coffee makers in the room. The lines for coffee at the shops were VERY LONG. I did take a one cup coffee maker for my husband to use that got us by but it took up a lot of room in my suitcase. If they won't put coffee makers in the room to get you to come down to the casino and gamble, it would be nice if they had more options for buying coffee so the lines weren't so long.

The atmosphere is lovely, the food is incredibly good in all areas and the staff are trained very well in their use of French responses. It may seem a bit bizarre that guests are addressed as 'Madame' or 'Monsieur' and you are greeted with 'Bonjour' and 'Merci' when you are in the middle of the Nevada desert but the whole theme is carried off extremely well and is all done with warmth and good humour. The breakfast buffet and cafe are fantastic - I've never in my life seen such a good selection of high quality food - and that includes many trips to France! I had a large room overlooking the Bellagio fountains which was worth every penny I paid and also had the good fortune to have the special deal which includes access to the 31st floor and the special 'Concierge' snack facilities. This meant, effectively, that I did not need to purchase either breakfast or dinner during my stay ( I sampled the restaurants whilst staying at another hotel later on my trip) The bedroom had a lovely bathroom which was so clean that it sparkled and had a separate shower and bath and a professional type hairdryer. The slot machines in the casino were incredibly generous - interesting that they paid out most to me before breakfast each day!

We booked through Continental's vacations packages and got free flights basically, so I did not mind paying full price for our room. We did the advance check in (called from the airport before our plane took off, four hours in advance) which let us waltz right up the front of the ambassadors line and get our keys in two minutes. The crystal chandeliers in the lobby are unreal. So pretty and bright! I hate dark lobbies. Our room was on the 19th floor with views of the balloon, Aladdin roof top, MGM, Mandalay Bay, and partial strip and Bellagio. If you want a better view, ask, or go somewhere and look at the view. We did not care where we slept. The room was huge, immaculaltely clean (of course we were on a nonsmoking floor), and had nice decor (though half of the fixtures in the bathroom were gold, half were silver). The TV cabinet/armoir was huge enough to put away all of our clothes and there was a couch, chair and ottoman, desk and another chair, safe, and everything. I stayed at the Fairmont in San Francisco last year and this room at Paris was nicer, newer, bigger, and cost 1/2 as much, if that gives you perspective. We did not hear any noise whatsoever. And, we called the housekeping dept. a few times to request linen changes and they did whatever we asked without bothering us. The cleaning staff on our floor was very nice and professional too. The pool was nice and big and had plenty of space and chairs (I heard lots of complaints about this at other hotels, too bad). The cleanliness of the pool water left a little bit to be desired, but I guess that's what happens when you allow people to drink and eat right in the water if they want and you've got kids as lifeguards who never say a peep or get off their butts. The topiary garden could use a little work (TI and the Mirage has much better flowers), but the spray jets keep things cool if you park yourself right by a planter. As far as food and drink service goes, the hotel has a lot of choices. We ate at JJ's twice since it was so convenient, not too expensive, and had a variety. I got a crepe once at the creperie, it was good even at midnight. We made reservations for Mon Ami Gabi one night (don't be one of the fools who shows up at 8pm and has to wait with 100 people to get in) and it was fabulous. The best filet I've ever had. Knowledgeable staff. Did everything we asked for. If you want cheap food on the go, go downstairs to Bally's at pick up breakfast or lunch at Johnny's deli (they were so nice to us there) or pizza at Sbarro. Sure it's mall fare, but that's why it's fast and cheap. If you don't want to pay five bucks for a coke at the pool (let alone about $10 for a cocktail that would be free if you played in the casino), stop at the soda machine and get a cup of ice on your way down to the pool (there's one on each floor). It's only $2. They give out nice plastic cups everywhere (the Mirage gave us two cups for everything, they must want their name out there), so reuse them the next day. If you want a free sandwhich with your booze, go to Napoleon's for happy hour 4-7pm everyday. Also, carry your connection card everywhere. I went shopping in the Paris and Bally's shops the last day we were there and didn't have my card, and would have gotten an extra 10% off. All in all, go to Paris- it's worth it. Even my impatient husband liked it. The cobblestone brick walkway did not bother me, no one was grumpy and Parisian, and the elevator music is FINE.

Valet staff was terrific 2. Staff in general was very courteous & Friendly, better than the other hotels we visited while on the strip 3. Le Village Buffet, go for a late lunch $17.95 before 5:30pm M - Sa, and have dinner including the crab legs at the lunch price. Caution on busy days like Saturday get in line by 5pm or you may not get the lunch price. The buffet was awesome and the choices were varied including awesome desserts. Make sure you tour the buffet before you dig in. Also, the made to order crepes were delicious. 4. Le Cafe, dinner special wa superb a large cut of prime rib, crab legs, veggies and a baked spud all for $13.95. Also, try the french onion soup $5.95, it was very good. 5. The Casino, the staff was very good, helpful and if you were gaming FREE drinks were avilable from the servers making the rounds (Although at times to few). The slots weren't overly crowded like some other hotels 6. The pool is nice and spacious for a quick dip. 7. The spa is great, but pricey 8. The room which was a standard was in great shape and very nicely decorated. 9. The bathroom was beautifully decorated and super clean Cons: 1. No discount for hotel guests for spa use, discount too small for multi day use, basic use is worth about $15/day. 2. Too few servers in the casino giving out the complimentary beverages 3. The in room TV was the typical cheap model, not worthy of watching anything besides checking the news or weather 4. Fitness equipment in spa is old and one of 2 stair machines was broken, they should invest in new equipment and more cardio machines We would definitely visit this property again.

We have stayed at the Flamingo, Mirage, and the Venetian. This was our first time at the Paris and the first time I have enjoyed staying somewhere so much that I felt compelled to write about it. My husband and I stayed at the Paris August 22-27, 2004. We enjoyed gambling in the Paris casino during our trip to Vegas last year so we thought we'd stay there this year. It also helped that we received an offer in the mail for $79 a night! The offer was only good for 3 nights, so we spent $129 for the additional 2 nights. Our experience with the Paris started out well. We arrived at the Las Vegas airport at 10:30 in the morning and went to the hotel check-in desk at the baggage claim area. We were happily surprised that we not only got a room, but also keys immediately so we could go to our room as soon as we arrived at the hotel. We had hoped for a room with a view of the strip, but instead got one on the 23rd floor facing east. We inquired if we could get a strip or pool view, but the woman at the desk said there were only two rooms available and the one we got was the better of the two. Not wanting to delay checking in, we took it and were not disappointed. Besides a view of the mountains to the east, we also had a view of the airport which made for an interesting backdrop (for the few times we were actually in the room to take in the view). We also received some coupons for match play, free drinks at the pool bar, and a discount at the hotel cafe. Upon entering our room we were happily surprised at how roomy it was. We had a king bed, small couch with coffee table, upholstered side chair, desk with chair, and large ottoman which could also be used for seating if necessary. There is no closet - the tv is in a large armoire with doors on either side - behind these 36\" doors are your closets, safe, iron, and ironing board. There are three rather small drawers below the tv for clothes. If you need more clothes storage there are two nightstands, one on either side of the bed, which each have 3 drawers. The bathroom was beautiful and spacious. The floor, countertop, backsplash for the tub, and the entire shower are marble. The shower has clear glass shower doors. There are three shelves under the countertop on either side of the sink for storing your bathroom articles, a large, powerful blow dryer, and a two-sided make-up mirror that pulls out from the wall. The only thing this bathroom needs to make it perfect is two sinks! The towels are thick and we always seemed to have extras. The only complaint we had about the bathroom was the bath soap - they give you some kind of French milled soap which looks like an oatmeal soap. It had all kinds of hard things in it which really scratch your skin when you use it. And since the Vegas water is so hard, you can't get any lather so the pebbles in the soap really hurt! The hand soap is normal - no pebbles - so we just requested extra hand soap and used that in the shower. They also provide shampoo with conditioner (which was ok) and lotion (which smelled awful - bring your own). After unpacking our next stop was the pool. One of our favorite things to do in Vegas is lay out in the HOT sun, so a hotel with a nice pool area is very important. We usually stay at the Flamingo because we like their lively pool area and were a little afraid we wouldn't be too happy with the Paris pool. Well, again, we were happily surprised! The pool isn't that big by Vegas standards - it's kind of an octagon and all one depth. There is a VERY large deck area around the pool, along with two hot tubs (one hot, one cold), a pool cafe and bar. The pool isn't in the sun until about 11:00 so there's no rush to get up early and hurry to the pool for chairs. In fact, we never had a problem getting chairs or finding a place for them, and we were with a group of 5 people so we needed a rather big area. At some hotels we've stayed (Flamingo and Mirage) you have to get down to the pool before 9:00 to reserve chairs or you're out of luck. We liked the fact that we could have a relaxed breakfast then go out to the pool and not have to worry about where we were going to sit. There's nothing going on at this pool, so if you like having a party while you're poolside (like they have at the Flamingo) or you want some water aerobics (like they have at the Mirage) you might be bored. We were in Vegas with a bunch of friends and we were using our pool time to catch up with everyone, so the quiet pool area was just what we wanted. The service at the pool isn't that great - you sometimes have to wait quite a while for a waiter or waitress to take your drink order - but the bar is close by which makes it convenient to get your own. My daughter was staying at Bally's and since I had read on other postings here that Bally's patrons can use the Paris pool I inquired of the pool staff if this was correct. I was told they are not allowed to use the pool, but when I told them my daughter was staying at Bally's they said that wouldn't be a problem since she would be my guest. While she was with us at the pool she ordered drinks and charged them to her room at Bally's with no questions asked. The breakfast buffet at the Paris is outstanding. They have all the usual breakfast fare - omelets, bacon, sausage, bagels, toast, waffles, pancakes - along with a crepe station where you can get made to order crepes, French cheeses, a ham slicing station, and all kinds of fresh fruit including my favorite, a neverending bowl of berries - strawberries, blackberries, raspberries, and blueberries. The setting is the prettiest of all the buffets we have been to in Vegas - including Bellagio and Mandalay Bay. If you are staying at the Paris and have a slot club card, go to the Connection Desk in the casino your first day and check in. They will give you a line pass which entitles you to bypass the line at the buffet and go right in. Unfortunately we didn't go to the Connection Desk until the day before we were leaving so we didn't get a chance to use our line pass. Both days we went to the buffet there was a 30 minute wait to get in, so that pass would have saved us a lot of time. We also ate a couple times in the Le Saint Louis Cafe. Breakfast was good but costs almost as much as the buffet, so you might as well go to the buffet for the price. For dinner they had a prime rib and crab legs special for $16.99 that several people in our party ordered and enjoyed very much. The best deal in the hotel is in the Boulangere. You can get a sandwich (or wrap), soup (or salad) and a drink for $6.99-8.99. And these sandwiches are piled with meat! All in all, we had a great time during our stay at Paris. In fact, we have decided it's our new favorite place to stay when we're in Las Vegas.", "Date": "August 28, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ohio", "Title": "\u201cStayed at the Paris\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2489876", "Content": "We stayed at the Paris August 9-13.

Considering the number of employees we came in contact with, 1 rude one isn't bad. We ate at several restaurants in the Paris and had wonderful food and service.

The sight is absolutely beautiful. The buffet at the hotel is cheap and very, very good. We also ate at Mon Ami Gabi and it very good as well. Ask for a patio seat and you can watch the water show across the street at the Bellagio all night. Some other good restaurants are the Seafood Buffet restaurant at the Rio and Galaghers steakhouse at NYNY. You definately have to have the warm crepes at the creperie or at the breakfast buffet....they are soooooo good!!!!! We gambled mostly at the Paris and actually came home with money. The blackjack tables at the Paris were a lot of fun and the dealers were always so pleasant. It's also worth the 10US taxi ride to downtown Las Vegas, where they have a light show at night and you really get to experience the difference in atmosphere. We went to 2 shows: Blue Man Group (which was o.k...not what I expected) and Jubilee (which is a traditional Vegas Show). Unfortunately Cirque du Soleil was off for the week, but I would of really loved to see \"O\" or \"Zumanity\". Oh well...guess i'll just have to do it next time!

Our stay was for three nights starting July 29. We had none of the problems described in some of the earlier reviews. The location is perfect, right across from the Bellagio and Caesars, and next door to the Aladdin and Bally's. The themeing is very good, with most of the shops and several of the restaurants located on a very pretty and nicely detailed faux boulevard, complete with cobble stones! There are several \"living\" statues (actors in full make-up poising as statues along the street, moving every so often to the delight of passers-by). The french elevator music WAS annoying, but then, so is most elevator music! The staff was always pleasant and helpful, though a few seemed a bit rushed, none were rude or abrupt in anyway. The wait staff in all the restaurants were especially good. The room is large and nicely decorated, it feels elegant without being stuffy (the whole hotel feels this way), and the king bed was comfortable. We had a very partial view of the fountains at the Bellagio across the street, even though this wasn't a \"P\" room. The marble bath is huge, with a shower separate from the tub (the tub is a little shallow though, but we didn't care as we didn't use it). The sink area has plenty of counter space, and the mirrors are fog-free. The maid service was good, the room was always clean. One day the maid even laid out my hair brushes on a towel on the sink in the bathroom. We always left a few dollars as a tip, and upon check out left a tip and a few candies from the stash I had brought with me for the trip. These ladies work hard at a job most of us would never do, and I always like to show my appreciation. We ate at 3 restaurants during our stay, the Village Buffett, the Le Cafe, and the Artistes Steakhouse. The Buffett was by far the best. We had breakfast there each morning, and though a little pricey compared to other Vegas buffets ($14 per person for breakfast), the extra cost was worth it as they have very good quality food that you'd actually want to eat. They had made to order eggs, omelettes and crepes, and plenty of fruit, pastry, danish, cheese, yogurt, sausage, bacon, and anything else you can think of for breakfast. The cheese is especially good! Le Cafe was also good overall, especially the service. The only down side was the prime rib, it was a bit tough. The Steakhouse was also excellent, but for the price paid, my filet minogn was again a little dry (very tender though). The Paris seems to have a problem with either getting good quality beef, or they don't know how to prepare it. My companion had the lemon pepper chicken, and said it was excellent, and we both loved the chocolate mouse desert. We saw Jubilee at Bally's. Jubilee is a typical Vegas showgirl review, with plenty of beautiful feathered costumes (mostly topless). The dancing and singing were very good, and the smaller acts like the Chinese acrobats and the jugglers were also very good. We paid $69 per person, and even though we were all the way over to one side (we booked the same day as the performance) our seats were excellent and we could see everything just fine. Don't get the table seats up front, it's too close to the stage and the drink service (and higher ticket price) isn't worth having to crane your neck up at the stage for 1 and \u00bd hours.

A phone clerk takes all the information and assigns you an available room. Upon arrival, one goes to the Ambassador line. All arrangements have been made while on the phone, and all the guest has to do is show the credit card. We were checked in in less than two minutes. Our room was elegant. Our view was of the Aladdin, the MGM, the Monte Carlo, NY - NY, etc. We did have a partial view of the Bellagio fountains and a full view of the Paris balloon. I very much appreciated the presence of security guards who walk the beat in the hotel halls. Their presence was very obvious and they also were attentive to say hello. I had never seen this in other hotels. I especially enjoyed the Paris television station that instructed the viewer as to how to play in the casino. The impersonator did a very funny Fran Fein, Joan Rivers, Judge Judy, Cher and Katharine Hepburn. The comps were very good! The customer service by Ed at the Connection booth was superior. He explained the point system, the comp dollars and then took the time to merge our numerous Caesar's entertainment accounts onto one account. Even our East Coast / Atlantic City accounts merged. We feel that the comp dollars that we used towards our rooms were very generous. Our summer package included a buy one - get one for the show \"Jubilee\". We took advantage and really enjoyed the show. The coupon saved us $65. Our package included a drink poolside. The bartender Alan made us feel very welcomed at the bar. The frozen drink was delicious. How can anyone not love this pool set beside the Eiffel Tower? The large urns around the pool reminded me of the Estanque pool in El Retiro park in Madrid.

Check in and out was quick and efficient and got an upgrade to a view room after a bit of persuasion for no added charge. Stayed at the Rio previously and was a better room experience, but location was a bit tuff. Don't know how Paris compares to some of the other better hotels, i.e. Venetian, Bellagio etc. If you want cheap and clean do consider Terrible Herbst, tho off the strip their restarant is quite good and rooms are fine, clean and bit smelly but fine. Pool and deck is outstanding. I have stayed at Herb's twice and paid $29 & $10 depending on the deal of the day and wud stay again.

Paris, Las Vegas is a charming fantasy of a Paris that no longer exists, perhaps never existed, with strains of Piaf and Aznavour wafting through the cobble stone street, Le Notre Patisserie, la Boulangerie and various boutiques and restaurants. The public rest rooms were so beautiful that some women were taking photos of them. I had a fabulous lunch buffet at Le Village with representative dishes from different regions of France with an array of fabulous pastries and desserts, one of which would cost $8 or $9 in a NYC restaurant, all for $17! I never had a bad meal at any of the restaurants in the Paris and the cocktail lounge, the gorgeous Napoleon had a happy hour special of free high quality sandwiches with the purchase of even a $4 beer. I was fortunate to pay a convention rate for my hotel of $80 per day.

The rooms were comfortable, bathrooms were a nice size, and housekeeping seemed to do a great job. We did eat at the Eiffel Tower restaurant our first night as we got in quite late. I would skip it. The service was rushed, the restaurant is quite noisy and the tables are packed too close together for comfort. The food was good but not the quality I expected. There are several restaurants which are simply much better experiences. The casino was fun - staff was friendly, drink service was consistent if a little slow. The breakfast buffet is nicely arranged and many options for even healthy eaters. However, the lines can get a bit long at popular times. Go early for no wait. The spa was nice - my actual treatment room and treatment was incredible. However, the hot tub, showers, etc leave a bit to be desired. The hot tub is quite boring and does not welcome one to linger. Also, you feel as though you are cattle being moved through lines when waiting for your appt. The lockers were nice and there was a lot of cold water and fruit out to enjoy.

We accessed the site through the Ballys-Paris website with full descriptions and prices. We very clearly booked this type of room with a view of the strip for a specified upgrade in price over the basic room. Upon arrival, we were presented with a xeroxed sheet of price upgrades for suites. When we expressed confusion, we were told that the Paris never guaranteed a specific type of room to an online booking only a basic room that you could upgrade. We asked why there were pics and different price categories then online. She kept assuring us we were wrong about our info and that we only paid for a view of the strip and we got a discount for that online. Well according to her sheet of prices we got a discount, but upon later accessing the web again (surprise the website had changed its info, is it possible they were losing money on the deal?), we indeed found the room with the strip view was quoted at almost 20 dollars lower online. Now remember we were supposedly getting a deal already. Needless to say we were not going to pay another $125 for the same room we thought we booked but were forced to stay since it was after 10 pm. The desk attendant kept quoting rack rates of $800 a night to prove what a deal we were being offered. Upon arrival in the room small and basic at best, I booked a suite at NYNY for about 20 more than our basic room price. I was not disappointed either, only kicked myself that I had not followed my instincts in booking the room in the first place at the NYNY. Back to the Paris review, yes the halls and the check in area were beautiful, but the room was small for the money. The air conditioner barely worked, bed was not comfortable, and the shower handle fell off when touched. Inadequate soap supply. And the one upgrade they explained we payed for, the view of the Strip, was through a very dirty window.

The casinos give away \"comps\" based on how much you gamble in the casino and how long you gamble, just like any business every comp given out must be justified, we all have superiors to report to. Secondly, when you book a room at a hotel in Las Vegas you should probably read the fine print. What you pay for is a room not the type of room. 100% of the time you will see that PREFERENCES ARE NOTED BUT CANNOT BE GUARANTEED. So if you are planning to visit Las Vegas and you think that because we have 3000 room hotels and we will give you whatever you want for free (i.e upgrades, food, amenities or anything else) you're wrong.

We also ate at La Provencal. Napoleans lounge looked interesting but we never stopped. (I actually thought that the bar would be upstairs by it's description but it's actually mixed in with the shops in the quaint french village.) We loved the pool. It wasn't very warm but it wasn't crowded, and the waiters can bring you a large drink in a souvenire eiffel tower.

We had a nice corner room, which was quiet and had a view of the Strip and the pool. The \"P\" rooms with a view are worth the extra $20 if a view is important to you. The room was kept clean and housecleaning was very prompt and organized. We ordered room service breakfast one morning and it arrived on time and was very good. The hotel's location in the middle of the strip is convenient and provides great access to the Bellagio, Bally's, Caeser's Palace, Aladdin and the Flamingo. The casino was open and well-lit (unlike Bellagio which I found quite dark and oppressive) but it is much smaller than other casinos on the strip so if you're a big gambler you might prefer a larger casino with more options. We ate at the cafe on the \"boulevard\" and it was reasonable and the food was above average. I felt that the biggest cons to this hotel were the following: (1) no matter what door you enter from the exterior of the hotel you must go through the casino to get to the check-in, the rooms, the shops, or anything else and I found that a bit irritating especially when carrying bags, (2) there did not appear to be enough lounge areas and the bars were small and always packed no matter what time of day or night we stopped by, (3) the shops and \"french boulevard\" while cute were a bit too fake for me (I have been to Paris and never once saw a mime) - I appreciate the effort but it seemed a bit forced (I know, everyone's a critic). I would stay at this hotel again but will probably try Mandalay Bay the next time I visit Vegas to compare. Mandalay had a nice lobby area when you entered and the casino was not so \"in your face\" when you walked in the door.

This is the ultimate place to watch the NCAA Basketball Tournament, as the hotel uses their theater to show the games on four huge screens that hang above the stage. Awesome! If you have ever been to a sports book during a big event and had trouble finding a seat, you know why this is so sweet. In 2002 the seating was plentiful, but last year a lot more people showed up and the theater was actually filled to capacity at times. The one drawback to having this many people at one place to watch the games is that the lines at the betting windows were HUGE! I recommend walking down the hall to Bally's to put your bet in, and then go back to Paris to root on your picks. There is a snack bar in the lobby of the theater that serves beer, soft drinks, and \"stadium\" style food. I preferred to get my drinks from the cocktail waitresses out in the casino rather than paying for drinks at the snack bar. As for the hotel, the room was on par with the other fine hotels in Vegas. The bathroom is the coolest part with marble tile and separate glass shower and bath. Makes you feel like a king! The buffet is excellent for breakfast and dinner (crab legs and prime rib!). It is the most impressive buffet that I have seen in my 20+ trips to Vegas. If you stay at Paris and plan on playing table games, be cautious about their comps. I played for several hours each day at an average bet of $50. I was told to charge my meals to the room and that a casino host \"would take care of it\" when I checked out. No dice! I don't know if this guy woke up on the wrong side of the bed or what. I vowed that I would not return, but I have since compromised since they are now offering me two nights free for my next trip.

Here is the typical rundown on our stay at the Paris Hotel in Las Vegas: We arrived at the Las Vegas Airport at 6:30pm and had the hotel arrange for us to have a limosine waiting to pick us up. The limo never showed. We called the hotel.. they said he was at the airport and we needed to call him and let him know where we were and He would meet us. We obtained the number, called it.. and was greeted with a wrong number. Finally we give up on the limo. Upon arriving at the hotel two hours later, we went to check in and they told us the room we had booked three months in advanced (not to mention payed in full at the time of booking) was doubled booked. We had to wait for 4 hours and 47 minutes before a room was finally ready. Being it was our honeymoon, we had previously booked a suite.. but we ended up in a standard room, with double beds.. we wanted a king. After they told us the room was ready, we went up to it.. discovered it was a standard room, went back down to the desk, explained we already paid for a suite, so we either wanted compensation for our overpayment, or a suite. We werent even asking for money back, we just wanted show tickets or maybe dinner passes, or something.. we knew we'd spend the difference either in casino play or on food or shows, so we were willing to take compensation that way. However, the person at the desk arrgued that we couldnt have paid for the room otherwise they wouldnt have been able to book it.. so we called the credit card company, and they were extremely helpful and explained to the desk clerk that the charge was in fact on our card, for the date that we made the booking, and even gave the clerk the total amount charged, which clearly showed we had paid for a suite for four nights. She continues to say that there was no possible way they could reimburse us the over charged amount, and we had to accept it. After about twenty minutes of arguing, we called the credit card company.. explained the situation to them, and they removed the charge from the card .. sent a refuse to pay to the hotel, and my new hubby and I left the hotel and found another.. the Luxor, which was much better. As for the hospitality of the Paris Hotel, well.. lets just say, I was called some pretty rotten things.. including a scam artist trying to get a free room.. and that was after the credit card company told the desk clerk that I had already paid in full for the room.

I found the rooms very tastefully decorated with what I would describe as an \"understated elegance\"--appealing decor without making the guest feel uncomfortable and ideal for singles and couples in early middle age or older. I find the casino quite appealing and, to be honest, Paris' casino and the casino in NYNY are the only two that stand out to me, and that is because of their decor. Most of the other casinos, though grand and elegant, all tend to look the same to me. In my experience casino services have been very generous. For example, although I enjoy some table games, particularly craps, I am hardly a \"high-roller\" and, for that matter, I hardly play the slots a all. Nevertheless, Paris' casino services were willing to give me an offer for rooms at US$69/night with some dining coupons and other perks thown in for a Sunday through Thursday stay this coming April even though I had only some 37 minutes of slot play on my Connection Card from my visit last September. I thought that that was very considerate of them. I don't understand some of the snide remarks about the French music in the elevators or the Art Nouveau decor in the hotel that some reviewers have made here. Since the name of the hotel is \"Paris\" and the theme is French culture, I would expect to hear Edith Piaf in the elevators rather than Pearl Jam. I wonder if this is indicative of the general French bashing (athough Paris is owned, of course, by Park Place Entertainment which also owns Caesar's Palace, the Flamingo, the Hiltion, and Bally's in Las Vegas) that is occurring as a result of France's stance on the Iraq war (if so, that's another reason to stay at Paris, although I won't get into politics here). My overall impression of the hotel is that it is an upscale property that caters to vacationers, typically low-rollers like myself, that are planning to gamble a bit, to be sure, but want to do a bit of sightseeing, see a show or two, enjoy an elegant dinner, and generally relax and people-watch as well. For those who prefer an attractive pool setting, the Mandalay Bay, Flamingo, Mirage, or Hard Rock may be better choices. High-rollers might prefer Caesar's Palace, a sister property of Paris Las Vegas. But with the exception of a stand-out pool, Paris offers a stunning ambiance in a beautiful setting and is located in an ideal location to enjoy all the things that Las Vegas has to offer.

From the moment we arrived to the moment we left the service could not have been better. Offered bottled water at check-in and were upgraded (or should I say treated!) to a gorgeous suite as an upgrade to a standard room when I explained we were here for important birthdays - how gracious and generous! Had dead-on view of Bellagio fountains, Eiffel tower and pool - couldn't ask for more! Ate at Provencal (singing waiters and great Italian food at reasonable prices), sipped Champagne at Napolean (beautiful room with couches, etc. - had a $7 Champagne sampler that contained 3 glasses of very good Champagne - (free sandwiches between 4 and 7), enjoyed an excellent onion soup and the best fries on the terrace of Mon Ami Gabbi, had nice breakfast at Le Cafe - all in all food was excellent, great service everywhere. Enjoyed great band in the lounge - lots of beautiful stores in cobblestone streets. Not very big gamblers, played slots a little - casino was ok. Loved atmosphere, beautiful chandeliers everywhere, marble floors, very Parisian. For those who complain that this hotel is too French - this is a Parisian hotel - this is the concept - if you don't like this sort of thing, stay somewhere else! They do it well here, its not tacky, it's just right. Also enjoyed pool area. Self-Parking is not really a hike at all - elevators to shopping area between Bally's and Paris - not far to rooms - quite convenient actually. Incredible location in center of strip - surrounded by Alladin, Bally's, Bellagio, and Caesar's - best location on strip and very classy! Paid $79/night for this incredible experience - loved it, loved it, loved it! Try it - you won't be disappointed.", "Date": "November 14, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saline,Michigan", "Title": "\u201cA Great Place To Stay\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1435332", "Content": "We love the Paris, they give out great deals to come out to stay at there hotel.We were out in Vegas three times this year and stayed at the Mandalay Bay, which is nice but over priced,then stayed at the Paris which was great,then the Venetian,which like the Mandalay Bay is nice but over priced,when you are paying airfare and dumping 5000.00 in to a machine you should get a few small perks to get you to come back.

In the words of the Desk Staff, it is a \" request\" not a reservation, so if what you thought you reserved is not available, and they have charged you a deposit in advance for it, they will give you something else that is availablefor the same price, even if it was avaialbe when you made the reservations at a lower price(and forget any offer of an upgrade unless you have alot of money on the table). Also we spent over a week and a few thousand $ there, and when our flight was delayed for 18 hours, they refused to allow us to use the hotel shuttle to come back unless we checked in for another night. Beware the Mon Ami Gabbi Resturaunt, $$$$, average food and very poor service(again they are trying to be french) .

I read from Paris Las Vegas website that they offer a Passport Package which looks quite attractive. So I just made my reservation online a month ago and submitted my credit card information. However I did not receive any confirmation, so I sent an email to the hotel reservations to enquire. But no matter how many times I emailed or faxed them, I never received any response. Since I'm in Hong Kong, I wouldn't be able to call any toll-free number to check. I eventually faxed a complaint letter to the General Manager of the hotel, but it's now another 10 days passed and I still received no response. I am very frustrated and disappointed at this hotel. As a matter of courtesy, I think at least the hotel should acknowledge and respond promptly to customer enquiries. By posting up this complaint online, I'm going to wait and see whether the hotel will respond to my enquiry or not. Since I have already submitted my credit card information, I just want to know whether my reservation is confirmed or not.
