{"Reviews": [{"Content": "excellent hotel at shopping mall in Mexico City outskirts This is a hotel in the north east of Mexico City, in the grounds of a large and modern shopping centre and a couple minutes away from the motorway. Not an option if you want to visit Mexico City itself (choose a hotel in the centre instead) but a great base to depart from and visit many attractions around Mexico City (Queretaro, San Miguel, Teotihuacan,...). You will save a lot of time battling with the traffic in the centre of Mexico City.The hotel is very modern with all the modcons you would expect, including a nice size heated swimming pool and a little gym. The shopping mall, including various restaurants, is one minute walk away. The rooms are well insulated so the shopping mall does not cause any noise.The only problem was that the map on the hotel website was somewhat approximate which made the hotel not easy to find from the direction we were coming from. Fortunately everyone knew where the Las Americas shopping centre was so it did not take long to get there.If we were to go back to Mexico, we would stay at the Fiesta Inn again.", "Date": "Jan 3, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR489808080", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "LarryWastoday"}, {"Content": "Fiesta Inn Ecatepec el mejor hotel del nororiente de la cd. de Mexico D.F.   showReview(7154630, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 13, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR919429249", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "ecatepec_D.F."}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g150800-d596410-r23216399-Fiesta_Inn_Ecatepec-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "HotelID": "596410", "Price": "$85"}}
