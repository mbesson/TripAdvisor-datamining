Unfortunately our luggage was lost on the flight (we were a group of 15), and when my husband and I got to our room, the toilet had overflowed. We immediately went back to the lobby to complain and also mentioned how our luggage had been lost. They put us in a new room AND offered us a free credit to the resort store to get a summer outfit since we only had our winter clothing! We did not end up using the credit as our bags did end arrive that evening. ROOMS Average size, clean with great showers. POOLS Nice. One large pool, a sports pool and a smaller \u201cadult only\u201d pool. Most of the activities go on at the larger pool \u2013 water aerobics, games, etc. QUETZEL/TUCAN Both sides very similar, Tucan may be a bit more casual. Each has it\u2019s own buffet restaurant (very similar) and share other facilities. ANIMATION TEAM Very impressed with this animation team. They are professional and work hard. Some are very talented with the shows at night, and many will go out of their way during the day to involve guests in their structured activities. A few seemed to genuinely enjoy getting to know the guests, and would ask questions about what things are like where we are from. SHOWS Best I\u2019ve seen at an all-inclusive. Clearly not Vegas level, or even as good as what you\u2019ll see on a cruise ship, but talent, costumes, production far better than other resorts where I\u2019ve stayed. Good mix of shows with Latin flair, contests with audience participation, pop music themed shows, etc. Theater itself is large and open with a roof, chairs around tables where wait staff will bring you drinks. There\u2019s also a bar. BEACH Very beautiful and clean beach. Whether you choose to snooze in the shade under one of the many huts, join a game of beach volleyball or sun yourself on one of the open lounges, there was plenty of room. They do play the towel game here and especially at the pool, so if you want a specific spot get up early and claim your chair. RESTAURANTS On a 1-10 scale, about a 4. The breakfast buffets were good with a large selection of pastry, made to order omelets, fruit. Lunch and dinner were repetitive, tasteless and not kept at appropriate temps. The a la cartes were better but not great. Service was very very slow. The beach restaurant opened for lunch offered stale nachos and rubbery burgers. BARS No pool bar, boo! If this were a newer resort, I\u2019m sure they\u2019d have planned for it. The beach bar was fine, lobby bar was a bit more upscale. Drinks were weak but they\u2019d make them stronger if you asked. Throwing a few bucks their way doesn\u2019t hurt. DISCO Small, dark, loud and lots of young people (including young children while we were there). EXCURSIONS Our group went snorkeling at Xel-Ha (pretty Lagoon) but much more \u201ctheme-parkish\u201d than I\u2019d expected, with lockers for your clothes and snack bars on site. It reminded me of a more natural water country. PLAYA DEL CARMEN One day we took a taxi into town, another day we walked. We felt perfectly safe and did a little bargain shopping. I would definitely be careful though of the food and especially the water outside of the resort.", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Hampshire", "Title": "\u201cRevisiting the Tucan\u201d", "Author": "alwsjr", "ReviewID": "UR126521604", "Content": "March 2012 back to the Tucan for a week of relaxation. The hotel is fine even though it's an older hotel they maintain it well. The beach is great since they rebuilt if after the hurricane in 09/10, bigger and better. As with any beach spot, you have to get up early to reserve cabana's and pool chairs, however, the Tucan now provides beach umbrellas a no charge and if you don't get up early enough to get a cabana (5:30-6:00 am) no problem your still able to get on the beach and have shade with an umbrella. The only areas that didn't impress as much as prior visits to the Tucan (we've been to the Tucan and or Quetzal four times now) was the food. While the food was fine as far as prep and presentation goes, they didn't mix it up much from day to day and it was a bit boring but again very clean and editable. The real difference I noticed, since breakfast is my favorite meal, is that the juices were really diluted and my orange juice had very little resemblance to orange juice and tasted alot like flavored water or tang. I remember the coffee being pretty good in the past as well and have to say it was like mud. There were four of us vacationing together and it was agreed by everyone that we couldn't remember the coffee being as bad as it was. I would have paid some bucks to get my hands on a dunkin or starbuck. Last but not least, the ice machine in our building wasn't working so after arrival on Sat. I asked if they could fix it and they told me yes, still broken on Sunday so once again I went to the desk and asked nicely if they could fix it and was told yes again, Monday still broken so while in the lobby for drinks Monday evening I went to reception and explained about previous requests and that it was still not fixed and the person seemed surprised that no one had come to service it and said they would take care of it. Tuesday and guess what, ice machine still broken so I went to the buildings next to ours for ice for the rest of our stay and by the time we left to return home the machine was still inoperative. I've spent alot of my career in customer-facing jobs and know what it's like to work with customers so I was disappointed to say the least and the Tucan let me down on this one. Not that it's a barn-burner issue but my guess is the machine was probably broken beyond repair or they were waiting for a part and all they had to do was tell me that and I would have been good to go but don't tell me you're going to do something and not do it as that just reduces my trust in the staff and the mgt. and sends a message that maybe there is another place out there that I should visit next vacation. Aside from these somewhat small issues, the property is kept up very well for its age and other Tucan personnel (waitstaff, maid service, etc., etc.,) treated us very well as usual. I would return to the Tucan but will share this review with the Tucan directly so maybe they can fix some loose ends. As for my 2011 review, I have to apologize to those folks that emailed me with questions which I didn't respond to. I missed your emails and so I will answer now for what it's worth. Personally, I would take a cab from the hotel to the shopping district. I think there may be some risk in walking, especially in the pm. As for the Tucan beach and the water action, no the water is not always smooth and is generally somewhat wavy because of the prevailing breeze but it's not real rough either. As a matter of fact, the water was a combination of calm and a bit wavy for our vacation of two weeks ago. You have to love the water temp, the enormity of the new beach and the weather. If those things are all good then any other inconveniences, like the ones I mentioned above, seem minor.", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Canada", "Title": "\u201cSpectacular again!!\u201d", "Author": "skibum13", "ReviewID": "UR126450772", "Content": "This is our 3rd time to the Tucan/Quetzal. We stayed Feb 29 to March 14th. Two weeks of heaven. My hubby and I love the smaller resorts and this one is indeed a winner. Resort is clean and well cared for, staff are FABULOUS, helpful and smiling all day and night. Check in was quick and staff were sure to meet you with drinks, smiles and all the help that was needed. Rooms clean and bright with well stocked fridge daily, the cleaning staff always went the extra mile if asked. Food hot, fresh and no complaints at all. Some people say they get tired of the buffett, well we were there for a full 2 weeks and i could of stayed another month. Everything changes and is wonderful. I am sure you are not offered that much at home! Made wonderful bonds and friendships with the entertainment staff, which kept us laughing each day. The beach is beautiful and loved swimming, boogieboarding and snorkeling daily. The nice thing is you can walk to Playa from either the beach or front road, roughly 25-30 minutes its a safe and easy stroll. Infact take the bikes! We were so sad to leave and will be back again.. One note is we booked through Sunquest tours and were very disappointed with their service. No representive could be found for days, tour books are not updated and needless to say would try not to ever book Sunquest again. Otherwise again this vacation was one of the best we have had.

We had an amazing 10 days and would definitely return. We stayed in building 10, right on the beach. It was so convenient, as we could get to the beach or the pool in 30 seconds. If we had to use the bathroom, change, ect... it was so convenient. This brings me to the only not-so-positive point - for the money paid, this was the only benefit as far as we could tell to staying in that building. The rooms are the same, no frills or whistles, and the view of the water on the first floor is obstructed by palapas and chairs. Try to stay in building 11, 12 or 13 - they are also near both the beach and pool. Our bed was great. Not hard at all. Maybe this was another perk of being in bldg 10 that we didn't know about, but no complaints at all, and I was worried after reading the other reviews. Being on the beach and being early risers, we witnessed people coming as early as 5:30am to get their chairs under palapas. We were out on the beach by 8 and many of these people did not come to those seats until noon or later. Yes, there are signs posted that this is forbidden, and no the hotel does not enforce the policy. Honestly, I don't expect them too, it would be too time consuming for employees who already have so much to do. Many of these people are the same ones who act like the buffets are going to run out of food. If you are reading this review and are one of these people, please know that there are those of us out there that see you and laugh at your desperation to obtain \"prime real estate\". For everyone else, there are enough chairs - you can get an umbrella from the towel stand to put up in the sand. If want a seat by the pool though, good luck. Loved the waiters and bartenders - their service was outstanding. One more tip for the ladies - do not bring heels unless they are wedges or really thick. The path through the jungle is treacherous in them, but quicker and prettier than the outside path.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Barrie, Canada", "Title": "\u201cSomething for everyone!\u201d", "Author": "gpskier", "ReviewID": "UR126275187", "Content": "We travelled to the resort as a large extended family.

The staff were great in helping provide a golf cart ride when necessary up to the lobby or to the restaurants. Our rooms were in building 11 which made it a short walk to the pool, and small buffet near the beach. The Star Friends are fantastic and the kids had lots to do. If you are booking any day trips I suggest considering just hiring a taxi and paying the fee at the actual location. When you book as a package you are paying so much for the transportation.

SHORT REVIEW: Pros: Beautiful well maintained grounds with jungle feel. Lots of animals. Nice big beach. Huge pool. Small resort. Good dive shop. Close to Playa Del Carmen. Cons: Unsatisfactory food, crowded beach with not enough chairs, churned up water with tons of sea weed (obviously out of anyone\u2019s control) Rock hard beds. Rooms starting to show age. Charge for wifi. FULL DETAILED REVIEW: GETTING THERE & BACK: Booked trip with Thomas Cook/Air Canada Jazz airlines. Flight was delayed 4 hours! Food was horrible. Plane was dirty. Two pieces of luggage were damaged. As always keep hold of your luggage when going through Cancun airport. The locals surround you hoping to carry your luggage for a tip. It\u2019s easy to loose site of, so I would suggest taking it to the bus yourself. Bus ride took almost 1 \u00bd hours because we dropped of guests of 3 other resorts on the way to Iberostar. Bus ride back to the airport took almost 2 hours (lots of pick ups) Flight home was delayed 20 minutes. Incorrect gate # printed on the tickets. CHECK IN: Quick to check in. There was only 1 other couple checking in with us & it was 4am. We had requested rooms close to the beach with king beds, which we didn\u2019t get. Most importantly we had requested 2 of the rooms to be beside each other as we were traveling with a minor & needed him close to his guardian. We were told there were no other rooms available that night & to check back in the following morning. We did, & the best they could do was 2 rooms on the same floor. RESORT & GROUNDS: My opinion of the grounds (still the same as my first visit/review) The grounds are beautiful. Love the jungle feel & animals (especially the monkeys) The actual hotel is average, nothing really special, but the grounds do make up for that. ROOMS: We were located in building 15. Not too bad, but still would have preferred closer to the beach. Two of us stayed in room 1509 the first night. This room was on the ground floor, was clean, but had a really strong moldy smell. We ended up moving to room #1543 on the 3rd floor because the noise in the morning from the other guests/staff on the ground floor made it impossible to sleep (this room did have a real hairdryer ladies) The other rooms we had were on the 2nd floor, rooms 1525 & 1527. These rooms were OK. Pretty clean, but definitely starting to show their age. Had monkeys on the balcony of 1525 one morning. This building is close to the theatre, so if you are early to bed & a light sleeper you may find it a little noisy till about 12am, not to bad though. Always had hot water. Did receive the usual bathroom amenities this time. Mini fridge stocked every other day, coffee maker, iron/board. No slippers or robes. No bottle of Tequila this time \uf04c Have to agree with other reviews this time\u2026BEDS ARE HARD AS A ROCK! FOOD: BUFFET & GRILL: Really disappointed with the food this time. First lunch went to grab a hamburger & it wasn\u2019t cooked. First buffet dinner went to have a piece of chicken, again not cooked. There were more than a few food items that I had throughout the week that I thought were down right gross. Food was very repetitive, and overall there seemed to be less of a selection than there was on out first visit. I am not a picky eater & have never had a problem before with the food at any of the all inclusive resorts I\u2019ve been to. A LA CARTE RESTAURANTS: We were allowed 3 reservations with a 7 day stay. The steak house was very good (last time too) The Mexican wasn\u2019t good at all. Had one too many pieces of chicken gristle with my order. Some of our party went to the Italian & said it was good. The Japanese was just ok. A lot of the desserts & appetizers were the same as what you would find at the buffet. ROOM SERVICE: 11am-11pm. Food on the menu not great. Good if you want some fruit or a small bite. Good for kids. DRINKS: Best drinks are at the lobby bar & the theatre. These bars served premium liquor & knew how to make a proper drink. Other bars served cheaper liquor. Drinks at other bars weren\u2019t bad, a bit more watered down for the blender drinks. Red house wine at restaurants wasn\u2019t great\u2026.but good enough. If you want better wine you can purchase it. GUESTS: Mix of Canadians, Americans, & Europeans. Mix of age groups. Not very many small children. BEACH: Same opinion as the first review. Nice big beach. Water was very rough the week so the water was not clear. Lots of sea weed again up until the last couple of days. The last few days the beach was very crowded. You can get a beach umbrella from the towel stand which was great; however you could not find a single chair on the entire beach!!! (Pool was the same) People had to take chairs from the restaurants to sit on the beach. DRESSEL DIVERS (Playa & Cozumel): Went with Dressel to complete required 4 open water dives. Had to do a pool skills check, fill out some PADI forms, and complete a small test before the first dive. This was $30 US per diver. Dives were $74.00 US per dive (equipment included) If you want to dive in Cozumel with Dressel you will have to reserve it in 1 day in advance. Cozume1 dives are 2 tank dives. You have 2 options to Dive Cozumel. #1You can pay $95 US for ferry tickets/transportation to Iberostar Cozumel + $74 US per dive, or #2 Take the ferry yourself if you have transportation or are hiring a taxi in Cozumel + the $74 US per dive. If you will only be doing a single dive in Cozumel you will have to wait on the boat for others who will be doing a second dive to return. Staff at both locations which were Coralee, Lily, Alex, Denis, Georgia, were super friendly & very knowledgeable. Bryn & Victor were there training, and will be an excellent addition to Dressel\u2019s instructors. Equipment was very good. Great boat captains as well. Would give this shop a 5 star only we didn\u2019t care much for Lara the base leader. This being out first open water dives we don\u2019t have any other dive sites to compare, but were very pleased with the diving sites we visited. Cozumel had better coral, same fish... We were lucky to see a turtle, barracuda, sting ray, and bull shark!!! *One tip: They did forget to stamp one log book (very important if you are completing certification) Understandable mistake as the shop can get very busy, make sure that dives are stamped & signed in your log book before you leave. ENTERTAINMENT: Went to a few shows in the theatre. Mister Iberostar was hilarious. The Mexican folklore night was OK. Movie night wasn\u2019t that great. Didn\u2019t like the magician. Exact same shows as last visit\u2026.maybe changing them up once a year for return guests would be a good idea. There were activities going on throughout the day, some on the beach, and some at the pool. I don\u2019t sit by the pool so I would have liked boards posted throughout the resort listing daily activities so you can check out what they are doing each day & see if you are interested in joining anything. Staff running shows and activities are very friendly & fun. STAFF: Overall most of the staff were friendly. Waiters were really good. Can\u2019t say the staff went above and beyond (we are always generous with tips) Front desk was a bit unorganized. Language was a barrier with a lot of the staff. Had to rely on my husband that can speak some Spanish to communicate several times. You seem to get different answers for just about anything you ask. Went to front desk having problem with the room safe & was told someone would come to the room right away. After a 40 minute wait & a phone call somebody finally showed up to fix it. CHECK OUT: Overall checkout went smoothly. Was once again not able to pay to keep a room for the day. If the hotel has any rooms this fee is $10 US per hour after 12pm checkout time. If you can\u2019t keep a room there are 2 shower rooms in the front of the lobby that you can use. Between the showers there is what is supposed to be a secure locked room for your luggage. Front desk will give you a ticket when you check out listing the number of bags you are checking in the room. You are supposed to have an employee take you into this room under supervision if you need to access your bags. This however did not happen. After spending the day on the beach, we came back to the shower rooms & found the room had been left open & was never locked once from the time we came to shower to the time we left the hotel. PLAYA DEL CARMEN: Taxi ride to Playa Del Carmen is $7.00 US from the hotel. Being the low season this visit the locals weren\u2019t relentless & more willing to bargain. A lot of things (like clothing) are very overpriced. Did have a few locals trying to sell us narcotics (even with a minor) Not too happy about that. EXCURSIONS: COZUMEL: Ferry ride (Ultramar) was $26 US round trip per person. Free wifi on the ferry. Different companies run at different times. You will be given a pamphlet when you purchase your tickets that will show you the times your ferry company will be departing from Cozumel. We took the 10am ferry with the latest return being 7pm. If you don\u2019t know how long you will be staying there or would like to come back at a later time I suggest only purchasing your tickets one way rather than round trip so you have options with return times. Cashier tried to overcharge for a second time when purchasing ferry tickets by keeping our change. Make sure you receive correct change in US currency & refuse pesos! We used the Iberostar there for diving & meals. We rented a minivan from Thrifty (always go with reputable company) $131.00 US full coverage. Return time for van was 7pm. If you rent there they will give you a map of the island\u2019s streets and gas stations (2 stations) If you want to snorkel at the money bar across from the hotel Americana (we did this last visit for free) you have to get a day pass from the hotel reception at a cost of $50 US per person. Not worth the fee. CHANKANAAB: Day pass was $21 US adult $14 under 12. Free admission with dolphin swim. Really nice park (not too big) with lots of attractions & great snorkeling. We loved it here. Only had a couple of hours so we just snorkeled, but there was also a dolphin discovery swim, sea lion and manatee show, diving, snuba, sea trek, volleyball, beach, lagoon, bar, ice cream shop (more on the web site) You can rent a locker for the day for $3.00 US. We snorkeled on the fenced side of the dock & got a really close look at the dolphins. They\u2019ll swim right up to the fence if they\u2019re in there! Would have loved to stay there for the day. Lots of different fish & coral to see. XPLOR: Awesome place! This is a must do!!! Cost online was $109 US. Cost from hotel with transfer was $120. Free locker. There are lots of zip lines, amphibious vehicle, river swim, river raft (done in the beautiful caves) & waterslide. Buffet & drinks are free. Really good food. Water shoes or strap on sandals are needed. 1 small over water zip line has hammock chairs to sit in, the rest require a harness. All other zip lines require you to start off on a pretty tall tower. If you don\u2019t like heights or have really small children this might not be for you. Everything else is child friendly. You wear numbered helmets that will set off cameras to take your picture throughout the park. All photos on usb for 6 people $164 - $45 for 1 photo. You can also order your photos off of the Xplor web site. They will only be there for 7 days after you visit. Same cost. EXTRAS & TIPS: Bikes are no longer free. They are $5.00 US for 1 hour or $7.00 for 2 hours. Not sure if you still get 30 minutes of internet usage per room. Wi-Fi is $15 US for 24 hours (has to be used consecutively) I think hotel should follow other hotels & offer this free for guests. There is a Starbucks about 5 minutes down the road that has free wifi. You will get your log in code printed on your receipt if you buy something there. It is the same code all the time for all of the Starbucks in the area & airport. Some small shops to browse around there too (cheaper than hotel shops)", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Springfield, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cGood quality resort in Playa\u201d", "Author": "Shellywms", "ReviewID": "UR126181146", "Content": "I have stayed at the Tucan a few times and I have never been dissapointed.

The beach is visable from the pool and the beach is great for walking. Lots of wildlife along with the flora and fauna. There are two paths on each side of the resort to navigate between the lobby and the beach.

I will try to summarize as best I can. Check-In & Check-Out: We arrived 2 hours before the stated check-in time, but was greeted by a friendly staff member and immediately given our room. We had an early transfer out and was told the day before that we could check out that evening and then drop the room key and towel card off the next morning. Again seemlessly we were proceeded and ready to leave. Just remember if you are going to pay for room charges with US currency you must have your passport with you. The room: If you are looking for luxury go somewhere else. However, if you want a clean and comfortable room in a beautiful location Tucan will suit you fine. I had emailed in advance asking for a room in building 12 - 15 and we were given room 1226. The buildings are 3 stories with no elevator so if you have an issue with stairs you may want to request ground floor. We were on the 2nd floor and loved it! The 1200 building is at the end of the jungle area and directly accross from the pool. We found this to be an exceptional area for us as we were within a very short walk to everything and yet far enough away from the theater so as not to be bothered by the music if we choose to retire early. The room provided a nice shower, amble room for hanging clothes, a lovely patio for early morning coffee and afternoon breaks, and a safe for our passports, valuables, etc... Many said the bed was hard but we found it to be comfortable. I will say for the ladies, the bathroom lighting is not bright and a lighted makeup mirror would have been nice to have packed had I known this prior. You might want to try to bring one with you. The beach and grounds: FANTASTIC! We enjoyed the grounds very much. The walk through the jungle brought something new to our attention each time we went through it. The path is uneven however, so if you have walking issues or have a child stroller the outside walks would be the better choice for you. Staff was endlessly working to keep everything trimmed, picked up, swept up, and perfect our entire trip and yet they seemed to never be intrussive upon us at anytime. The beach is wide with soft white sand and a wonderful shoreline - water shoes are not necessary as there are no rocks at entry. We had heard about sea weed being and issue and yes there is some each morning; however, the staff is out early racking it up and therefore it was of no issue to us. We did see one topless individual on the beach and found that to be in poor taste as there are many children there. I really do not believe this person was even staying at Tucan, but rather just walking - nonetheless everyone else was mindful to the fact this is a family type resort. Monkey Business: I loved watching them of a morning. We did find, however, while we were there that they were not in the center jungle area but rather along the Tucan/Riu fence. Look for them between building 12 and 15 just as other reviewers had indicated but on the outside parimeter and not in the middle. Also, the peacocks seem to stay in this general area also. The staff: Friendly, helpful, and fun! We did not encounter one individual that was anything less than friendly. We encountered one bartender who had poor english but most of the others are very fluenant in many languages (one I was speaking with is fluenant in 10!). I had a young bartender helping me with some of my spanish and 2 days later when I ran into him again he remembered me and threw a \"pop quiz\" at me! LOL! I do take a substantial amount of one-dollar bills with me and I do tip - the staff worked very hard to accomadate my needs or desires and I like to show my appreciation to them for their efforts! The pool: It is very large and nicely divided into activities, kids, and adult areas. We enjoyed the activities with water aerobics and the main pool area for swimming. We found the \"hot\" tub to be a \"cold\" tub and did not try it again during our stay. The adult swim up bar was a bit of a disappointment. It was somewhat out of the way, which was okay but it did appear dirty (we did wear our water shoes here) as some of the other reviewers had stated. There was no music or activities going on which might have made it more enjoyable. It was also closed one day and the second time we went there was only one other couple there. To many people go out early in the AM and reserve the sun loungers with a towel and then are never in them - aggravating, but again it is not Tucans fault and I'm uncertain how they would be able to monitor this. The animation team: OUTSTANDING!!! If you cannot find something to do with all they offer it is your own fault! They worked tirelessly to make things fun though the beach activities, water activities, and the nightly shows. You saw this young group of people from sunrise to way after dark and they were always friendly and would stop and chat and invite you to their next event. The beach party was a blast and the chefs took me behind the counter and even let me help cook! The nightly shows were very entertaining as well. One thing (although our kids are grown) was how they did not ever forget the kids and did a very nice job of having equal activities and fun for both, adults and children. Hats off to this top notch group of young people! Food: Sorry, but I'm not the best one to give food tips as I go for the sun and beach - food is a just a necessity to me, but I'll sum up as best I can. The main buffets do have some repetiion but that is to be expected. That being said I always found amble food to eat. We did go to the steak house one night and it was good and a nice break to eat a relaxing meal instead of an on-the-go as we tend to do on our vacations. We also went to the hibatchi resturant one evening. I would have to say it was my favorite as I love this type of cooking and food. The chef's cooking show was entertaining and the food very good. The ice cream on the beach seemed to be a great hit to all young and old. Bars & Drinks: The bartenders and staff are very attentive and try to get to you as quickly as possible....be kind as sometimes they are trying to serve very large crowds. The beer on tape is Dos Equis which was fantastic for us as we drink that in the states often. The drinks were pretty much whatever you wanted, they seemed to have a good knowledge of most cocktails. If the drink was not strong enough for you - ask for more liquor, they will accomodate! Overall: Great vactation spot for families and those who do not need the \"wilder\" side of a beach vacation. Pleanty of activies to participate in if you wanted and enough seclusion from it if you did not. Beautiful and clean grounds. Friendly, fun, and helpful staff. All in all - no complaints worth mentioning! I wish the weather had been nicer, but that has nothing to do with the resort!

It was his first trip to Mexico and he said it was his best trip ever. I had booked the Tucan side but ended up on the Quetzal side. Sunwing's useless at answering requests and their webside hadn't allowed me to select a room with two beds. So I wrote to rrpptucque at the resort who said they couldn't guarantee my request. She was useless too; she hadn't even entered the request into the system. But the receptionist at the desk was great and found us a room with double beds. I had asked for a second or third floor but ended up on the ground floor which was fine. Looked like it was mating season for the peacocks so we had our coffee, every morning, watching the antics of the peacocks. I had read that the beds were hard. They are but we slept well. The next morning, I requested a foam pillow top. Either way, the beds were fine. The rooms are the only thing I would give three stars to at the resort. There's nothing wrong with them. They're smallish, they're nothing special and they need to be renovated. The resort is a solid 4 star and the service and the food are 5 star all the way. The hotel employees have had excellent training in customer service. Pablo, the Customer Service rep on the Tucan side, is very nice, very friendly and very helpful. We had to line up only once to book all our dinner reservations for the week and changing them was never a problem. I had booked a tour to Chichen Itza with Viator. Pablo called to ask how to go about confirming the hotel pickup since their North American phone number doesn't exist. The rep at the hotel (not an IB employee) snarled at me for pre-booking and wasn't at all nice about it (because he didn't get the commission, I guess) but he did his job and got my son and his friend (staying elsewhere) on the tour. They LOVED it; they were given beer and food all day and they went swimming in a cenote. They said the tour guide was EXCELLENT. (I told them he would be. Mexico is very good at selecting and training tour guides.) The resort is beautiful. We preferred the Quetzal side because of its vegetation and bird life but the Tucan is fabulous too. It's really the same resort. The pool is never crowded. The beach is fabulous. The service, second to none. The Japanese restaurant was entertaining and the food was good. We'd read that we should try the lamb at the Italian restaurant so we did. The reviews were right! The lamb is delicious and just melts in your mouth. My son said it was the best lamb he'd ever had in his life. I agreed. The tenderloin at the steak house was also nice, tender and done perfectly. We had dinner at the buffet only once. The food was good. One night we ate in Playa on Fifth Avenue and another night, at Xcaret at their dinner show. The location of the resort is perfect. You can walk into town in about half an hour. We stopped to use the free WiFi at Starbucks at the Playacar Plaza, just five minutes down the street from the resort, so we didn't time the walk. When we got home, my son asked his father, \"How do you walk with her? She walks so slowly!\" So you wouldn't want to depend on me for timing. :-) If you walk down the beach, you arrive at Senor Frogs in Playa del Carmen, ready for refreshments! The lobby bars are a great gathering place for pre or after dinner drinks. They have quiet entertainment and again, good service. The evening entertainment put on by the star friends was okay. I really enjoyed the music of the disco era one night. My son... not so much. :) The Miss Iberostar was funny/entertaining/boring/cheesy. We didn't stay till the end. (He'd had enough.) We tended to sit up by the bar and the pool tables. I kept him busy getting our drinks; he enjoyed chatting with the bartender who was having a ball dancing and singing while mixing drinks. We would have enjoyed the Folkloric Show but didn't get to see it. We went to Xcaret one day. It was okay. One day I wandered around the gated community of Puerto Aventuras, had lunch and watched the dolphins while he climbed the pyramid at Coba and had lunch in Tulum. PA is where you can swim with the dolphins. What a beautiful place, only 15 minutes from Playa. The only downside to the resort is the swim-up bar. It's nice at the Iberostar Cozumel. Fabulous at the Iberostars in Puerto Morelos. Not great at Tucan Quetzal. It's set off by itself in a secluded little pool that needs to be redone and repainted. The week we were there the same loud guests were on the same stools the entire week. They were friendly enough and asked us to join them. I politely declined explaining that I am allergic to smoke (which I am). My son wasn't crazy about their music choice. (They didn't like the birds or monkeys or solitude, they had to create noise by bringing their own boom box.) (No comment.) We didn't spend a lot of time there. The restaurants are smoke-free and they have separate areas in the lobby bars for non-smokers but you can't get away from smokers at the swim-up bar. I just don't remember smoking being an issue at the other Iberostars. Not that I would recommend the others over the Tucan Quetzal. The others are a bit nicer / newer but they're way too big (do you really want to walk half a mile from the lobby to the beach?) and they're 15 minutes from town which can get expensive when you have to take cabs all the time. We took a cab back from Playa to our resort. I had read that the cab ride was $5, $7, $8... so I gave him a $10, said thanks and took off. He didn't say anything; seemed satisfied with it. I LOVE Mexico and can't wait to go back. With my husband next time. :) Would I go back to the Tucan Quetzal? Absolutely. Looking forward to it! I'm an Iberostar fan. I just wish they'd offer free WiFi. Someone told me that what they charge for WiFi is crazy expensive.

We requested a king bed and topper and both requests were granted. Our room was in building 1600 which was an ideal location, halfway between lobby and beach. We loved the jungle walkways, and were like kids looking at the various animals. Only disappointment was we didn't see any of the monkeys. The pool was large and very nice. Our room was very clean and well appointed. The grounds are beautifully maintained. The beach is beautiful, there was a lot of seaweed, as noted in most reviews, but they did their best to keep it cleaned up. The water was a little rough for most of our stay but still beautiful and warm. We took a cab to the 5th Ave shops and walked back, nice long walk on the beach. Also walked to the smaller shopping area nearby, only about 5 minutes, and this was a very nice shopping area as well. It felt very safe walking in both directions from the resort, both on the beach and on the road. We also took a half-day tour to Tulum, which we both enjoyed. Because our stay was short, we could only reserve one restaurant in advance, but each day you can go to the reservation desk and see if anything is open for that night, which we did on 2 days so we did get to try 3 restaurants, the Italian, Japanese and Tropical. Would definitely recommend Italian and Japanese, Tropical was not bad. The buffet was excellent for breakfast, lunch and also dinner.

The hotel and grounds are very pretty, but we all found it lacking in many ways. To start the trip off we had issues with getting the correct rooms (there were 3 rooms of family in total with small children). We had to ask 4 times on 3 days (somehow it never got into the computer system) after we got there to get adjoining rooms since they somehow missed the 2 requests for it prior to arriving. When we got to our rooms we had to call to get cribs, again this was requested when making the reservations and when we checked in. This was after we had to fight to get the 3 rooms even in the same building. They did offer sitters for an extra charge, which were great, just the process of booking one was very difficult. Out of the 6 days we requested one we were only confident ahead of time for 3 days that we actually had one coming. The communication portion was greatly lacking. The pools were very pretty, the only issue was that they were too deep to touch unless on the very edge where you enter, thus you had to swim the length of the pool which is difficult, even more so trying to hold any sort of a drink and or push a baby in a floatie. The children's pool was warm and shallow which was a plus, but it lacked any sort of interest. It was just a round pool, which works, it just would have been nice to have some sort of a fountain or interest. The swim up bar was in a separate adults only area (which I understand), but it was at least 8-10 degrees colder than the regular pool and we really couldn't stand to be in unless you were sitting in full sun. Oh yeah the pool was completely surrounded by tall lush greenery, beautiful, but the sun was gone by 3 at the latest. Our last issue was with the food. Somehow we all missed in the reviews that there were limited reservations available for the A la carte restaurants. We stayed 7 nights and were allotted 3 reservations. We were able to visit all 5 of the restaurants, but out of the 6 of us the most that really enjoyed any 1 given meal was 2. I personally did not love any of it. It is sad when all of us stated that the buffet the last 2 nights was the best food we had eaten for dinner. The breakfast buffets were very nice, a lot to choose from. Lunches up by the main lobby were the same, but the pool side locations were greatly lacking and pretty much the same everyday. Overall I would give the food a C.

It is located directly on a large sandy beach (reconstructed a couple of years ago), which slopes gently into the sea. It is possible to walk for at least 30 minutes along the beach both north towards Playa del Carmen, which can be reached via the beach in about 40 minutes, and south away from the hotel zone. The hotel (both the grounds, common areas and rooms) is immaculately clean and well maintained. The food is plentiful and although the choice is sometimes a little repetative we always found something that we liked. The pastries served in the morning are particularly good. The staff are both professional, friendly and happy to chat if you wish to speak with them. The reception staff were particularly helpful this year, spending a good 20 minutes helping to relocate us from our allocated room when we were unhappy with its location.

Last year we were on the Quetzal side facing the jungle in building 25. We loved it there waking up to the monkeys, peacocks etc. Absolutly no complaints with that area. This year we were on the Tucan side in building 11. At first we were a little disappointed that we were not in the jungle but I have to say this was perfect as well. We were closer to the pool and I was able to \"claim\" our seats each morning. Yes, its anoying that you have to get up early if you want \"your\" perfect spot but I knew what I wanted and where so I was willing to get up. Knowing that the beds were not super comfortable as soon as we arrived to our room we ordered the extra padding for the beds. This makes a huge difference and I would highly suggest it for all that perfer sleeping on a softer bed. We tipped the maid a couple bucks for making up our bed again. We tipped our maid $2-3 daily for making up our room. These individulals work so hard and are so appreciative. The room size is average. We have 2 boys (10 and 13) so one of them slept on the couch/bed per choice. We came to the resort with 3 other families with children the same age as ours. They swam, enjoyed all the activities and played Uno, Doodle Dice and other card games by the pool for hours when they needed a break from the sun. The weather was AMAZING the entire week we were there. One suggestion when on the beach is to bring your own \"CUPS/MUGS\". Your cup you bring will be larger and insulated then the plastic cups that are provided. The bar tenders will gladly fill yours up instead...bigger drink...faster buzz ...plus you don't have to stand in line as much. Rafael has worked at the pool bar by the beach and is amazing! Super friendly! We remembered him from last year and I have to say he was just as friendly. He can make a GREAT Coco-Loco! Just remember to ask him to add more rum. More rum makes for less calories when drinking the sugary drinks. The icecream in the afternoon by the pool is also good. We loved the coconut and highly suggest it!! The grounds of the entire complex are always super clean! The beach is combed everyday and the workers remove the seaweed each morning that washes up on the beach. You won't notice that there is even seaweed that washes up if you don't get up super early. Walking each morning through the jungle is a great way to start the day. Seeing the monkeys every morning (around 8 a.m.) and then in the afternoon (around 4) was always fun for the kids as well as all the other animals. The entire complex is set in a lush tropical rainforest with almost no bugs. You can choose to walk along the rainforest or through the rainforest. In the morning I enjoyed exercising along the paved cement path along the the entire complex. I always felt safe and was always greeted with a smile and hello by any workers that walked past me. I also worked out in the gym each morning. Its not a huge gym but it did the job of burning off some unwanted calories. The free weights only go up to 50 pounds, they have 3 treadmills, 2 ellipticals, 2 bikes, a couple benches with bars. I also did the water aerobics in the pool each day. They do the same routine each day which can be a good thing for those that are new to exercising or repetitive for those of us that work out daily. Either way its fun and again burned some extra calories. I also did the yoga and that too is very basic and more of a stretching class but enjoyable. Now onto the food...the buffett is huge and has many choices. I loved breakfast! Each day I had an egg white omelette with tomatos, green peppers, onions and cheese. AWESOME! The kids enjoyed the donuts, french toast and bacon. The fruit was also amazing as well. For lunch I loved to have a big plate of chips, guac and salsa. Dinner we ate at the Japanese restaurant, Italian Restaurant and the Steak House. I would also rate the dinners in that order as the Japenses restaurant was really good. The water is safe in downtown Playa as well so no worries. We also went to Playa for 2 nights for dinner as well ($7 taxi ride). Downtown Playa is very safe with many families walking around shopping and eating. The kids enjoyed finding their souvenirs. The kids loved all the activities throughout the day. They tried shooting the guns, did the pool games at noon, played soccer on the beach at 4. We also kayaked, windsurfed and sailed on the catamaran (all provided for free from the resort). The shows at night were also good. My only complaint is that they start to late for families that have started their day early. The show starts at 9:30 and 8:30 would be a better time in my opinion. By 9:30 I'm exhausted from getting up by 6-7 a.m. and being at the beach all day. They do a great job of entertaining everyone and would highly suggest seeing a couple of them as they are fun to watch. The other biggest complaint I had was again they do not provide free internet. With this day and age free wifi in the lobby would allow you to check your email and check with your family at home if needed. The internet is quite costly for those of us who need to check in with work daily. You can walk down to Starbucks closer into town but when you need to just do a quick check twice a day it becomes frustrating. Overall a great trip once again with family and friends! I would suggest this place to all families who are looking for a fun trip that will provide for many memories.

The pool area is great with lots of shady/sunny areas. The beach was nice and wide with volleyball nets and lots of lounges also. I had a great time painting a plate. When I wasn't sure which one I wanted to paint they told me I could design my own. The next day they drew my design on a plate! When I was finished they did the accents.

We agonized over where to go, Costa Rica, Aruba, DR but finally settled on Cancun because it was the easiest place for our 2 older sons to get to from where they are in Missouri and Virginia. Tucan is absolutely beautiful. The grounds are unique. The jungle area between the lobby and the pool was really cool. Lots of monkeys, peacocks and other animals. The pool is beautiful. The beach is great and of course the waters of the Carribean can't be beat. The staff was great. Very friendly. The rooms are really nice and clean as is the entire property. Since I can subsist on guacamole and chips I didn't need gourmet style food but nevertheless the food was certainly good enough. A long as you know that you are not going to be getting gourmet meals then you won't be dissapointed. Make a reservation at the Japanese restaurant - good food and lots of fun. About the dive shop associated with the hotel... It is a separate entity and the staff was very nice as were the dive instructors. It was just the refund policy that was troublesome. We were scheduled to go snorkeling one afternoon but the it was to choppy so they told us we had to go another day. That really didn't fit into our tight schedule so we asked for a refund and they would not give it to us. The only give you a credit for a future trip. Also the particular place that they took us snorkeling was pretty bad. None of this is a reflection on Iberostar Tucan and again the people at the dive shop were really nice so my advice is to wait to pay for any diving/snorkeling until the last minute.

This is an objective review of the Tucan Hotel by Ibero Star in Playa Car, Mexico for a 14 night stay in February 2012. We traveled from Gatwick with First Choice holidays. The flight was quite long at close to 11 hours, this was due to a strong head wind all the way. The flight was due to leave at 09:30 but did not get away until 11:30. We had standard seats and to be honest the leg room was fine, I am 6' 1'' tall. Unless you want to upgrade your seats I would not bother. The transfer to the hotel takes a little over an hour. By this time it was dark so nothing to say other than it was not an unpleasant ride and the coach looked clean Etc. The immediate impression of the hotel is one of large open spaces, lots of marble, high ceilings and a nice relaxing atmosphere. The check in was good, no problems. Our room was the standard one that the hotel offers. It did have a musty smell upon our arrival but we opened the balcony doors and the front door, had a blast around with my deodorant spray and after a little while it was fine. We were in block 18. This is close to reception and the buffet, Japanese and Mexican restaurants. We opted for a top floor location with a balcony. The room was a good size with plenty of space. It was comfortable, adequately furnished and brightly decorated. We had a table, chair and a sofa that we felt may have been convertible into a second bed if required. Our bed was a king sized one and although it was quite hard it was comfortable and probably good for your back. There was a good sized wardrobe and this contained the ironing facilities and the free safe. Our room also had a coffee maker, TV and mini bar with water, soft drinks and beer. If we are honest it is probably a 3* plus room but we liked it as it was pleasant. However, if we had booked the hotel for a plush room we would have been disappointed. The bathroom itself was of a reasonable size, without a bath, but with a nice, well powered, spacious shower. The hair dryer is located in the bathroom and so is the bottle opener. Complimentary shower gel and shampoo was provided and we had a plentiful supply of towels. Again, ditto comments above about it not being plush. The balcony was of a sensible size for two people and the furniture consisted of 2 plastic chairs and a table. We also had a dryer for hanging out the washing. The view from the balcony was of the jungle and the edge of reception; nothing much to see to be honest. A big thank you to the animals for the 06:00 wake up calls every morning :-) The hotel has a small spa that is equipped with Jacuzzi(s) and steam room(s). The spa offered a number of treatments. None of the treatments are very well priced and seemed expensive to us. We did try the hot stone massage as this was on special offer for two people. We found this treatment to be very relaxing. The gift shops offer the normal array to T-shirts, toiletries, cards and bric-a-brac. The hotel also has a jewelry shop. In our opinion it's worth looking at the shops at Plaza Playa Car or in Playa del Carmen before you decide on your purchase. Guest / room service. On the Tuesday of our stay it was Valentines Day, so I ordered the following to be delivered to our room at 08:30 as a special treat for my wife. * Champagne. This arrived at 08:50. * Fresh orange to make bucks fizz. This never arrived and I went to the Tucan bar to collect it my self. * Cheese and strawberries. These arrived at 08:50. * Red roses in a bouquet. These arrived at 10:00. I'll let you decide if this was good service... The bars are as you would expect from an all inclusive hotel, the drinks are fast and in plentiful supply. The drinks are actually fine, as is the service. A nice drink to try is one called BBC (banana, Baileys, coconut). The Tucan bar may have better quality brands, it's hard to tell, perhaps it was just the setting that made them feel more upmarket. Wifi. Now you should know that this is a pet hate of ours. We feel that it is quite ridiculous in this day and age to be asked to pay for this service. It is our opinion that wifi access should be free in almost all circumstances. Wifi is a vital tool for life in the 21st century and to charge for it when a facility is in place in a given location is just a ripoff. So poor show to all concerned for this... Go to Starbucks down the road, turn right out of the hotel and walk for about 10 minutes to the aforementioned Plaza Playa Car shops and you will see it. The wifi is free and as always the coffee is wonderfully good. The Wifi pass code Etc. will be on your receipt. With regard to the in house entertainment shows. We really did not go to see many of these. We went to the magic show and I fell asleep! My wife said it was okay. All we can really add is that they seemed to be well rehearsed, and the energy and enthusiasm of the participants was evident. The shows were well attended by the other guests, and this in itself is probably a good indication of how much they were liked. The restaurants are okay. To be honest they are what you tend to get with all inclusive hotels. Not bad in themselves but it is always going to be impossible to make an entirely successful transformation from daytime buffet / pool side snack bar to evening speciality establishment. The permanent restaurants such as the Japanese are better than the other afore mentioned. The food is quite edible. A large choice is available and we can see no reason why anyone would complain. Once again it is what we were expecting from an all inclusive hotel. If you want food that is more in keeping with a pay-as-you-go hotel then perhaps all inclusive is not going to be the thing for you. The beach is large with clean soft sand. Numerous sun beds and fixed parasols are available. The sea is easy to get into and the sea bed is soft sand, beach shoes are not required. The pool is very large and also quite deep in most places, chest high on myself and close to chin high on my wife. The steps into the water are a little misleading, the last step is twice as high as the others. The first time you go down into the water the last step gives you a little surprise by dumping you in! The pool does have a shallow area that is at the beach end of the pool. A separate child pool is also available next to the good sized climbing frame / child play area. Around the pool itself are a large number of sun beds and fixed parasols. Although they do have a lot of these they tend to get taken quite early in the morning. There is very little provision for outside seating with tables and the only place we found was close to the beach on a small patio area close to the beach snack bar. The jungle and the animals are the stars of this hotel. The monkeys are a little elusive but if you do keep looking you are sure to see them in the tree tops even if just for fleeting moments. The other animals are more in abundance than the monkeys and if you have young children the animals are sure to delight them. The jungle pathways wind down from the just behind the buffet restaurants to the pool. The pathways intersect each other and you will not get lost if you keep heading down you will end up at the pool. During the evening these pathway are romantically lit up. If you prefer you can walk to the pool / beach via the room blocks and avoid the jungle. The location of this hotel is about a 45 minutes to an hours walk outside Playa del Carman; to the left as you look out to sea. We walked up the beach one day and we were please to see the town and Se\u00f1or Frogs bar by the time we arrived. We also walked one day on the road into the town, not much to see on the way apart from villas. If you take the taxi back and it cost \u00a34.00 without the tip. On another day we went for a walk down the beach to the right as you look out to sea. After about 10 minutes you come to a wide and undeveloped stretch of sand that has the jungle backing onto it. This beach is totally natural and just the place to chill out away from the music, people and bars of the hotel. If you keep walking for a further 20 to 30 minutes the people diminish until just a few remain, perhaps looking for solitude as we were. Eventually you come to a rocky outcrop that impedes further easy progress. Playa Car has a shopping mall, Plaza Playa, that is to the right of the hotel as you exit the main entrance. It is about 10 minutes walk and has the normal array of souvenir shops selling an assortment of Mexican gifts. No bars, but they do have a Starbucks coffee house. With regard to insect bites. We have noticed that a number of holiday makers have said about this problem. We always use a sun screen that has a built in insect repellant. We had no problems with insect bites. We actually did not see much in the way of insects or spiders of any kind during our stay. Perhaps the animals and birds act as a natural pest control at the Tucan? The weather was a little erratic during our February stay. It was quite hot most days, like a nice English summers day. However, just like England the rain or clouds could come almost out of nowhere, although the rain did not last very long. Some evenings the sea breeze was a little cooling. We recommend brining one or two long sleeved garments if you come at this time of year. The other guests came from a wide number of countries. We did not see any drunk guests, or notice any bad or disruptive behavior during our stay. The hotel money exchange rate is close to that offered in Playa del Carman. We used the hotel as we were not changing up large sums. In conclusion. The hotel is an all inclusive establishment. The food, drinks, service, and the presentation do reflect the all inclusive status. The hotel is like many such in the word, a bit of a guest factory, but not at all oppressive in its approach to this type of service. We felt that the room was pleasant, functional and met our needs for a nice holiday. All of the staff we met were friendly, helpful, and pleasant to deal with, as were the Mexican people outside of the hotel. In the end you get what you pay for and we did purchase this holiday on a late deal at a considerably reduced price. Some years ago we paid quite a bit more and stayed at another Ibero Star hotel a little way up the coast, the Paraiso Maya. This was better than the Tucan, in our opinion... We did have a very nice relaxing time at the Tucan and would recommend this hotel if you are a younger family with children or if you have grand children with you. Perhaps if you are a little older and without children then this may not prove to be the best choice for you. To be honest its not a bad hotel at all regardless of your age. Enjoy the Tucan for what it is. Do not look for the hotel to be something other than an all inclusive beach / pool hotel with the added extra of the jungle and animals. Tips for the hotel management to improve the establishment. - The rooms could do with airing before your guests arrive. - Bath robes would be a welcome addition. - Some extra plug sockets would be an advantage in the rooms as people tend to have more electronic equipment than they did a few years ago. - The spa is overpriced by about 25%. - Wifi needs to be free. - More tables and seating outside by the pool for guests that would like to sit rather than lay in the sun. Last thing. Nothing at all to do with, First Choice Holidays, the Tucan Hotel or indeed Ibero Star. The airport at Cancun shows little evidence of any organisation, just a confusion of queuing and form filling in upon arrival. Then when you think its all over you get to press, \"The Button!\" If the light is green, \"Ta-Dar\", you can move on, if the light is red, \" Ho-Hum\", you get to open all your luggage up and show it to a customs official who was o so much less interested than we were by this ridiculous pantomime. Full marks to the Mexican government for making entry into their country as hard as possible. One has to wonder if they actually wanted us to come to Mexico and spend our hard earned money. So 1/10 for Cancun airport. Procedures need to be reviewed as you look most unprofessional indeed. When you go home you have to pay the airport \u00a342 each to leave Mexico, thats a lot of money in our opinion. Although we have to add that leaving the country was far more organised, certainly First Choice had a hand in this. The baggage check in was very well set up with lots of First Choice staff on hand to help and explain what was going.", "Date": "February 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "La Tuque, Quebec, Canada", "Title": "\u201cJust Great!!!!\u201d", "Author": "Chantal5583", "ReviewID": "UR125082582", "Content": "we stayed at the Iberostar Quetzal for 7 days( february 10 till 17 2012) and it was wonderful.

The Tucan is located in Playacar amid numerous hotels and beach houses. Despite sharing facilities with the Quetzal, Tucan has its own lobby and we loved the high ceilings covered in thatched roofs as well as open breezeways. Checking in was quick and they put us in building 14 as requested prior to arrival. It was midway to the beach and to the lobby so we didn't feel like walking too far to any facility. Our room was on the third floor and there are no elevators. If you don't feel like lugging your luggage upstairs, you can ask the front desk to have it delivered to your room. Based on comments regarding the beds (I kid you not, hard as a rock), we also requested a mattress topper but it wasn't placed when we got there. We found the housekeeper on our floor and in haphazard Spanish, we asked for it and by the time we got back to the room, they were able to accomodate us. Our balcony faced the trees where monkeys reside and we heard them every morning and at dusk. We also got paid multiple visits by some of them so that was a cool treat, behind glass doors of course. The grounds have some cool animals like peacocks, agoutis, pheasants, iguanas, swans and more, that seeing them everyday reinforces that jungle feel. Once we got settled in, we immediately went to the lobby (pyramid booth near the lobby bar) to reserve for the specialty restaurants. For 7 nights, we are given 3 choices out of the 5. We wanted to reserve one on our first night there, but as a bonus, they don't count that as one of 3. Instead, we were able to reserve 3 more times! Of all the restaurants, we enjoyed the steak house the best. Second was the Japanese one (the show was pretty cool). We thought the food at the Mexican (La Hacienda) and the Italian (La Gondola) restaurants was pretty disappointing. But like everywhere in the hotel, the staff was exceptional. The buffet food was average and after eating it a couple days in a row, the specialty restaurants were a nice break. For drinks, the lobby bar is indeed the best to have stronger drinks. They have top shelf liquor and the staff are more than happy to accommodate when you ask by name. The hotel has a great stretch of beach and they make it an effort to clean it in the morning from all the seaweed from the night before. I guess like everywhere else, the hotel lets you know that reserving a chair or a palapa early in the morning is not cool but everyone does it anyway. Besides, how can they really enforce that rule? For the most part, we got to the beach around 8:30 in the morning and we were able to find a chair by the pool or a palapa on the beach. The one day we got to the pool/beach around 10, finding a chair is like playing the lottery. The main pool is gorgeous and expansive only we noticed that not a lot of people were in it. Once we got in, we realized why: its 5 feet high, not conducive to hanging out without having to tread water the whole time. They have free daily scuba try outs which require the depth but its a shame that the pool is under utilized by guests. We never went to the swim up bar because it didn't look too inviting. It was shady so the water was colder than the pool and was isolated from the rest of the area. For the days we decided to go to downtown Playa, we took a cab as we found out the first day, walking to town was about a 30 minute walk. It cost $7 a trip and its a fixed rate. Before heading out to Playa one day, we asked reception for a recommendation for a nice Mexican restaurant and they gave us a card for La Parilla (5th ave and 8 calle). The card was a coupon for a welcome margarita and yes, the place comes highly recommended. On the day we took a ferry to Cozumel, we rented a scooter and stopped by sister hotel Iberostar Cozumel for lunch. Once you show your wristband to the reception folks, they give you another wristband and you have access to their buffet area. Overall we had a great experience with the hotel and the atmosphere. It was very laid back and we'd like to thank the hardworking and wonderful staff that made our stay wonderful. We let the staff that took care of us know how much we appreciate them by tipping them accordingly. We've been to Cancun prior to visiting Playa and I think I prefer Playa better. If you want to taken care of without blowing your budget, I would highly recommend the Iberostar Tucan.", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver", "Title": "\u201cmjhawes1@mac.com\u201d", "Author": "MJH161", "ReviewID": "UR124839583", "Content": "We spent 4 nights here and that was just the right amount of time for us -- we were ready to move on.

Dislikes: have to wear a wristband 24/7 which is ok at the hotel but bothersome if you go to town ($7 cab ride or an hour walk along the beach), drinks are watery (you can counter by asking for a double), food at buffet is good for a buffet but not 4-5 star, specialty restaurants access somewhat limited (have to make a new reservation every day, only 1 specialty place per 4 day stay), tv set up only for pay per view, pretty crowded at times, evening shows lame, shower was tricky to use.

If you are looking for a party resort, this is not the place for you. I loved the laid back feeling of every area in the Tucan. It was very nice being able to walk around together, enjoying the scenery and just having fun taking pictures etc without the hassles of a million people trying to get by you etc. In the mornings after breakfast, we would walk through the jungle, out to the lobby bar and enjoy a cappucino together with no hassles of finding a place to sit. If you are someone with a disablity visiting this hotel, there is quite a bit of walking to get around. We stayed in room 1141 - Which cut the walking down by a lot. We were literally a 2 minute walk to one of the buffet restraunts pool and beach... I really appreciated that. It was more so the walk to the other restaurants, or front lobby that could get exhausting. Someone we had met down there also had mentioned the walking to and from was very aggrivating on his ashthma. I should mention too - that there were no elevators, and although only being 3 floors up, we still had 35 stairs to walk up to our rooms. If you are in fine health though, I really don't think the walking or stairs would be any problem at all :-) If you would like to go down to the lobby area for drinks and music later in the evening and want to get dressed up - I would suggest carrying your heels so you don't have to deal with all the bumps on the paths. Plus, as beautiful as it looks with \"moodlighting\" on the walk-ways...It is pretty hard to see at night. I constantly thought I was going to step on an iguana or something creepy, or trip and twist my ankle lol. Speaking of iguanas... If you do not like them, you may not like how many there are here. And they are everywhere!! Big ones and little ones hahah... Initally I did not want to go to a resort where iguanas would just be walking around, but honestly...as much as I find them creepy, it was pretty cool. They won't chase you or bother you lol. There are also all sorts of other animals - everywhere! One night we saw a peacock who had come into the lobby bar (some people were feeding it popcorn lol) They were also in the lobby and so were the little rat creatures. I find the little rats cute. The peacocks, not so much. They are freaky and they will follow you!! Not to worry about the animals though, they aren't near your food or anything like that. The parrots and macaws that are in the lobby area are very cute and very beautiful. There are also tucans, turtles, fish, birds, some little racoon type creatures and monkeys all in the jungle area. Everyone else seemed to see the monkey's close up. We were able to catch a small glimpse of some...but they were super high up in the tree. They are very loud though, it is pretty funny! On the resort, in the pool area, a photographer will also come around (I am not sure what time of day, or what days exactly) with a certain animal you can get your picture taken with. They have a parrot, a huge iguana..and a tiny spider monkey. We were lucky enough to catch them with the spider monkey and got some pics done. His name was Simba and he was sooo cute - It was one of my favorite parts of our trip. They take (I think) 3 or 4 shots different shots, and then you can go and pick which one(s) you like from the photo center in the lobby. The pictures are pretty pricey, 15 dollars each, but you also get a disk with the ones you purchase on it, so that is nice :-) Onto FOOD... If you are interested in eating at one of the a la carte places - Make your reservations as soon as you check in... If they allow it, I would say to even make them in advanced before you check-in. We wanted to try the steakhouse, but were not able to get a reservation until our 4th night there and at 9:30pm. By 9:30, you are either starved to death, ready for bed or would like to enjoy a few drinks...Needless to say, we never did make it there. We did however, try the mexican restaurant. The food was alright - I had red snapper with chipotle sauce (the serving size was good). and my boyfriend had steak tacos (they looked super tiny and I can't imagine he felt even near full). They have a little stand with some other goodies on it, but - It wasn't anything spectacular or that I would tell someone they must try while down there. We felt it could have been way more authentic, being in Mexico and all :-) I enjoyed the other buffets which reservations were not needed, a lot more. Lots to choose from. Breakfast time is what got repetitive..But there was always one thing new each day. The little blueberry muffins were really good! The coffee is not that great, but they will make you a cappucino or espresso if you ask. To go into downtown Playa it is only a $7 cab ride. The hotel will call a cab for you and they are readily available when you want to go home. It was really neat to walk around, check out all the souvenier places etc. There are lots of bars and restaurants too. Personally though, I would not go down there at night, due to the constant and I mean CONSTANT nagging and offering of drugs that happens just during the daytime. I can only imagine how it would be down there at night - yikes. lol It was pretty uncomfortable at times, because you wouldn't even want to put your head up to look around. However, if you can look past that - downtown has some pretty amazing things - They had a tiger cub (right on the street!) that you could actually hold and take your picture with. Of course we did it and it was one of the highlights of our trip! Cons: The beds are SUPER hard. When I had read the reviews from others mentioning this, I didn't really care or think much of it. But, there is definitely no exaggeration when we say they are hard...Unless you are used to sleeping on concrete :)) However, after a few nights, you won't really notice - just takes some getting used to :-) Room service is only available from 11am-11pm. The \"main course\" types of food are not so great, but the brownie and apple tart are very good! Room service also does not deliver drinks (cokes, beer etc). They will ask the maid to bring that to you. There is a restaurant open 24 hours - I think it was called Cozumel... I am not sure where it was located on the resort, as we never checked. Therefore I won't be able to tell anyone what they serve, whether it is meals or just snacks - sorry! I wasn't fond of the room service hours, as sometimes we just like to relax in bed after a long day in the sun, have a snack and watch a movie. We really didn't feel like getting out of bed, getting dressed, then venturing around to find the 24 hour place. Mini-Bar fridge is only filled every other day. They give one big bottle of water, a few smaller bottles of water, a couple of beers, soft drinks and some sort of juice. The bottled beer in your fridge is the only bottled beer you will get on the resort. They serve it on draft everywhere else on the resort. Get to the pool or beach area EARLY on nice days. Even though you are asked to not reserve spots for yourself, it seems everyone does. People will leave their towels/belongings under the palapas, on the beach chairs and on the beach beds ALL day. I find this very ignorant. We are pretty laid back people, but it was to the point of frustrating not being able to sit anywhere - so we would just keep wandering around or going back into the restraunt. The hotel really needs to enforce the no reserve rule to make it fair for other travelers wishing to enjoy the sun :-) Oh, one thing I wanted to mention too was - Males also will clean the female washrooms. This might make some people uncomfortable. I know it did for me, especially when I was the only person in there at the time. I got over it though - It is nothing that would stop me from returning. If you have any questions, I would be happy to answer the best I can.

Location of the resort in Playacar is extremely SAFE with many security checkpoints & they really do check. Rooms on the 2nd and 3rd floor are worth getting or waiting for as our first room on the 1st floor had a musty/moldy smell. We stayed in the 1200 building which is closer to the beach.

You could walk to shops close by, it was safe and nice for an evening stroll. The evening entertainment was also fun, with the \"Star Friends\" keeping everyone involved.

Drinks served at the adults only sunken pool bar were OK but top shelf was available on request with a tip to the friendly bartenders. As an all incusive resort you never felt like the servers were pressuring you for a tip and in most cases a few pesos went a long way with people you delt with daily. The only negative was reserving of beach lounges by people very early and then being vacant most of the day. The hotel has a policy frowning on that but it is not enforced apparently to keep from upsetting guests. The location is a plus if you like to go outside the boundaries of the resort.

I had to put my own \u2018package\u2019 together last minute but all worked very well \u2013 booked hotel directly with Iberostar hotels, transfers with \u2018USA Transfers\u2019 (they were very accurate and prompt with pick up times, fees and promised service, found them via Tripadvisor!), we flew to Cancun with Delta Airlines from Buffalo via Atlanta), 45-60 min drive to the hotel from Cancun airport, depends on traffic. Overall great hotel, very happy with all aspects of our stay (chose based on Tripadvisor reviews!). Room was great, clean, bright design, comfortable, it is one of a very few hotels that take family with two teenage kids in one room, most hotels make you book two rooms\u2026 Bathroom clean, everything worked properly, no stains, leaks, very good water pressure any time, plenty of hot water. We had two queens or double beds and separate \u2018build in\u2019 couch with mattress, linens were provided \u2013 so each girl got her own bed and they were very happy with this arrangement. Room had enough space for us and our luggage \u2013 closet, drawers, free security deposit box, fridge that was refilled daily (or every second day, we did not use it much), terrace with little table, two chairs and space to hang wet swim suites. Maid service was great \u2013 we found a bottle of Tequila the day we arrived and a fruit basket, towel art every day with little chocolates or rose petals, another fruit basket in the middle of our stay. They even had room service or breakfast in bed included, which girls were happy to try one day. Buffet had good choice of hot dishes, starters, fruits and deserts, not just wine but champagne or bear with every meal, I loved Caf\u00e9 Maya they served every night at dinner \u2013 coffee with spices served with rum set on fire and poured into a coffee \u2013 very impressive presentation and great flavour. Great selection of freshly made juices at breakfast \u2013 we loved drink called \u201cCactus Juice\u201d, new to us and very refreshing, with good taste. The eggs they served were very fresh, big, of beautiful yellow-orange colour, like little happy suns, sunny side up was my favourite. Girls really enjoyed desert selection. At any given time you could find somewhere to eat \u2013 one of the buffets, beach restaurants, burger station (they had really great tasting burgers with good selection of condiments, freshly baked nachos with cheese and salsa etc.), we tried three out of 5 (I believe) a-la-carte restaurants: TROPICAL, JAPANESE and MEXICAN. Tropical was our favourite: excellent steak, juicy and properly cooked, starters (buffet style) were also great; Japanese was ok \u2013 great presentation with usual staff, like flaming onion \u2018volcano\u2019, tossing eggs in the air etc., food was ok, Mexican wasn\u2019t bad either but there was nothing you could not find at the buffet in that last one. Most nights the shows were great (I just did not see them all), the Magician was really really good and Mexican Folklore show was my favourite \u2013 great dancers, colourful costumes and happy music. There were also a lot of activities at any times on the beach and around the hotel; unfortunately we did not get a chance to try all of them (or probably not even half of them) because we took some side-trips and I went to town many times (shopping and taking pictures, felt very safe there). My husband and older daughter enjoyed Yoga, tried some archery, one afternoon there was a Beach Party with competitions that were fun to watch and Paella cooked right on the beach - it tasted great and also it was fun to watch (it being cooked). We were in building 11, second from the beach, on your right if you face the beach; we loved the location (very close to the beach and a bit farther from the buffets and lobby (worked well with our personal preferences \uf04a ) Even though it is called Iberostar Tucan and Iberostar Quetzal - to me it seemed like one hotel with two sides (Tucan and Quetzal) that are practically identical/\u2019mirrored\u2019, with restaurants/buffets/lobby block in the middle, towards the front and \u2018Jungle\u2019 in the middle (with lighted path walks and lots and lots of animals to see) and pools/beach bars/restaurants in the middle close to the beach. We took a taxi to Playa Del Carmen, it only takes few minutes, cost $7 for all 4 passengers per direction. But I discovered that it only takes 20-30 minutes to walk there either inside the gated compound (of hotels and private villas - Playacar) or on the beach, I walked alone to Playa and back to the hotel 3 or 4 times, very safe, it is mostly tourist you meet(and probably 100% tourists on the beach) and few employees (very nice and polite) that you meet along the path, the area of hotels and villas is enclosed, with gates/guards on both sides, the vendors inside that enclose compound (there is a mall with lots of shops, pharmacy, even Starbucks) and in Playa are quite nice, nobody harasses you to buy anything (like in some other places we visited in Caribbean), yes, you king of expected to bargain (which I don\u2019t like \u2013 so we enjoyed our shopping at the big store just by the taxi station, in front of main bus station and beautiful white church - their prices were the lowest and prices are fixed, also great Tequila shop there with HUGE selection and samples to taste). We walked few blocks \u201cup town\u201d to\u2026Wal-Mart (!) - even better prices there for Tequila, souvenirs (not big choice though), and our favourite Mexican candies \u2018GLORIAS\u2019. The beach was very good, the only negative side for us was that there was not much to see in the water (we love to snorkel), but the sand is fine, very light colour, beach gets cleaned several times a day and kept tidy in front of the hotels, there were enough seats both in the shade and in the open, we liked the fact that there was only one more hotel (Sandos Playacar, to the right) and then there was a natural unsupervised beach where you could walk as long as you wish, with very few people, there were always groups of pelicans to watch, seagulls and other sea birds, iguanas on the rocks, crabs, even the starfish one morning, just by the water edge \u2013 the biggest I\u2019ve ever seen, lots of picture opportunities. The service at the hotel was very good \u2013 in restaurants, bars, maid service, check-in/check out, guest services, they were all very helpful, polite and speak decent English, never had a problem. Would be happy to come again to this hotel or try a different Iberostar in that area \u2013 they never fail to please us.", "Date": "February 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cGuaranteed fun vacation!!\u201d", "Author": "seb929", "ReviewID": "UR124132694", "Content": "My boyfriend and I stayed at the Iberostar Tucan from January 13-January 22, 2012. We had stayed at the Iberostar Dominicana in the Dominican Republic last year and had such a great experience, that we knew we had to book Iberostar for our next trip! Aside from a few minor bumps in the road, we had a wonderful and memorable vacation and would recommend this resort to any of our close friends/family. Our flight was about 5 hours from Boston, MA and we found it extremely easy to navigate through the Cancun Airport upon arriving. Once you land, you\u2019ll claim your bags and go through Mexican Customs\u2014they\u2019ll make you press a button and if the light is green, you walk through and if it turns red, it means your checked bag will be randomly searched (but not to stress- it\u2019s a relatively quick process). Once through customs, you\u2019ll go out to the main pickup area\u2014make sure if anyone asks you if they can help with your bags you firmly say \u201cNo.\u201d They\u2019ll want a tip from you and it can be irritating after being on a flight for several hours. Just say no and keep walking. We booked our trip through the All Inclusive Outlet (www.allinclusiveoutlet.com) and were assigned transportation to and from the airport to the resort through Olympus Tours. We found our representative, no problem, and he was extremely polite and informative in getting our luggage and us to the van. The drive to Iberostar was probably only about a half hour, but we had to drop off two additional couples along the way- it was a nice opportunity to see some other resorts and get excited for our vacation! Upon arriving to Iberostar, we were there after check in time, so everything ran extremely smooth and the front desk attendant was very pleasant. A man drove us to our building (2828) in a golf cart and helped us with our bags all the way to our room. He didn\u2019t make us feel like we had to tip, but we did anyway since my bag probably weighed close to 45lbs (and he carried it up a flight of stairs for me with a smile on his face the entire time). We were thrilled to see that our king bed request was honored. The room was spotless when we arrived. Our room was situated pretty far from the beach (but extremely close to the Quetzal lobby) and our balcony faced the neighboring resort\u2019s loading area, so we were woken up pretty early by the sound of trucks and clamor- but it was a great way to get up and going. If you get one of these rooms, just request to be moved- we had already unpacked and settled before it started to get to us (mid-week) so we didn\u2019t bother causing a stink about the noise. Resort: The resort grounds are beautiful- the resort is literally built around a jungle, so no matter where you walk you\u2019ll definitely take the jungle path at one point or another, where you\u2019ll see various animals such as peacocks, agouti (little guinea-pig like animals), lizards, monkeys (Look up! We tried to find them all week and finally saw a monkey mom and her baby at the end of our trip) and various other animals- definitely a great way to remind you of where you are in Mexico, and this was one of the things that attracted us to booking at Iberostar Tucan and we\u2019re so happy we did! Food: The dining halls were beautifully situated around a fountain and are outdoors\u2014when you get seated for your meals you can pick smoking or non-smoking sections (I never had any issues with the smoking at this resort- I know last year when we stayed at Iberostar in the Dominican Republic it was definitely more obvious and more of an annoyance) and if its not too busy will get seated by the water and can watch the beautiful birds while you eat your meal. I highly recommend the omelet station in the morning, they will put anything you want inside (ham, bacon, tomato, peppers, cheese, mushroom). I found that there were plenty of food options for breakfast, lunch could be hit or miss- if you\u2019re a burger fan DEFINITELY try a burger at the beach burger station\u2014seriously one of the best I\u2019ve had! They have hot dogs too and a nacho station. Dinner at the buffets was never an issue- they had a fajita station every night which was great since I love Mexican food, but also have various options to choose from, and it gets switched up every other night. I don\u2019t think picky eaters would have a problem here. Since we stayed 9 nights, we got to book dinner at 3 of the A La Carte restaurants- they were easy to book, but I recommend booking within your first day or so at the resort since they claim to fill up fast. There are kiosks right in the Quetzal and Tucan lobbies and menus for you to look at to make your selections. We booked the Mexican Restaurant, Steak House, and Japanese. I was pretty disappointed by the Mexican Restaurant because most of the foods on the menu were available at the buffet (fajita, chips & guacamole, tacos\u2026). I hate saying it, but I was expecting better food than I could get a Mexican Restaurant in the US and it didn\u2019t really do it for me. However, if you don\u2019t eat a ton of Mexican, give it a try! The Steak House was great- I ordered tenderloin and my boyfriend had the rib eye\u2014super delicious, you\u2019ll get a baked potato and some vegetables. The dessert was also one of the best I\u2019ve had\u2014make sure you try the brownie. It was delicious and served with ice cream! The Japanese Restaurant was by far my favorite\u2014better than hibachi in the US! Please do yourself the favor and make sure you book the Japanese Restaurant! You\u2019ll be seated around a table with about 4 other couples and can order an appetizer of sushi rolls, and then a soup option. For your main course you can pick a few or ALL of the meat selections on the menu (Shrimp, Chicken, Beef, or Squid). I had the shrimp and chicken and my boyfriend ordered all four. You can also pick steamed rice or fried rice, which they make right in front of you! Our Chef was Alex and he was so much fun! The bartender comes around and makes sure your glass is never empty \u263a We had so much fun at this restaurant, you also get a very generous portion! We went here on our last night, it was a great way to end the week! T Beach: The beach at the Iberostar Tucan is lovely\u2014surf was a little rough for most of our days here (we stayed 10 days total) and we had a couple overcast days so it didn\u2019t get too hot to want to jump in. The ocean is pretty shallow after you get over the first round of waves, so it\u2019s definitely safe for wading. Unfortunately, due to the surf, the water sports weren\u2019t offered all days, but you do have the options to sea kayak, snorkel, or do a small catamaran boat. There are also vendors walking up and down the beach offering jet skiing and parasailing (I think I overheard them say parasailing was $50/person for 20-30 minutes). Tip: We didn\u2019t realize this until about mid-week\u2014if you walk down the beach toward the right of the resort, there is a completely un-developed beach stretch---it is simply beautiful and literally a 2-minute walk from the Iberostar beach. Bring your camera and take a ton of pictures here! My boyfriend and I walked here at sunset and got some beautiful pictures of us on the beach without the resort in the background/tons of people---it\u2019s so pretty! We also highly recommend the adult-only swim-up bar. I had my best drinks at the entire resort here\u2014although its situated in the shade mostly, if you get a hot afternoon take a nice break from the sun and have a drink. It wasn\u2019t crowded and the bartenders were great, I wish I got their names! Entertainment: I promise that you will never be bored-day or night! The Star Friends have a board with listings and times of all the activities that they do daily, every hour of the day! There is water aerobics in the pool, salsa dancing, bingo, and Zumba (Ricardo leads beach Zubma around 4pm, and he was wonderful! Don\u2019t be afraid to go up and dance\u2014no one cares if you\u2019re dancing in a bathing suit and there is always a big crowd of young and old-I even got my boyfriend to do it with me!!). The Star Friends also put on a beach Olympics mid-week, which was a ton of fun\u20143 different relay races on the beach! If you choose to stay in at night and rest early, that\u2019s fine, we had a nice flat screen TV in our room with several English/Spanish channels. But if you like to get out and do things and end your night dancing away at the disco, you can! We attended the Star Friends entertainment shows every night after dinner\u2014we\u2019re so glad we did, we didn\u2019t get that into it last year when we stayed at Iberostar Dominicana. If you go early enough (around 8pm) and get a good seat, the Star Friends come around and politely ask if you would like to dance (Ladies: If you\u2019re looking to do some salsa/slow dancing, make sure you take this opportunity! I danced with Caesar (Star Friend) two nights and it was so fun!) The shows were very fun as well-some people may think it\u2019s cheesy, but give it a chance! The bar staff is excellent and makes sure that your drink is never empty (although, we had a couple nights where the servers forgot our drinks\u2014but they felt really bad when they realized they did and quickly brought us another) and the Star Friends never fail to impress. We loved the Magic Show with Sebastian (all the way from Argentina) and they also did Karaoke after some of the shows. The Star Friends are absolutely incredible and talented people- they do so much to make sure you\u2019re having an excellent vacation. We never caught the name of the Emcee, but he was so funny and entertaining! Also, if you get there early enough before the show, the Star Friends come around and see if you want to be in one of their pre-show games! They always pull about 8 people from the crowd for a pre-show contest or game. My boyfriend and I both got pulled up for a matching game competition and narrowly escaped doing \u201cThe Ideal Couple\u201d game. After the shows, the disco \u201cLa Mascara,\u201d is open from 11:30pm-3:00am. I found this disco to be a lot more fun than the disco in the Iberostar in the Dominican Republic- they played more modern party music and the Star Friends came and danced some nights! Excursions: If you want to get off the resort and do excursions, there is plenty out there. Our Olympus Tours agent, Arturo, was wonderful. He didn\u2019t pressure us into ANYTHING and was extremely helpful and HONEST about what to do. For example- we ended up booking the cheapest excursion (Tulum Extreme\u2014for about $80/person we got transportation to the Mayan Ruins in Tulum, had an hour long guided tour, then 45 minutes to explore on our own---we then had transportation to the jungle park where we got to do snorkeling in a Cenote, 3 zip lines, repelling, then had a buffet lunch. Our guide throughout was Carlos, and he was just excellent!) and he told us it was a great choice, showed us pictures from when he did it, and didn\u2019t try to pressure us into more excursions or a more expensive pack. We also told him we wanted to do some shopping and he told us not to bother with the small shops within walking distance of the resort since they would be too expensive (Playa Mall). He suggested that we take a cab to Playa del Carmen 5th Avenue (which was only 7 bucks from the resort) and gave us names of about 3 different stores to buy souvenirs at affordable prices. He gave us the best piece of advice that in Playa Mall a souvenir costs about 3x what its actually worth\u2014so if you do go, to bargain with the sellers and ask for about 1/3 of that price. It was an easy trip from the resort and there are tons of shops/restaurants to go to if you want a change from Iberostar life. Notable Star Friends who went the extra mile to get to know us and have fun with us: The Emcee (we never caught his name!), Ricardo, Mauricio, Bryant, Caesar, and Heather. In closing, this trip was extremely relaxing, full of activities, and full of fun. Our only negative comments, since we need to leave an honest review, are the following (but I promise, we didn\u2019t let this get in the way of the awesome time we had! Just minor bumps in the road): 1. The toilet in our room clogged within the first few days of our stay\u2014but we called the front desk and it was fixed by the time we got back from the beach (I even left a tip for the maintenance, and they didn\u2019t take it!) 2. One day randomly, our room swipe key stopped working. So we tried the other and that didn\u2019t work either. We walked all the way through the jungle to the Tucan lobby to report to the front desk and they said it was fixed. So we walked all the way back, through the jungle, back to our room to find the door still didn\u2019t work. Again, through the jungle, back to the lobby, and the front desk attendant said she would send someone from maintenance. We get back to the room and the keys work fine, and maintenance never came. Good exercise, but a lot of back and forth. 3. One day our room was cleaned but we never got fresh towels. We called the front desk and they did send someone right away. The next day when we got back from the beach, our room wasn\u2019t cleaned at ALL! We have no idea why this occurred, but we called the front desk and they sent a cleaning person, but we felt weird making them clean our room while we were there, so we just asked for fresh towels and called it a day. We hope that you book a trip at Iberostar Tucan and have the same memorable experiences that we had \u263a I promise you will never get bored!", "Date": "February 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cIberostar Tucan - grounds are better than room\u201d", "Author": "krukab", "ReviewID": "UR124130850", "Content": "Spent three nights here with a family of five, including three young adults. Let's just say the stay improved as the stay went on. I must admit that the check-in was pleasant and went well. The outdoor lobby is welcoming with the birds and the front desk clerk. They let us check in prior to 3pm which was helpful. The room itself was a bit disappointing. No TV remotes in either room. The patio light was flickering and the patio towel rack was broken. One of our rooms had a \"situation\" and maintenance had to fix it. Basically the entire door was broken - looked like a drug bust had happened the night prior. Beds are HARD, but that was OK for me. Other than those negatives, the only other concern would be the lack of a hot tub... but I'm thinking that Cancun doesn't offer hot tubs at many places? Positives include: Although we needed better directions to drive here, we felt very safe once inside a gated community of Playacar. This is a nice compact resort with less walking as many resorts. Loved the critters within the jungle atmosphere including the peacock that was not shy about walking through the lobby. The food was good as well as the presentations. We liked that the restaurants were mostly open-air and really liked the available food down at the pool. The shows were very entertaining after a day at the beautiful beach! We liked the variety of activities, including daily yoga, Zumba on the beach, scuba lessons at the resort -- and they did a good job of communicating times and places. The staff was very friendly and accomodating. The only Internet access was in the lobby, but once there the connection was fast and constant. It was a short walk to Playa del Carmen and an even shorter walk to the shops inside Playacar.

The food was not bad either we liked the Italian best (make sure you have the lamb chops) and our least favorite was the Mexican having said that we also loved the buffets especially the lunch time at the sister hotel the scenery was gorgeous with a waterfall and pink flamingos while you can sip a cold glass of white wine with waiter service,dosent get any better!! The evening entertainment was just the right mix of shows which were very professional also the team work so so so hard.(10 out of 10) The rooms were comfortable and very clean and you can hear the monkeys howling in the early morning. which brings me to the most unique selling point of the Tucan ...its the jungle which has been built through the middle of the resort complete with monkeys and many other unusual animals...what a clever idea that works so well its just wonderful.

Luggae arrived swiftly to our rooms. The rooms are spacious, two double or one king size bed, seating area, coffee/Tea making facilities, TV, Balcony with chairs and table. Having said the rooms are spacious the interior decor is in need of refurbishment as looking tired and a little worn. The bathrooms due to the dark decor look a little tired and need to be birghtened and updated, hairdryer, showr gel, shampoo and small lotions and potions are also provided. Free in room safe, iron and ironing board. The rooms/bathrooms and the lobby and hotel walkways are extremley clean and all the outside spaces and gardens are maintined to a high standard. The Pool - Is large but majority of the pool is very deep, averaging in most entrances at 5ft, we only found one small area that was shallow enough to float in and cool off, unfortunately this was where the children also swam due to the depth of the rest of the pool. There is one seperate small toddlers pool and a swim up bar pool. Beach/Pool towels are provided. The Beach - Is great, plenty of seating and umberellas for all the guests, still some people insist on getting up at the crak of dawn to 'save' a seat! Water is very warm like getting in to a warm bath. There are a few sellers selling cheap and nasty silver necklaces/bracelets, but if you say no they do not pester you and will move on. The hotel do tell them to not come on the beach as private but it still happens. All the standard watersports available on the beach. The Food - Breakfast is great could not ask for more of a choice and our waiter Ruby (to his friends) could not have been nicer or more helpful. Lunch - Again fairly good choice but does get a bit repretative after two weeks but found this to be the same at any AI hotel, will always find something to eat, and they have all day ice cream and at lunch a help yourself Whippy machine. Evening Meal - In the buffet it's not the best, very poor choice, the staff have no idea how to carve joints of meat let alone cook them, twice they had raosted hog it was that crisp it could not be used it was being hacked to bits by the chef to try and give guests a piece to eat. Found the same with Turkey and the Beef was only offerd in one choice and that would be raw. If you like Fish there was always plenty to choose from. Speciality Restaurants - Please be aware at peak times you may not get to eat in one of these in your first week, book them as soon as you can as they have limited set times and numbers per night for each of the sittings. Steak House great, Mexican great, due to the time of year we where there we did not get to visit the others as we had Gala nights to attend but managed the Steak House and the Mexican twice. The Airport - This was fun fun fun upon arrival collect your luggae as normal, but you then have to walk through the middle of the Departure lounge to get to imigration where you then have to place your luggae through a Xray Machine, then each person has to hit a button Red/Green. Green you can go, Red you have to open up all yout luggae and hand luggae before you can leave. The staff barely look just seem to tipp all your stuff upside down for fun. On leaving the country there are various details on the Departure Tax, you can pay in Sterling, US Dollar or Mexican Peaso (but must be cash). Current rate are \u00a340 $58 $700. The food is very expensive in the airport so if you have time eat in your hotel, talking \u00a325 for burgers and chips x3!! So would be very expensive for a large family. The jungle walk is great and you get to see all sorts of wild animals that roam freely around the hotel grounds, Peacocks, Hens, Agouti, Falmingos, Ducks and best of all monkiey's. We where lucky enough to be bale to hand feed thesm every day from our balcony with fruit from the restaurant. They can make rather a lot of noise so if you wake up early and think a dog is howling, this is the monkey's gettting ready for the day!!!", "Date": "February 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cSo many excellent places, don't waste your time here\u201d", "Author": "wallyb48", "ReviewID": "UR123890321", "Content": "I have stayed in the Cancun-Playa del Carmen area eight different times. This resort was by far the worst experience of any resort. Let me first say the only reason I am giving it a \"poor\" rating and not \"terrible\" is that it is so inexpensive the value may appeal to some. The pool is small and has no view of the beach. Except for a few people the staff was rude. There was no organization to the beach area leaving a cluttered mess of chairs everywhere. The restaurant situation was MISERABLE. There are a few restaurants that you MUST have reservations at. But good luck trying to get one. And then when they tell you there is no room, have fun walking by the restaurant you thought was booked only to find a dozen empty tables - every time. Their employees do not appear to care that you have a good time and enjoy your stay. There was a nasty sewer smell half of the walk to our room. We were literally kicked out of breakfast 10 minutes before they were supposed to be closing. We paid for internet in our rooms that didn't work - only after having to talk to half a dozen people before we finally found someone who even knew what the internet was (true story.) The beds may have been made out of concrete. We had to remove all of the sheets and blankets from the extra bed to create our own version of a pillow top after I bruised my coccyx when I sat down the first time on the bed. Oh, and even though they will tell you they have queen beds (not a king bed on the premises, or so we were told), they are actually only full sized \"beds\"/slabs. The rooms were clean but VERY outdated with very few rooms with a view of anything but a bunch of trees. I can see trees anywhere. I go to Playa del Carmen to see beaches.

This is my honest opinion of the hotel. I had called (via Skype) the week prior to our arrival and requested a King room on a top floor in Building 11 or 12. When we arrived 01/24 - the hotel said the hotel was full and they only had rooms with double beds available. They did offer to move us to the Iberostar Paraiso which would have a King room. We opted to stay at the Tucan in a double room on the top floor of Building 12. This is a Large Resort - it basically 2 resorts - The Queztal is on one side and the Tucan is on the other. Each hotel has 10 buildings that start at the beach and work their way back. My understanding is the first building on the beach (#10) is all suites, which you could upgrade to. Buildings 11 & 12 are very convenient to the beach/pool. If you are planning a trip - find a hotel layout on the web (Google \"Iberostar Tucan Map\" - click on Images). I had read from previous posts that the monkeys would be found between Buildings 12 & 13. Either way I would recommend a room on the top floor if you are able to take the stairs. (There aren't any elevators.) The beach is very nice - the sand is soft and easy to walk on. There are a lot of palupa huts (about 3 rows) all along the beach near the buildings. They are close together and do fill up. Of course, like any resort - you'll have people go out early and throw their towels down to reserve a palupa (or a chair by the pool). There's nothing anyone can really do about that. There was some seaweed when we were there (01/24 - 01/29) - most of it was around the shoreline. The water could be a little rough (the first two days were windy - so there were lots of waves) the next days - the ocean looked like a big lake - it was almost perfectly calm - with small waves close to the shore. The water is very clear - but nothing to see snorkeling. There are boats dragging around para-sails all day, lots a jet skis and small sailboats off the beach. There were also people from the spa that would come around and ask you if you wanted any massages/treatments. There were occasional people selling jewelry/cigars. The pool is HUGE. It is very nice and always clean. There are hundreds of chairs/palupa huts around the pool. They do have a separate Kiddie-pool, swim up bar pool and a pool used for water polo. The Jungle - in between the buildings and the outside perimeter of the buildings is all natural. They build a little path up the middle that allows you to view all kinds of wildlife. You'll see peacocks, iguanas, capybara, the occasional chicken, birds and of course the howler monkeys. Generally we saw (heard) the monkeys in the morning (from 7am - 9am and in the early evening (5pm - 6pm) They were around Buildings 12/13. We did see some climb up on the balcony of Building 13. The restaurants/buffets. - There were two places to eat breakfast and lunch. Near the pool/beach had small buffets available. Fresh fruit, breads, eggs & bacon, etc. in the morning & hot dogs/hamburgers, chicken, salad, breads at lunch. The other \"main\" buffet is near the Quetzal back towards the lobby. It had a much larger selection of everything and omelet/taco station. For dinner you could eat at the buffets (the one at the Tucan is only open for lunch, the one for the Quetzal is open for Lunch and Dinner) or a specialty restaurant. We ate at 3 specialty restaurants - the Tropical, the Mexican and the Steak House. We didn't care for the Tropical or the Mexican - but did enjoy the Steak House. (I had the Ribeye, my wife had the Tenderloin - but were good. I also asked for some grilled shrimp, which were also good.). We were a little disappointed at the dinner buffet as is it is basically the same as what they have for lunch. AT another Iberostar we stayed at - they had a different theme each night. Not so at this location. Bars/Drinks - They have a central beach bar (between the Tecan/Quetzal), they also have waitresses that come around the beach/pool to take your drink order. They also have a bar in the buffet building next to the pool (where breakfast is served). We usually walked up there and got our drinks. They don't have top shelf liquor at these locations. The pool bar didn't seem to have anything going on the days we were there. The lobby bar from 5pm - 1am has top shelf liquor - if you ask for it (Tanqueray, Absolute, Quervo Gold, etc.) Star Friends/Shows: The star friends are always around - there are plenty of activities if you wanted to participate. We went to a couple of shows - they are fun and you get to see people from all over participating. I wouldn't take anything too seriously - it's not Vegas - it's just a enjoyable time. The employees are GREAT. Everyone you encounter will go out of their way to try to satisfy your needs. The wait staff is excellent, the housekeeping staff is great. (I left a note we wanted more water bottles and they left them every day) The bellboys are great - they'll take you/you luggage down to your building and up to your room. Overall - it was a very good resort - but we were expecting a little bit more. There are more PROs and CONs at this hotel - this is just my opinion... Pros: 1) The Hotel - although over 10 years old is Very Well Maintained. Employees are constantly working around the grounds. It looks Great. 2) The Rooms are very nice. They are clean and comfortable. The shower is nice and big. The beds are hard - but that did not bother us at all. 3) The Employees - always willing to help/assist you 4) The Pool / Beach. We did feel a little crowded at he back of the beach - so we pulled our chairs up to the water and put up an umbrella (umbrellas are free where you pick up your towels). 5) Lobby Bar - Great place to have a drink before/after dinner and meet other guests (Henry the bartender is GREAT and will make you anything) Cons: 1) Dinner - we were disappointed at most of our dinners. The Steakhouse was good, from what I heard from other guests go to the Japanese and Italian. I'd skip the Tropical. 2) Other than the lobby bar - none of the others had top-shelf liquor. Overall, for the price we paid - we thought it was very nice - and we had a good time.", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Weir, KS", "Title": "\u201cGreat family trip!\u201d", "Author": "verandah330", "ReviewID": "UR123756016", "Content": "My husband and I went with our two girls, ages 16 and 10 in July 2011. We were in the first building right off the lobby. I had read a lot of reviews were people were upset about being put there, but we loved it! Our balcony was shady and private and we didn't feel bad about hanging our suits from the rail to dry since it faced the service alley. It was right off the lobby so as soon as the girls were ready for dinner, they were able to go down by themselvs and order a 'cocktail', complete with skewered fruit and umbrellas and wait for us to join them. The room was nice and decorated in bright colors. But OMG, the beds were like rock slabs! I had read this prior to our departure and came equiped with an egg-crate foam pad....it wasn't enough! We asked for foam pads as soon as we got in the room and they were delivered promptly...the two on my bed made it bearable, and then we just left ours for someone's future use, which is what I usually do. This also frees up room in my luggage for souvenirs. The lobby is gorgeous and spacious and there are 2 parrots there. But bring some OFF or steer clear of the benches. The tropical plants behind them must be a breeding ground! The internet in the lobby was hit-or-miss and they always blamed it on our computer. My husband thought he would try to keep up on his work emails in the evenings but could seldom get on. We wouldn't waste the money next time. You're on vacation---go order a drink or 3 from the bar and enjoy the tropical breezes! Even though we were the building furthest from the beach, it was only a lovely 8 minute walk through the shady jungle ,where we spotted monkeys and many other animals. The beach stretches on forever, with plenty of loungers, sun umbrellas, and gorgeous white sand. Down a ways to the right there is a manmade reef, where my husband and girls snorkeled and saw gorgeous tropical fish. (we brough our own gear so this was a freebie!) The surf was definitely 'active', but not so rough if the little ones had floaties. Bring your own from Walmart...we paid a couple of bucks for something the gift shop was selling for $20! Every day, there are 'handlers' walking through the pool and beach areas with the 'animal-of-the-day' for you to get your picture taken with. I didn't want to pay their prices, and was glad because when the girls and I went into downtown Playa to shop, we lucked onto a street vendor who let me take as many pictures as I wanted of his two monkeys on the girls heads and shoulders for only $10 for BOTH girls, one at a time! Then on our last full day on the beach, they were doing photo-ops of the tiny monkey about 15 feet in front of our loungers, so I had my husband get the camera ready, while I walked down the beach a ways and then strolled up and got in line for my picture. He zoomed in and got some great 'free' pictures! lol The girls did parasailing on the beach, so when you know you want to do that, bring some cash because it's just a couple of guys walking along the beach soliciting business. I can't remember the amount, but it was less than the $100 per person we paid in Cancun. They took us all out to their boat on jetskis, but only charged us for the girls trip up. We got a lot of good pictures and video and they had a blast! Bring some ziploc bags and double bag your camera. We enjoyed all of the restaurants, but ate most meals at the Tulum, where they set up a huge breakfast and dinner buffet, simply because it was easier and didn't require a reservation. I don't want to wear a watch and follow a strict schedule on vacation, ya know? We did book a night at the Bonsai and had a great meal and a great time watching our Japanese chef. The tropical restaurant by the beach was very nice, too, and also serves quick lunch items. We enjoyed a fancier dining experience at La Gondola on the Quetzel side. My husband got a burger from the snack bar on the beach and said it was delicious. Every few days, they would set up a tent on the beach and cook a huge batch of seafood paella. I brought us a plate of that back to the loungers one day when we were enjoying the sun too much to go eat lunch. Most of the time we ate lunch at the Cozumel, which is on the Quetzel side--it's set up pretty much like the Tulum and serves a great lunch buffet--however, there was little to no breeze here so we never lingered after our meal. The thing my girls enjoyed the most, though, was being able to have ice cream on the beach whenever they wanted. It did rain twice when we were there and we had some overcast days. However, we did not let that stop us from relaxing and enjoying ourselves, and considered it a blessing that we were able to enjoy the outdoors without fear of bad sunburn. Oh, we did have an 'incident' that we are still laughing about! I have this huge mesh bag that I got free somewhere, that we always take on tropical trips, because it holds our sunscreen and beach toys and allows the sand and water to drain away on our walk back to our room. One morning, we got up early and headed down and claimed one of the beach bed huts by the pool and then we headed to the shore to watch the sun rise. Ten minutes later, we came back to find that someone had stolen our bag....but get this, they had dumped out our belongings ($40 worth of spray-on sunscreens, if you'd purchased them in the giftshop), pool toys, cover-ups, and my $40 Reebok sandals! We reported it to the workers in the pool area, but never recovered it. Dang...I'm gonna miss that bag! lol Drinks---we never waited in line too long at any of the bars, nor did we feel the drinks were weak. We just always made a point of ordering 2 of everthing so we didn't have to go back as often. My husband is a certified diver and really enjoyed his diving trips. He found them to be very knowledgable and professional in the dive shop. We did one excursion to Tulum. This was a really interesting cultural experience. However, thanks to Trip Advisor we didn't book it with the high-pressure tour guide in the lobby that was assigned to us by CheapCarribean.com. He pounced on us as we followed the bellhop to our room and insisted we needed to come right back down and talk to him before we did anything! We managed to sneek past him on our way to hit the beach 10 minutes later and avoided him for a couple of days. When we finally got around to stopping by his desk, he pressured us to book his over-priced trips and when we acted disinterested, he got belligerent and told us we MUST buy our tours from him. His quote for the four of us roundtrip to Tulum was over $300. I ordered a cab at the front desk and for $100 he drove us there in a very nice air-conditioned cab, dropped us off in front of the ticket booth (Tulum wasn't expensive but can't remember the exact cost), showed us where he would be parked, and when we returned 2 hours later, there he was in his lawnchair under a shade tree. We took bottled water from our room and snacks, so can't tell you about concessions there. One more Cheap Carribean tip: when I booked our trip on their website, they gave us the option of adding in roundtrip transportation to the resort. It was actually CHEAPER for us to book our own mini-van than it would have been to go on the big bus that makes several stops along the way to drop off or pick up other Cheap Carribean travelers, so check all your options! The most fabulous 'excursion' we took was thanks to TripAdvisor's Top 10! For $8 USD, the cab dropped us off at the end of Fifth Avenue, the shopping district. Which is also where you can find a cab when you are ready to depart. Number 4 that week was the Sabai Spa...the four of us got a fabulous hour massage for $100 TOTAL! My 10 yr. old was in seventh heaven that she got to participate, as well. Once you are on 5th Avenue, head to the left for approximately 5 blocks. Sabai has a small kiosk on the right-hand side of the street with a masseuse dressed in white scrubs, sitting at a computer. We approached her and she led us down the alley behind her to the spa. Now, I know what you're thinking and I never would have taken my children there, if not for the great reviews! But this was a beautiful alley lined with hand-painted murals and boutique shops. The spa has a very oriental flavor and felt so tranquil. We opted for the outdoor massage in the back garden. It was very secluded and the fans kept you from feeling too hot. Wow! Our only regret was that we did not discover this at the beginning of our trip and did not have time to come back! All in all, we had a terrific trip and were able to enjoy many things we would never have attempted thanks to Trip Advisor!!", "Date": "January 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gypsum, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cGreat all-around resort!\u201d", "Author": "mtndavid", "ReviewID": "UR123715956", "Content": "The beach, food, staff, fun, entertainment, jungle were all incredible.

The room service food we ordered once has rather small portions to our liking. The rooms are on the smaller side, but certainly livable, considering the fact that we only slept in them anyways.

Every day there were squeals of awe and surprise, followed by comments about the animals, and of course camera moments! The beach is wide, very clean and nice, and has very good profile. The swim area is sufficiently large. There was a mini-disco at 8 pm every night for the kids with games, and almost daily there were kid's shows by the kid's pool area. The playground is rather challenging for small kids, but 3 y.o. and up can spend some energy there. Beware that Tucan and Quetzal is the same hotel, the only difference being is which side of the jungle the buildings are. However, if you have a srtroller, a wheelchair or a walker, request Tucan side, as it is certainly flatter - the Quetzal is hilly and has a step or two at unexpected places. Also, the jungle paths are only passable on foot - forget about strollers there! However, you certainly can get around the resort on side paths. We have a side-by-side stroller, and it was a challenge to fit it into some of the paths, creating traffic, so I would recommend something like Phil and Ted's for those who have 2 small kids like us.

A couple of tips, don't book trips with your tour operator you're going to pay double what you need to.(walk 300 yards up the road to the shopping mall & book there).

I am a \"legitimate and trustworthy\" customer. I don't work for Iberostar and I do not have 200 family members who vacation with me. My husband and I have stayed at this property 3 times and are currently planning a 4th trip back. I can't tell you how many people we've met there who are returning for the 9th, 10th, 11th time. The reason being...and the reason why these reviews are all \"eerily similar\"...is because it's a GREAT resort with wonderful, hard-working employees. For the record.... We also request a king bed on the 3rd floor. We are always told at the time of booking that they will try to honor our request but that they can't guarantee it. We've always been given the room we've requested. Yes, the buffet is not gourmet and it does get a little boring after a few days. But you will find something you like. And the ala carte restaurants are great! Try the lamb chops or the flaming tequila beef skewers. Delicious! If the drinks aren't strong enough for you, ask for a double. No problem. As far as theft goes, never had a problem. As a matter of fact, on our second trip there, I forgot to put my \"designer\" purse that contained $300 in the room safe. I left it on the bureau and we went out for the day. We returned to a clean room and the purse and cash were still there. Never had a problem with our luggage either. I understand the random possibility of theft anywhere, but Paddle0pounce's \"constant state of anxiety\" over the safety of her belongings is, quite frankly, laughable. I find her accusations to be highly unlikely, for the following reason. Some of the repeat vacationers we talked to had brought gifts for some of their favorite employees. They had to include a letter with the gift stating their name, room number, and the fact that the item was indeed a gift to the employee...because the employee is CHECKED as they leave the resort. Every single employee we have encountered at the Tucan has gone \"way above and beyond\" to make our stay as enjoyable as possible. That being said, I agree with Mary W. A \"please\" and \"thank you\" and a friendly smile goes a long way no matter where you are staying. Being a haughty, condescending drama queen is not going to get you very far. If you are planning a vacation here, do not worry. You are going to have a GREAT time. If the food was \"disgusting\" and theft and rudeness the norm, there would not be so many repeat customers.

The main lobby is gorgeous, especially on the Quetzal side with the waterfalls. It\u2019s pretty much like one resort, just separate lobbies. The jungle pathways meandering down to the pools and ocean are unlike anywhere else I have ever stayed. I loved seeing the peacocks, flamingos, iguanas, agoutis, toucans, and many more creatures.

There are plenty of resort activities to break up the day between relaxing in the sun, take advantage of them. We walked to the small shopping plaza in Playacar, just a 10 minute walk north from the resort. You can get your souvenir fix there with no heavy pressure from the vendors unlike what I heard about 5th Ave in town. Also, bought a hat and t-shirt in the hotel gift shop which were reasonably priced. Because we weren\u2019t there very long, we did the half day Tulum Express excursion. Very nice, only $44. Booked it in the resort at the Iberostar office. We did have to walk to the plaza to catch the bus in the morning at 7:50 and we were dropped off at the resort about 1:30.

The food was what we expected at the buffet (this is the same at all the resorts we have stayed in)- see comments in other reviews. I was disappointed with the speciality restaurants, usually they are very good. At the Tucan they might have been a step up from the buffet, but not much. We ate at the Mexican, Italian and the Tropical rest. We stayed in room 1546 (on the third floor), this particular room was very close to the evening show. Every evening there was a song/dance show from 8:30-11:30 and most evenings it kept us up. We had family staying on the lower floors and the noise didn't bother them. There were some comments below regarding the drinks, the comments apply to most of the resorts that we have stayed at. However, what we have found is that if you go to the bar by the lobby, the drinks tend to be much better. Regarding the rooms, they were fine. It's nice to have a balony to sit and watch the wildlife. The mini-bar was kept up (this doesn't always happen at resorts) and the maids really work hard keeping the rooms clean. The beds... I don't know why, but I have never slept on a comfortable bed in Mexico, they are all as hard as a rock. Overall, we got what we were looking for, a beach vacation... but I'm a little burned out on the all-inclusive places so we might choose a cruise the next time around...", "Date": "December 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201clove it!\u201d", "Author": "nenann", "ReviewID": "UR122263309", "Content": "amazing vacation!!!!we will never forget playa del carmen!!the water is so clear and blue..but they have a lot of waves!!.the all inclusive is the best idea!!the people from the hotel were so nice and helpful!!the disco at the hotel is not good but the drinks are so cool!!!the place is like a little jungle with a lot of animals!!birds and monkeys!!the pool is huge but he adult pool is freezing .we love the hotel and the mexican's working were fantastic!!we def want to go back!!we pay for the party hooper outside the hotel!!it was so crazy!!all you do is drink and drink from one bar to another bar...is a place to have fun and a lot of drinks!!but also you can relaxed during the day and enjoy the beach", "Date": "December 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "crawley", "Title": "\u201cgreat holiday great hotel , loving mexico\u201d", "Author": "woodys1234", "ReviewID": "UR122196432", "Content": "just returned from 2 weeks in the mexican sun (12th dec thru 26th dec 2011) family group of 7 ages 46 to 9 years old, we all totally loved the place.. very professional staff from the check in staff to room maids.. most staff speak fantastic english and are so so friendly.. we travelled with thomson, ... great flight although long outgoing due to strong head wind.. 11hrs + but only 8hr 50 on home journey. very fast check in at the hotel, and a welcome drink for all.. well needed.. luggage arrived promptly to our rooms, we had 3 rooms all top floor in building 15 and all next to each other as we requested. all rooms very simliar, just different bed layout.. spacious enough, comfortable, air con , clean great walk in showers with towels shampoo everything you need.. and the balcony of course. 2 huge buffets for breakfast and dinner also several a la carte for dinner food and drinks are available pretty much 20hrs a day, and room service 12hrs a day, you cannot go hungry or thirsty here... pleanty of choice all round, a la carte's were not the best ive ever had, but certainly not the worst, the italian was our family favourite... great veal.... beach is simply amazing, long, wide white sand, beautiful views back into the jungle and out to cozumel island,, if you like beaches you gonna love this one.. again food never far away 1 food hall 10 feet from the beach, and a bbq even closer from midday-4pm, fantastic waitresses will bring drinks to you all day if your far too busy to move of your sun lounger......... some of our party went on a booked trip and swam with dolphins. manitees and wrays, while the others stayed and used the beach / water sport to its max... i also took my padi open water while here(booked before i left uk) the guys and girls at the dressel dive shop were great again very professional and thanks to them i even saw a bull shark on my final dive christmas day...:) bars staff are great also the guys all speak way better english than i have heard on holidays before, both in mexico and other destinations... we tipped as and when we felt the need, but if you do or dont the same great service comes all inclusive,,, plenty of sightings of the howler monkeys on the resort along with lots of other little animals trotting around minding their own business..we even had monkeys on our balcony one day..... recommendations.............. check out jungle place. a private house and spider monkey sanctuary, a few hours you will never forgot, see my seperate review on ' jungle place' if you have never tried scuba diving , do it and do it here , turtles, wrays, corals, nurse sharks, bull sharks, and may more amazing beautiful fish to see here.. we are already planning a return trip here, we have never yet returned anywhere twice, but this place is AMAZING any questions just ask dave", "Date": "December 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indianapolis, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cPre X-Mas week\u201d", "Author": "copricorn", "ReviewID": "UR122149684", "Content": "We traveled first time to Tucan, family of 4: Mom, Dad, 9 years old, and 5 months old.

Cons: we went in June, and only a couple of the a la carte restaurants were air conditioned, the lobby and the open air buffets were not air conditioned. A couple of birds got into the open air buffet most days. The food was decent with a lot to choose from, even for kids, but not dynamite or anything. You only got a few nights at the a la carte restaurants, but the other Iberostar in Playa Del Carmen (the bigger one) allowed you to go to an a la carte restaurant every night. The beds were extra firm, but we had no problems sleeping on them, apparently that is common in cancun from what I have read. What I would change: 1) I would have at least enclosed the food in an air conditioned area, a little less accessible to the birds. 2) add more air conditioned areas, especially in the lobby. 3) Have some one with a golf cart continuously offer rides to and from the rooms (they will let you hitch a ride if you ask though), I didn't mind the walking, but anyone with mobility problems might want to avoid a resort this sprawling.

Beach front room has awesome view but we mostly just sleep here. Hotel grounds are gorgeous. Both resorts blend together with lots of water and open air pretty architecture. We had reservations with Tucan but stayed in building 20 which is the other one. There is no difference. Staff is very warm and helpful and happy and plentiful. Buffet is good for about two days. Good guacamole and salad and coconut ice cream. Then food is all the same and gets yucky. You cannot go to specialty restaurants every night and reservations are hard to get before 830. Doubt I will do an all inclusive again due to food. They only have whole milk which gets gross, wish I had brought skim with me. Not a great place for a vegetarian unless you really love guacamole. Drinks do not have much alcohol but I'm not a big drinker so I did not care. Sometimes they gave us white rum instead of vodka ordered. My guess is all the alcohol is watered down. Frozen drinks are very artificial and taste like slurpies. Main pool is super clean and nice and deep. Hot tub is dumb, not hot with sad little jets. Pool bar is cute but not useable because water is freezing due to too much shade. Jungle paths from lobby to pool are cool and lots of animals, fun during daytime, but very creepy and not well lit at night. I found it uncomfortable that we rarely saw anyone on the dark paths. Did not like my kids walking alone at night thru those paths. Signage around the resort is not good. Some well lit signs with arrows showing the way to beach or lobby would be helpful especially at night it is easy to get lost on the dark paths. There are maps but they are impossible to read in the dark and the dot of where you are now is sometimes missing. My daughter did scuba diving and really enjoyed it, seemed costly but well organized with knowledgeable staff. Star shows have talented staff but drag on with lots of cheesy pre-shows. We liked walking around playa Carmen 5th ave shopping instead. Easy cab ride back for seven dollars. Beds are very comfortable but kids thought pillows were too hard and uncomfortable. I wish I had brought more suntan lotion and a travel coffee mug. I like waking up early and having coffee on the beach but their cups are small and awkward to carry. Bath and beach towels are big and nice but it is helpful to have some from home to help identify your chairs and each person only gets one blue beach towel. Japanese restaurant was great, awesome food and entertaining except for appetizer sushi. Italian restaurant was ok. At Italian we had salmon that came with mashed potatoes and spinach. We did not try room service, though I did look at the menu and it seemed ok. I liked flying direct, airport transfer with Olympus - on time, the only annoying part was they had families from different resorts so it felt like forever before we got to Iberostar. Check in very easy. At first I was upset because I had requested a high floor - did not feel safe on ground floor. But we got ground floor and it was fine and convenient (no stairs). The in room safes are easy to use - I threw our passports and phones in here. The weather for late November was sunny in the 80s each day. The first 2 days were very windy, we had waves and lots of seaweed in the water. The 3rd day the wind slowed down and the water was calm and the seaweed gone. I loved swimming in the ocean.

Had an oceanfront room, and yes we thought it was worth it for the view and proximity to the beach. Several weddings on the beach outside our room added to the experience. We read all the reviews prior to leaving, here's our 2 cents. Its a solid 4 star resort, not 5, but we thouroghly enjoyed it. Very international clientele, lots of various languages being spoken. The staff was great, especially the bartenders. Tip early and often, you get great service. They are very good at remembering you and your preferences. Tip - you can get the Dos Equis Amber beer (darker) only at the bar at the back of the stage show area. For our reserved dining, we prefered (in order) the Japanese (great), the Hacienda (mexican - very good) and then the steakhouse third, which was different than the other reviews we read. The beach is truly magnificent, you can't go wrong here. We ended up canceling all but one of our excursions, as we just wanted to relax, and this resort worked for that. We did go over to the Iberostar Cozumel, which gives you a day pass bracelet, you can use all their facilities and dining areas for the day, all included. It was a VERY relaxed pace over there. Take the ferry, then it's a $25 taxi ride (each way) to the resort and back to ferry. We rented a JEEP instead for about the same price.

Even though hurricane Rina threatened to ruin the vacation, she faded out and we only had some rain and wind for the last 3 days. The first 4 days we had nice weather. The hotel kept things running despite the threat and kept us informed. We felt safe and taken care of. This was our second visit to the Tucan. We stayed there at least 10 years ago. We have stayed at over a dozen other all inclusives in this area, and really, this place is one of our favorites. They have what we want--beautiful beach, ok rooms, good bar service, decent entertainment (not top-notch, but fun in general), good service and decent food. It is NOT a 5 star place, but we don't like to spend big bucks for our vacations, and you get what you pay for and then some at this property. The food is fine. We liked the buffet (ice cream sundaes every day!) and enjoyed the Italian, Japanese (entertaining show) and Mexican sit down restaurants. The Steakhouse had very poor service on the night we went. I think the staff was getting chewed out a lot by the manager, and so they were so nervous that our orders were slow, mixed up and our drinks were not refilled. Not a good meal by any means. The Caribbean restaurant was closed. Our room was nice. Our bed was very comfortable--don't know why others say the beds are hard and uncomfortable. Guess it must depend on the room. TV worked well, the bathroom was clean and up to date, the room upkeep was timely and we had quick service when we asked that our falling-down curtain get fixed. The jungle part of the property is quite fun to explore. The pool bar was crowded with loud, uncouth drunks so we avoided it. The other pools were huge and well maintained. I went to the gym a couple of times, and it was pretty good. I did not use the spa. The tennis courts are nice. Zumba dancing was offered every day until the storm came, and it was fun. I enjoyed the water aerobic classes, too. The disco was up to date and would be very fun for younger folks who like to stay up late and dance and drink. We went one night--pretty good for Grandpa and Grandma! (we are in our 50s) They offered one night of Karaoke, if you like that. I can recommend the Iberostar resort to people who want to have some fun, not spend a ton of money, relax on a great beach, and generally just take a break from work and bad weather for a nice vacation. If you are looking for excellent food, stunning rooms, top notch entertainment and are willing to pay for it, go somewhere else. Secrets Maroma (perfect beach!)or Valetin (beach is not as nice, though) for example (we have stayed at both). We have been to Mexico a lot, so we don't leave to sightsee any more. We scuba-dived once. It is not that great there. Cozumel is the place for that. Also, we went during hurricane season, which is the \"off\" season. When resorts are crowded in high season, you will always have a much different experience.

We have tended to stay away from \"resort/ all inclusive\" places due to the largeness and impersonal feel of most of these properties. This place does not have that feel at all. The natural flora, fauna and animals scurrying around make you feel as if you are in a much smaller complex as you don't see all the buildings/ units around you. The beach space is one of the nicest in the Playacar area, plenty of sand, no rocks or coral reefs to navigate around and about a 10 minute walk south there is a man made reef to snorkel around with plenty of fish, lobsters, the occasional sea turtle (my husband saw it, I missed it!) and sting rays. Rooms are clean, though the beds are hard....I think this must be a \"Mexico\" thing. Request the foam egg crate pads for the beds and it will make a big difference. This a kid friendly place, and there is plenty for them to do here. Food is good with plenty of selections. The restaurants are also very good and have developed a routine of eating at the Japanese first, Italian second(lamb chops are really good!), the steak house next and if we are staying longer the Mexican restaurant. The little buffet palapa by the beach is our favorite place to eat breakfast and watch the day start.

If anything, the food had improved. Out of the 14 nights we were there, there was only 1 night that nothing in the buffet interested us. We only ate out in town once. The steaks in the Steakhouse are excellent quality, better than we can get at home. I can also highly recommend the lamb in La Gondola. The Mexican food served in the buffet every night is actually better than what is served in the Mexican speciality restaurant. The only thing that lets the food down is the cleanliness and lack of common sense of the other guests. People going to the toilet and not washing their hands, and using their finger to pick at the buffet food instead of the tongs provided. Some people also don\u2019t grasp the fact that they can go back to the buffet as many times as you like. There is no need to load your plate then not eat most of it. You can see the waiters are not impressed when clearing away plates full of food. What a waste. We sat on the amazing beach every day. Always plenty of space and sunbeds. The sea can get a bit rough.

I would return in a heartbeat! I must say, reviews were a huge reason we chose this hotel, so I hope this one is helpful. Above and beyond anything else, this hotel and it's ambiance are beautiful and amazing! One reason we chose this particular resort was due to the \"jungle atmosphere\" we saw in the photos and it surely lives up to it! We really wanted a nice, clean place with the comforts of home, but also didn't want to feel like we were home. We wanted to feel like we were in another country and with the lush landscaping and wildlife this resort offers, it did not disappoint! The lobby areas, pool, and walkways leading to the beach are well maintained and beautiful, with marble flooring on the Tucan side and wood-planked flooring on the Quetzel side. We saw everything from Monkeys (literally RIGHT outside our window a family of them our first morning, we were in room #1501), to Flamingos, Peacocks, Iguanas, and so much more! It was incredible! Second to the beauty of the resort was the staff! The customer service was incredible. Anytime we had a request, question or concern, the staff was there within minutes to assist. I can't say enough about how they go out of their way to make you feel comfortable and cared for and they do an amazing job at maintaining the resort and the rooms. THE BEACH is fantastic! Beautiful white sand and crystal blue water. As my sister and I read in a review, if you walk to the left of the beach about 5-10 minutes when you are facing the water, you will see the hustle and bustle of other resorts and Playacar with tons to do. If you take a right and head down 5-10 minutes, it is the complete opposite, totally desolate, undeveloped, GORGEOUS scenery, beach and water. We walked down there twice and took tons of pictures. I definitely recommend going to Playa del Carmen, 5th Ave. is a $7 cab ride (one way) about 10 minutes from the resort (you could walk in about 30 mins and save the money), but there is tons of shopping and lots to check out. The street vendors do wear you down after awhile, trying to hustle you and make deals, but I already anticipated it so it didn't bother me. As others have mentioned in reviews, the USD rules here so DO NOT worry about bringing Pesos with you. My sister and I didn't bring any and had no trouble at all. Only a few negatives from this reviewer: The main one would be the food. I will admit, it was rather disappointing. The buffet has edible items, don't get me wrong, it's not like I starved. But daily it was the same. My buffet faves included the chips and guac, french fries, and an omelette in the morning. Nothing impressive. Drinks overall are not bad. I don't drink a lot, so I don't have much to compare too, but the fruity \"fluffy\" drinks were actually pretty good. What was most disappointing were the \"specialty\" restaurants. One of the BEST parts about going during LOW SEASON is that we were able to get a reservation for the specialty restaurants every night, which had me enthused, but unfortunately there wasn't much to be excited about. We didn't get to eat at the \"steak house\" but did eat at the \"Italian\" place twice, the \"mexican\" once and the \"Japanese\" twice. The food was a JOKE. At the italian place one night I fettucine alfredo, easy right? Not so much. Noodles were so odd and the sauce was horrible. We left and went to the buffet. The best place out of the \"specialty\" places was the Japanese. It was like the \"Teppenyaki/Hibachi\" style, where the guy cooks on the cooktop in front of your table, simple stuff, chicken, meat, shrimp.....my chicken was good and it was relatively entertaining. I will agree with one previous reviewer however that stated \"if it were a stand alone restaurant it would never survive\". But in comparison, it was by far the best of the places there. Another comment about going during \"low season\" we had no problems finding beach chairs or lounge areas by the pool at ANY time during the day. The only negative part of \"low season\" is the sun goes down completely by 5:00pm! As long as you are out early enough you can get in plenty of beach/pool time, but that was rather odd. Lastly, my only other bit of \"warning\" is that when you get off your flight and come out of customs to the right there are all these people in blue shirts. This lady approached my sister and I asking if we needed help (we were looking for our shuttle transport to the hotel through Olympus, as this was the transfer company, we booked our trip through AAA) and she acted like she worked for them and told us to follow her. We were led to this guy that we believed worked for the shuttle company. Turns out we get this long sales thing roping us into getting a discount for ziplining and other things we wanted to do. In order to get this discount we had to go to another resort where they tried to sell us a time share. We ended up doing it and all and all it worked out because we ended up going to \"Kin-Ha Cenotes\" which is a place advertised NOWHERE, that we would've never known about had it not been for this. We went ziplining, ATV'ing and jumped into the Cenotes (natural water springs) DEEP in the Jungle. It wasn't as touristy as going to a place like XPLOR which you will see advertised everywhere, but we had an awesome time, with great tour guides and an experience you will never forget. These guys in the blue shirts work for \"Tourist Advisors\" try to avoid them, they waste a 1/2 hour of your time when you get off the plane. Also, if you do have a transport shuttle, even though it sounds convenient, it really wasn't. I can't imagine how much a cab would be from the airport to Iberostar (I am guessing a small) fortune, but it took us over 2 hours to get to the actual resort after we dropped off numerous other people at their resorts. Ours was the last one. All in all, great trip, great weather, great time! SO RELAXING and a great 30th bday present to myself and fun hanging out with my sister!! So, long story short, if you have any reservations, don't!

Check in was fast an efficient, the bellhop bringing us and our bags to the room in a golf cart was a nice touch. The room was your basic hotel/resort room, clean and comfortable but nothing outstanding. The big walk in shower was great and for us was the highpoint of the room, but then we didn't spend anytime in the room except for sleeping so a cot by the pool would have worked for us. The design, layout and decor of the hotel are excellent, it flows well and fits into the jungle layout perfectly. The pool is huge and also being around 66\" deep makes it comfortable to actually swim in. This resort has been covered many times and i'm not going to go over everything, basically just going to name some of the high points and for us a couple of not so high points. Location in Playacar is perfect, we walked into town numerous times at for us it was 35 minutes from the room to 5th ave. The beach is wide, clean and the water warm and clear. A number of reviews complain about some of the food and or restaurants, we didn't find that to be true for us. We had 4 ala cartes but due to being busy on a few nights and having no interest in the Japanese one we only ate ala carte twice, first was the Hacienda Mexican where we both had the Flambe kibobs which were prepared perfectly. 2nd one was the la Miramba staek house and we both had the tenderloin, it was honestly one of the best cuts of meat I have ever had anywhere, I was shocked at how good it was. We ate at both of the buffets many times and aside from a few dishes we didn't care, nobody is going to like everything, we found them both pleasant place to hang out with a wide variety of food. Some of the reviews state they got tired of eating the same thing everyday but the only meal we saw this happening was breakfast where it was the same items everyday. For lunch and dinner the buffet menu had 3-4-5 different choices every night, there was always something new to try that we hadn't had on a previous night. Bar service is excellent no matter which one you choose to utilize, neither of us are big drinkers but there were days where I would have 4-5-6 ok maybe 7 or 8 different drinks. Having the ability to try many different choices with friendly bartenders was a lot of fun. Monkeys, yes we saw them numerous times but it was always before 8am, anytime after that and we never saw them again. Building 1500 right next to the junle had a family of monkeys hanging out 1 day, was easily 5-6 of them. The coati's were my favorite, looked so friendly you wanted to reach out and pet them. With that being said I do have a couple of negatives. #1. I really did not care for the vendors that would set up in the walkway leading to the theater. dealt with enough of that on 5th ave and I would like some relief from it while at my resort. #2. The swim up bar while looking halfway decent has seen it's better days and needs refreshing as well as a bit warmer water. Everywhere else the water temp was fiine but the bar is bit sheltered and temds to get cool easily. #3. We didn't care for the Star Friends theater shows, all the people performing did a great job and were warm and friendly it's just that neither my wife or I particularly care for those style of shows/skits. We attended a couple and they just weren't for us. Overall we loved just about everything here, we actually came to prefer to Quetzal side over the Tucan after a few days. The suspended wooden walkway with the mini canyone below it was a nice touch that pushed it ahead of the Tucan. One final aspect I just recalled, the gym is actually pretty nice. I used it twice and it has all the basics for a nice workout, dumbells up to 50 lbs are a bit light but for a vacation workout will do just fine. Bench press setup with oly weights was good, as was the universal station with lat pulldown, tricep press, etc. I believe there were 3 treadmills as well as a couple of ellipitcals. All in all a nice little gym.

Be sure to visit the Quezatel side, near there buffet there is a waterfall and many flamingos, swans, etc. Rooms- very clean and well taken care of, the building we were in was 1100. Great location right near beach and pool! Staff- super nice and always working hard to be helpful and friendly! Pool- great for the kids, they loved doing the water aerobics and all the other pool activities lead by the Star Friends. Limbo, beach party w/ paella My kids loved the ice cream cart near the bar, for excellent ice cream! Now for the not so good.... Beach- water and sand was nice, but the chairs NEED to be replaced!!! Very dirty and stained. The 1st thing in the morning, there still was trash and bar cups around. Lots of cigarette butts too, seems like people rather use the beach sand as an ashtray instead of the cigarette sand trash cans that Iberostar has provided throughout the whole property. Food- for the most party food was fine, I have had better at other Inclusive resorts, but it was the same thing every day. The themed restaurants were just ok. Upon arrival, make sure you do your reservations for the whole week. they fill up fast! My recommendation would be the Hacienda, and Japanese. The other 2 where horrible! Bar- when ordering your drinks, dont forget to ask for your top shelf liquor. We tipped our bartenders and wait staff on occassion and was much appreciated. Some extra tips for leaving the property- The excursions we highly recommend (with kids too ages 4 and 6) Xel-ha we did snorkling, tubing, zip line. Food and drinks were excellent. Place is super clean and very well maintained. Dolphin Discovery we swam with Dolphins, and again very clean and well done!!!

The weather sucked but that's the chance you take when you go at this time of year. We went with our kids and 3 other couples....all of the women are high school friends and it's the first time we have all travelled together...and I think I speak for all of us when I say that we were all very impressed with this resort! The food was great...I have been to a few all-inclusives in the Mayan Riviera and this is by far the best food we have had. We were easily able to get reservations in all of the a-la cart restaurants and we were even offered more than our 3 reservations for the week so that we could try all of the restaurants. We loved the steakhouse and Japanese best but the Mexican restaurant was also very good. The only restaurant we didn't love was the Italian. The buffets were great - lots of variety and the place by the pool always had something tasty to offer if we were peckish in the afternoon. The ice cream cart by the pool was also a lovely yummy treat. The grounds were beautifully kept and there was always some wildlife to see. The monkeys were a bit tough to find but we managed to get a great glimpse of a full family including a mom with a baby on her back on our last day. One caution is that most of the floor surfaces are smooth tile and can be very slippery if it rains. As the roofs are thatched, many leak and there can be quite a lot of wet places in the indoor areas (the theatre especially). The pool and beach are beautiful and the service was always very fast and friendly. One negative of the pool area is the seating. Many of the lounge chairs by the pool are not strong enough to hold you up in a reclining posture and we witnessed and experienced a lot of people falling flat on their backs when trying to relax!! And finally we come to the staff. As mentioned before, I have been to many all-inclusive resorts. The staff at the Iberostar Tucan/Quetzal are fantastic!! We felt like there was an attempt made to really personalize our experience with staff members like Mauricio coming by daily to check in with us and talk to us about our vacation....Joseph always going out of his way to talk to our kids (and blow their grandfather's Donald Duck impression out of the water!!) and Ricardo coming by to say hello at the lobby bar and invite us to the shows. We were impressed with all of the wait staff as well - they always greeted us warmly and even noticed when a few of the group were absent (usually at breakfast from too much tequila the night before!!). We travelled with a 16 month old and were happily given full cartons of milk to take backnto our room for her bottles. Aside from the weather, the pool chairs and the slippery floors....I have no complaints!! Thank you to everyone at Iberostar Tucan for a fabulous vacation.

This resorts greatest asset is its' staff! What a great group of people working at this hotel! Very helpful and friendly. The grounds at this hotel are truly jungle-like, yet very well maintained. There are a multitude of animals roaming the resort and don't be surprised to see a peacock roaming through the lobby from time to time. Also there is a fair sized group of monkeys living on the grounds which can be heard more often than seen. Our room was 1544, just about smack in the middle between the lobby and the beach. In my opinion,it was the perfect spot. The beds are rock hard... about that,i can't even sugar coat. However,it seems that every tropical place we've traveled to has had this 'hard bed' problem. The solution is simple. Call the front desk and ask for a foam topper. We did,and within an hour we had a foam top on our bed which went a long way toward making our nights more comfortable. *** We added our own double foam topper which we bought for 20 dollars at walmart. It was no problem to squish into our suitcase and weighs next to nothing. We got the idea from another contributor on this site.*** Our mini bar was stocked daily with water and beer and our room staff was just amazing! Sometimes, we would return from breakfast before 8 am and our room was already made up. We tipped about 40 pesos/day while we were there for our room lady. Our Canadian dollar was worth about 12 pesos. Needless to say, a very nominal expense and for the great service you get?... it's a no brainer. The one negative about our room was that the water is NOT drinkable. I realize that this is only a minor inconvenience,since bottled water is readily available,however, if you are traveling with children, You will have to make sure they don't drink the water from the tap. The food at this resort was very satisfactory,but as one might expect,very repetitive at the buffets. Again, the food is of very good quality,just a lot of the same,which could be rough after a week. On the bright side,we ate at the Steakhouse,Mexican,and Italian eateries, and all were very good. DO use your included reservations.. 3 per 1 week stay. They are worth it. The BEACH!!!! what can i say?! the beach here is AMAZING.... simple as that. Do get down early if you're like us and like to have a shady spot to relax for the day. The shady spots go quick. You can also get your own sun shades from the hotel to place wherever you like on the beach which is a huge bonus. We did take a tour to see the COBA pyramid and mayan village. It was well worth the 90 dollars/person. Includes lunch and a very bright tour guide! Climbing the pyramid at Coba is not for the faint of heart but it is worth it. How any people can say that they have climbed a mayan pyramid??? Take the tour to Coba, and ACTUALLY be able to touch the pyramid and even climb the stairs to the place where the ancient Maya did their human sacrifices. Very cool....if not morbid?....History nerds like myself and my wife, loved learning about this stuff. Amazing!!!! Overall, I highly recommend the Iberostrar Tucan .

I've never revisited a resort, but after my experience at the Tucan I probably would go back if i was in Mexico again. We had an amazing stay - there are a few things that we were not happy about, but these were totally down to guests & out of the control of the hotel staff. You will probably find the same anywhere you stay, it's just a shame that a small minority of people do not know how to behave in a public place. A few examples.....things that annoy! 1. Guys & girls not washing their hands after using the toilet. Gross! 2. People using chairs to put their feet up (someone has to sit on that) 3. People eating & drinking over the buffet (you can always walk back & get more later) 4. General poor hygiene. I wont single out any nationality..but i will say it wasn't the local visitors.

Lobby nice and big with artifacts, parrots, shops and lots of chairs; with lobby bar. Front desk staff were always helpful and polite; fruit drink on check in was nice and refreshing. Property not huge so great and quick to get around, bellman took our bags and we just walked. 2 paths to beach area, paved area and center tropical tree/shady area with rock pathway. 2 days they had some sellers at the beach; and 2 days at night they had local sellers in as well with local stuff. Lots of lights around property at night to give off nice glow. We were in building 12, right behind pool; great location! No elevators and tiles so watch your step. Room was nice and big, bathroom and shower area too. We told them it was our parents anniversary and they did rose petals with bed display and around the sick. Mini fridge had pop/water/beer but not really cold. parents put beer in ice bucket in fridge in afternoon for cold 'happy hour' while getting ready for dinner. Safe in room easy to use and free. Beds were a bit hard, but I'm a bit more 'sensitive' to beds than the rest of my family; they only started to feel it about day 4/5. When I go back (yes loved it that much) I'll see if they have a bed topper that we use at Riu Playacar as theirs were rocks. Resort wasn't full so they closed down Caribbean restaurant but we used steakhouse and Italian; both good. Buffets we loved every time we went, main one for breakfast or lunch; and by beach the 'small' breakfast restaurant had just enough of what you needed but got to sit by the beach. BBQ for lunch with hotdogs; one day on beach they did paella with some limbo. Lots of great activity staff and stuff to do; we tried archery and shooting; bike ride to town as well. If you don't want to walk to town small shopping area just down street. We did snorkeling 1 day; went about 20min away. Once in water saw a turtle within minutes; first area boring but once he took us further out saw lots of fish; coral; cuttlefish need. One point a small school swam right around me. Low season/filling seats we figure as came on beach with 2for1 $20 each so how could we say no. On beach the spa team walked by to give out deals and give free 5min massage/I did was very nice. prices reasonable but just more than at home so didn't; but you can do in hut right on beach. Couple servers walking around pool and beach for drink orders so was nice; we still went to the beach bar and restaurant bar for bit better drinks(clothes required). Fruit juice drinks were 'watery' we figured as juices in general not as sweet as we are used to at home. Pina colada, mixes etc we stayed away from and did vodka/tonic and yummy mojitos. we tipped bartenders/servers as really nice; one day dad ordered 4 drinks and bartender brought for him to us at the beach. they were buddies after that; again all staff so great. Lots of animals on property, tucans in cage by kids area/pool and if you walk down pathways to main buildings lots of 'forest' animals (birds/peacocks etc and waterfall area by buffet restaurant with ducks and swan; flamingos just down from there. One day monkeys crawling on our building, one set of patio balconies walking to tree. One day in trees outside our room mama and baby and another were eating; only clearly saw twice but you can still hear them. In lobby bar peacock strolled thru, beach restaurant outside having breakfast drink peacock right there as well and everyone loves them. For eco friendly resort I would hope people would stop feeding bread to the animals, seagulls and fish in the water as not natural food for them. Wish they told us what we could feed them or provide. Some cute little fish right off beach too. on Beach lots of pallapas and at beach towel hut can also get beach umbrellas and floatations (figure people left behind) to lay out on in water.

My companion loves, loves, loves the beach. I could take it or leave it, keep that in mind as you read. I will say that the ocean was beautiful. I would far rather look at it than get in it. :) We got a very good deal (5 nights, $800, 2 people, so that's $80 per person per night) considering that it's an all-inclusive resort. Our room was one building back from the beach, which was good for getting to the beach, but made for a long walk back to the lobby. Sometimes you can flag down a passing cart and hitch a ride. The room itself was fine, about on par with something you'd find in a cheap chain hotel in the US (e.g., Super 8, Howard Johnson). There was a fridge filled with soda, water, and beer (all free). Neither of us drink beer, so we asked them to take that away and bring more soda and water. They seemed puzzled by this (\"No cervezas, por favor.\" \"No cervezas!?\" \"Si.\"), but they did it. The room also had a small safe. We had a couple of blackouts, but they didn't last for more than 30 seconds or so. I think part of the reason our deal was good is that Mexico in June is HOT and HUMID. I spent time in the water (pool and ocean), but the water was so warm that I often retreated to the room and cranked up the AC. As far as the food goes, we were a little underwhelmed. It was mostly very bland, which I can understand given the need to satisfy people from around the world. The service, however, was great. The best meal of the day was breakfast. There were so many choices, and it seemed less bland than other meals. The restaurants that required reservations were a tick better than the buffets, and although they said they required dressier clothes (no shorts for men, etc.), there were plenty of people there in shorts. One night, I accidentally tripped my companion on the way from dinner to the room, and she went down hard on the marble. The staff was very helpful, very concerned (perhaps in fear of lawsuits, but still...), and very attentive.

Everything that has been said already on here is spot on in that the beach is just beautiful, pure white soft cool sand, the brightest clearest water, no seaweed, stones, rocks etc and the perfect temperature. The hotel is the best I have been to, no its not The Ritz but it has so much charm and character and a real Mexican flavour. The grounds and animals are amazing as people have said before which all adds to that tropical feel. What stood out for me was the staff and service, I've been to many All Inclusive hotels but this was the best service I have come across, they were incredibly friendly and helpful and really put in that extra effort to make sure you are happy and have everything you need. I like to drink tea in the room and they even gave me from the restaurant a carton of milk to take back to put in the mini bar fridge so I could have my cup of tea, speaking of which the tea is very weak and I needed about 4 tea bags in the jug to make a decent cup. Next year I'll be taking me Tetley!! Oh yes, definitely going back next year! For me, this holiday has everything, best beach ever, nice rooms, good shower, beautiful surroundings with exotic animals and interesting scenery around the grounds, lots of local culture, great snorkeling - we even swam with a giant turtle, lively nights (good disco playing well known music) or quiet nights if you want them. The only thing I would say is the entertainment is a bit 'Butlins' but many others enjoyed it, just not my thing. Great atmosphere in the Lobby bar, we made loads of friends and had some good times. We went on the Dolphin Trainer day with First Choice and had the most amazing experience, I would recommend this trip wholeheartedly. A top tip about the rooms - email the hotel beforehand and ask for the mattress toppers because the beds are quite hard but very comfy with these on. Also, the pool is huge and very clean, the swim up bar is in a separate pool which is a good idea and has lots of moveable seats which I've never come across before. Some days it was very quiet and other days very busy. I was very concerned about going in September (hurricane season) but needn't have worried as the weather was lovely, very hot and sunny although we did have rain on the last two days. I thoroughly enjoyed the food, perhaps a little too much! Fab burgers at lunch time, proper ice cream stand by the beach, the steak house restaurant was to die for, tepanyaki japanese good fun and lovely food, the red wine was really good too and also proper drinks in the bars.

We were a bit worried about where we'd be staying based on the stops our transfer bus was taking prior to our hotel (they looked pretty grungy). It was a pleasant surprise when we stopped at the Tucan - it was beautiful! The forecast called for showers and thundershowers the entire week we stayed but it didn't rain once. Rooms: Very spacious shower, hard beds. Ask for a foam mattress topper right away. Clean with good A/C. Food: Steakhouse and Japanese were good, we found the Italian gross and didn't try the Tropical or Mexican. The buffet was hit or miss - started out really bad but got better throughout the week. Drinks: Not really any premium brands. Ask specifically for Smirnoff, Crown Royal, Jack Daniels or Tanqueray or you will get pretty nasty spirits. Their fountain pop is flat so we just started carrying around cans of pop from our mini fridge in our room instead. Entertainment: The \"Big Show\" was pretty good, depending on the night. Don't miss the Mexican Folklore night and the Pre-Hispanic Show. Pool: Excellent, but would have liked to have the swim up bar in the same area (had to leave the main pool and go into the adults only pool). If you want a cabana you have to be up before 7am. Service: The staff were super friendly and always greeted you and would get anything you asked for. Tipped our maid a couple of bucks daily and our mini fridge was always full. We ordered room service quite a bit and it was there in less than 20 minutes everytime. There were always so many people cleaning and tending to the property. I really appreciated the front desks help in getting my camera back after leaving it on a tour van. Wildlife: Tortoises, Agoutis, Peacocks, Monkeys, Iguanas, Anoles, Koi, Flamingos, Swans, Macaws....all on site. Really neat to see. Tips: Take the ferry to Cozumel and rent a dune buggy for the day ($45USD) to tour the island. Visit the Iberostar Cozumel to get a free wristband and swim at their beach - there's tons of fish. Before you take your dune buggy back you have to gas it up at the Pemex. MAKE SURE you specify you want the green/cheap gas or they will screw you and fill it with premium ($8 fill versus $25). When you go to buy your ferry ticket go to the actual UltraMar ticket booth and buy a ONE WAY ticket. We would suggest going on the Coba Mayan Experience Tour with AllTourNative. Don't underestimate the power of an overcast day. We got sunstroke on our first day. Start slow, get shade and reapply sunscreen often. Don't bother bringing pesos. The USD rules here.

The Beach: Cleaned and groomed daily. The beach is very clean and well maintained. The staff work tirelessly serving drinks and cleaning up after the guests. My recommendation is to get to the beach early cause it fills up quick. Restaurants: We tried most restaurants from the buffet, mexican, italian, japanese. We did not try the steakhouse but heard it was alright. The buffet for breakfast had your assortment of ceral, bread, eggs, fruit. The food was the same everyday however, they do provide an assortment so you can work around the routine. Lunch is served near the beach at the grill. The food was very good with a large assortment of items to choose from. At peak times, the lunch restaurant can get fairly busy. Dinner was much quieter. Between all the a la carte restaurants we did try, they were all quite good. Only complaint especially at the Japanese restaurant is that you must be on time and can't dawdle. They have limited seating and staff to accommodate all the guest who wish to dine there. If you are more than 5-7 minutes late for your reservation you may loose your table, Entertainment: Obviously not Las Vegas material but entertaining nevertheless. Since the evening shows may change from time to time I won't go into detail on each show we did see. The production quality wasn't that good but for those who have children it will keep them focused and entertained. For those with children, the starfriends also run the daycare area. The disco located on the edge of the entrance of the resort ensures that most guest don't hear the constant thumping from the bassbins. The lights, fog machine and sound system could rival most small/medium size clubs but that's where it ends. The DJ plays your top 30 euro anthems that to some may drive you insane. What is worse is the next night, prepare to hear the same playlist in virtually the same order. Staff: A+. Always cleaning, always serving, always friendly.

We stayed in the Quetzal portion of this hotel this past Sep 18-23. Both sections (Tucan and Quetzal) are part of the same complex, but don't know if they share the same room amenities or nature trails, but they do share some facilities. I had a hard time deciding on hotels since we were traveling with a 1 year old. It was our first vacation together and his first time to the beach. I am a VERY picky person and do a lot of research to make a decision. I am NOT sorry of my choice. Let me start by stating that the beach of this hotel is EXCELLENT. This is my main plus of choosing this hotel. I wanted a REAL Caribbean experience for us, and that my baby could go in the water with no fear of rocks, pesky algae or nasty waves. This section of beach is excellent!! We could walk several yards into the ocean and it would hit my waist (and I'm 5 ft tall!), super calm waters. The hotel is next to 2 more large resorts (other Brands), and the beach is pretty similar, BUT this hotel is the only one along that strip that had umbrellas on the beach. So for the others if you want to get out of the sun, you had to walk a considerable distance. Although, the later you get to the beach, the harder it is to get one. But we stayed there a week and could always find one ... so it's not that hard (in \"Low\" season). Pools are good, nice size and always very clean. They have kiddy pools, sports pools and pool bar. But a pool is normally not what you seek in a Caribbean vacation. But we had a great time there as well. Also, the hotel has very nice \"natural\" areas, they kept some areas of the original landscape and left it for some animals (all safe!.. no jaguars or things like that), that's nice for kids to see! We never had a hard time with mosquitoes, but bring some repellent anyway. Food is nice, not that immense variety, but we could always find good food and leave very satisfied. Plus, if you don't like the buffet, there are standard lifesavers (burgers, hot dogs, pizza, sandwiches, nachos, chilly fries). Great ice cream. Entertainment is decent. It's no Broadway show, but I really can't say anything bad about those people, they really give their best to try and entertain. And in truth, they do! Rooms. Simple, no elegance (a bit out dated); minibar no snacks only beverages, so buy your own. Beds are HARD, but you can request another mattress. There are NO elevators... so, if you are traveling with a baby, request a first floor room. Service. Very friendly staff, always cleaning and asking if you need something. Location. EXCELLENT. There is a little market square about 2 blocks away. And it's a short driving distance (10min) to the main avenue of Playa del Carmen (5th Ave) were all the shops are. There are hospitals at both entrances of the complex were the hotel is located (which is a gated community adding extra security). Extras. There's scuba lessons, kayak, windsurf, etc... and a professional photography service. But all this is extra, not part of the all inclusive, and the photo service can be expensive (we did it and don't regret it though). We had a very good experience, and would definitely return.", "Date": "September 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "north wales", "Title": "\u201cnice holiday\u201d", "Author": "happycouple40", "ReviewID": "UR118729592", "Content": "Just returned from Iberostar Tucan in Playa del Carmen, the hotel was very nice (open plan design) the hotel has two sides Tucan and Quetzal with a small \"Jungle\" in the middle.The main entrance is where you will find lobby/reception area, 4 shops, selling all the usual items,and a bar, through out the hotel are water ponds with really large fish swimming around, some tortoise and a couple of small herons fishing for their tea, on the quetzal side you have got a couple of swans, beautiful waterfalls and flamingos, Just go for a wander round and you will see all the animals that live there, We did not like the room, we found it dark and the bed!! what can i say, we never slept for nearly a fortnight, the matteress is on a concrete slab, (watch the corners they hurt if you catch yourself on them) The T.V. is old and out dated, i think the rooms need modernising they are looking really tired. The tea/coffee making facillities are not very good, it is a coffee machine that falls apart half way through the boil, a kettle would be of better use especially if one of you drink tea, they do not provide milk just a couple of sachets of coffee mate, (not nice in tea) 2 teabags,sugar, coffee bags and a couple of stirring sticks..The small fridge housed cans of coke,diet coke, fanta ,sprite 2 of each,4 btls lager and water.We found the bathroom small and in need of modernisation,The balcony we could not use at night for the midges biting.... The shows were very good, main swimming pool is large and deep,with plenty of sunbeds around the pool area, the beach was wonderful, plenty of sunbeds, although the hotel was not very busy at this time of year, I think it could become a problem at busier times to get a sunbed, In the buffet restaurant we found the food hit and miss some nights, afternoon meals were quite repetative,the food overall was nice most of the time, but i must say the cake selection at afternoon and evening meals was fantastic, we over indulged (alot).The steak house was very nice, i did not like the idea of having to buy a bottle of white zinfandel wine at 350 mexican pesos, (when you are checking in nobody tells you this) exchange rate is roughly 19 pesos to the pound, (you can do the maths) you can still have house red or white....Sun lotion/aftersun/mossie spray, all expensive, take your own or take a taxi to wal-mart in playa del carmen cost of taxi 70 mx peso one way not expensive at all, we got all we needed from there, also BEWARE of having photographs taken by the adventure people,(they have got a shop in quetzal side) yes they can be very nice pictures and a great reminder of your holidays but ask how much they are before you go and have them done, Dont get ripped off like us pair of idiots, You can have a massage on the beach. use the gym, sauna and steam room, play tennis, table tennis or pool, and after all that if you have got any energy left go to the mascara night club......Lots going on.....We met some very nice people jane and gang, the family from leicester,a couple from near london, and the couple who have been to the tucan 7 times...it was very nice meeting you all............

Check-in was quick and easy and the staff polite and friendly. Everywhere you went in the resort you would be greeted with Aola's and friendly smiles from all the staff you past. LOCATION: The Tucan is approximately 45 minutes from Cancun airport and situated within the large gated community of Playacar on the outskirts of Playa del Carmen. Playacar itself is a purpose built little town consisting of numerous All Inclusive resorts and fancy houses surrounding a golf course. The Tucan itself is the second farthest resort from Playa del Carmen and is about a forty minute walk or five minute taxi ride (70 Pesos) to Fifth Avenue. About a five minute walk from the Tucan gates is a small shopping complex, consisting of a Starbucks, Chemist, excursion stalls and a variety of small shops selling anything you might require or have forgotten. Playa del Carmen is a large town but the tourists mainly stick to fifth avenue area, a long street filled with the usual tourist shops selling the same old holiday tat, bars, clubs and restaurants. RESORT & GROUNDS: The resort is split into two identically laid out hotels, the Tucan and the Quetzal, both surrounding a jungle area containing a variety of wildlife. Every aspect of the resort is aesthetically pleasing and grounds men doing a great job of keeping the place immaculately clean. We loved the jungle feel of the resort and enjoyed walking round each day looking for and seeing different animals. From investigating the grounds it appeared to us that the quetzal side had more of the jungle and more wildlife but on the Tucan side you still had lizards, peacocks Dougal animals crossing your path. ROOMS: We stayed in block 11 which was the closest block to the beach without upgrading to the ocean front suites. The location of this block was ideal for us as being beach people we could nip back to the room easily. The room itself was larger than expected and nicely decorated. Yes the beds are firm but we found them comfortable. The bathroom does not have a bath but a large walk in shower with dual shower heads. We did not have any problems with a lack of hot water showering at different times throughout the two week stay. The room has the usual amenities, including iron/board, hairdryer, TV with pay per view movies, coffee making facilities and bigger than average safe. The fridge was restocked every other day with soft drinks, water and beer. Although it did not feel cold it did the job. The balcony was large and had a partial sea view. We did not face the jungle which we liked as this reduced the chances of mosquitoes, which can be a problem this time of year. The room was cleaned everyday to a high standard and our chambermaid left different towel art, rose petals and chocolates on the bed. Thank you Orlando. FOOD & DRINK: As my fianc\u00e9e is a fussy eater we thought that this would be a problem but that wasn\u2019t the case. There was plenty of choice at the main buffet in the evening which was different each night. They attempt to cater for all tastes and my fianc\u00e9e was able to find some thing each night. As people have mentioned it is hot in the buffet but this is a result of it being open air and air con would be pointless. Breakfast was served in the Tucan buffet restaurant and also next to the beach in the tropical restaurant. We tried both of these and both had a wide variety continental and cooked breakfast. The tropical restaurant had slightly less choice as it was smaller but we preferred this as it was closer to the beach and less than a minute\u2019s walk from our room. At lunch the main buffet was available but we never tried this as we loved the grill bar next to the beach which served the best wedges and burgers. During our 2 week stay we were allocated 6 reservations at the a la carte restaurants but were offered extra reservations if there were spaces left on the day. The tropical restaurant was closed during our stay so we are unable to comment. Our favourite by far was the steakhouse, we loved the onion bloomers and the location of the restaurant as it was near to the beach so you got a lovely sea breeze (plus men can wear shorts!!!). The Italian and Mexican were also very good but unfortunately the Japanese was just ok. The show at the Japanese was fun but it gets very hot and we found the food too salty for our tastes. Also worth noting is the drink, the selection available is very good with a mixture of international and domestic brands. The cocktails are good at the lobby and theatre but not so much as the beach. We never found any drinks to be watered down anywhere. Also as one previous reviewer suggested the soft drinks were not carbonated, this is total rubbish. BEACH/POOL: We only went to the pool once as we are beach people but it was massive and always appeared clean. The beach is beautiful, white sand and turquoise waters, just what you want from the Caribbean. Due to the Tucan\u2019s location, you can walk right, past one other hotel and then the beach becomes deserted, walk left and you will eventually end up in Playa del Carmen. When we arrived the sea was rough but this calmed down into our second week, allowing for all the usual water sports to become available. The beach has plenty of sun beds and shade, which is more than required during the Mexican summer. People do get up early to play the towel game but this was never a problem on the days we slept in. EVENING ENTERTAINMENT: This consisted of either going to the lobby bar where there was a guitarist or pianist playing background music or the star friend\u2019s theatre between the Tucan and quetzal. We spent most nights here where there were different shows each night. Towards the end of the holiday some of the shows were repeated. We enjoyed some of the shows and the star friend\u2019s team work extremely hard at keeping the guest happy and entertained. After the shows there was live music and there was the nightclub Mascara. We went here a couple of nights for drinks as we were not ready to go to bed but it was not really our scene but the air con was very good! If you wanted a late night drink there was no where to go if you did not want to go to the nightclub. WEATHER: Our biggest concern was visiting Mexico during the Hurricane/wet season, these concerns proved to be unwarranted as the sun shone for almost the entire two weeks. The only rain was on the final 2 days in the late afternoon and it only lasted for an hour or two. The humidity is also very high, which can be uncomfortable but you do get used to it. Would we go back to this hotel? Yes we would but there are many different places in the world we want to see first. Would we recommend the Iberostar Tucan?

A covered walkway took you through to the restaurant area and onward to the rooms.( No air conditioning in the restaurant). The rooms were spotless and maid service excellent. However our first room was overlooked by jungle . We asked to change rooms and were given another which was overlooked by jungle!! Our 3rd room was looking onto the public area and was great. The first 2 rooms were very dark due to the jungle nearly touching the balcony. The restaurant was clean and waiter service very good but the chefs had an annoying habit of putting fresh food on top of cold food and stirring it all together, consequently the food was never hot. The speciallity restaurants were very good, especially the steak house. Pool area was very clean and plenty of sunbeds available with no-one booking them with towels! A nice feature was leaving the room to go to the pool, we had to take a walk through the jungle ( short walk) Plenty of wildlife walking about including monkeys peacocks agoutis and so on. Entertainment was in a purpose built area which had a very good stage area with band, and a lighting rig. They had the ability to put on first class shows but the entertainment wasn't up to much. Plenty of people thought it was great so maybe it was me being hard to please! There was a bike ride at 10 oclock and 3 oclock which was very good. Once there was only me and Joshua the staff member . (thanks Joshua for that , great fun!! ) All in all I would recommend this hotel but not when we went (August ) due to the stifling humidity.

The spa was nice. It is open and airy with no true ceiling dividers so unfortunatly when people come in and out of the spa lobby sometimes you can hear them. We didn't mind though.

Travelling solo a lot, I like hostels as a means to meet people/all the basics, and hopefully that can vouch for what my threshold for niceties is. First off the hotel itself was very nice, jungles and wildlife were amazing, walk to the rooms through the paths was fun, beach was great, rooms were more than adequate, food and a la carte restaurants found to be delicious. Given that all that on its own would have felt my $275/nt would have been well spent. It was left to the staff to screw it up. I took the bus from the airport to the town, then walked to the resort. Nice little 30 minute walk. Upon getting to the resort I was told I could not enter because I didn't have a bracelet. I told him I was checking in. Didn't matter. I told him I had a reservation. Didn't matter. I showed him my reservation. Didn't matter. I asked him how I'm supposed to get a bracelet if no ones allowed on the resort without one, but you get them on the resort? He said I simply could not come in. We stood staring at each other for twenty seconds, so I just went in. He started yelling and I kept going, eventually blew a whistle, someone came but I left them behind and checked in. Went smooth. Had a quiet night, day two booked the Japanese restaurant. Good food, good service there, a fun experience, and I was the only one to catch the shrimp they threw in the air. Met two nice ladies and went into town after. Day 4 my friend surprised me by saying he caught an earlier flight (he was supposed to come the next day) and that he was in town. I told him to come on by. He went through the same hassles at the gate and eventually had to sacrifice his passport just to come meet me in the lobby. He asked about staying in my room and was told it would be $320. More expensive then the person who booked the room in the first place? Then it was $340 for his own room. When is adding a second person to a room more than 2x the cost of 1? Or two rooms essentially the same price as one? After travelling and being already tired of the nonsense, he acquiesced and got his own room. His first impression however was a bitter taste of being taken. We asked about the Japanese restaurant again (as he just arrived) said it was full, but were fortunate that the man behind us(A nice couple from Belgium) said his wife was ill and would be cancelling theirs. So we took the reservation, and had it signed off by the dinner kiosk. After changing for dinner, I realized I forgot the slip in my trunks, explained the situation at the hostess stand, pointed to the couples name on the roster, and after 10 minutes of consultation said we absolutely could not go in with out it. A 15 minute round trip later I have it, but there's another 10 minutes of consultation. They asked us if we really had a reservation, and if we didn't just make it up. They actually accused us of forging a dinner slip. I assumed there was some kind of booking snafu, and those seats had been reassigned twice, but no, when they finally relented - 30 minutes past seating time, we go in to see a fully packed restaurant - save for our two seats. Had fun that night, then checked out the next morning. We asked about extending our stay, but at close to $700/nt for the two of us, (that was the \"best\" they could do) we said we'd be leaving. They said \"we don't believe you, I think you're going to sneak back in and stay with someone else\". We looked at each other as we didn't know anyone else, so they repeated \"Are you really leaving?\" At which point we walked out. I've been to about 10 resorts(Yay RIU!), all over, and heaps more basic backpacking trips, and this one left the worst taste in my mouth. I can forgive most anything, but acting in bad faith, accusing your customers of intent to tresspass, forging dinner receipts, lying, future theft, while the whole time trying to take them to the cleaners money wise is unacceptable. I've routinely booked equivalent AI packages from Canada(flights, hotel, transfers) for $750 or less for a week. I was willing to pay $1100 for 4 nights accommodation only, because it was over new years, and it was a little bit of an unusual situation. But then after we're already there, I invited a friend to stay, you say that $680/nt for just a hotel was the best you could do? BS. If that was the case week long getaways would all be over $5000.

He ran down all of the amenities and showed us the locations of everything on a map of the property. He also suggested that we make our dinner reservations right away. Our room was in the 1100 building, which is one building away from the beach and right next to the pool. The common areas of this hotel are breathtaking! The lobby of the Tucan is a huge open structure, with 20 foot tall Mayan statues, water fountains, floral displays and even 2 red macaws to greet you. Walking through the property is a feast for the eyes and you can tell that it is very well maintained. There are large waterfalls, traversed by bridges that lead you to the various restaurants. The center area is a nature preserve with lighted trails and informative signs about the various wildlife. We saw peacocks, monkeys, agouti, flamingos and various lizards. The pool is immense with different areas, palapas, a swim up bar and even cabanas. But honestly we did not spend much time by the pool, as the beach here is amazing. We never once had a problem getting a place to sit, and there are waiters there to bring you cocktails. Also there is a snack bar serving burgers, ice cream and nachos. After spending time in a mediocre hotel in Cancun, the food at the Iberostar was a welcome relief. The buffets are large with a great selection of well prepared food. The selection included grilled chicken, steak, jumbo shrimp, house made hot sauces, pasta stations and authentic Mexican. Also the food at the Italian restaurant was excellent. The antipasti was what you would expect from any good Italian place in the States. My only problem was with the room itself. It's not terrible, but considering the rest of the resort it could have been better. The TV remote and hair dryer did not work, but were promptly replaced. The AC gets just cold enough to be bearable. Also the decor is garish (bright yellow and orange) and outdated. We did enjoy spending time on the balcony but the door would stick and had to be forced shut. With a little TLC and polish the rooms could be excellent. I would highly recommend this resort. It is tranquil and relaxing, but there is a party scene if you want it. Every day when I left the room in the morning, a staff member would say \"Good morning sir! How was your sleep?\" or \"There's a great show tonight I think you and your wife would enjoy\". Thanks for a great trip Iberostar...

Speaking from experience of an all inclusive hotel traveller.... read what I have to say and book somewhere else. I know when people read this site they have often booked the hotel or looking to book a hotel. They want to read good reviews to help them choose a place to stay. That is why I am writing this review. Starting with the good points, the staff is friendly - however think about this: What hotel in Mexico does not have friendly staff? Lets be honest, they need a job. This hotel has a jungle feel to it. Lots of wildlife animals around which means lots of animals doing their business all over the place. Watch where you walk. Damp rooms that smell like mold. Beds are uncomfortable. No hot water in rooms between 9am - 11am or after 7pm at night. Buffets are open air - so birds and other animals are all over the place .... doing their business. Hot hot hot in the buffets. No change of food in the buffets - very bland selection. Reservations are needed for other restaurants - and we only got to make 1. The others were booked up because the hotel was full. Another note about the food is the lack of basic food handling techniques - i personally witnessed the same tongs etc being used for cooked and uncooked food. With the open air buffets, the food is not sheltered and is covered in flies/bugs. Watered down drinks. Had to get up and get my own drinks a lot of the time, as the staff just walked right by me - even though I tipped very well. Just lazy and couldn't handle more than 2 drinks on their trays.

We also saw several monkeys from both rooms everyday as well as between the Quetzal buffet and the flamingo pont. We drove the west, south, and east coasts of Cozumel this trip and enjoyed spending a few hours at the Ibero Cozumel. It is a slightly smaller more intimate resort, but there is not alot around the area. We prefer the Tucan because of the location and activities there.

What really set the tone for the stay (and brought some disappointment) was the fact that they couldn\u2019t find the reservation for us at check in. We were told at check in that the reservation was not in their computer system. They really didn\u2019t know what to do or say to us. They pretty much told us, there is no reservation in the system and since we can\u2019t find your name in the system, our hotel is at full capacity and we have no rooms available. After standing around until they figured what do to, apx. an hour had passed by. This was after showing a printed copy of the receipt with the confirmation number to them. We had our reservation through Travelocity. I honestly can\u2019t say who screwed up if it was the hotel or Travelocity. However, waiting for a few hours to figure what\u2019s going on, not knowing if you have a place to stay the night, tired from an overnight & connecting flight and transferring from the Cancun airport to Playacar, and being hungry is not a good combination. After apx. 3 hours, we were told they found a room for us and after questioning what happened, they really tried to avoid the question. Very disappointing! Now a few notes: overall the hotel was average to a bit over average (depends on your taste) If you like a more natural theme/environment, then you will love the place. The hotel is kept fairly clean. You\u2019ll see a lot of different animals throughout the hotel grounds. The rooms are basic simple rooms. The rooms were nice and cool with the a/c on even though the weather was very hot outside. The beds are on the harder side; definitely not comfortable. The person who cleaned the room, did a great job every day. Everyday there were different towel \u201cfigures\u201d left by her. The food was average. I\u2019m personally not picky about food, but you do get bored of eating from the same offerings everyday at their buffet. However, I do understand that a resort like this has to cater to many different people with different taste buds that it becomes very hard to cater towards everyone. The burgers by the beach snack place were very yummy. Didn\u2019t get to go in the swim up bar since they closed by 6pm? Waitress staff at the restaurants and beach were sporadic. If you want a drink, you\u2019ll need to get up and get the drink yourself. The cool thing there were self serve fountain drink dispensers next to the bar on the beach. The bar by the lobby was a good cozy lounge area and wasn\u2019t too loud. We didn\u2019t have a chance to do their specialty restaurants since we were out and about most of the time. The beach area was very nice. Even though there are signs everywhere not to \u201creserve\u201d the chairs on the beach, everyone doesn\u2019t seem to respect this. Most people get up early in the morning and \u201creserve\u201d their chairs on the beach. Reserve-meaning putting your towels on chairs to hold your spots. WiFi service is available for a fee. I think I paid about $10 US for 1 hour, but I needed it for work. Taxi service from/to Playa Del Carmen\u2019s 5th Avenue to the hotel runs for $70 pesos. If you want to walk-take comfy shoes-and you'll be there in about 20-30 minutes. Iberostar is located on the southern part of Placar and one of the last few hotels at the souther tip of Playacar .

Loads of good excursions, coba one of the best, Tulum can be done by cab and if going from playcar, return trip, do not pay anymore than 800 pesos as the cab drivers will try for more.

Everyone had a blast! (I`m 23, my partner is 27 and we had people from 1-82 with us.) Arrival: We went with Sunwing so we were met at Cancun Airport by one of their representatives. He was good a directly such a large group and getting us to our shuttle bus. The ride is almost an hour to the hotel by the transport service rep kept us busy. He talked about the hotel, Playacar, Playa del Carmen and a lot of helpful information about tipping, food, etc. The hotel staff were prepared with a huge sign up table so the check in process went very smoothly. When we got to our room we found we were still very warm. By the end of the first few days were were adjusted but these first few minutes felt like a sauna! The A/C sits at 20 which is ok with a ceiling fan on. However our ceiling fan would not work without having the lights on. ?. The staff came and tried to help us but was some weird wiring issue. This was taking forever as the language barrier with the staff at night was very difficult. I found during the day it was easier to find someone who could understand me and I could them. About 2 hours later I was able to get someone on the phone who could pretty well understand the problem. Instead of trying to explain it all I just asked him for a floor fan. Problem solved! The Room: People complain about the beds?! That is strange as we thought ours was great! We liked that they were platforms instead of a typical bed. No under the bed losses! The room was clean and spacious. The fridge always stocked with soda, water and beer. The shower had beautiful terracotta tiles. We always had lots of towels. The porch (we were on first floor) was private and surrounded by hedges and a large flower box. The room safe was really convenient and easy to use. Besides the weird wiring issue it was a great room. Nobody else in my group had a issue with the wiring. Food: Buffet: We are vegetarian and my partner as many food allergies and we ate so well! We admit that if you eat meat (especially pork) and seafood that you have many more options. While I did not eat something different everyday, I stuck to my favorites. These included salads topped with fresh tortilla chips, guacamole and salsa fresca, re fried beans, fresh fruit and smoothies, pasta in tomato sauce, soya burgers (taste like potato), beans and rice, and veggie sandwiches. My partner never had a reaction at the buffet! A La Carte Restaurants: Just forget it unless you are going Japanese and even that was too salty for my taste, although my partner enjoyed it as well as most of the others we were with. It was nice that they cooked it in front of you. At the Mexican my partner reacted to plain raw vegetables they gave him instead of the salad we got with this weird rose sauce they keep using. Not very Mexican tasting. The choice was fish or beef and I chose fish interested in trying the whipped sweet potato side. It was like warm, orange, vanilla pudding. My brother had the beef and couldn't eat it. He said it was too fatty. The Italian restaurant didn't offer much to the vegetarian either. My partner had the penne arribiatta which he said was good but a little too hot. (And he likes spicy.) I had the pizza margarita thinking it would be something nice. It was the same thing they had at lunchtime at the beach restaurant. Not enough sauce and too salty. Grounds: Amazing. We saw so many animals: agouti, peacocks, flamingos, ducks, anteaters, howler monkeys, toucans, tortoise, swans, iguanas, a crowned crane, bats, and made friends with an orange cat we named Toulouse. The hotel is can be very confusing and it is easy to get lost at first.. The two hotels (Tucan and Quetzal) are like mirror images . On either side of the stage area are two walkways, one granite and one wood planks. They lead to separate lobbys. Bars: We went to Mascara almost every night after the show and while not club people, we enjoy going out and dancing on holiday. We have been to other resorts where the club isn't happening but this one was fun! All the bars give generous drinks and are always willing to listen to your suggestions (ie mas tequila por favor). Their margaritas aren't terribly sweet and I quite enjoyed that. The lobby bar often had a classical guitar player which my partner, a musician, quite enjoyed. Pools: The main pool was quite warm with the sun beating down on it all day but there was relief in the \"grotto\" swim up bar. However the people who were in here were typically obnoxiously wasted. Beach: The beach has beautiful white sands and clear bright, blue water. Just like the pool you will have to get out early and save a beach chair if you want a spot even though it is not allowed. The rule is not enforced so if you want one you have to break the rules too! On a breezy day the waves are fun to lay and sway in. Shows: The star friends are really fun in general. They are very engaging and are really trying to make sure you have a good time. From games in the pool, to their late show and even coming to the club afterwards and dancing, they were always engaging. The shows had many very talented dancers but timing always seemed to be off. The last show we saw was a traditional Mexican troupe from off the resort that did Mayan, Spanish and Mexican traditional dancing. This was worlds better than the star friends. Excursions: We did the Tulum Mayan Ruins which are the smaller of the three. We are so glad we did this, as we were so hot and doubt we would have made it through a larger location. The guide we had was great and we got to learn a lot about the ancient Mayans through a guided portion and then were allotted some time to freely roam around the ruins. You cannot visit the Mayan Riviera without a visit to the ruins. It would be like going to Paris and bypassing the Eiffel Tower! We also did a snorkel trip from the hotel to a close reef. The whole thing took two hours and was absolutely breathtaking. The guide pointed out neat vegetation and animals and even looked under rocks for us to find a starfish we could touch. We also saw a huge Queen Fish, and swam with a sea turtle! Be very careful though, I was wearing SPF50 and was lobster coloured on the entire back of me! Playa Del Carmen: In town you can see a lot of military and police with big guns, and people offer to sell you drugs but it's not really too scary. The touristy stuff is all on 5th avenue, but is mostly overpriced and you cant haggle, so if you want a deal you have to wander around some of the smaller streets in the area. The food in town seems to be better than at the resort. We went to a small restaurant \"La Misson\" and had a beer and tortilla chips with guacamole and salsa which made the resort's versions look bad. Overall, we had a blast.

We are a family of four with kids under ten. We started on the Quetzal side but upgraded to the Tucan oceanfront building (#10) after the first night because our kid twisted his ankle by the entertainment area. The hotel did not offer any compensation, and we did not really insist on it. We had to call for their golf cart two - three times a day for the next four days to get to the main buffet area. I can imagine they were sick of us, but whatever. Both Quetzal and Tucan are open for your use and exploration, although they have different wristbands. Both sides serve breakfast and dinner at their main buffets, but only Quetzal serves lunch. There are also two poolside buffets (one on each side) open for breakfast -they have different hours- and lunch. The first night (Quetzal side) was in the building 25 facing the backroad. The room was OK size, and the oceanfront one was exactly the same size, but had an extra couch in it(consequently, minus one chair). We did not hear any noise at night, and were able to see several monkeys on the trees by the bulding 26 next morning. After transferring (extra $65 per night), I really enjoyed having both the ocean and the poolside restaurant \"next door\" to the building. At 3 p.m., when their \"snack time\" starts, they bring new cakes, and some of them are really not bad (those you get only at this restaurant, not even in the main buffet.) The grill is open next to the restaurant daily from 11 or so to probably 5, so 3-4 rooms on each floor at that end of the building are engulfed in smoke, less so with other rooms, although there is smoke more or less all over this building (not a problem if you are not in the room during the day). The jungle is beautiful, you will see tons of animals and birds, just watch your feet: it is easy to stumble while you examine tree-tops for monkeys. If you are at the oceanfront buildings, there is no wildlife there at all, so you have explore the jungle to see it. There is a backroad on each side (both Quetzal and Tucan) more appropriate for walking, but there is less wildlife there. Quetzal side is kind of more \"natural,\" with more animals generally walking around, and a flamingo pond and swan pond with a waterfall. The Tucan side, as my kid pointed out, is kind of fancier, with some nice decorations at and by the lobby and the marble walkways with the fountains and fish leading to the restaurants. The entire hotel is open air, which was a problem for us. I guess it should be nicer in the fall and winter. The only air-conditioned places are your room, three restaurants by the lobbies and the Tucan lobby bathroom (out of all places, ha-ha). The beach is one of the best I have seen in this area (this is my third time in Riviera Maya, plus four times in Cancun). The other comments about it, and getting chairs and stuff, are very accurate. The food was not bad, and we did not go hungry, although my husband got sick after the first or second day, but we agreed that Riu's food was generally better. We visited all three so-called air-conditioned restaurants (all are pretty warm), and decided that Italian was the best one. We did not like Mexican at all, and found Japanese just entertaining since they offer a teppanyaki-style show for you. Out of 18 people at our table, hardly anyone finished their plate, and sushi were just bad (we are from New York though, so we are spoiled). We did not see any evening shows, because they start at 9:30 Mexican time, and we have a 4 y.o. We are not into drinks at all, but a couple of them I tried were pretty terrible. We walked to Playacar shopping area once (10 min walk) , it became kind of expensive compared to two years ago, and went to Playa del Carmen (7 bucks, used to be 5). This one was good as always. We originally wanted to take some excursions, but due to my child's ankle and heat decided not to. We do not like transfers/shuttles, so we took a taxi from ($90) and to the airport (I believe $60). The airport transportation is always more expensive because they have some kind of monopoly running there (check the internet if you are interested). Overall, it was not bad, the kids had a great time and loved the animals, and if it was not so hot all the time (one air-conditioned buffet, please), I would have liked it so much more.", "Date": "August 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Grafton, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cWe had a great time at the Iberostar Tucan, a very nce resort in Playacar.\u201d", "Author": "RedSoxNation1", "ReviewID": "UR117375496", "Content": "Our family of four recently stayed for six days/five nights at the Iberostar Tucan in Playacar. The Iberostar Tucan is a wonderful resort, with 350 rooms on the south side of the Iberostar property. There was a another 350 room hotel on the north side, the Quitzel, connected by common areas in the front and beachside, with a rain forest in between. Definitely a great place if you are an animal lover; we were visited on our balcony by a family of Howler Monkeys and a couple of Spider Monkeys during our stay. There were also the Iguanas, Guinea Hens, the adorable Agouti and other animals on the grounds. We had a wonderful time at the Tucan, and would recommend a visit. My wife did an excellent job in our travel planning. We went through JetBlue Getaways. The hotel was family oriented, and the guests were a mix of Americans, Europeans and Mexicans. The hotel has an extensive kids program that appears to last until the early evening. The hotel is a short cab ride to Playa del Carmen (or a 15-20 minute walk \u2013 doable in the winter but not the Mexican summer), and is about 45 minutes from the Cancun Airport and an equal distance to Tulum. Xhi-Ha is about a half hour away. Both Zama (Tulum) and Xhi-Ha and both are worth a visit; Zama for the amazing Mayan history and unbelievable Pre-Columbian engineering (the Sun Temple is concave and lines up with the magnetic North Pole). Xhi-Ha is a natural water park fed underground rivers with lots of snorkeling, river tubing and other water activities. Playa del Carmen is a nice little town, totally different than Cancun, and Avenida Cinco is a lot of fun to stroll around to shop. On the resort, there are activities all day long and entertainment at night. The Positives: Food: The food was very good for an all inclusive. I am a picky eater, and was able to find something every evening at the buffet, and in the dining rooms. Breakfast was outstanding, enjoy it by the beach! Service: The service was outstanding, everybody was very attentive, had a good command of English, and was always willing to teach a little Spanish. Regardless of the location, service was universally very good. The Rooms: Were very comfortable, our King room had a built in coach and table and chair, nice as it seems that so many hotels have a bed and that is about it. The balcony opened out to the rainforest canopy, and was very private. The bed was very firm and comfortable. The housekeeping staff was terrific, every time we came back after they had made up the room there was a swan, doll or heart made out of towels and flowers. Entertainment: There was a show every evening; I attended the Magic, Las Vegas and Boogie Nights shows. As entertaining as they were, the band and singers beforehand were excellent, as were the contest they performers ran prior to the beginning of the show. I actually liked the contest part the best. The Star Team, as they are called, work very hard as they also run most of the activities during the day. Drinks: There are soft drinks and fruit juices available at the pool/beach on a self serve basis which is nice. Cocktails are poured rather light, which was nice as there were not a lot of drunks annoying everyone, with a few exceptions. Beach and Pool: Outstanding facilities, second to none. The Less Positive (not really negative, but things to know) Internet: There is no Wi-Fi in the rooms, and you have to pay to use the internet in the business center and the lobby (using your own computer). Business Center is a reasonable 20 pesos per 15 minutes, but it is free at the Palace Resorts. Televisions: The TV\u2019s are tube TVs, not flat screens. Not a big deal, why are you watching TV in paradise? Couch potatoes are warned! Reserved Dining: We were only allowed to dine in the reserved dining rooms twice during our five night stay. The main buffet was good, but the dining rooms were very nice. We ate at the Mexican and the Steakhouse, both of which were very good, the best dinners of our trip, it would have been nice to try the others as they never seemed to be terribly busy when we ate there, or just walked by and looked in. Air Conditioning: Only the hotel rooms and specialty restaurants are air conditioned, the lobby, theatre, buffet and beach side restaurants are open aired. Took a little getting used to at first, as it was August, but I bet it is very pleasant in the winter. Noise: As the nightly entertainment is held in an open air theatre, most rooms, especially closer to the lobby will hear the music until 11:30 or so. We very much enjoy Mexico and look forward to returning. We found Playa del Carmen more to our liking than Cancun. Not as built up, no high rises and more laid back. Also, I was never concerned about our safety, or at least anymore than when you are traveling in a foreign country. There was private security entering Playacar and at the Hotel, plus there was a healthy number of Federal Police in Playa del Carmen and on Route 307. Our Family recommends the Iberostar Tucan. It is a great resort, and we look forward to our next visit!", "Date": "August 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Mids", "Title": "\u201cA great holiday for all of the family!\u201d", "Author": "williae", "ReviewID": "UR117278629", "Content": "The consensus from the family (Mum 40ish, Dad 50ish and Kids 20 & 15) was that it was the best family holiday we have had. First time to Mexico and won't be the last. Hotel was chosen on the basis of the (mostly very favourable reviews) on tripadvisor and were delighted with our decision. Stayed for 11 nights and have just (unfortunately) returned. Hotel facilities from the rooms to restaurants and public areas were kept spotless. The maid service in the room was also excellent. As previous posts have indicated, if you find the bed a bit hard ask for a mattress topper which will be fitted within minutes. Rooms were very quiet (block 18) and apart from some wildlife noises (birds and monkeys in the daytime) there were no other disturbances. The food in the main buffet restaurants was very good both in terms of quality and choice. Of the specialty restaurants, the Italian (especially the veal) , Japanese (cooked right in front of you) and Steakhouse restaurants were excellent. The food in the Tropical and Mexican restaurants wasn't bad, just that it wasn't really any better than the food in the buffet restaurants. Water and ice is all purified and none of us had any problems with stomach upsets at all - neither had any of the other guests we talked to. Breakfast was also served from 07.00 in the restaurants down by the beach as well as in the main buffet restaurants. The highlight really was the quality of the service in the bars, resaturants and the really hardworking drinks girls who worked the beach all day. Really was service with a smile everywhere, especially if you make a bit of an effort and speak a little Spanish to them. The entertainment teams worked very hard all day to keep people entertained and amused. The evening shows with live music and singing were excellent (especially Boogie Nights!). Plenty of sunbeds on the beach - whilst the sunbeds with the fixed straw parasols tended to go by 09.00 there were plenty of other sunbeds available and there seemed to be an unlimited supply of parasols from the towel cabin which also provided beach towels. Sea was wonderful, warm and very clear. The walk down to the beach was always interesting with always some of the local wildlife to be seen. Wifi is available at a charge - 96 pesos for an hour but you can buy only 15 mins if you want. For those of you with a Kindle, you can get a 3G or EDGE signal down on the beach although the strength was variable but 3G was nearly always available in the Lobby. The only thing the hotel really missed was a bar down by the beach that was open in the evening. Overall a wonderful time and would have no hesitation to recommending to anyone wanting a relaxing week or 2 in the sun with good food, facilities and service.

We \"discovered\" it while out in the sea kayaks the resort provides, another great passtime and I'd suggest doing this in the morning as the water is not too full of activity yet and the surf is more calm. You can get snorkel equipment from the resort for an hour I think but we took our own equip out and spent hours out there with the fish. They literally swarmed to us it was thrilling! Don't miss the evening entertainment or at least try it one night. We were reluctant at first but ended up there every night! Wish I could borrow some of the Star friends energy!

However, things changed and I wish I could say they improved, but unfortunately that was not the case. I will start with the positives. The resort is still maintained beautifully. The beach was fantastic and the staff always has a friendly smile and work extremely hard. The rooms were cleaned thoroughly and we were centrally located in building 14 between the beach and the restaurants. Now for the negative. The food is mediocre at best. We have stayed at many all-inclusive resorts over the last 15 years, many of them Iberostar, however, this is not how I remembered it. The buffet was good for breakfast, very good actually, but for dinner...well let's just say there were some nights I barely ate at all. I do not expect five star meals, it is an all-inclusive and that almost never happens, but for me to complain, it had to be bad. We did reserve several specialty restaurants, although getting a reservation for something other than 6:30 was difficult. We ate at La Hacienda (the best one by far), the Steakhouse (I would have preferred a hamburger), the Gondola (the appetizers were good, the food so/so) and we did try for the Japanese, but were turned away because we were five minutes late. The matre d at the Japanese restaurant was the only staff member who was not only unfriendly, but downright rude. The shows were okay. Perhaps because we've traveled to numerous Iberostars in the past, the shows are always the same and I found I just couldn't sit through them anymore. I much preferred to sit on the beach at night. My son did have trouble one night in the club. Apparently there were several people in the bathroom while he was in the stall and a flower pot broke. A security guard came and blamed my son while he was washing his hands. He tried to explain that he didn't do it, but they had to make someone pay. So upon checkout we were charged $50 for a broken flowerpot, although they couldn't prove it was him. To get a chair in the morning under a palapa, plan on getting up EARLY. The monkeys on the roof were my alarm clock, they woke me up every morning at 6:30 a.m. and I was on the beach reserving chairs (you had to, everyone else was) by 6:45 a.m. There were some mornings that I got the last one...I'm not kidding. If you go off season, I'm sure this isn't a problem, but be prepared. The positive side to that is the beach is spectacular in the morning. Quiet music playing, coffee and light breakfast served, and I was ultimately glad to have that time every morning. I always loved to paint some of their ceramics, I find it very relaxing, but I must say the prices have really gone up. If you are traveling with little ones and they want to paint, be prepared to spend $25 minimally for a small ceramic piece. We did take one excursion to go diving and snorkeling off of Cozumel, which was a nice trip. Can't say I liked our guide too much, for a reason unknown to us, he just wasn't very friendly to my family, so no tip for that cabellero!! The rest of the crew on the boat however were great. I apologize if I sound like Debbie downer, that is not my nature, its just that I hate to see a resort I had enjoyed so much not live up to its prior standards.", "Date": "August 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Illinois", "Title": "\u201cCan't wait to return\u201d", "Author": "beachbumIllinois", "ReviewID": "UR116962815", "Content": "We were there about 4 years ago,when the beach was lost because of Hurricane.We are beach people and it put a damper on our mood every day when they jamb everybody on the beach 6 inches apart from your neighbor.Since then they have fixed the beaches and they look gorgeous again.Everything else was 4 stars,The food was always fresh and plentiful.The room was plenty big for two people.The entertainment staff kept you laughing through the day and night.I think we will go back next summer.Happy Vacations", "Date": "August 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sacramento, California", "Title": "\u201cBetter for Families than Couples\u201d", "Author": "lovetotravel1510", "ReviewID": "UR116961334", "Content": "I have been going back on forth about giving 3 or 4 stars for my review. The service and the hotel itself were wonderful but the environment was not quite what I was hoping for on this trip. My boyfriend and I just returned from the Tucan a few days ago. While we really enjoyed our trip, I think this hotel is geared more towards families rather than couples. The pool and the beach areas are well maintained, spacious, and beautiful but are frequently very loud with all of the children running around and playing. The star friends are also constantly arranging games and activities which can be heard from all around the pool and beach area. As many have said, the pool is very warm and oddly deep. We brought rafts and were very happy we did. The beach is gorgeous though very crowded but that is to be expected. The service was wonderful. Everyone was so helpful and nice. The food was fine. It is an all inclusive so as many others have said, you know you aren't getting gourmet food. The restaurants were pretty good, with the Japanese and the Italian being our favorites. We also tried the steakhouse which was good. The buffets had a nice selection of items but even though we were only there four nights, it did get tiring eating similiar things everyday. The meals near the pool were not great so we got dressed and had lunch in the dining room on the Quetzal side most days. The location was a little farther away from the center of Playa than I thought it would be. I had heard it was a fairly easy walk but with the beach being as uneven as it was, the walk was somewhat uncomfortable because we were always at a slant. The walk to town wasn't bad but it was very hot and humid because there was no brreze. I really enjoy walking and would have prefered to be a little bit closer to town for dinner and exploring. I don't want to repeat what everyone else has said but I do wish someone had told me that for a couple in their late 20's (or any age for that matter), this might not be the best option. It felt so crowded and loud, it was hard sometimes to relax. We still had a fantastic trip because the hotel itself really is beautful and the grounds were so much fun to explore but for couples looking for a romantic or at least quieter vacation, I think this hotel might not be the best option. For families, it seems like everyone was having a blast and there is something for everyone. Also, I highly recommend emailing ahead of time and getting dinner reservations.

We stayed 5 nights, Wed-Mon. The place is outstanding!! We stayed on the top floor of building 14, which was right in the middle of the jungle!! We saw the monkeys almost daily and were even pleasantly suprised by one on our patio the last morning! Leading up to this trip I read tons of travelers reviews on where to stay and after deciding upon the Tucan, I read tons of reviews on this site so I want to provide something future travelers can use. We travel often and consider ourselves to be in the know on what to look for so here goes!! My 2 biggest recommendations are to bring 1 of those big Bubba cups, ours were the 52oz ones!! Unless you like drinking beer/cocktails out of small plastic cups this is a requirement!! The staff has NO problem filling them and it saves many trips. We always kept one full of a cocktail/beer, and one full of ice water. EVERYONE we ran into was envious of our cups! Also bring your own cheap little float!! The pool is quite deep in most areas, 5 ft and up, and it's nice to have one. They sell them there, but there are very expensive! Plus if you only pay a couple bucks for one at home, it's a lot easier to pass it along to another traveler on your last day! ROOMS: Our room was PERFECT for 2. It was a king bed, which I emailed and requested upon arrival, with a large area with 2 couches that could've been used as beds if needed. The bathroom was spacious, just be careful, the tile floors throughout the room can get pretty slick when wet! Ladies bring Conditioner, for some reason it's not offered and my wife had to buy some after several days in the pool/beach! Beds are quite firm, but we got and egg crate to put on it and it was perfect! They stay nice and cool also!! POOL: As mentioned above it's fairly deep, and shorter people, ladies especially, will have a hard time with this. Also as many reviews have stated the pool is VERY warm. To the point that in the mid afternoon it's uncomfortable. After getting a bit of a sunburn the first day, we came back down to the pool the second day to find that when getting in the pool the water was so warm it stung our burned skin. We got into a routine of going to the pool in the morning until about 2, then going to the beach, which was much more comfortable water. I personally don't like sweating while in a pool, and think they should leave the pool cooler on longer(they had it on one evening while we were swimming and there was a noticeable difference in the pool temp.). And if you want any chance at all of getting a chair you better get there EARLY, everyone comes down and \"claims\" the chairs first thing. Everyday we were there nothing was available, which wasn't a big deal cuz we wanted to be in the water, not outside. But also everyday we noticed that many of the chairs we were swimming by were \"claimed\", but nobody every came to actually use them, which is pretty frustrating. Beach chairs fill up quick to! As far as poolside service it was pretty much non existant to us, probably because do to the lack of chairs we had to set all our stuff at the edge of the pool out of the way. Wasn't too big of a deal cuz we had our big cups! BEACH: Beach was beautiful!! They do a great job of keeping it well maintained! The water was great! It's a bit steep entering/exiting the water, but worth it! This is where the big cups really came in handy because we didn't have to do a lot of back and forth for beverages! FOOD: Food was average. I could usually find something to fill me up, but my wife is a bit more picky and was left unsatisfied most of the time. Hamburgers and hot dogs outside were great, for the first couple days!! Then it gets a little redundant. Plus when I go to Mexico I would prefer a bit more authentic food, I can have hamburgers and hot dogs at home! We understand that they are catering to thousands of people here, and being that we are not big on buffets we weren't expecting much anyway. It was worth it for what we saved not having to buy breakfast and lunch, but we went to town for dinner all but one night. They have some great food in Playa Del Carmen, you would be doing yourself a great injustice to come there and only eat the buffet food at the resort. All in all the place is fantastic! My wife and I agreed if we were bringing the kids this would be a perfect place! There are tons of families who enjoy this place! We also agreed if we come back on another couples trip, this is probably not where we will be staying. We prefer a more personal, authentic experience, and due to the size of this place and number of people it's hard to get that here. We agreed that while the all inclusive is good, you lose a lot of customer service with it. The monkey's that showed up on our back porch made the trip even more memorable!! If you are coming for a family trip, I would give this place 5 stars! If you want a couples getaway, go somewhere else, in my opinion somewhere that's not all inclusive.

To sum it up in a few words, the resort and the staff were AMAZING. We stayed in a standard room in Building 15 on the Tucan side, which was located right in the middle of the resort (Building 10 is closest to the beach, with Building 19 closest to the lobby). The standard room was just fine. It had a very nice size bathroom with walk-in shower, queen bed, a futon, small refrigerator that is filled daily with water, soda, and beer, and a nice deck area. We upgraded to a Presidential Suite on our last night, and it was unreal. A few highlights from that were: * Huge living room area w/ flat screen. Half bath off of the living room area * Kitchenette area * Master - Large king bed with full bath including jacuzzi tub * 2nd bedroom with 2 queens * plenty of closet space * 2 decks overlooking the beach/ocean - 1 off the living room area, and 1 off of the Master area. The main deck was huge. It had two large sleeper couches and a hot tub/jacuzzi. Service was top notch - Sammy at the swim-up bar was great. We also made very good friends with Santos at the main lobby bar - he was awesome. Food - We ate at the Japanese (favorite), Mexican and Steakhouse, and they were all great. There was an Italian and Tropical (seafood) option, but we didn't get an opportunity to try them. You do have to make reservations, so I would recommend doing that after checking in, or try doing it prior to your visit (not sure if you can do this). Even the standard buffets at lunch and dinner were all very good. Beach/Ocean/Pool - The beach & ocean was simply beautiful. You have to get to the beach and pool early to reserve the tiki cabanas; however, there are plenty of beach umbrellas available at the towel center if you don't get one. I also brought a cheap blow up raft to float around on, so I would highly recommend that for lounging in the water. The main pool area was beautiful, and that seemed to be where most of the families and kids hung out at; however, the water was very warm and not very refreshing - that's to be expected when it's as warm as it is day in/day out. The swim up bar is seperate from the main pool area, and has almost like a grotto type feel to it. Resort - the resort is laid out very nicely and is very easy to navigate. The grounds are simply beautiful. From the open air, tiki like lobby to the jungle pathways leading to the beautiful beach/ocean. The wildlife throughout the resort is very cool. Do go over to the Quetzal side of the resort. By the main buffett area is a beautiful rock waterfall area. This side is also open late night if you have late night munchies. Other things we did that I would recommend: * DO go into Playa del Carmen and do a little shopping and experience some culture. It's a $7 cab ride (from 1-4 people), and the cabs are readily available. 5th Avenue is lined with a lot of neat shops, restaurants and nightlife spots. We did this a couple of evenings, and had a great time. We ate dinner and had drinks at a place called Fusion, which is located on the beach. Great food, drinks and they had a reggae band playing. We never felt unsafe at all while in town. * If you go on an excursion, I would highly recommend Tulum Extreme. It's a combination of snorkling in a cenote (underground cave), rapelling, ziplining and a guided tour at Tulum. The company who puts this on is top notch, and it was an oustanding day trip. Overall, our experience on this trip was outstanding. The five days we were there went very fast, but we had an unbelievable time that we will never forget.

The other restaurant next to the stage on the quetzal side was much better, so save yourself and go there, everyday for lunch. If you can settle for a so so burger or nachos or a wierd hot dod you can also hit up the snack bar. Dinner on the other hand was great. The steakhouse was great. The japanese restaurant was fun, food was good. Its Benihana style where you all sit around the table and the chef cooks the food in front of you. And the buffets were very good for resort food. All in all the food was very good. The pool is tremendous! I mean huge! Get up really early to get one of the four cabanas. Really early. Otherwise you can delay it, but not for long, and get yourslf a chair with a small palapas. You still have to get there early enough or you'll be out ! But you can always find a chair on the beach, which is great all on its own. The water is ausome. It could get a little rough but you shouldn't have a problem even if you are a poor swimmer. Beware of the fake cigars on the beach, they're not real Cohibas. The service was very good, considering that the hotel was pretty much full. We caught the tail end of one show and it seemed good...the cast are the members of the pool team during the day. We went into town one night and it was a great time! Very safe. The town is your lacol tourist trap but its a lot of fun. Buy some silver jewerly and when they ask for something rediculously high, throw a rediculously low number back at them. If they ask for 300 you say no 10 and get it for 25 or 30. It's a funny transaction. But dont waste their time, if you really want it then buy it. The beds are on the hard side but its fine. Ask the maid for a mattress pad. It makes it a little softer. The premium brand liquor is pnly in the tucan lounge near the front desk. Grab a drink there every time your near for the good stuff.

We were in Cancun a few years ago and it was just average. Then went to the Iberostar Tucan in July 2009 and LOVED it. Tried a different place, Barcelo, last year adn thought it was just okay. Just a couple minor negatives....then all the positives. Every bed we have slept in at a Mexican resort has been a little on the hard side....this location was no different...but, again, I find this to be the same at all three of the resorts we have tried...and I had no trouble sleeping. We asked before we left for a second or third floor rooms because the ground floor rooms in some resorts have bugs. We got put on the ground floor anyway....but, they gaurenteed we would not have a bug problem and they were right. They also \"upgraded\" us for free to the Quetzal side of the resort. I didn't really see a difference between the two sides. Also, some of the deck chairs don't hold up very well to the weight of larger people when you try to lean back...depends on the type of chair your sitting in...(by the way...I'm 6' 210....so not THTA big). That's it....that's all the less than perfect stuff. Food: Very good. They buffet's are buffet's...but, pretty well done. Breakfast always includes eggs/omelets made to order. We always ate lunch at the beach buffet which has hamburgers and hot dogs out on the grill as well as a good variety of other lunch items. Dinner always has a carving station where the staff is doling out fresh items....roast beef, leg of lamb, fish, etc...a pasta station and a mexican food station are also alwyas manned making your selections fresh. The ala cartes are great....particularly the Japenese...we also ate at the mexican and steak house and loved them. Drinks...lots of alcohol....they tend to make em a little weak...but, all you had to do was ask for an extra shot and the would help you out. SAMMY...the adults-only swim up bar mixologist was awesome!!!...Very friendly... Very fast... and got to know us quickley...remembering what we liked to drink. Thanks Sammy. Shows...the night shows were great. Alot of audience participation stuff as well. We laughed alot. Entertainment: Started at 9 in the morning and ran all day and early evening. Volleyball, archery, water basketball, aerobics, spanish lessons, etc... THE STAR FRIENDS: What makes the Shows and Entertainment so much fun is the Star Friends....the entertainment staff. They are great at getting to everyone and trying their best to make sure you are enjoying your stay. Maouricio and Michelle were still there from our previous trip two years ago...and they both still had smiles on thier faces and seem to really enjoy making sure we had an enjoyable time. We met some new faces that were equally as awesome (Okay...we have a special place in our hearts for Mauricio...but the rest were nearly as good...lol) Thaks for a geat time Paulina, Joshua, Roberto and the rest. Customer Service. Which leads me to mention the best thing about this resort and that is the customer service and the friendliness of EVERYONE there. While the Star Friends were awesome...so were the front desk staff....and the information staff...heck...even the guys doing maintenance in the forest always had a smile and an \"Hola\" for any passer-by.

The beach was perfect as the water was so blue. There were fish in the water so we took bread from the buffet out into the sea and fed them. There were many restaurants available: the buffet, an Italian, a Mexican etc. The only problem with the specialist restaurants was that you had to book in and during busy times at the hotel, it was hard to get a table. Also, we had to wait a long time for our food at the Mexican due to the number of people. The only major problem with this area was the heat. We went during the hottest part of the year for Mexico and we were unable to do a lot during midday because it was too hot, I would advise that you take a lot of sun cream and after sun because it's indredibly easy to get burnt, especially if you are in the pool. During our stay, we took a taxi to the small town, Playa Del Carmen, nearby. There were a lot of nice bars and restaurants in this town and the staff were very friendly.

I would not recommend this hotel. I have been to mexico several times in the last 3 years. I have stayed at Dreams in Tulum and Iberostar in Cozumel with my teenage children. We loved the other 2 hotels a lot. This one was only OK, not terrible, but nothing special. I will start with the positive. The beach was beautiful. The pool area was designed to give all guests some privacy and plenty of shade if you want it. The resort, was easy to walk around and find everything. The rooms were fine. The jungle in the middle of the resort was very cool and seeing the wild life was exciting. The food in the japanese and italian restaurants was very very good. The rest of the time we just ate at the buffet. My family did diving with dresslers which was located on the property, and they were all very friendly, and we enjoyed the dives. The shows at night were excellent. The star friends are very talented and friendly. The hotel photographers were very nice and friendly and took great pictures of my family around the pool and we requested a photo shoot too (there is no charge for the photo shoot - only cost is the pictures you buy which is reasonable 6X8 was 188 pesos) What I did not like was the lack of service. I have always said I am easy to please, a beach a book and someone delivering drinks. Well I had 2 out of the 3. While I saw many staff keeping the property clean, there was very very limited bar service around the pool area. Only once in the week I was there did someone come and ask me if I needed a anything. And speaking of the drinks, they were horrible. The pina coladas, daiquiris and margaritas were not very good. There was a bar next to the pool and in the buffet area which is where you had to go to get drinks (yes very lazy of me not wanting to serve myself, but I am on vacation). Also the swim up bar is in a separate pool in the back, and I believe was adult only (this is a positive or negative depending on your opinion). The food in the buffet was mediocre, always something you can eat but very rarely did I say you must try this it is delicious. Again the service at the buffet was minimal, at other hotels the waiter will come and ask you if you need a drink and remove used dishes. At this hotel we would often go a whole meal with out anyone coming to check on us. The breakfast and lunch buffet had a self serve drink machine and you just helped yourself. The only time the waiters were attentive was when you went to one of the specialty restaurants and the drinks were way better at these restaurants too. Our room always had a little bit of sand in it, which is always a problem when at the beach, but I seemed to notice it more this trip then in other trips. You need a card to get a towel, and you will be charged if you loose your towel cards. Though this is not the only hotel that uses this system, I always find the towel card annoying. I was also disappointed in the activities. Our family likes to participate in pool games, volleyball, contests and so on. Though they had these things, they were often slightly disorganized, usually started late, and just too few activities. I found the front desk staff very unhelpful with an internet problem. I was trying to print my boarding passes, but the hotel computer wouldn't allow me on the jetblue website. The front desk offered no work around, and so I asked for a refund (since you have to pay to use the hotel computer's internet), and they said no because the Internet was working, it was just I couldn't get on the website I was trying to get on. They did eventually refund me the money (which was not a lot of money), it was the lack of help that I found dissatisfying. We did have a nice time there, because we were on a beach in a beautiful location. But I would not recommend this hotel because of its lack of service. Lack of waitress/waiter and star friend staff. It was almost as if they cut back not expecting as may guests. We usually bring a bunch of $1 to tip, but since we were barely waited on I came home with most of it. I spoke to a family who had gone to iberostar tucan last year and loved it, so returned this year. They said the service had significantly declined since their trip the previous year. If your looking for a nice all inclusive keep looking else where. If your already booked here, like I said we still had a fine time.

The room maintained that temperature the whole week. Well stocked refrigerator with water, beer, pop (soda- for all you non Chicagoans) both diet and regular. We left a note for the maid to restock with diet pop and to remove the regular. They did replace them with the diet until the 6th night then they put regular pop back in (must have been a different maid). The beach servers were awesome but we did tip her every time.

And there really isn't much to add from all the wonderful reviews!! This was our first time at Tucan and the second time at an Iberostar. We just absolutely loved everything about it -- especially the monkeys visiting us on the balcony. The rooms are quite adequate for two -- maybe I can sleep on almost anything, but I thought the beds were firm but very comfortable. The teens had their own room - and Iberostar does have some connecting rooms as we had one. We were in building 14 -- a very quick walk to the beach. Actually, I found this resort to be very easy to walk no matter where you needed to be -- you do not need a shuttle to get around, although you could easily get one if you so desired. The staff were great and very accommodating. Tipping the maid is certainly not necessary but very much appreciated!!! $1 or $2 a day goes a very long way with the staff. And the Star Friends (the entertainers for Iberostar) go above and beyond -- I ran into one of the Star Friends one day at 8:00 in the morning and he had just gone off duty at 1:00 a.m. the night before. At that hour, he was so upbeat and raring to go. They really have to love what they do. We didn't do any excursions this time around but still highly recommend Xel-Ha -- you can't beat what you get for the price. The kids, however, did take advantage of the chance to rent wave runners and thoroughly enjoyed themselves. Loved the convenience of Playa del Carmen -- a nice walk to the little shopping \"mall\" and a easy drive to downtown. The one thing that did suprise me about this resort is that it (as well as quite a few other resorts) is located within a beautiful gated residential community. Definitely felt safe the whole time we were there. Teens aren't usually mentioned that often in reviews but I just wanted to add how much they enjoyed their time there as well -- They can't wait to go back and they made quite a few international friends during their time there.

AMAZING There is nothing more you could ask for in a hotel. The Japanese restaurant was way beyond our expectations, the chefs are truly talented. We would pay a lot of money in England for food of such a high standard. The best thing about this hotel is the Entertainment.

The a la Carte restaurants are at such a high standard, Fillet Steak and the Lamb Chops are to die for in the Italian The hotel also offers a wide variety of Drinks, even branded imported Spirits such as Bacardi, Smirnoff, Pernod, Baileys etc. The cocktails were also of a high standard. Samuels Mojitos in the swim up bar are well worth a taste! I cannot say how brilliant this hotel truly is, the only fault I can possibly find is that the pool is extremely warm.. however you can cool of in the fresh water swim up pool bar as its a lot cooler.

I loved sitting out on the balcony every evening looking out and the Ocean and all the activity. We received a WELCOME BACK gift on the second day of our stay which was a great touch for personal service. We spent time at the Beach and at the pool. They were both excellent. The only thing I would say that was irritating was that both at the pool and beach because the resort was full, everyone started saving their chairs by 7am . It was kinda annoying but...We were on vacation, I got over it! One thing I did notice, we were there last year right after the beach restoration. It was beautiful. This year, still beautiful but I noticed there is a bit of a dip again to the water and it is going back towards the way it was before the restoration....It is defeintely not a big deal, as the beach is BEAUTIFUL but thought it was interesting. The food was great with plenty of choices at the main restaraunt. We made our dinner reservations by email in advance before we left and we ate at the steak restaraunt one night, which was great , the service was excellent! We also ate at the Mexican restaraunt which we liked the best. I think the atmosphere really made this restaraunt. I had a massage on the Beach which was wonderful...still a bit pricy but, I was on vacation. My daughter and I had facials as well. AWESOME! We loved our spa day. the spa people are warm and friendly. We also took advantage of a photo session at the resort...This was such a fun thing to do for both of us. This was new from last time when I was there and I thought it was kind of a cool service for the Hotel to partner with. And yes....We ended up spending more than we wanted to for photos but that was because we could not decide on just one photo. We spent one day away from the resort. We HIRED a driver (I had hired him last year as well) from Transportations Cancun. His name is SALVADOR and he is an awesome guide to wherever you want to go. His specialty is to the ruins. We hired him to take us to THE JUNGLE PLACE (a Monkey Sanctuary) which I had been to last year as well. It is an awesome place and one that my 14 year old daughter will never forget. I will write a trip review for them too under THE JUNGLE PLACE but if you want to do somehting a bit different when you are there, look Heidi and Joel up at this place. They are warm and friendly people who care about what they do. Salvador also took us to Akumal Bay. Here my daughter and I had lunch and because we brought our own snorkel gear, we snorkeled all over. We had the great opportunity to snorkel with a sea turtle that day! Could not have been a better day. On the way home Salvador stopped at a Cenote (I need ot get the name of it) and we went swimming in it. It was great as they had a cliff to jump from and little lounge chairs around too. It was a great day all in all and worth every penny for Salvador to drive and tour us around. I got to have a beer or two at lunch and not worry about driving. As for the Tucan...The service was warm and friendly just as before. I noticed the little merchantile right down the road has been built up quite a bit for more souvenier shopping which is nice as we walked to that a few nights. The wildlife at the resort was also a plus....It was fun to see the monkeys there too. Please dont forget to tip these people. Again I saw not a lot of tipping going on.

Go to the towel hut and get an umbrella rather than getting up at 7am to reserve one on the beach. The beach bar is right on the beach, not up a path from the beach, plus it has self serve sodas, water, and juices so you don't have to keep bothering the bartenders. Hard and soft serve ice cream are also right on the beach. Pool- Huge with activities going on in the shallow end. Swim up bar in a separate adults only pool. Restaurants- Two, right next to the beach and pool (they serve the same food). No dress code so you can just go from the beach or pool as long as you're not dripping wet. Two buffet restaurants identical to each other. Five specialty restaurants for dinner (3 air conditioned require long pants for men). Food is good but selection isn't as varied as in past and doesn't change daily. I feel the price hasn't increased so they had to cut back somewhere. I didn't go hungry.

Rooms- large with a couch large enough to sleep on. They have real bathrooms with a full door. Just stay at another hotel with those European style toilets (with a short stall door) and you'll appreciate this. Atmosphere- the jungle is awesome. You'll see various birds, lizards, monkeys, toucans, and agouti's. Going to breakfast or dinner was an adventure each time. Price- couldn't rent a place at the shore for what we paid. Airfare stunk but total price was still worth it. Other items- my daughter cut her foot and the staff couldn't have been more helpful. They even contacted us numerous times to make sure everything was okay. They have a travel office with excursions. Our Apple rep was only interested in selling us his prepackaged tours but Iberostar's travel staff got us just what we were looking for. Only thing we find lacking is the kids club is supposed to be for up to 12 years old but there really isn't anything for kids over 8.", "Date": "July 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFantastic\u201d", "Author": "PAPPION", "ReviewID": "UR115975546", "Content": "could not fault this Hotel location beach food service and the friendley staff.

We had a good time and felt like the hotel was a good bargain for what we paid. The animals and jungle grounds were beautiful and really added to the feeling of being somewhere exotic. The room was average but well cleaned. We asked for the foam mattress pad and slept more comfortably with it. We only had 2 chances to eat at the reservation restaurants. Our first choice was the \"tropical\" restaurant. We thought it was fine, but not great. Our second choice was the Japanese restaurant, and it was good. The buffet restaurant where all breakfast and lunches are served (there are two of these restaurants--one for Quetzal and one for Tucan, but they are back to back and serve identical menus) was pretty good. There were many, many choices for every meal. By the end of the trip, though, we were ready for something else and enjoyed eating at a few places on 5th Ave. in Playa del Carmen. Pez Vela has swings for seats at the bar and their nachos are excellent. We paid quite a bit and had a swanky dinner on a rooftop overlooking the ocean, but I can't remember the name of the restaurant, nor would I really recommend it. I think you are better off sticking to the casual dining places here. Also, there is a burger and fries stand down by the beach at the hotel, and we enjoyed burgers there one afternoon. Unfortunately, it closes before dinner or we would have eaten there more. And speaking of closing early, the adult's only swim-up bar pool closes at 5:00 each day. Just when folks are starting to get ready for happy hour, the waterfall shuts off and the bartender packs up. We were mystified by the logic there, and disappointed too! The evening entertainment was not really our taste. The kids who are \"Star Friends\" work very hard to put on their musical and magic shows in the evenings, and the shows have packed audiences, but we found our attention lagging quickly. They have some decent musical acts in the lobby bars in the evenings, and we did enjoy that once or twice. Other than that, there are no other choices for evening entertainment. We felt a little isolated in Playacar. The trip to Playa del Carmen is a $7 (plus tip) cab ride, which isn't bad. And I'm sure the bars there have more going on, but we never wanted to be in town too late. We did feel safe everywhere we went and are planning to go back. I think we will choose a resort in Cancun this time, though. Even though we liked this hotel, the long drive (45 min. to an hour from the airport and Cancun attractions-- dropping off and picking up other people adds to the time) really got to us. We did a snorkel excursion to Puerto Morales and really enjoyed it, but it took over an hour to get there. If we stayed closer to Cancun, our time traveling would be minimal. Also, I remember the beaches in Cancun as being calm. The surf was fairly active in Playa with a bit of beach erosion right at the edge. I wouldn't bring my young children to swim there--I think they would have a hard time with it. Also, the big swimming pool was 5.5 feet deep for a big portion of it, and that is over my head, so we didn't utilize the big pool very much at all. There is a beach entry, shallow part of the pool, though, and another shallow pool for children, and I saw many families having a lovely time there. We were pleased with the service at Iberostar and felt like they were truly concerned with meeting our needs. My husband's one BIG complaint: the wifi situation. There is NO wifi in the guest rooms. And the only way you can get wifi is in the hotel lobby, where you have to pay thru the nose for 15 min. increments of time on the internet. And as we understood it, you cannot buy more at one time. At the 15 min. mark, it just shuts off, and you have to go buy more minutes. Not great for the traveling business man, but for his wife, it was actually kind of nice (but don't tell him I said that :).", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saltash, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cA place to Chill out in style.\u201d", "Author": "wrighton53", "ReviewID": "UR115835836", "Content": "The Tucan hotel is about one hour from Cancun airport; it has its own beach front and is set in 28 acres of lush greenery. We had an all included deal, which had transport to and from the airport. Other deals don't and people were paying $90 from the airport and $50 back, it seems that is the set rate. The hotel has two large restaurants, which serve breakfast, lunch and evening meals. Also there is a beach restaurant open from midmorning till 18.00; there are also five bookable restaurants in the evening. Depending on which deal you have, you can book a meal in these restaurants between 18.00 and 21.00. We were in the Tucan for ten days and were allowed to make reservations for four nights, it is advisable to make your bookings when you arrive at the hotel otherwise you may find that the restaurant you have selected is fully booked. On the food front we all enjoyed every meal, and did not have one upset stomach during our stay. This is due to the hotel washing all the food in clean water rather than the tap water, which is undrinkable. There is room service and a mini bar which is also free in the included deal; the fridge is topped up every two days. The hotel has a full range of activities all though out the day, and there are lots of trips to go on such as a trip to the Maya pyramids. We only did a half day trip to the Tulum site which was great; there is a beach there so you can cool off after having the tour (Make sure you take your swim wear). There are longer trips which include a show and take up the whole day as it is three hours in the coach; we did not go for that as chilling out next to the pool was our main priority along with enjoying the food. There were lots of water sports from the beach, the free ones were sailing and canoeing. The rest you have to put your hand in your pocket and pay for such as Jet ski ($60 for 15 minutes), I stayed with sailing a Cat as every day the wind was just right and I had a great sail. The hotel room was clean, and each day the maid made a different animal out of the towels and displayed it on the bed. It became one of the events of the day to come back to the room and see what the maid had made, we had other friends staying at the hotel and they all had different animals each day so it became a talking point. In the grounds of the hotel are a number of birds, monkeys and iguanas, they have been around people all there life so do not even take much notice when you walk close by. The hotel had a full price list of taxi fares printed at the reception, so before entering the taxi you got the right price for the trip. We did trips to Cancun and Playa De Carman; we enjoyed 5th avenue in Playa De Carman the best with all the souvenir shops and restaurants which go on for about 2miles or so. At night there are a number of night clubs open until the early hours, a number of our friends were out until 5am.There are some big shopping centres nearby, but we had no need of them during our stay. So our overall opinion of the Tucan Hotel, was very good and we would go back the again without hesitation as we saw with a lot of guests who had returned year after year.", "Date": "July 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "st. louis missouri", "Title": "\u201cWonderful vacation...don't hesitate to stay here!\u201d", "Author": "Tq1008", "ReviewID": "UR115806896", "Content": "We just returned from a seven day stay at the Iberostar Tucan. It was our first trip to this resort. Check in was a breeze, no waiting friendly staff which greeted us with a glass of fresh juice. We arrived early in the morning before our room was ready, but we were able to leave our luggage with the staff in lobby; which they watched closely while we explored the resort and headed for the beach. The grounds are immaculate, I have NEVER been to a resort where the staff is endlessly working to keep the grounds clean and maintained to perfection. They are friendly and always greet you with a warm smile (Hola), making you feel very welcome. The entertainment staff \"Star Friends\" who are very talented... are remarkable, they arrive early in the morning and must stay until the wee hours; they do everything from water zumba (Yeah Ricard \"King of Zumba\") beach parties, magic shows for the kids, to various beach games through out the day.... and in the evening the same staff puts on a variety of shows (Vegas, Mexican Folklore, etc.) everyday!!! The activities are endless, free scuba lessons (Alex was great), complementary catamaran's and kyak's, beach vollyball, ping pong - along with optional jet ski, and parasailing (at a very reasonable price - however don't pay the first price they say ..... they will go down). Once we arrived to our room it was very clean. We were in building 12 which was very close to the buffet, beach and pool; a perfect location. One of the best parts was the abundant wildlife; Howler monkey's, Iquana's, Peacocks, Flamingo's, Sereque's, and Tucan - great for kids. The best time to see the monkey's is very early in the morning or early evening - if you hear a big growl like a big dog - they are close by just look up. The Ala Carte restaurants we tried were great, the Japanese and the Tropical were our favorite. Our steaks at the Tropical were cooked to perfection and the Japanese was a night of fun, laughs and good food; you must try the fried banana and ice cream dessert it was delightful. The buffets were all good too, however the food was very repetative - not bad for a few days, but got a little tired after seven. The ice cream stand between the beach and pool was a favorite with our family - chocolate chip was the BEST!!! Our waiters were all wonderful, very friendly and will wait on you like you are royalty - by the second day they knew us by name. ALL of the Iberostar staff seem to really enjoy their jobs. We spoke with many of them, Dominico (at the big buffet) has been working their for over ten years and he said he loves it more each day - and it shows in his service a very happy man! Be sure to request his section in the large buffet. The drinks were pretty good, daquiri and dirty monkey's were the best, however we did notice that the drinks at the lobby bar were far better than the drinks at other bars although Victor at the beach bar was GREAT!! I think this was mainly because of the house liquor brands and not the bartenders. The beach was beautiful, clean and just as pristine as could be. The pool was VERY warm, but then what do you expect in the middle of July, it too was spotless. If you want to go shopping I recommend 5th Avenue, we went there twice and it was great, lots of shops and restaurants; they are willing to bicker prices A LOT much more than we found when shopping at the Plaza down the street from the hotel (they seemed to be all fixed prices). One of the waiters (Roberto) from Iberostar (who was off) recognized us while we were shopping at 5th avenue, and came over just to say \"hi\" and to see if we were enjoying our trip to Mexico. We talked with him for probabaly a good 30 minutes - just shooting the breeze - Roberto did not have to even speak, but we're glad he did very nice man! A taxi from the hotel to 5th Avenue is only $7 + tip, but well worth the trip. We have stayed at many all-inclusive hotels abroad and I can honestly say that the Iberostar Tucan is at the top of our list - especially for the price. You will not find a friendlier staff nor a cleaner resort! Perfect for couples or families.

Very pushy waite staff (due to reservation timings). Food was normal for an all - inclusive at this price point. Evening Shows - best of all resorts we have been to in Mexico (remember people you are not in Vegas or NYC). The entertainment staff work long days and long hours. Pools - 1 large main pool. Bring a raft or flotation device. Most of it is not usable for any long period due to depth of water. There is a good area for small children. A smaller pool for water basketball. Adult pool with swim up bar is tiny. Drinks - top shelf in lobby bar. Beach bar is very busy but wait times were minimal. Soda fountain available with coke products and orange Fanta. If you do not like the water out of the fountain, ask the bar staff for water. It's bottled and tastes much better. Beach - Beautiful. Maintenance workers clean debris every day. They work hard to keep this area well maintained. Huts available as well as a beach umbrellas. You should not have any issues with shade. Beach towels provided with towel cards. If you lose your towel there is a $10/towel charge. I absolutely hate this method used by some resorts. We manned towels all day for 11 people to make sure we had no issue. Wildlife - as everyone else has said, it's quite interesting and fun for everyone. Nightlife - nightclub available on property for those interested. Obviously you are a cab ride away from the great night life in playa. Paid $7/cab. Resort really pushes a club in town. Vendors on beach every day, as well as, beach spa personnel. They will stop by all day long. If you say no, they keep on going with no issue. Spa on property near lobby. Resort jewelry store and convenience store on property in lobby. Photography as well. Ping pong tables available near pool (close at 7pm) and billiard tables available at the show area. No game room or teen center. If you have teens they will be quite bored in the evenings. Tennis and basketball courts are outside main lobby near the weight room. You will be able to get a decent work-out in, but gym is very hot. Soccer available on the basketball court as well. Bicycle tours of playa community for adults 2x daily. If you normally have problems with mosquito or bug bites, you will definitely need your bug spray here. Dress code - slacks are required for men or older teens in most restaurants. If you forget, they have slacks available free of charge. Very casual resort. Dress as you like.

We are yearly visitors to the Cozumel area and this is my 3rd visit to the Playa Del Carmen area. We love Cozumel but just did not find a good last minute deal so we started looking in the Playacar area especially since they re-did the beach area and I had heard it was pretty nice. We did love the beach at this resort but we still found ourselves craving for Cozumel waters which are a lot more clearer than the Playa del Carmen side of things... but more than that we are beach people and we got an excellent deal via apple vacations and decided to jump on it. Also when in Cozumel we prefer eating at our favorite loncheria's and taco joints so we are not real AI folks. The deal was so good it was only $100 more for this all inclusive compared to other non all inclusive hotels so we thought lets go for it..for an extra $100 it was an excellent deal and if we saw this come up again we might pounce on it. First off the grounds of the hotel are lovely- 4-5* and they kept our room nice... great ac, decent water pressure and hot water, fresh stocked fridge etc, our bed was hard too- we slept on it the first night and next day asked for an egg crate mattress pad and it was much better. great beach service on the beach but we still got our own no problem on that. The beach was nice and we preferred to get our own beach umbrella to be closer to the water- which to us felt nicer and with more breeze than the palapa area. The beach did get crowded with guests but I'm still mesmerized by that blue water so I was fine (again we are beach people and I was happy to be on vacation). We didn't go to any of the shows it was not really our thing. We enjoyed the people who worked at the resort very much...everyone was helpful and fun to be around (5* on the customer service) My only BUT in our vacation was the food... I know what to expect for AI's but I'm still not really sold on them because I don't think the food is that great and it does get old at 1.5 days. I think if you can sign up for as much of the specialty restaurants as possible that would be a good idea... I know they limit they amount but you can also sign up if any one cancels there reservations. Also know we don't eat fancy when we have gone to Coz but I love going to taco places where we get fresh yummy taco's for under a dollar each and they are great...so I don't eat really fancy anyways and I kept telling myself I'll just make tacos and I'll be fine... but I found the food lacking. We both enjoyed the breakfast buffet- I would say no problems with this- we loved the fresh fruit juices and fruits available everyday, we loved having omelettes made from scratch and surprisingly we liked the coffee too. Lunch was a different story -I really didn't like much of the lunch buffet but I do love guacamole and chips and sometimes would just go with that option. I also made fish tacos out of the white fish they had daily and just put this between one of the quesadillas added a bit of pico and it was okay- nothing I was craving for more but okay. One day on the beach for lunch they serve a paella and it was really good and flavorful but if you see it in the lunch buffet just know you may be eating left over paella. We had bites of pizza, ravioli and not so great. I do have a good tip- if you want to know what the hand made pasta will taste like in the ala carte italian restaurant taste it here it seemed to be the same and sorry but its gross- it tasted like the pasta was made from flour tortilla dough- something is off but they aren't so good..(also a not to skip the italian food place -or order something other than pasta there). My husband did fine at lunch because he was happy with a fresh grilled burger everyday and they were really pretty good. The dinner buffet the first night was fun because they really do have a huge selection of food and like many other reviews before me you should be able to find something you'll like- just don't expect much... I ended up making my own taco's again... We did eat a little late 8-8'30 just so it would cool down and did find some of the interesting dishes of the night to be lacking at that time ... one day it looked like they had baked a large grouper and would have loved a piece of this but it was really picked over at that time.... another day it looked like they had some type of roast but it looked overcooked and dry. I had some decent ceviche there with shrimp and white fish- not too bad but I wish it was a little cooler and had some chicken Mole and wished it was a little warmer- it made me a little nervous not to finish the whole chkn thigh but the sauce on it was really delicious. They have tons of deserts but I'm not really a desert person- the ice cream was okay a little too sweet for me... I did enjoy the lime and coconut candy/desert- just a few bites-its kind of interesting to me I don't know why- just something I don't see that much around our hispanic neighborhoods. We ate at the Japanese restaurant and it was ok to good- yes like beni hanna's but not quite as fresh in my book but if I went back would still book here. We enjoyed the show and had great service. The italian food restaurant was not that good I sent my pasta back - it was gross to me and the waiter recommended I try the lamb chops which were cooked perfectly. Not the greatest sauce of veggies that went with it but I love me some lamb chops... My husband got the pork medallians or something like that and they came out luke warm and it was just so so. The thing that was okay was the appetizer buffet... which had a few nice cheeses on it.. I had a nice slice of brie and a nice slice of goat cheese so I was happy with that - could of used more of a green salad too but it wasn't really set up like that... the other items on this were just mediocre. I would skip this restaurant if we went back.. We did enjoy being in AC for both of these restaurants and really did choose the italian over the steak place because of this. The pool was fun to jump into after the ocean but still pretty warm so we preferred cooling off in the ocean... The pool is very large and we didn't feel too crowded - there was always a place to hang out. Never made it to the pool bar - it does look kind of gross to me too. The beach is wavy but nothing you can really body surf but we still liked cooling off in the water... on busy days the jet ski's go crazy and we weren't crazy about this since we enjoy just hearing the ocean waves on the shore. One of the other reasons for coming over to the Playa side was my husband never saw Tulum so we rented a car from the hotel (which I normally don't do since its pricier than getting one in town but didn't want to mess with the logistics of doing that so it was worth the higher price IMO) good service and off we go to Tulum- We loved seeing it and then I wanted to explore some of the beach clubs of Tulum. I had heard south Tulum had better beaches and we went to check out the beach in front of the OM resort and it was just okay and we didn't even stay which I thought we may stay at 2 locations (it was pretty but so was the beach at the Tucan and at the Tucan we have beach service for free... next we went to North Tulum area and found a great beach at El Paraiso - its a beach club and its on a gorgeous stretch of beach- we went swimming (no rocks in July) and took some photos and had a beer for an hour. I had really thought maybe Tulum would be my next favorite spot but I think I'll stick to Cozumel beaches from here on out. Back to the hotel for more ocean time. We did like the beer on tap at the hotel - we think Dos Equis (xx) but we didn't really care for their mixed drinks from the beach bar- even when adding a double I think they may water down...They use syrups for their mixed drinks so it may have been just too sugary or not that fresh fruit that I like ..they did use fresh banana's in their banana daquari's or dirty monkeys which were okay for one. We like just having a beer and a shot of tequila or mezcal every once in a while. The mojito's and capriahana's where not bad either. The lobby bar was nice and we enjoyed the classical guitar player too and seemed to have better drinks up there as well. All in all it was a nice get away and if the deal came around again at The Tucan i wouldn't hesitate staying there again- but maybe budget for a few nights in PDC for dinner.", "Date": "July 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Derby, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAnother Great Holiday at the Tucan\u201d", "Author": "Mexicoloversjb", "ReviewID": "UR115652963", "Content": "We've had another great holiday at the Tucan.

The lobby is open air and very pretty. The front desk staff was friendly and efficient. We arrived around five o'clock, and they told us our room would be ready in about ten minutes. A little confused why it took so long to get the room ready but no big deal. We walked around the jungle area (which was my favorite part of this resort), had a drink at the lobby bar, and went up to our room afterward. The rooms are pretty basic, nothing fancy. Yes, the bed is hard. We like a firm bed, but this bed is hard. The refrigerator was restocked every second day they said. We only got two beers on the first day then never again. There is a \"daybed\" beside the door that is nice. The rooms have a shower only, no tub, and once I figured out I was turning the faucet the wrong way every freaking time I had no problem with hot water. Overall, it was a decent place to sleep and shower and that was really the only reason we were in the room anyway. The food was really quite good. The buffet did get a bit repetitive but everything was prepared well, and there wasn't one night that I didn't comment \"hey, this is good.\" Suckling pig, y'all. I don't eat pork, but I gave in to the husband and tried it and it was delicious. We had one reservation at the Mexican restaurant, and while the food was excellent I found the set up a little weird. Appetizers and desserts are on a buffet line. You are served your entree table side. I was kind of expecting a full service experience, but eh. We jumped in the pool once, and it was warm like bath water which in my opinion is excellent. Most days we went to the beach, which was busy, but the water is gorgeous. We were able to find a palapa for me to hide under (I'm ridiculously pale) with no issues. The service was always quick and friendly with one glaring discrepancy--the beach service. Example one: I go up to get a drink from the Coke machine (it's self-serve). Two employees are talking loudly and laughing in front of it. I asked them in English, excuse me. They don't move. I ask in Spanish. They don't move. So I just reach between the two of them. One rolls her eyes and moves. Example two: My husband saw these same people standing on the beach talking to each other, not serving guests or clearing away plates. They were supposed to be offering to bring things to guests, but people were just getting up to get their own when they were standing around talking. Example three: When a girl did come by to pick up cups and plates, she said to me, \"Give those to me\" in a rather rude tone. She was acting all exasperated and ignored a whole row of people, then got to another seemingly random couple and turned sweet as punch--\"Can I get you something from the bar?\" Maybe I would have liked something from the bar. Celia, I think her name was. Anyway that irritated me. Another thing that irritated me was having to pay for internet, but we just walked to the Starbucks in Playacar and used theirs. So in short--food was good, beach was excellent, staff was excellent (with the exception of the beach staff). Oh, and the location was awesome--a few minutes to Playacar Plaza, and a (rather long) walk into Playa del Carmen where you can get on an ADO and go anywhere. For the price I'd definitely return, particularly if I had kids.", "Date": "July 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cThe bees knees\u201d", "Author": "homersmee", "ReviewID": "UR115635852", "Content": "All of the positive reviews are correct and we did our research prior to booking at this resort. This resort had three major upsides that we enjoyed as well as many other great offerings. First off, the beach is amazing. We have stayed in the Rivera Maya 3 times previous to this trip and this was by far the best beach. There is only one resort to the south of the hotel and then the beach is practically empty for a good stretch. For the most part we just hung out at the hotel beach and were very pleased with the ocean and the amount of space. We never felt crowded on the beach or in the water. We never sat at the palapas and just grabbed an umbrella from the towel desk. When we did venture further down the beach, we were amazed at it's pristine beauty. The second major advantage was the location. You are in the gated community of Playacar. It is right off of the main highway and contains numerous homes and other resorts. It was a quick 5 minute taxi ride to Playa Del Carmen (about $7 US) and we always felt safe. We ventured into town both during the day and at night and never had any issues (even when catching a taxi back from Playa at 2am). The third positive that set this resort apart from others that we have stayed at was the overall natural environment and the animals that inhabited it. Truth be told, one of the major reasons we booked here (aside from all the positive reviews) was to see some monkeys. We were not disappointed. They typically arrived in the morning along the trees and buildings on the south side of the resort and then back again at the same location before sunset. They are high up, so if you are planning to take photos, a telephoto lens helps. If you just plan to watch them eat and leap from tree to tree you will not be disappointed. The grounds also contain agoutis (squirrel/gopher like rodents), peacocks, flamingos, iguanas, frogs, fish, toucans, tortoises and turtles, odd ducks, parrots and a few other creatures. The overall grounds were kept very clean and even though it is a large resort we found it convenient to get around. The staff was amazing and made you feel very welcome. We tipped frequently, but felt that it was never needed. We just did it because we liked the people that were helping us out. They made a point of engaging you in conversation and not just asking you what type of drink you wanted, and most of them always had a smile on their faces. The food was better than resorts we have stayed at in the past and they offered an ample selection at the buffet every night. We always tried new things, and if we didn't like them, went back to the staples that we had discovered earlier. It was not top of the line offerings all the time, but we never had trouble finding something to eat. We dined at the Italian restaurant and the Hibachi (Japanese) restaurant. The food was good at each of these places and offered a nice break from the standard buffet food. We only ate at these two places because we didn't like being tied to a reservation time (wanted to hang out on the beach as long as possible). We ventured off the resort one day for the full day tour with Eadventures. They are listed as the #1 tour for Playa Del Carmen and we were very glad that we decided to do this excursion. They take you to Tulum, snorkeling in a cenote, zip line riding, cliff jumping, lunch at a beach side restaurant, snorkeling with turtles and finally snorkeling in a lagoon where the fresh water meets the ocean. It was amazing and they were very professional and courteous. Would book the same tour again in a heartbeat. Overall, the resort was fantastic and was the first place we have stayed at in the Rivera Maya that we would consider returning to.", "Date": "July 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hal;esowen", "Title": "\u201cFantastic\u201d", "Author": "JBHal;esowen", "ReviewID": "UR115623889", "Content": "Just returned from the Tucan and I have to say that the place is faultless.The rooms are large and very comfortable,the food is first class in both the themed restaurants and the buffet with the latter having a great choice where even the pickiest of eaters cannot fail to find something to enjoy and the grounds are out of this world with lots of wildlife the highlight being the Howler Monkeys.We were lucky enough to get rooms on the jungle side of block 14 and had the monkeys on our balconies most days which was great fun.The staff are also first class and gave great service in all areas but a special mention must go out to Ofelia our Beach Waitress and Gerrado our Breakfast Buffet waiter but a lage thankyou goes out to all of the staff who always had a smile and a Hola for you at all times.If you are looking for a Hotel with great facilitys, staff,and a great beach then the Tucan is a must and we cannot wait to return next year.

The Kids Club activities were good. Both of our kiddos liked going, and the staff was great. The beach was beautiful, with waitresses to bring drinks to your chair. If the palapas were full, you can get an umbrella from the towel check-out place. They allowed us to do late check-out for 100 pesos/hr (about $10). Since our flight was late we got to enjoy another morning at the beach. The resort has a large jungle area with monkeys, iguanas, peacocks, and other animals wandering around. The kids thought this was great. Other things to note: There were some ants in the bathroom. Not many and we just smashed them and moved on. The beds were very firm. Also, the resort is mostly open-air, only the guest rooms, the shops in the lobby, and the Mexican, Italian, and Japanese restaurants have a/c.

They keep an eye on the kids while entertaining them, giving the parents some time to themselves. The hotel's location is outstanding; it is located right on the beach, and has a great view of the beautifully coloured water. If you do not believe that the colour of the water is actually this shade of light blue, come see for yourself! Unfortunately, the hotel's cleanliness is not top of the line. You may find insects in your room, but nothing major. I myself despise insects and had no problem with them at all. Whether you are 5 years old, or 25, you will find endless enjoyable activities throughout this hotel and it's campus. If you want a really mice view of Playa del Carmen from above, try the parasailing. It is unbelievably fun.

We Flew in on an old Boeing crammed up plane supposed too be with Thomson however it had be operated by TUI Airline Belgium who were an absolute discrace, the had absolutly no idea how to work a long haul flight from Manchester, it was three hourse delayed followed by an eleven hour flight, we had booked an upgrade which they were unable to facilitate, it was a lot like faulty towers to be honest with bad in flight meals, know entertainment, toilet problems and a refusual to land at Cancun to start with :( However when we arrived we were greated by staff serving drinks whilst checking us in to our rooms, the secret is not to pay for the sea view rooms offered by Thomson but to instead email the Hotel Directly through there email adress and they will alocate you one free of charge, the Pools were great but we made little use of them as there were a lot of children, we did however do some amazing diving with dressel divers and went out on s great day trip to Cenotes they were fabulous, There is also pottery painting which is reasonable, the Snorkling at Tucan is second to none with some great sea life especially if you sneak out some bread out of breakfast you see some amazing creatures. We also took a jungle tour on a Hummer that was great with a great guide and some great food along side some great attractions for more information check out Hummer Jungle Tours. The Beach was lovely and clean and if you has just come out of the sea covered in sand you were not alowed into the Lunch Buffet but the Barbeque was a great alternative, the waiters would usually deliver drinks to your sunbeds and you would in return tip them a few pessos. The Food was great and because of the large resort there is ample opurtunity to check out some of the many resutuarants there, we stayed during new year and christmas so took advantage of the two Gala Buffets which were filled with Lobster Sea Food and Steak, oh and plenty of Champagne :) The Rooms were a bit tired but no matter they will still very comfy with a lovely view and in room mini bar you could sit out on the balcony and watch the sun go down whilst reading your Kindle. The Rooms were cleaned Daily and great towel decorations. Playa del Carmen is filled with shops selling tourist tat for miles, you can pick up some bargains like Sun Creams and Bug Repellant. We ate out one night at Karens and each had a \"Surf on Turf\" it was great :) Thomson Reps are great with in depth knowledge and great offers so check out there special offers on excursions when you go as the is no better life there. The Hotel charges for Wi-Fi which can be expensive so get it cheaper by popping into Playa Del Carmen and visit starbucks where it is free :) Taxis are around 5 $ and you can also do laundry there cheaper but that is something to look into we didn't as we were on holiday. On Check-out you settle up and wait for a coach if you flight is later than check-out then you can spend the reat of the day by the beach free but and then use the facilities on the lobby area like the shower before having the flight home. We had a 7 hour delay but thanks to First Choice we spent that seven hours in the hotel on the beach which saved a lot of time and money. Overall it was great and we picked the perfect time of year, I strongly recomend visiting there but make sure to book some excursions as we spent 14 days and that can sometime make you feel a bit gated if you don't go out and do something, A good Holiday for all the Family", "Date": "July 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baltimore, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cThis resort is the best!

We traveled with 2 kids ages 15 and 12 and wanted to make sure that we had a hotel with something for them as well as for the adults. Let me cover the highlights: FOOD: It was great and there was always plenty to choose from. The buffet at the pool/beach was the place we frequented most - they served breakfast and lunch everyday. You could order a specialty omelete or choose from other egg/pastry/fruit items. In addition to the buffet there was a grill at the beach that served hamburgers, hot dogs, fries and nachos all day long --Ice cream too. The reservation resturants were great - Mexican is best! Steak house - just ok ( compared to the others). There is something for everyone so don't worry about the food. POOL/BEACH: The beach is amazing - plenty of chairs (alot with umbrellas). the water is gorgeous and it is easy to stand in the water without it being too deep. Pool is also beautiful an water is warm. Most of the pool is 5.5 ft deep - but there is a 4ft section and a more swallow entry area for kids. The only negative comment I have is that the swim up pool bar is in a separate adults only pool. That pool is small and the water is much colder because it has a waterfall spilling water into it. It was a little bit of a hassle to get out of the main pool to go to the pool bar - but nothing that would keep me for staying at this hotel again. ACTIVITES: More than you could even imagine. The \"star friends\" are in charge of the activities and they always had something going on - beach volleyball, water games, special dancing on the beach even a mechanical bull riding competition on the beach. Something new each day! ENTERTAINMENT: The shows were spectacular - way beyond my expectations. This resort is well above other all inculsives in the quality of their performers. ROOMS: the rooms were very comfortable - great showers with 2 shower heads. Many people in other reviews complain about the beds throughout Rivera Maya being hard - but we slept great. Even my 15 yr son who loves a soft bed commented that he loved his bed in Mexico. OVERALL: This was a great trip and we will return to this hotel inthe future.

We were there with two younger children (8 and 6) and they had a great time at the Kid'sClub. The staff there were great with kids and made sure they were always safe. The first night we were in building 15, which is close to the resort \"theater\" and can get noisy during the evening show (goes on untill 11pm). We asked to move and got a room closer to the pool which was great (very quite and closer to the beach and pool). For those that have complained about the food, I do not understand what they expect... it is an all inclusive, but there is food for every taste. We also tried some of the \"theme\" restaurants, and would say that the Mexican was excellent, the Japanese was very good, and the Italian was OK. We skiped the Brazilian, but were told it had great meet choices. With regards to the rooms, ours was always clean (maybe it helped the 5 $ we gave to the cleaning lady), but the bed is a bit hard. Some of the \"not so good\": the SPA is very small, but there is a Jacuzzi and Steam bath which we used during the rainy days (included). The massage were overpriced (around 100USD for 1 hr). Also if you need Pesos, there is an ATM onsite, but you can only get USD... you have to then exchange them in the reception... I can't figure that one out. If you need Pesos, its better to go to the 5th Avenue and get the cash from a bank ATM. Other than that we had no complaints.

Will return.\u201d", "Author": "glomom81", "ReviewID": "UR115000544", "Content": "My husband and I have traveled quite a bit and seldom return to a hotel, but we went back to the Tucan and couldn't have been happier. It has a certain magic. We will go back again. Here are some tips based on what I was fretting over before I went: Money- We brought 75 ones and used almost all of them for tips. We tipped only those who truly deserved it, so you can tell the service was excellent. Shuttle to resort - First time we went it took us 3 1/2 hours to get to the resort. This time it took 1 1/2 hours. Taxi's are $95.00 from the airport to the Tucan. It takes about 40 minutes. Ask the tour rep how many stops they'll be making and how long. Worth the $95 if there are mutiple stops. To go from the Tucan to the airport is $50, so we did this to give us extra time to get packed and have a relaxing breakfast. Check-in - If you booked a king bed, be prepared not to get it.The desk will tell you that they try to give you what you asked for, but it's all based on availability. I was not pleased and the desk staff tried to find me a decent room with a king, but no luck. We ended up paying $50 a night for beachfront and it was worth every penny (still no king, though.). There are no taxes or fees on the upgrade, so it was $350 even. So nice being right on the beach--convenient for those rain showers that make you run! (I found the front desk staff very nice and accomodating.) Clothes - it was hot, hot and hot there.(But a nice breeze during the day on the beach.) Very humid at night. You don't need in-between clothes. You need bathing suits and cover ups, and nicer clothes for night. I brought flat shoes because the path is cobblestone-like and not lit very well, so I didn't want to break an ankle. I wore only the lightest clothes I brought -sleeveless everything and anything made of cotton. I never wore anything with sleeves and my sweater never saw the light of day. And...bring two-piece bathing suits no matter what your age. I haven't worn a bikini in 25 years, but wore one this vacation and didn't feel self-conscious at all. Americans are the minority at this resort and the Europeans all wear bikini's and are very accepting of their bodies. I loved it. Beds - in the oceanfront room the mattresses were great. I would say they're new and far from hard. In fact, my husband and I both agreed they were better than our expensive mattress at home! Electricity- you do not need to bring a converter or adapter if you're from the USA. My hairdryer and straightener worked fine in their outlets. Hair--I have wavy hair that takes on a life of it's own in the humidity. After a couple of nights straightening and drying my hair, I gave up. Within half an hour of being outside, I looked all poofed up . I ended up pulling it back or twisting it up. So bring some nice hair clips and headbands, etc. Weather- I was always told that when it rains in Mexico it's just short showers and then the sun comes back out. Not so in June. We had 4 sunny days and lost our last 3 days to rain. Bring umbrellas (our room didn't have one) and cards, books, or games to play on rainy days. The resort has some activities, but all excursions and shopping are outside, so you're very limited. I asked a couple of people who worked there about the rain and they said, \"Don't ever come in May, June, and the summer months because you never know what you're going to get. Come in April or May.\" Oh, that's just great....hindsight! If it is pouring(like heavy heavy rain), you can call reception and asked to be picked up. Just be prepared to wait a bit. Safety--there is security everywhere. As I took a right and walked down the beach, I got a little nervous as I got pretty far away being that I was walking alone. But, I soon saw a security guard from the neighboring hotel walking the path that ran parallel to the beach. He smiled and waved, so I felt better. The police also patrol the beach in ATV's. It's quite a sight to see the guy on the back with his machine gun. The Tucan is in a very safe area, but you have to be smart, no matter what. Food---For an all-inclusive, the food is fine. There is a lot of variety. Don't forget that the buffet up by the lobby is also open for lunch. Check to see what side is open. It's a nice change from the beach dining area, which can get repetitive after awhile. The specialty restaurants are nice, but the food is nothing to gasp over. Medicines- Neither my husband, nor myself had any trouble with our stomachs, but we were careful not drink the tap water, nor eat anything that could be washed in tap water. The Apple rep told us that everything is washed in purified water, but we were wary. As the week went on, we branched out a bit and ate some things, but still stayed away from lettuce and unpeeled fruit, etc. We also stayed away from anything mayonaise-based. Always bring Immodium in case you do have trouble. Works like a charm! Cipro, an antibiotic, is also nice to have. My doctor always insists I take it with me \"just in case\". Pool/beach - Pool was hot when we were there. Without exaggeration, it had to be in the upper nineties because when we got out, we were cold (and it was 89 out!). The ocean was in the mid to high eighties and crystal clear. Due to the wind, it was not calm, but I wasn''t battered by the waves either. If you're a pool person, you might want to consider the beach at this time of year. There is little breeze at the pool and it is beyond hot sitting around it. Bring a tube (or buy one there), so you can float. We had excellent drink service on the beach by a girl named Ofelia. We also had a couples massage that put all American massages to shame. I had Enrique and my husband had Eli. Best massage I ever had in my life. Enrique took every once of stress out of my body and locked it up somewhere. Amazing massage. My husband, who never gets masages is now a convert. He said Eli put him in Heaven. $182 for a couples massage. YES, YOU HAVE TO GE UP EARLY IF YOU WANT A FRONT ROW PALAPA. If you don't care, then relax. You can also get umbrellas, if all the palapas are taken. Tip-turn in your towels at the end fo the day and ask for fresh ones right then. The towel place doesn't open until 8, so that way you'll have the towels for \"saving\" your seat. Drinks- Yes, they are totally watered down. I'm a lightweight when it comes to drinking, and these drinks on the beach did not give me even the slightest buzz. The bar in the lobby is a different story. There I got buzzed. hahahaha Entertainment- typical all-inclusive, except for the magic show. It was really good! The otheres are fun, but kind of repetitive. But after long days with rain, they were great! Service- was terrific. Our safe wasn't working, so they sent someone right away and they put in a new safe! And, the maintenance man saw that our shower like was strobing, so he fixed that, too. Our room was immaculate the whole time and the mini-bar was always stocked completely. I would leave notes and a couple of dollars requesting extra bottles of water because it was so hot. They were always there. Keep the big, blue bottle of water in the bathroom to brush your teeth. I hope this review helps takes some of the stress out of getting ready for your vacation. The Tucan is a beautiful and friendly place. I hope you enjoy it as much as my husband and I do. It's not 5-star \"off the charts\" fabbbbbulous, but it sure is special. I'll take the Tucan any day over those fancy, sterile-type resorts.

We could walk right out our door to the pool and the beach was only a few steps away. The mini bar in the room was not keeping the water and beer cold so I called to have it fixed. The staff came right away and tried to fix it but it was still now doing the job. I called again and they brought a new minibar and I was good the rest of the trip. I left Flor, our room server, a tip and asked for extra water and beer and she took great care of us. The rooms sofa also doubles as a bed so it was plenty of room. The pool was great. My 10 year old could not get enough. The beach was awesome and we alway found a nice Tiki umbrella to sit under. The water was a rough but it was fun to jump the waves and search for shells. The food was outstanding. Our favorite server was Leonardo. He was such a nice guy and treated us great. I loved the buffet. The people that complain about the food are the same people that just eat hamburgers and hot dogs everyday. They never try different things. Trust me the food was very good. We did the Japanese and it was a lot of fun watching the chef do his thing at the grill. We also did the steak house and that was very good too. The shows at night were a bit corny in my opinion and by the end of the week I was more content to sit in the lobby area or go to the beach to enjoy the breeze. The performers do put in a great effort though and are very friendly while promoting their shows. The theater were they performed was packed everynight and they do a lot of stuff for the kids. The only thing I would say is GET FREE WIFI. It is 2011 and the guests need to stay connected. It costs $12 an hour to connect to the WIFI. We walked to Starbucks and used the WIFI there. It was not a huge deal but seems like a simple thing to give to the guests. I cannot end the review without talking about the jungle area they have at the resort. It was so cool. They had monkeys, chickens, turtles and many other animals to view. The kids loved walking through there to see the animals. It is just one of those extra touches that sets this resort apart. I have been to one other resort in the area that was very good but for mny money this place was a step ahead. We will return. I did not tip everyday but instead tipped my servers on the final night of my stay to thank them. They work so hard and are very friendly make sure you take care of them when you have the chance. Check out XCARET and the Mayan Adventure snorkeling tours.

Second, they mischarged my room for movies that we never watched as we weren't even in the room at the time. But no one had the authority to remove the charge from my bill. That run around took 45 minutes after which I gave up. Third, they couldn't even get their own internet network to work after having charged me twice for it.

Even the specialty restaurants are okay but not great. Staff: Just great - so nice and helpful. Receptionst was not very nice but the rest of the staff was amazing. Rooms: Lovely! We booked a Junior Suite with sea view and I can recommend it soooo much. You have a total sea view. We woke up with the sea breeze and it was just awesome. I would really recommend everyone to book a Superior room since in our case it wasn't even very expensive (150 EUR per Person for 2 weeks more than regular room).

The Good: Rooms/Shower and great A/C Service Good Always Friendly and Helpful Staff Entertaining Pool Large Beach Beautiful The Just Ok! Food Bla and no presentation and same everyday. Birds like to swing down and grab some food as well....all open air buffets. Pool Area, boring...Do not go to this resort if you like a swimup bar. This one is seperate from the large pool and you are surrounded by trees and its actually dirty sorry. There really never was people in it. I never once went into it, and that is sad because its nice to meet people and hang out there. NO A/C in most resturants all open area, except Mex/Jap/Italian which pretty much were warm just no humidty in it. In my honest opinion it seemed like people looked bored. I know that sounds bad, but there was like no bars that you could just sit at and people were having fun. Maybe they were but from what i could see not so much. I feel this resort is in need of some renovation, up date in the food department and build a swim up bar closer to where everyone is hanging out. The shows at night were good but no A/C or event air ventalation so it was very uncomfortable to sit and watch, we did but...thank god when we got back to the room it was comfortable. The staff did there best and always tryed to get people invovled and they were so friendly, thank god for them because it would have been a long trip. So i know you will probably read this and think just another complainer but i am a travel agent and i am not sure if i would recommend this property. I dont think I have ever compared resorts since every trip to be is great, but this one i always seemd to compare something, so that means i was a bit unsure. In a nut shell that is how i feel, sorry to disappoint anyone and from what i here the other Iberostars in Riveria Maya are wonderful so yes i woudl return to another Iberostar just probably not this one.", "Date": "June 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cGreat experience - Destination wedding on the beach\u201d", "Author": "Hanic", "ReviewID": "UR114424413", "Content": "We went to the Toucan as destination for our son\u2019s wedding. We were a party of 29, family and friends of the couple. We mostly arrived on a Thursday and Friday for a Sunday wedding and stayed 4 to 7 days depending on individual schedules. The room was exactly what I wanted. I like a good, clean comfortable room with the basics well done and not much need for glitz or large size. I am there to enjoy the resort, the experience and socializing with friends, not to spend time in the room. The room had a comfortable spacious bed, 2 couches by the sliding door to the balcony, spacious closet, drawers and a good sized bathroom with a large shower area. No issues with water temp or pressure. Food was excellent at the buffet where we ate breakfast and dinner most of the time. Lunch was at the snack bar by the pool and ocean. We had sit down dinners at the Italian, Mexican, Asian, and Steak house. All very good +. The rehearsal dinner was at the Asian which is Benny Hana style - well done. The wedding dinner was at the steak house, excellent dinner, nicely set up for the slide show, DJ, and dancing. Service was excellent. About 6 waiters took care of all our needs, serving food, wine etc. Gabriela, the wedding coordinator, made everything flow very smoothly. She took care of all kinds of requests for the DJ equipment and the slide projector (one of the quests wanted to DJ, and my son brought a disk of photos to display continuously during the dinner and dancing). No request was left unattended. Thank you Gabriela. The wedding itself (and the rehearsal) was also set up and run by Gabriela. She was very efficient and attentive, everything went well. We were 1 of 3 weddings that day! Service and food was excellent in all the bars and restaurants we attended that week. Keep in mind that we mostly went as a group. While the facilities are big, the sudden presence of 20 or so more people never seemed to stress any thing. At the large buffet, we were a small part of the action, but when we showed up at the lobby or beach bar - no problem, all orders were filled quickly. No comments like wait for the waitress to take your order. People were happy to help and serve you your way. I gave tips, I think most people do. If I just had a drink or 2, I usually left a dollar. If we were at a table with several people each getting several drinks, We left about $5. We left daily house keeping and restaurant tips. I left a total of about $70 in tips during my stay. Additional amounts were left for Gabriela, Antonio and Rob, the captain of our snorkeling boat. The property itself was very well kept. It featured a small \"undeveloped\" area they referred to as the walk thru jungle. It was a 3 or so acre parcel with paved paths located between the back of the resort and the ocean. Watching and looking for the various animals was always a pleasant diversion when walking back and forth from the lobby to the room or beach. The buffets were bordered by a moat with coy and tropical fish, on one side and a water fall area which lead to a pond with mostly flamingo's. Last but not least was Antonio, our Go-Go rep. Antonio was the \u201cgo to\u201d man. If you needed or wanted something, Antonio could help out. We booked our excursions thru him; snorkeling and Ecco park (both very enjoyable). We got advice from him on where to shop for various items during our day trip to Playa del Carmen. He took some of the group out to buy cigars, and generally helped us with myriad little things that came up during the trip. Thank you Antonio. The wedding was pretty much a fairytale experience for the B&G.

Service: Spectacular. The room was always spotless with new towel creatures everyday. The waiters/waitresses were on top of everything, VERY hard workers and earn their tips. I know you don't have to tip, but these staff members are working very hard and are more deserving than most. Activities: There are activities for the young, old, drunk and sober :) If you are bored, this is your own fault. The night shows were a little cheesy, but entertaining nonetheless. The staff members that were the \"star friends\" were extremely friendly and always had a smile. The disco is also a fun spot for those who are into dancing/night club. Pool: Love it! Really big and pretty deep and has a \"beach style entrance\" for the kids. Swim up bar is good...gets a little roudy at the time, but you can get drinks elsewhere.

It was our first all inclusive experience and it could not have been better. Everyone is so friendly and they just cater to your every need. The Apple Vacation representatives are very helpful, and will answer all your questions to make sure you are on schedule for departures or excursions should you choose to do so. Our room was spotlessly clean and I don't know what kind of bed some of the other reviewers sleep in normally, but these beds were extremely comfortable and not hard as some stated. The air conditioner works wonderfully which adds to a nice nights sleep after being out in the hot humidity. Our room was in the 1200 block, facing the pool. Very nice, private and quiet. One morning the monkeys were on the balcony of the room just over from ours, so we did get some great video. We did tip our maid and left her a note to leave more bottled water for us to take to the beach/pool during the days, and she more than took care of us! The monkeys are such a joy to see and experience, as all the wildlife that you encounter. The peacocks are so fun to watch, especially where there are 2 males and 1 female together. The pool is beautiful and so spacious. We always had a nice hut and never over crowded. The beach.. well its gorgeous, and again whether it was 10:00 AM, or noon, we always had an oceanview hut with no one on either side of us. The shows were very good. The singers and dancers are extremely talented. We also enjoyed the Magician very much. We sat extremely close and could NOT see any illusions or hidden areas... he was amazing. The food is wonderful especially in the specialty restaurants, but be sure to make your reservations as soon as you check in. The time slots fill up fast and spaces are limited. We had no problem finding something good at the buffet (breakfast is wonderful). You have your choice of anything from chicken , pizza, fish to hamburgers and hotdogs. We rented jet skis and went out on the ocean (paid in US Dollars for this, as well as for tee shirts in the shops inside the lobby). We never had to exchange to pesos, as we thought we would have to.. so do check this out first before you exchange your money.. this may only apply around the resort area itself. We were content to just enjoy the area and did not venture out. The only problem we encountered was our last night trying to enjoy a nice quiet dinner in the Mexican restaurant. There was a family next to us with the brattest kid I have ever seen. As she whined and cried and threw her fits, the parents just kept repeating \"your behavior is unacceptable\" over and over again... ENOUGH ALREADY, take the kid out of the restaurant, and take care of the issue.. others are trying to ENJOY their dinner. This was a result of horrible parenting skills and I wish I would have said something. The bus ride to and from the airport does take approximately an hour, maybe a little more, due to picking up and dropping off people... so take that extra minute to run to the bathroom one last time. We are looking so forward to going back to the resort, and we are pleased to come back with such a good experience. I am very thankful to the staff and management of Iberostar Tucan for taking such pride in the resort and making our trip so memorable.

First week was bit wet & chilly, but the second week did not dissappoint. Beach was amazing... we never had any calm days in the ocean, but was never that rough that could not go in. No water shoes needed here. There were few tourists there the first week and was easier to get a palapa on the beach until late morning. Drink service on the beach was adequate. My husband doesn't drink and he appreciated the cappuccinos they brought him. Pool was large and chilly, again wasn't too difficult to get a lounge chair there, although we spend most days at the beach. Drink service was adequate. When we wanted to drink sooner than later, it was alot faster just to go to the bar in the restaurant on the beach, faster than the beach bar as well. The benefit with this was you could ask for Jose Cuervo tequila and they would provide. I asked at the beach bar and they just \u2018said\u2019 they did not have. We found that the food was exceptional, it is the first all inclusive that we have been too that cooked hamburgers and hotdogs that were just like back in Canada. The potato wedges were to die for as well. The Steak house was very good as was the Japanese restaurant. The Italian was so, so and we did not try the Mexican. The buffets were very good and always found something to eat. Champagne was easy to acquire with the dinner meal, just ask for sparking white wine. It is also the first time that I have been able to drink the red and white wines at an all inclusive \u2013 they were very good. The evening shows were pretty good, some better than others. I wish they wouldn\u2019t spend so much time repeating everything over again in all languages. I think English is pretty universal and they could get away with just one language. Although I am sure some of the foreign countries did appreciate it. Loved the feel of the resort in the gated community. Felt very safe walking about. Took $5.00 cab ride to Playa Del Carmen few times as well as shopped right at the resort. We found that if you take the price they want cut it by 40% you could usually end up getting your purchase for that in Playa del Carmen. Also four of us took a cab from the resort and went to Tulum 1 hour each way and $45.00 each way and the driver made a point of staying there and waiting for us. Said we could take as long as we wanted and he would wait. We stayed about 2 1/2 hours. It was very nice of him and we tipped him well for waiting. We also took the ferry to Cozumel and cab ride to Iberostar resort there where you can sign in and spend the whole day laying on the beach, snorkeling, eat and drink there. A good way to see the other resort. I cannot remember how much the ferry was, but I think around 20 - 30 dollars for 2 of us. We have been to one other resort on the Mayan Riviera the year before and were curious how it would compare. We stayed at Catalonia Royal Tulum and loved it there as well. CRT is better if you don't want any children around. CRT is perfect for a more intimate couples get away as the resort is smaller and the ambiance just feels more romantic. The Lounge chairs at CRT are more comfy and high-end padded loungers. We loved that you did not have to make dinner reservations at CRT, but having said that we didn't like the fact that you did not have the option of a buffet for dinner, only lunch and breakfast. The beach at Iberostar was better, the Tulum beach was very good, but you had to watch certain areas as there were a few rocks in the water. All in all both are great, just depends on what you are looking for in a vacation. We were in building 11 in at Iberostar, main floor and I would have to say it was probably the best location close to the beach and ocean. We are trying Riu Tequila in September and am not sure how we are going to like that as it isn't right on the beach, but we booked our room right through Riu.com and you couldn't beat the price.

This was the longest amount of time we've stayed at any 1 place (11 nights), but I did not get sick of it. I was terribly sad to leave. We are in our early 30s with no kids for a point of reference. Check in: The ladies working there were so sweet. We got a room in the 1600 block, but wanted to be closer to the pool. We were switched to the top floor of the 1300 block with a view of the pool 2 days later. If you're not happy with your room, just ask. I felt the genuinely tried to make us happy. Restaurants: I emailed 2 weeks ahead of time to get restaurant reservations for our first 3 nights and I was glad I did. We ate at the Japanese restaurant twice (excellent), Italian twice (good - try the lamb), Steakhouse twice (very good- try the tenderloin), and Mexican once (poor). I did not like eating dinner at the buffet - it felt too much like lunch. We ate in Playa del Carmen twice at these restaurants: Fusion and Carboncitos. They were both awesome. Fusion is on the beach with awesome ambience, live music, and good food. Our drinks were weak and not very good. Carboncitos is delicious authentic Mexican food (try the tacos al pastor) and has fabulous margaritas for 25 pesos ($2.15 USD) daily from 3-6pm. They were strong! I really recommend going into Playa del Carmen at least once. It was fun and felt very safe. Room: Room was just fine. I was worried about the bed since I\u2019m a light sleeper. I requested a foam mattress topper and slept like a baby the whole time. Housekeeping did a nice job and I tipped them daily since IMO maids just don\u2019t make enough money for what they do. There was a decent hairdryer in the bathroom so you can save space in your luggage. We had a nice time hanging out on the balcony. Beach: It\u2019s gorgeous with soft, white sand, and blue water. We didn\u2019t have issues with the towel game. If we wanted a specific spot with a palapa (we preferred to be on the far right side near the massage hut since it was quiet) we tried to get out on the beach by 8. Otherwise, we would just walk around until we could find spots or got an umbrella from the towel hut and set up near the water. There were some small-midsized waves when we were there, so it wouldn\u2019t have been great for little kids. We had fun body surfing. We took out a kayak one afternoon and that was fun. There is no snorkeling in front of the resort. My husband walked down to the undeveloped area to the right of the resort and the snorkeling was slightly better. If you really want to snorkel, go to Cozumel or to Akumal to swim with the turtles. Service: I thought it was top notch. The staff were so friendly and tried to keep everyone happy. They work so hard, so we tipped frequently when we got great service. I loved the waitresses on the beach. I felt so pampered getting cocktails delivered to my lounge chair. Grounds/pool: They are gorgeous. We loved being in the jungle and the animals were a delight. The staff work very hard keeping things spotless and beautiful. The pool was huge. We called it the warm lake since it was the biggest pool I\u2019ve seen and extremely warm. I don\u2019t like swim-up bars since they are usually full of pee. The swim-up bar is fairly small and was full of very loud people so we didn\u2019t hang there. Internet: The resort need to get on the ball and get free wifi for the entire place! It's expensive to use their computers or wfi in the lobby. We walked 10 minutes to the Starbucks in Playacar (turn right outside the report and you'll see it on your left) and used theirs for free. You'll get a passcode on your receipt when you buy a drink. Comparison: We stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro in Punta Cana (Dominican Republic) last year. Both resorts are great. The Bavaro is newer, with larger rooms, and the most gorgeous beach. The Bavaro beach was more beautiful in my opionion and the food was a little better (lobster, more choices). The Tucan has the awesome jungle feel, animals, and the ability to do awesome excursions. If you want to just lay at the beach and not leave the resort, try the Bavaro. If you want to see and do a lot of stuff, go to the Tucan. Excursions: I used tripadvisor to plan all our excursions \u2018cause it\u2019s the best. \uf04a We went to Tulum (took collectivo and hired a guide at the ticket booth), Akumal to snorkel with turtles (took collectivo, used own equipment to snorkel for free), Hidden Worlds (they provided transportation, centote was stunning!), and the Jungle Place (took collectivo, find full info on trip advisor, held awesome monkeys ). We loved them all, especially the Jungle Place and swimming in the cenote (sinkhole with caves you can swim through) at Hidden Worlds.

We originally booked with Thomas Cook for the Quetzal side, however once checked in, we was told our room was on the Tucan side. No big deal as both hotels have exactly the same rooms with shared facilities, pools etc. We was in block 18, and although our room didn\u2019t overlook anything amazing (just some thatched roofs of the lobby), and although we did enquire at reception about changing our room, we decided not to bother as we would hardly be in there anyway and the area was nice and peaceful. Rooms are lovely, maybe slightly dated and could do with more storage space for clothes, i.e. drawers, but this wasn\u2019t even a problem. You would have to be extremely picky to even moan about this sort of thing! The pool is gorgeous, just like stepping into a warm bath, and it\u2019s also really big, we never had a problem with over-crowding etc. The beach is absolutely amazing; this is where we spent many of our days. There are palapas at the back of the beach, near the showers and beach bar, however, (as we like to be near the water for a dip when it gets too hot!!) we really liked the fact that we could go to the Towel hut and grab a brolly and put it up anywhere we liked. When walking down into town, we didn\u2019t see any other hotels that offered this. We also enjoyed the waitress service on the beach, once again, something that we didn\u2019t see in any other hotel along the beach. Another reason why I liked the beach so much was because my boyfriend proposed to me there! \uf04a I couldn\u2019t think of a better place to do it myself. The weddings also looked really lovely as well. The staff here are amazing, they are what makes this hotel so special. The service, the friendliness \u2013 is just top class. The animation team are fantastic, always providing games and activities; however they do not pressure you into doing anything. Our last day they even had a bucking Bronco on the beach! Brilliant fun to watch! They work such long hours (14 hours a day in that kind of heat would kill me!) and are always so happy, I really don\u2019t know how they do it! Now to the restaurants. We always found something that we liked in the main buffet restaurants. Even the most pickiest eaters should be able to find something they like. I\u2019m not fussy myself and like to try different kinds of things, but if pizza and chips is your thing, then you\u2019ll also be fine! We really enjoyed the speciality restaurants. We went to the Steakhouse twice which was our favourite. The steaks there are just delicious, and we were told that the chicken was also yummy! We did the Japanese twice as well, not only is the food lovely, but the show is also fun to watch (when I say show, I mean watching the chefs cook the food in front of you!). We also tried the Italian which we also enjoyed. Me and my boyfriend had the lamb chops (very Italian I know!!) and they were tasty. And the Mexican was also good, although would probably not bother booking that one again! The nightclub \u201cMascara\u201d is a laugh! It\u2019s good if there\u2019s a few of you but if you\u2019re just a couple, it would probably be quite boring, although it is good to \u201cpeople watch\u201d!! One night we was the only ones in there having a boogie but that was at about half 2 when most people had gone! Another thing that makes this hotel so special is the wildlife. The monkeys are just brilliant to watch, but the noises they make are so loud! Fascinating to watch. There are peacocks, agoutis (just like little squirrels), tortoises, parrots, tucans, turtles, koi carp fish...there was always something to look at. How many hotels can offer this!? We made some really good friends out there, and got talking to so many different people. Such a friendly place to go. To sum it all up, we had a fantastic time here and we miss it already.

In many ways we rated the Tucan higher than the EDSS (especially the beach). We pretty much agree with the glowing review from Teece88 below \u2013 so we will try to keep this one a little shorter than our normal reviews! \u2022 The rooms were comfortable (4* not 5*) \u2013 no issues. We requested twin and double interconnecting rooms on an upper floor and got them. \u2022 We loved the jungle surrounds, and in particular the antics of the monkeys (ask for Block 14 if you want monkey action \u2013 it\u2019s also midway between reception and beach and not too close to the entertainment noise). The monkeys occasionally woke us with their distinctive loud \u201cbarking\u201d noise at 6am (they also do this at dusk), but preferable to crying children! \u2022 The huge pool was the warmest outdoor hotel pool we had ever experienced \u2013 the first time I\u2019ve ever seen my other half dive straight in without any faffing around in the shallows \u2013 bliss. \u2022 Beach was gorgeous \u2013 picture postcard white sand, with palm trees on the approach, turquoise sea and blue sky (see pic). Just hard work for sea swimming as big waves. \u2022 The food was nice \u2013 good selection of roasts, pasta, salads, Mexican dishes, etc. Only downside being, some of the dishes were lukewarm (didn\u2019t see any thermometer temperature taking referred to by Teece88 in the week we were there \u2013 may be the hotel has taken note of comments). Meats were particularly tender, seafood less so \u2013 a shame given the location. The teenagers found plenty to enjoy in the buffet, but the Japanese restaurant was their highlight \u2013 the chopper wielding \u201cninja\u201d chef very entertaining, and food good too. Only red and white wine available in the buffet, but rose wine available in the speciality restaurants at extra cost. Overall a great spot for a family holiday. If you\u2019re determined to find fault, you can do, but there are so many positives we thought it merited its rating. And if you\u2019ve done your research it will definitely live up to expectations. Other tips re excursions: 1. Go to Akumal for snorkelling (almost guaranteed sightings of turtles, rays and you can hire equipment and underwater cameras from the dive shop if nec). Also drive along to Half Moon bay (left fork under the Akumal arch) and stop for food or drink at La Bella Vida bar \u2013 complete with swings, tree houses, hammocks and skeletons!! Fab spot. 2. Go to Coba for Mayan culture \u2013 not as picture perfect as Chichen Itza but atmospheric in the jungle and less crowded, and you are allowed to climb the tallest temple and hire bikes for a minimal charge to explore further. We hired a car to get here and Akumal 3. Go to Xel Ha for its beautiful lagoon and numerous outdoor activities. We also swam with dolphins here \u2013 not cheap and previously we weren\u2019t convinced about the ethics of this, but the dolphins seemed so happy playing together with and without the tourists we were really glad we did this.

At the beginning I did get worried because planning a wedding in another desination, you have limited control and that is scary . But at the end everything was beautiful, no it was amazing, we received compliments from other guest staying at the resort. The resort is a good size to have a wedding all your guest will find one another but yet if you need to get away from everyone you still can. My husband hurt his foot before arriving in mexico and at the resort they made sure we were comfortable and good. I had out side vendors come in and special request for certain guest and each item was taken care of with out a concern. Gabriela did have another wedding around the same time, but she and her colleagues took care of everything. the decorations , food and service was great. They do their best on trying to have other hotel guest invading your ceremony... I have so many good things to say that i am not sure how to state it... I love them at tucan.

The airport was fine checkked bags and got to cancun transfer with no probl;ems. The driver was fantastic he made a convienance stop and we bought a few beers and such before going on to resort. The bag handlers at the resort were not so nice they yanked our bags out and practically threw them on the ground rushing the taxi away which was shocking considering there was no one behind us. We looked at each other and just smiled thinking well one person's bad day will not affect us. The lobby check in was no problem. However our room was terrible. the floor tiles were dirty and the sink had hair in it. We lifted the sheets and even the sheets had hair on them. (short curly hair if you get my meaning) We called desk for a manager and when he showed up he did everything short of accusing us of placing those hairs theree to get a free upgrade. We insisted on a room that was not an upgrade to put a stop to that theory and was place din a diffeent room. The food was not so great (many people complained of illness) and the beer was always warm it served no purpose to bring a mug since the beer was never cold. the drinks were ok for bottom to mid shelf at best. The restrooms in the public areas were always a mess and a few times I had to get tissue for my wife from the men's room because the womens would not be refilled. The beach area was not as clean compared to some of the resorts a few steps down and a few people had rashes from what I guess could be sea lice. Most of the lounge chairs would always be taken early and if you did get one you would be within the loud noise. The service was not so great and the staff was rude if you didnt speak spanish. I know I was in Mexico and should have learned basic spanish but I still think the staff should have been a little more patient with my attempts. We were never rude or mean to anyone and I realize now after the fact that the people that would go stomping their feet and creating a big rucus were the one's that got the special tretment. Silly me to think that all you have to do is pay for the service to recieve it. We had a wonderful time outside of the resort and stopped by Luna Blue for drinks and visited the bad boys too.

Had a great room in building 12 near the pool & even had 3 monkeys visit us on our balcony. Rooms are the same as they have been for years. Beds are rather firm & nice big shower.

None of them materialised. THe grounds are beautiful and kept very clean. You see the gardeners working very hard all day long. THe property is huge and it's a fair walk from the reception/main restaurant to the beach. The blocks stretch from the beach inland and there's 12 of them. So if you are unlucky and get a room in say block 17 and higher it's a fair walk to the beach. You will also be able tro hear the noise from the evening entertainment. We were in block 12 and itr was perfect. Rooms are nice, very spacious and brilliantly clean. The shower rooms can do with updating but everything works and is totally sufficient for that little time we spent in the room. The a/c worked pvery well and was quiet, the mattress was very comfy and not at all hard. So overall the rooms were very adequate. We tipped the maid a couple of times a week and our minibar was restocked every day. Also you get a huge 3 litre water bottle that we used to brush our teeth. We didn't have any stomach problems. The food - don't expect Michelin star quality, not even in the speciality restaurants. But there was plenty of choice and it was edible. The Japanese was good, the Italian and the Steackhouse were just about bearable and the Mexican was palso good. Trouble with these restaurants was that there wasn't much choice so we actually preferred the buffet one. The staff are the friendliest we've met. They all work so hard and you can see why some of them may get annoyed when a holidaymaker expects them to turn into slaves for a mere $2 tip....As long as you treat them with respect they will go out of their way for you! The hotel doesn't have free wifi - anywhere. Which is a key letdown because the Riu next door does. Still not a huge problem and there's a Starbucks within a 10 minute walk. The wildlife is lovely. There's monkeys, peacocks, iguanas and plenty of other animals which are all amazing to watch. One tip of advice - try to avoid the central path through the property at night. It's extremely uneven so a no-no for heels or buggies plus you are guaranteed to be bitten by mozzies. Also, we did come across a snake. Not a large one but enough to make us jump. Instead use the path that runs along the back of the buildings. It's even and well lit so a lot less bugs thee. The beach is superb. Wide, soft, White, clean. The waters are turquoise, every shade of it. We preferred tro stick to the beach as it was quieter. We were early risers so no problems with loungers under the palapas. Someone on here mentioned they were al taken by 8am -not really. For the 2 weeks that we were there they were all gone by 10. And there were plenty of free ones closer to the water where you could get a beach brolly. The daytime entertainment was annoying. The main guy would shout all the silly announcements in all languages that he knew and repeat 3 times. It was ok at first but did get really irritating after a few days. Still if you want to participate there's an option. If you are having a wedding at the hotel -you are in luck! We could see 3 weddings from our beach loungers and they all looked fantastic. The wedding planner and the rest of the crew were superb! We did 3 trips: Chichen Itza, Tulum and and activity day at Xplor. Unless you are a history/ culture freak we'd recommend doing Tulum first before booking Chichen ITza, then you can decde whether you want to spend the whole day on the bus and in 40 degree heat with not a single shady spot. We probably would still have done it but it's just a thought. Would we go back to Playacar? Definitely. Would we choose Tucana again?

In short - we liked it (regardless of the 50% clouds and rains). Rooms: relatively small. Bed mattresses on stone base which some find too firm. But they absolutely were not rock-firm. Maid service was pretty good (as much as possible when you bring sand/dirt on your shoes from outside). The room had some leak in the bathroom and we've been transferred to another one as soon as we asked. A/C worked fine in the room, and the mini-bar was refilled regularly (we don't drink soda and asked for water instead what's been done). Food: it was good. Really good. Those complaining about it probably those we saw walking to their table with a plate having a hamburger. We liked it. The usual complain about repetitiveness comes when you try everything on your first day. But if you eat 2-3 kinds of food a meal (for breakfast/lunch/dinner) then you're good to have completely new meals every time. My only complain is about drinks. Fresh squeezed once were only available for breakfast. What's really good was you could have something to eat all day round. But I have to agree with the smoking problem. They don't really have a separate area for smokers and this may be a real problem at a restaurant if you're concerned about it. Beach: good and clean (hotel team was really working to keep it that way). If people cared to clean after themselves it would be ideal. Towels were always available for replacement (clean and in good condition. Comparing to Egypt here). Enough spaces/shades on the beach. We were not interested in pools. Though I tried one. And we never tried adult only pool. Entertainment: we were not interested. But they definitely had some 'animation' activities by the pools. And they also had extremely loud late night shows (at 8 pm - for kids, 9 pm - midnight - for adults). And we wanted to go to bed early so we had to move to another room (see Service/Staff). Territory: amazing tropical garden. A lot of animals, birds (including flamingos and peacocks), turtles etc. You can spend the whole day in that garden. ATTENTION! Agree with others about slippery floors and passages. We joked that the whole hotel might have been carved from the single piece of rock. And when it's raining the floors may be very slippery (though in most places the territory is well lit). So, be aware. Service/Staff: most are really friendly. The main reception guys were really helpful. When we moved in we could not stand the noise from the night show and could not get asleep till midnight (the building was close to the entertainment place). I asked to be moved (around 11 pm) and they offered to do that immediately but we did that in the morning. The second room (farther from night madness) had a leak. The service guy came in 15 min after front desk call. But we asked to be moved again. Fortunately, they had another room close to the beach and we moved again. This time it was good enough. My feeling is waiters in the restaurants waiting for being tipped and trying to do extra unwanted services to get that. But otherwise they're pretty friendly. Features: staying connected is really expensive. $12/hr of wireless Internet connection (sic!) and even more expensive if you use their business center computers. If you walk for 15 min you get to Starbucks where you can buy something for $2 and get access to their wireless network without limits (and the same password worked for me for the whole week). I also tried to make a collect call to Amex but could not manage to get connected (they seem to want you to pay for it regardless). They also have souvenir guys coming 2-3 times a week (though we found a small plaza in 15 minutes from the hotel where you can buy the same stuff for less). A good thing they had a small playground so our kid could do something when it was cool and cloudy. Again, not sure about complaints from other. Sure, this is not a heaven.

No real opportunity to snorkel directly from the hotel beach. beds are plentiful, with great thatched sunshades, although we did have a sunrise towel rota to book the best spots each morning on the beach ! food - buffet quality ok with enough choice for repeat visits. other restaurants could be better. Italian had best food, Japanese for the cooking experience, loved the onion volcano ! Mexican had worst food, but we had one very good night there due to the friendly staff and mucho tequila. Steak house was disappointing. burger bar by beach was great at lunchtime, and the ice-cream wagon. drink - red wine was good, can ask for sparking cava too which was vey drinkable. cocktails at beach bar were fine, using local spirits and variable quantities ! cocktail bar at reception and in entertainment area were very good with international brands available. beer was not so good, only 'unbranded' draft available at the bars, but quality bottles in your room fridge. For the tea-loving Brits, take your own tea-bags as the Negra brand there was unpleasant and weak. dress code enforced in the themed restaurants but not in buffet, where shorts and t-shirt ok. beach restaurant, for lunch, let people in with just swim-suits, would have preferred it if they had been told to cover up. Generally relaxed and informal everywhere. bars - hotel lacks an outdoor area for the evening, with just indoor cocktail bars and the entertainment area, which is covered and partially air conditioned. Also would have liked a sports bar, or at least a screen somewhere where we could have watched a bit of football. Had fun in the swim up bar a couple of times. beach bar convenient for quick service during the day, staff - all staff excellent, from reception, bar and restaurant and entertainment star team. rooms - beds are firm, but this did not bother any of us. just ask for the pads if you prefer softer. balconies - disappointing views, unless you upgrade to sea-front at 75 USD per night which are great but basically the same room spec. Inward facing rooms overlook the 'jungle' which comes right up to the balconies on all three floors. Many are very dark, some you can barely see the sky, let alone the beach. Hotel may need to look at cutting back some of the overgrowing branches to let in more light. Great views of the monkeys though. Outward facing rooms more light, but only view of garden pathways and next door hotel. If you want to move rooms, reception were happy to oblige. entertainment - variable - Boogie show was the best, almost west-end production quality. mexican culture shows twice a week were good too. in-house band and good dancing and 'live' singing, not mimed. We went on half day trip to Tulum, less than an hour down the highway. Had personal guide who was very knowledgeable and talked for ever ! Prefered this to the long trek to Chichen Itcha. walked into Playa del Carmen a couple of times, once along beach and once on the road behind the hotels.. 5th avenue the main strip, shops all the same, with constant hastle for attention.

The property hasnt' changed much, other than the location of the lobby bars and of course, the beach due to the hurricane. Our room was on the Tucan side. It was conveniently located near the pool. The decor hasn't changed since 2002 and could really use an update. Also, there was very little storage. They offered no dressers. Other than the one dead cockroach and a few permanent stains on the blankets our room was clean. The housekeeping did a great job every day and always made great towel creatures. The beach is MUCH nicer than a few years back with the huge sand bags, etc. Although, I miss the old beach. I don't like the steep drop off from beach to ocean, but hey, they did a great job rebuilding it so I can't complain to anyone other than mother nature for destroying it in the first place.

I am of Mexican heritage and my husband is Italian American. Yes, some of the food could be spicer, but they are trying to please guests from all over the world. Speaking Spanish helps too and I do. The staff is wonderful and very friendly, most speaking some English, French and German. (It is a much smaller resort than the Iberostar Paraiso Maya where we stayed in 2009 for 9 days, but I believe this is the 1st Iberostar built in Playa, so you can definitely see how they improved if you decide to stay at 1 of the 5 mega resorts at Iberostar Paraiso Maya).

The pools are pretty deep at the Tucan with only 1 shallow end for children or anyone under 5'2\" (me!), but I'm a beach person, so I got my exercise swimming in the pool and relaxed at the beach. My husband did mention the bed being a bit hard for him, but after spending days at the beach in the sun, nights in Playa and dancing in the disco at Tucan, I could have slept on the floor and still had a good nights sleep. So do not let other reviews discourage you. There is small shopping plaza just outside the resort within walking distance. It is a must see and you can barter for a reduction in the prices in most outdoor stands and few of the stores. Go into Playa at night, yes's it's SAFE.

And quite why people have to scrape chairs on the marble floors at 2 and 3 am in the morning escapes me, - some nights the rooms were very noisy especially if new people arrive at your block late with all their bags and stuff. Tucan/Quetzal is located as second last hotel on the Playacar strip and has a lovely beach. The buffet restaurant which is the fall back food option was good and on occasion very good and the specialist restaurants offer nice alternatives - but the queue for booking them is not pleasant or efficient. Tucan/Quetzal is a mostly a very friendly place to stay and the vast majority of the ordinary staff we met were amazing and just want you to have a nice time in their country. They offer real Mexican hospitality and a genuine welcome all over the hotel. Quite why the front of house staff are quite so greeting faced and miserable I'm not so sure. They really let the hotel down. Maybe they've all been on the rude training course that Ryanair send their staff on and passed with flying colours! And finally when will hotels like Tucan/Quetzal get what Starbucks already get and provide free WIFI - the iberostar charge rates are ridiculous.", "Date": "April 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cCruise ship on land\u201d", "Author": "4cortinas", "ReviewID": "UR103694746", "Content": "We went with our 2 daughters (9 and 12), and it was good overall.

Especially concerning the food. We spent a week at Iberostar Tucan - all inclusive - and were very impressed with the facility, the food and the service. We were able to eat & drink just about any time of the day. The service and food at the restaurants was extremely good. We ate at the Japanese, Mexican, and the Steak house, and all three of these were incredible. The Buffet was also very good, and at the beach they have a outside station were you can get hotdogs, hamburgers, and nacos all day long. I would just like to say to all the people that said the food was inedible..I just don't get it!! We met other couples from all over that have stayed at the Tucan numerous times..up to 16 times with one of the couples. They said they have stayed at other places around the area and like the Tucan the best. We will return without a doubt. The Beach was great, and if you enjoy snorkeling like we do, walk down to the beach, and go to the right, and walk down past the other resorts and you will see a reef right off the beach. It is a manmade reef, but holds alot of fish. We had hours of enjoyment out there alone. We cannot say enough about this resort..except can't wait to go back. The staff will bend over backwards for you, and they work very hard at their jobs and do their jobs very well. We do agree with alot of the reviews about the beds being a little hard, you can ask for a foam matress to put on top if you need one, we were just too tired at the end of the day to care. This is one place that we recommend very highly.

Great room with partial view of the pool and lots of tropical plants. Howling monkey's swinging around the trees and running around on roof tops. The grounds are just beautiful and rooms are spacious, colorful and clean. The buffet restaurants are also good, the Japanese a la carte was our favourite. Lots of choices, people who complain about the buffets are probably very picky eaters. The nightly shows could use a little help but they are not that bad, have a few tequila shots and they will be a lot better, lol!!! The beach is one of the largest of all the hotel zone and super clean. The pool is amazing but you will have to get up early in the morning to reserve a lounge chair. Warning do not wear heals on this resort while walking through the jungle trail or walking around playacar hotel zone, especially if you had a few too many tequila shots. Get a nice pair of flats. Don't forget to go to the town of Playa del Carmen, which is a 5 minute taxi ride or a 25 minute walk from our hotel. You can also get on the fairy in Playa del Carmen to take you to Cozumel.

The property is amazing. It is essentially built in a jungle, so there are several varieties of animals running around including monkeys, iguana, agouti, peacocks, ducks, song birds, geckos, etc. The beach is gorgeous and meticulously maintained. The staff is what sets this resort apart. Each staff member was so nice and quick with a warm greeting and smile. It is impossible to have a bad attitude about anything when there are so many nice people around you. The event staff was good, although the nightly entertainment was just ok. The bartenders are top-notch and will keep your glasses full. The food is above average for an AI. If you don't like your a la carte meal, just stop by the buffet. We had heard that the restaurants are difficult to get reservations for, but we had no issues and had reservations on 6 of our 7 nights. Make sure to book your first 3 choices when you arrive, then stop by the desk early in the day on the other days. No problem. I can not say enough good things about the grounds, the beach, and the staff. The room was clean but certainly not a Ritz. The beds are hard(ask for a mattress pad) and there are little ants that are here and there. There are several bugs on the property, but they were a minor inconvenience(and I hate bugs). The only major complaint I have is that there is no internet in the rooms and the wifi in the lobby is slow and costs $$.

I'll try not to be repetitive and I agree with ALL the positive comments that people have already written. I'll try to keep it short with just observations I made, once I got down there. One thing on Trip Advisor that was misleading to me was regarding taking a collectivo (bus) outside the resort, on the main highway, to the Tulum Ruins or Akumal Beach for snorkeling., for 50 pesos. This may be true, but the main highway was approximately a mile or so away from the resort and not easily done, if you're carrying snorkeling gear, backpacks, & a little cooler. We just rented a car for a day & went to the Tulum Ruins, Jungle Place, & Akumal Beach. To Rent a Car, it's: $50. for a small manual, $55. for a small automatic, and $5.00 extra for an added driver. I think it might be better to visit Akumal Beach for snorkeling in the morning, because the afternoon was very crowded & we didn't see many fish or sea turtles. To rent a life jacket, it was $5.00. To use the changing room/toilets, it was $1.50 for 2 visits & parking was $2 an hour. I don't know how much it was for renting snorkeling gear, cuz' we brought our own. There's little restaurants on the beach there, also. Wear gymshoes to the Tulum Ruins, because it's a long walk just to get to the entrance where you buy the tickets. I wore flip flops, big mistake. If, you want to see the monkeys, up close & personal (on your balcony). Request a room in Building #14. Building #13 would probably be good, also. Xplor was GREAT, but you should be in good physical shape, because of all the walking and going up ramps, stairs, & ladders, for the Ziplines. It was $107 pp. open 9am to 5pm. Well, worth it, because you get to do as much as you want of the ziplines, ATV's, swimming & rafting in the water caves, plus lunch is included. We did the ziplines in the morning & then again in the afternoon when the lines got shorter (after 2:00pm). I think that's it, for a change of comments?

The reason why you should go to this resort is because of its beauty, family centered activities and bc of the experiences that you will have w the animals. My friends saw more animals their first day than they saw during their 10 day stay in Costa Rica! If you love monkeys, request block 14 near where they reside. But be forewarned that they WILL wake you up very early with their carrying on and often appear on the balconies! You will see peacocks, strange guinea pigs w long legs, iguanas, gorgeous birds,chickens etc..bc the resort is built around a small jungle. If this turns you off, be sure to ask not to be placed facing the jungle. If you are a perfectionist, do not go here. This is not the Ritz Carlton-not everything is perfect.. However,this is a beautiful, quirky ,well run hotel which has VERY reasonable prices for a place so gorgeous. It has spirit and energy for children, and there is always something to do. We will return next year. I plan to bring my own bottle of Kettle One Vodka! Enjoy! The other wonderful part was the Star Friends. They are adults who run the activities and they are fun, fit and very professional. Morning airguns and afternoon archery was a huge hit for all families.

No the entertainment isn't the caliber of Hollywood but it's fun and adequate for a good time. Yes, the food selection is nothing to write home about but the food is good quality well maintained. The onsite restaurants are pretty good but they aren't like Olive Garden or a good steak house, etc.. Last but not least, the place is kept clean and the gardens and monkeys etc. are nice to have around if your in to animals. You can't go wrong for an all-inclusive just don't expect the Ritz.

Just don't take those reviews that say don't good or the reviews that say it's the best thing since sliced bread too seriously. All things considered, it's a great value and unless your expectations are way off base, it's an excellent vacation spot. Oh ya, with all that's going on in Mexico these days, the security is very good, the Tucan is in a community known as Playacar which is a part of the Playa Del Carmen area and not only is the Playacar area gated but the Tucan hotel itself is also gated so you feel ok visiting the local shops and taking the morning jog.

It was my husband, myself and my two teenage sons aged 17 and 14. My 17 year old is not one for positive feedback but even he admitted he had fun and enjoyed the hotel. That is huge praise! The Tucan is located in Playacar, a gated community which is just south of Play Del Carmen. It is a very safe area. The beach is beautiful with fine white sand and small surf. The water is the most amazing colors of blue. The Tucan provides plenty of lounge chairs. There are three rows of Palapas on the beach. These are all taken by 7-8 am. But the hotel has very nice beach umbrellas you can check out for the day for free. There are wait staff walking along the beach offering drinks. Plus there is a bar right there between the pool and the beach. There are several showers and foot spigots to rinse off after taking a swim. I am not a pool person...much prefer the ocean but my sons swam in the pool and they enjoyed it. There is a covered area by the pool with a ping pong table and foose ball table. My younger son enjoyed that. Also at the pool is the towel station where you can get towels and umbrellas. I loved that I could trade a wet towel for a dry towel whenever I needed to. Our rooms were very nice. Brand new mattresses (one day we saw them change out all the mattresses in the building next to ours so it is my assumption that they are in the process of putting new mattresses in every room). I am a very sensitive sleeper (like the princess and the pea) and I found the bed to be very comfortable! We booked two rooms so we would have plenty of room. The hotel was very good at ensuring our rooms were right next to each other. Rooms were very clean (although the blankets looked like they could use a washing). The bathrooms are nice and the shower had plenty of water pressure. My only quibble is that the stone floor gets very sandy. It would be great if there was a broom and dust pan in each room. The grounds of the hotel are gorgeous. From the lobby to the beach you walk through a jungle. There is plenty of wildlife to see, monkey's agouti's, toucans, peacocks and other interesting birds. I loved walking from our room on the beach to the restaurants and front lobby on the jungle path. I will warn that the walkway is cobbled and very uneven. And at night not very well lit. There is a outer path that is a better way for people with physical limitations (or like me, wearing heels). There are two buffet restaurants, one on the beach which served breakfast and lunch (until 6 pm) and one that served breakfast and dinner that was near the front lobby. The restaurants are open air. The buffet food was decent. We could always find something to eat. Of course there were some misses but all in all I was happy. I thought that they did a great job considering how many people they had to feed each day. They also catered to many different tastes. There are visitors from all over the world, many Europeans, Americans etc. The Tucan tries to cater to everyone. For lunch we often got the chicken from the hot line and chips, fresh salsa and guacamole from the salad line and make a huge platter of nachos which we all shared. The boys also enjoyed the burgers, hot dogs and french fries. They especially loved the never ending soft serve ice cream! At breakfast there are a ton of choices. We would go to the egg station where they would make any kind of egg to order-with real eggs! None of that liquid egg product you find on cruise ships. we only went to two of the specialty restaurants. The Japanese restaurant is a hibachi restaurant. We ate there twice and it was very good. Very fresh as the meal is prepared at your table. We also went to the Mexican restaurant one night and that was very good. The tamales were excellent. The wait staff are all very nice. Very polite, very helpful. All the staff at the hotel were great. My older son cut his foot pretty badly and the staff immediately reacted and showed up with a first aid kit and cleaned and wrapped the cut. The following day they did it again. There is a small shopping area a quick walk away with convenience stores, a starbucks, souvenir stores and kiosks, clothing and jewelry stores and an Avis car rental office. We rented a car one day and drove to Tulum. A site that is a must see! We also did a tour to Chichen Itza on the Spring Equinox which is a big deal in Chichen Itza. That was a great day as well. My younger son and husband did a dive with the on site dive shop, Dressel Divers. While the dive was great, the shop was rather disorganized and when they went back for the 2nd dive of the day that we had prepaid and reserved they were told that they did not have enough dives to go on the dive and were turned away. We were very disappointed that they did not mention this on the morning dive. They had all the information including how many dives each of them had completed and yet no mention when we booked the dives that the 2nd dive was going to 100 feet. They have 2 dive boats but chose not to accommodate my husband and son and only took out one baot and did the dive my family were not qualified to do. We had plans for the following day and my son was also not feeling great so we never got the 2nd dive we paid for. Needless to say I can not recommend Dressel and I now have to deal with them to get a refund. I can not comment on the entertainment as we were so tired each evening (getting up early to get those palapas lol!) from all the sun and surf that we never attended the nightly show.

Room: The bed was hard as a rock and the TV remote was broken - wished there were screens on the patio doors to have open in the evening. Room was immpecable - clean and mini refigerator was stocked, if we needed something we just asked. Beach: Awesome and well maintained. Con: They need to enforce the saving chaises for the ones who get to the beach later in the morning. Too many saved chaises with no one using them for hours. Pools: Clean, I didn't swim in them but my SO did, refreshing. Con: Again enforce the saving of the chaises pool side, Great place to read and get out of the sun in most cases. Bars: Great drinks! No complaints at all. Didn't go into the Aqua Bar - too shady. Food: My SO and I made reservations at the Italian, Japanese, and steak. Italian was good and well presented. Steak place was good - excellent tenderloin and nice salad buffet. First time we ever at Japanese food -- it was AWESOME! Very entertaining to watch food being prepared. Our wine glasses never was empty. The Japanese was our favorite place to eat and the foodl was terrific. Buffet: Lots of choices and all very good. Entertainment: The jazz music was AWESOME and entertaining. The other show we watched was with the couples doing different games-- it had us in stitches laughing. Very fun. Wonderul place to see all sorts of animals - only saw monkeys towards early eveing in the trees. Peacocks all over (they woke us up by 5:45 every morning). Playa del Carmen - lots of places to eat and shop - BEWARE of the timeshare people who want to stop and talk - ignore and keep walking. 5th Avenue was fun.

We stayed mostly at RIU Playacar, RIU Palace Maya once, and this time decided to try Iberostar Tucan. My husband and I were traveling with my adult daughter and her boyfried. We booked separate rooms for 10 days. We decided to splurge so we booked and paid for 2 ocean front Jr Suites, which added close to 2000 to our cost, which in total was almost 11 thousand dollars. When we arrived our rooms were not ready, and the man at check in told us immediately that he had something to tell us, but to come back at 2:30 as he was not ready to tell us what it was. After reading a previous review, the only thing I could conclude was that he wanted to put us all together in a Presidential Suite. It was important to us that we each have our own rooms for privacy. We went back to him and sure enough he told us that he did not have the Suites we had booked and paid for. He told us he was putting us all together for the 10 days in the Presidential Suite. We were not given the choice to look at the room. We told him we paid for 2 rooms and due to our different schedules and desire for privacy that we did not want to room together. He actually became angry, did not apologize, but said he would offer us 2 Presidential Suites for 3 days, then the 4 of us would have to move to the Quietzel side which was quite a walk, and that he did not have King Suites that we paid for, so we would have to each have rooms with 2 beds. I asked if they would help us move, and he said NO! He was not at all friendly! We finally got the the Presidential Suites and they were beautiful. The first 3 days though, we did not unpack or feel comfortable as we knew we were just going to have to pack again and move to the other side of the resort. I called the man at the front desk and asked if we could just all 4 stay together after the fist 3 days in one of the Presidential suites as he had originally offered. His response \" Ill have to think about it\". Also, I forgot to mention, while he was telling us at the front desk that he did not have the rooms that we had booked and paid for, we watcdhed a woman who had not paid for a suite ahead of time slip him a 20 dollar bill or a 50 we were not sure which, so that she could get in to a suite. He took the money! After the 3 days, we moved in with my daughter and her boyfirend. Dont get me wrong the Presidential suite was amazing, but it meant that we have to walk through their bedroom to get to ours, and my husband and I had to sleep in separate beds. I decided to talk to the manager. I told him the story, he actually brought the man over from the front desk and he looked like he wanted to kill me! In the end, they \"found\" a suite we had originally booked so my daughter and her companion moved and spent the last 4 days in their own room. No apologies, so please dont count on having the room you pay for! That being said, I will move on to other things: Beach- The beach is amazing! Of course you have the selfish people who go out at 6 am and put towels on all of the palapas and then do not return for hours, but we chose to sit in the sun closer to the water anyway. Room- There are no mini bars like at the RIU with liquor in the room, but they do stock with beer, water, soda, etc. The Presidential suites are awesome! I also forgot to mention that the man at the front desk warned me that if we failed to move after our first 3 days, he WILL charge us 400 dollars extra per night for the Presidential. The regular suite was ok, nothing special really, but maybe worth it for the ocean view. Beds were not bad, there were a few lizards in our room in the Presidential suite. The Presidential suite also had a hot tub on the balcony we used once, and amazing views. We watched the sunrise every day. Pool- The pool was huge. Once again, the people would go early and put towels on all the best seats and some of them did not return til afternoon! I refuse to play that game, One day we were walking around the pool looking for a seat and some lady walks up and said all 8 of these are ours! It is posted of course not to do the saving of seats but is not enforced. I watched and those 8 seats she had saved were never sat in the entire time we were at the pool. There was no music at the pool, it was quiet and nice for reading a book, but we thought maybe a little music would have been nice. There was some activity at one end of the pool with the entertainment staff, but I hardly saw any of them the entire 10 days. One lady told me that due to new management, they laid off all entertainment workers but 5. That really didnt matter much but at the RIU they had more that made it fun for everyone. Swim up bar- They may as well not even have one. It is secluded, with a lot of it shady, so it was cold, once again, no music, one bartender so no fun banter, etc. The RIU swim up bar was great. We only went in one time. It also looked dirty. Lobby bar- Nice, drinks more upscale. Not as much fun with bartenders but they were nice. It just seems that the staff were a little more outgoing and went out of the way at RIU to get to know you, and make sure you were haivng fun. FOOD- You are limited if you stay 10 days you can eat at specialty restaurants 4 times, for one week stay you get I think 3 times. We ate at the steakhouse twice, which was very good. The Italian was not good, I ordered veal and could not eat it, spouse ordered spaghetti and he said it tasted like chefboyardee from a can.The Japanese was very good. We did not try Mexican but daughter did and got ill. The buffet was BAD. no meat that was edible, limited choices, food cold. Breakfast was fine, but at RIU Playacar the buffet was so much better. AT RIU, they had a woman who made pancakes right in front of you so they were hot and fresh, the pancakes at Iberostar were cold. They did nake omelettes which were good. The room service we had once, and chicken nuggets were ok, as was the brownie . AT lunch, they have a hamburger and hot dog grill near the beach that was good. Jungle- The walk through the jungle path is uneven, and you need comfortable shoes. We saw roosters and peacocks but no monkeys in the jungle. We did see monkeys on the outer area of the resort way up in the tree on two occasions. This resort is much bigger than the RIU so it is a long walk from the ocean front rooms to the buffet for dinner, and to the lobby. I cut my foot on a rock in the ocean on the first day, then got blisters from wearing new flip flops so walking was painful. Bring lots of bandaids from home just in case or make sure you have shoes that are comfie! Shows- We did not go to any- Daughter saw one and liked it Excursions- Hubby had a good time going golfing, We also did the Mayan adventure where they took us swimming in a cenote, snorkeling in a cave, and then in part of ocean. Saw a stingray and daughter saw a sea turtle. That was pretty fun We took a cab to town and had drinks at a bar, took ferry to Cozumel and rented a jeep, stopped at seaside restaurant for lunch, that was fun as well. Had a massage on the beach which was great. Overall, this is a nice resort but I would not stay again. Most of the staff are friendly, but it is just not as friendly or fun as the RIU Playacar. I would say the ocean front rooms are great, which the RIU does not have, but the beach is not any better, both are beautiful. The food much better at RIU, The jungle is nothing too special. You will have a wonderful time here enjoying the beach and the sun.

I have travelled the world from Asia, Europe and central America, stayed in a multitude of hotels from 3 to 5 star and ultra luxury hotels. This is my third visit to the Riviera Maya area and my 7th trip to Mexico. I have stayed at Riu, Bahia Principe, Barcelo, Palladium properties and a recent stay at the Sunset Princess Hotel in 2010. I always try to budget an all inclusive getaway per year keeping in mind my max is 1200$ per person. I would also like to remind reviewers that hotel ratings vary from country to country, from vacation providers and such. For example the European rating system only takes into account amenities offered on the resort whether there\u2019s a mini bar, pool, spa etc determines the start level nothing else. Vacation providers use a similar rating system, taking in to account customer experience and profitability (they appear to favor hotels that give them a kick back). Furthermore big hotel chains such as Riu\u2019s, Iberostar\u2019s and Bahia Principe\u2019s etc. offer different 5 star options at different price points remember the higher price points such as the Grand Hotels (Iberostar) Palace (Riu) etc. will give you newer hotel with more elaborate amenities and options. Our research included all the big chains, Princess which were all in the same price range. We also took into account the location to Playa and narrowed it down to Iberostar Tucan/Quetzal, Riu Yucatan, Riu Tequila, Barcelo Maya, and The Gran Sunset Princess. We wanted to try something new so the Princess was out of the question. Upon reading reviews both the Riu Tequila and Iberostar scored high and after hearing that the Riu Tequila was not on the beach we went for the Iberostar and didn\u2019t regret our choice one bit. Location 5/5: 30 min. safe jaunt to town, 5 min. by taxi. One of the last resorts on the strip. Keep in mind that your likely to be the last one off the bus if your taking the hotel transfer from the airport provided by the vacation operator. In hind sight I would have paid and booked a private transfer. (There\u2019s nothing the hotel can do about this) Beach 5/5: much better than the Bahia properties and the Grand Princess. Fine white sand lots of loungers to choose from some days were more difficult to find such as after a day of rain when the hotel was at capacity. Lots of palapas at the beach unlike the riu\u2019s that don\u2019t offer any. Beach umbrellas were available should you want to pull your lounger to a more quiet location or closer to the beautiful turquoise waters (I wish all resorts would offer this). All other properties on the beach did not allow patrons to pull loungers closer to the water. Ocean AMAZING blue, turquoise, aqua green need I say more. We had two red flag days which would stir up the sand, on calm days the water was clear. Not much to offer for snorkeling. Grounds 5/5: As others have mentioned there\u2019s a jungle filled with wildlife in the middle of the resort . Note: Rooms located closure to the mid hotel area will be awaken by wildlife specifically those pesky peacocks who moan and screech in the early morning.Which makes for a great walk to the beach or to the buffet. Beautiful lush mature vegetation which you don\u2019t find at newer hotels in the area. Pools 3/5: There\u2019s 4 pools on the resort one rectangular one on the Quetzal side which is used for sports activities such as water polo, basket ball etc. The main pool is huge and offers some lounger\u2019s in the shade, sun and 4-5 big beds under a hut good luck getting a hold of one they are reserved in the early morning and impossible to get. Loungers are sometimes hard to get during busy times of the day it wasn\u2019t a prob for us as we are beach people. The main pool is quite deep which has some advantages (keeps drunks and kids out) however may be too deep for some. Some complained about the pool temperature in other reviews however we found it comfortable. There\u2019s is no swim up bar at the main pool again it has some advantages but can be annoying as the adult pool which is small is full of drunkards and has the only bar on that side of the pool. There is also a small kids pool on the Tucan side close to the main pool and kids club. Unfortunately all pools are showing their age and could use and update, tiles and all. Compared to other hotels the pools just didn\u2019t cut it. Bars: 4/5: The annoying thing was top shelf alcohol is not available at the beach or pool. Nor was it provided when you order your drinks from the waiters. Every time I ordered a Gin/Tonic with Beefeater or Tangeray or Gibson they would come back with the local Gin which would be fine if the local gin was drinkable but it wasn\u2019t it tasted like bubble gum. So if you want top shelf order it at the bar. I find this a little sneaky. But not a deal breaker as many hotels have this type of policy. Other wise drinks were readily available service was great and they had tones of options as all other allinclusives drinks are week order doubles. In room mini bar was fill ed every day unlike advertised which is a plus, we did tip everyday. Rooms 4/5: Showing there age, beds are hard we ordered the available mattress pad which resolved that problem. No bathtubs, shower only, and one sink. No flat screen though I hear some rooms were being changed. Overall no big deal it was impeccably clean and provided the amenities as advertised. High Def TV with ample english choices and on demand pay per view channels available. Could use an update isn\u2019t as nice as the newer hotels but met my needs. Entertainment 5/5: Star friends are everywhere not overbearing but help make the experience more enjoyable when you want to take advantage of the activities. Great staff good experience. Nightly shows are better than the average with live music every night. Patrons at the hotel was a good mix of European and North American which made for a good range of people which I find entertaining in itself. The disco was always happening unlike other resorts I have been too. Overall entertainment above par than others. Food 4/5: Standard run of the mill resort hotel food with better choices than some never left hungry however sometimes a little underwhelmed Spa 4/5: though I didn\u2019t try any of their services two in our party did. They both had a exfoliation rub and a chocolate wrap for about 130$ per person which lasted a little under two hours. They were both very satisfied with their purchase thought the price was just about the same as at home which I find expensive for Mexico. Service 6/5: The strong point of this hotel Exceptional attentive staff from all points. Buffet service was excellent. Maid service excellent. Beach/Pool service excellent. Theater and Lobby bar service excellent. Service with a smile at all times. Waiters always talked and joked with patrons. A++ a lot of the newer hotels can learn from this hotel Overall I would highly recommend this hotel, though it does show it\u2019s age location, service and experience blows other competitors out of the park. The hotel would be an exceptional 5 star hotel should they update the main lobbies, restaurants, rooms and pools however that would mean it would not be offered at this price point so I am fine the way it is. I will be a return customer some day.

We loved the jungle atmosphere, most mornings at 6AM we were woken up by the spider monkey\u2019s screaming kinda like a bear getting ready to attack. On the way to breakfast a peacock had always been by the restaurant to greet everyone walking by. Also saw tucan, turtles, swans, cranes, raccoon type creatures, iguanas, flamingos, chickens everything was just so beautiful. The pool was huge and the temperature was just perfect and always able to find a chair. The beach was amazing and with perfect weather for 7 days straight this is what I came to Mexico for. Hard to get a chair in the shade so every day I pulled up a chair and setup an umbrella you can get from the towel stand. Because I wanted to sit right by the ocean rarely did we get a server to take our orders so had to go get drinks at the beach bar ourselves. The drinks were to be desired, kinda watered down and always tasted like they were missing that fruity kinda taste. The food was just okay, nothing special which is to expected you are in another country and yes the food is pretty bland. Tried the steakhouse and it was okay, I asked for well done and it came out pink so didn\u2019t eat much of it. Didn\u2019t try any of the other restaurants, it was hard to get in any of them but walk by and it always seemed pretty empty to me. Breakfast was the best meal of the day. The Quetzel side has a photo shop where you can get professional photos taken, did this and the pic\u2019s turned out great! Had a facial and massage in the spa, loved it. Used the steam room, hot and cold sauna\u2019s also. Used the gym 4 times during our stay and the equipment is just ok, nothing special. Went to 1 Las Vegas show and was just ok, nothing special but the performers take it really seriously. Many took the ferry to Cozumel but the water was to rough for me to try it. Went to Explor, most people had a blast but for us it was a waste of $238US. Took a $5 one-way cab ride to 5th avenue to shop a couple times, didn\u2019t buy much as most stores were expensive. I swam with the Dolphin\u2019s. Check out now this is where they could use some work. Check out is at 12 noon but our transfer didn\u2019t leave until 4PM, for $10 per hr you could keep your room until it was time to leave. Went to sign up to do so and was told it wasn\u2019t available, what \u2026really? How frustrating. Had 4 hours to kill and was told we could use the hospitality room to get showered and changed before it was time to leave. Can\u2019t they coordinate when we are to leave and not pre-assign our room to someone before we are even off the property? All in all it worked out, we used the hospitality room to shower and change clothes along with left our luggage in a holding room. I would go back right now if I could! If you are looking at different hotels, stop here and look no further.

The Iberostar brand continues to be our preferred choice when vacationing in the Carribean or Mexico. The Tucan/Quetzel resort is really one with two sides. We stayed on the Tucan side and were in block 11 - one block away from the beach, immediately adjacent to the pool. We had requested a room on an upper floor near the beach via e-mail ten days prior to going and they gave us exactly what we wanted. This was Iberostar's first resort in Mexico and is a little worn in spots, but they do a tremendous job of everyday maintenance and the building's age in no way detracts from enjoying your stay there. We are beach people and the beach there is exceptional. Broad, soft sand and great waves for body surfing while we were there. The pool is very large and, because of the Animation Team, there is always something fun going on there. Rooms were on a par with other AI's in this price range. AC worked very well, maids cleaned daily and restocked mini-bar every other day- but would give you whatever you wanted if you saw them in the hall. Food was very good in the Main Buffett and also in the Japanese and teakhouse restaurants. The Mexican restaurant was dissapointing though - we liked the daily Mexican offerings in the Main Buffett better. One suggestion; we found that we could get a full breakfast -including made to order omlettes-at the restaurant by the beach. This was a more relaxed atmosphere than at the Main Buffett and saved us the long walk up there every morning, (ya-lazy, but it was vacation). The Animation team and entertaiment were terrific, as we have come to expect from Iberostar. I highly recommend Iberostar to anyone thinking of an AI vacation.", "Date": "March 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oxford, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBrilliant holiday, Wonderful Staff and Great Location\u201d", "Author": "missfi-77", "ReviewID": "UR98420092", "Content": "My husband and I really enjoyed our stay here. The Beach looks just like it does in the photos and is well maintained by staff. It's busy but if you walk to the right, passed one hotel the beach is pretty deserted. We swam everyday and only saw the red flags go up 1 afternoon. We love to snorkel but did not find much to look at from the beach in front of the hotel, there are some great places to go to and you can take trips from the hotel or any tour tout. The service was fantastic, all the staff work really hard, bringing beers and cocktails to the loungers or your table. We're not really in to Hotel entertainment but did catch a couple of shows and thought them better than usual. The rooms and the balconies are big, our cleaner was very efficient and stocked our fridge as needed. We loved having a coffee percolator in the room, we often enjoyed a cup while watching the wildlife from our balconies. We saw howler and spider monkeys, tucans and coatis. They also have tortoises, flamingos, peacocks, raccoons, iguanas and more. We were satisfied with our food and found plenty to eat in all the buffets, the Japanese restaurant is great fun, you could take 5 meals in the restaurants over 2 weeks which was plenty. The bars are well tended and the table service we received was excellent. The location is good if you plan to do different trips, not too far from Tulum, excaret or the other parks. I would recommend this hotel to anyone, couples, groups and especially families but maybe not honeymooners looking to get away from it all. We could always get clean towels and you can get sunshades from the towel hut when all the shaded loungers were taken.

This was a great time to go to the resort because it was not very full. We also got a great price since there were not a lot of people going on vacation immediately after the holidays. I might suggest purchasing the express shuttle or get a cab. We had to make many stops - I think the trip to our resort took almost 2 hrs. After a full day of flying, we were all a bit crabby on the bus. The weather was chilly the first few days, but warmed up our last 3 days. It is a beautiful resort. Well maintained. There is a jungle in the middle of the resort. You can see many differnt animals. Use caution on the paths through the jungles if you are wearing heels - this can be a challenging walk. Rooms - Very clean - well maintained. We requested and received a king size bed. We were on the 2nd floor of a building. Had a nice balcony. We left money every day for room service to stock our fridge. It was nice that the hotel provided a gallon container of bottled water as well as smaller bottled water. Food - So-so. It was good, but bland. I didn't see any food handling issues. There is a lot of variety - lots of fresh fruit, veggies, but you saw the same thing on the buffet every day. The 'hot' salsa seemed homemade, but was not spicy. I think since they are catering to many differnt types of people, they keep their food on the bland side. Room Server - suprisingly fast! The pork tacos were great. Pool - very big pool area, well maintained, beautiful. Separate pool for playing sports. There are a few cabanas around the pool. These are nice to take a nap or read. Beach - beautiful beach! The beach restoration project was completed a year ago. Many of the chairs were reserved, but if you roam to left of the resort - in the other Iberstar area - they had plenty of chairs. You can use these chairs, but it's a little far from the bathroom. Restaurants - We had fun at the Japanese restaurant. The Italian was OK. I was not thrilled with my seafood dish, but the lamb was wonderful. The steak place was suprisingly good. Nice tasting steaks. We were able to get reservations no problem - probably because the resort was not very full. Staff - The staff was wonderful. Very friendly, helpful. I may go back to this resort if I got a great deal again. I do love to cook and enjoy food, but was disappointed with taste of the food. The quality was very good, just not a lot of flavor. I would probably go to Playa del Carmen or Cancun for dinner on several occasions.

We were travelling as a party of 17 for my brothers wedding, ages ranging from 8 - 65 years old and we all loved it. The hotel looks very Balinese in style and is very attractive, sat next door to its sister hotel Iberostar Quetzal. Whilst the hotel rooms were nice and spacious we were overlooking the jungle area so didn't really have a nice view (although we did see some odd looking animals outside, including monkeys). This didn't really bother us as we didn't spend much time in the room but it did mean that the room was a little dark and didn't get a lot of natural light. There was a mini bar in the room stocked with beer, water and soft drinks and this was replenished on a daily basis. We also tried the room service on a couple of occasions for my son when he fancied some chicken nuggets!! The room service was included in the price. The grounds were immaculate and my brother and his new wife had some of their photos in the gardens which were lovely. Food was very good and we all put on weight. There was a great choice at breakfast, lunch and dinner although the lunch menu got a little repetitive (the salads were great though, as were the nachos!). We ate in most of the al a carte restaurants and particularly enjoyed the Mexican restaurant where we all had Tequila shots (they even put some Sprite in a glass for my son so he could pretend to be drinking it!). My brothers wedding was in the Italian restaurant and the food was beautiful, it's a shame we didn't get to go again. The hotel actually closed off the restaurant just for our wedding party and it was a perfect setting for the reception (they set up a disco and dance floor for us). The wedding itself was amazing. I'm not sure which package my brother went for but it was the most amazing day. The night before the wedding they organised a cocktail party on the beach for us all just as the sun was starting to set. Perfect start to the wedding festivities. The day itself couldn't have gone better and the wedding planner at the hotel was amazing, everything ran like clockwork. I would certainly recommend the hotel if you're thinking of going to Mexico to get married. The location of the hotel is perfect as it's right on the beautiful beach and only 5 minutes away by taxi into Playa del Carmen if you want a change of scenery. There was always plenty going on on the beach and in the pool, from beach parties (with paella), to yoga. volleyball, water aerobics etc. You didn't have to take part and you're not harassed but it was good fun. Didn't really see many of the evening shows as we tended to eat later and then just go for drinks in the bar but there was something on every night and the ones we did see were okay. Not West End standards but what do you expect. The staff were all fantastic and couldn't do enough for you. My son left his Nintendo DS console on the beach with a number of games and when he realised it had gone we thought we'd never see it again. However, on asking the travel rep if anyone had handed it in, she rang security and they brought it to him. We were all pretty surprised that this was the case as in the UK if this happened you'd be pretty sure never to see it again! We only did one trip where we went to a Mayan village, then to the pyramid at Coba which you could still climb (think they've closed it off now) and then to a cenote for a swim. It was a great day but we did find all of the excursions to be quite pricey which is why we only did one (we've previously been to Xei-ha which is a fab day out). Anyway, we had a fantastic holiday and would certainly recommend to others (and certainly anyone considering getting married out there). Enjoy!! PS.

My husband and I spent months deciding where to have our wedding, and I don't think there could have been any more perfect place. We travelled with a group of about 20 guests staying at the same hotel. My husband and I stayed from Jan 25 2011 to Feb 08 2011. The rest of our group was there until Feb 1 2011. Upon arrival our group checked in. All of our group had specific room requests, all of which were amazingly accommodated, even though the hotel was at almost full capacity. Check in was smooth and the staff were very friendly. My husband and I had a third floor room facing the rainforest. This was our choice. A note for future brides...as bride and groom the hotel did offer us what they said was the nicest room in the hotel, a ground floor room on the beach, but we were excited to see the wild life in the rain forrest. We loved the view of the rainforest and the visitors that came to our balcony! We had monkeys visit us a few times, and could see interesting birds, lizards and other creatures any time you went out on the balcony. The rooms are not fancy, but they are spacious, very clean, and everything works well. The showers have great water pressure and temperature. The beds are hard. We requested a foam mattress pad which did help a little. The house keeping staff are lovely. Every day we had a restocked bar fridge, and fabulous towel art! Even after two weeks, it was still a new towel creation every day! We did tip generously, as the house keeping staff are such hard working, lovely people, and they deserve it. The location of this hotel is ideal. With a large group of guests, there was literally something for everyone to do every day. You can walk from the hotel to Playa Car, a small shopping plaza, within 5 minutes. There is a Starbuck's there with free wi-fi access with a purchase. You can take a taxi for 50 pesos ($5) to the larger town of Playa Del Carmen, or you can walk along the beach into town but it will take about 40 minutes I think according to people in our group that did it. The hotel is close to many attractions in the area. We went to Xplor and on snorkeling trips arranged with the dressel divers on site. The food was good. I am a vegetarian, and typically find food challenging when travelling. There were always options for me at the buffets. After two weeks, truthfully the food was the only thing I was getting sick of. Most of the vegetarian food was fairly bland. I really can't give a fair opinion otherwise...except to say that my husband still seemed to be enjoying the buffet at the end of the two weeks! The staff in the dining rooms were fabulous. The drinks were always good. The lobby bars seem to make stronger drinks than the other bars, but if you want a strong drink, really all you need to do is ask! Our favorite drinks were the Coco Loco and the Riviera Maya! The resort grounds are amazing. The staff keep the grounds spotless and very well manicured. The beach is huge, and we never had any problems finding a palapa and chairs. I did not go in the pool (in the ocean all the time!), but it looked lovely! My husband said it was nice. There are tons of things to do...tabble tennis, painting ceramics, night shows, the disco, bike rentals, tennis courts, kayaks, tons of stuff...you really cant get bored unless you want to! Our wedding day...January 29 2011 Our wedding day was perfect. We got married in the rain forest which I highly recommend if you are planning a wedding here. It was very private and intimate. The beach weddings tend to have lots of people watching, as well as lots of wind. The rain forest was so intimate and quiet. Gabriela (the wedding coordinator) is a dream to work with. She helped plan everything, and she was there through the whole event keeping it organized and running perfectly. We had 28 people at the wedding, some from other resorts. We were required to purchase guest passes for people from other resorts. The passes were waiting at reception for our guests. The only problem was that some of our guests from other resorts were directed to the beach for our wedding, and nearly missed the wedding by the time they found the rain forest area. To our delight, at the end of our ceremony, a monkey appeared in the tree directly above us! :) We had our wedding dinner at the steak house and everyone enjoyed the food. Again, being a vegetarian, I can't really comment here. They prepared a different vegetarian dinner for me which was delicious! After dinner we had dancing and drinks at the beach bar, which they set up very nicely with white decorations, tables and chairs. They close it off for a private event. We used Adventure Photo, who have an office in the Quetzel lobby, for our wedding photography. We are so happy we decided to use them! We were a little concerned after learning the original company we had booked (Photo Caribbean) was no longer with the resort...but this really worked out for the best. These guys are great! We had two photographers with us for the whole day, and they were both amazing at their jobs, and such nice people to have with you on a special day. George and John Karlo...what a great team. We are so happy with all the great photos. Overall we had a fantastic two weeks. The weather was perfect, the people were lovely and we had our dream wedding.

I have read of the occasional complaint about this resort and honestly, I question if they are talking about the same resort. Check in and check out went smoothly. No problems at all. The beds are very firm, but I woke up without back pain for the first time in years. The food was very good. The buffet restaurants have a lot of variety but the real gems are the a la carte restaurants. We ate at the Italian, Japanese and the Steakhouse. The Steakhouse was ok but we managed to wrangle a second reservation to the Japanese restaurant. It stands head and shoulders above the rest. The food was awesome and the show that is provided by the chef who is cooking the food right in front of you is awesome. The beach was awesome! No problem getting loungers and if the straw hut umbrellas were all being used, you can get beach umbrellas at the towel hut. We preferred that as we could put our loungers anywhere on the beach, even close to the water, if you wanted. We went to a Tulum/Xel-Ha excursion. It was very interesting but it was a long day. It rained in the afternoon but we were in the water anyway, so it was no big deal. We swam with stingrays, which was very cool! We went to Xplor, which I highly recommend! It was the highlight of our week! Ziplining above the tree line for 2 hours, swimming in cenotes, rafting in underwater caves and driving through caves in all-terrain vehicles were a blast! You are given helmuts to wear throughout the park, which have a computer chip in them. Cameras are situated throughout the park and they are activated by the computer chip. At the end of your day, you can purchase pictures of your adventures throughout the day which are put on an USB for you, all in about 10 minutes. If you change your mind and want to buy additional pictures later, you can purchase them online. Very high tech!! We went to Play Del Carmen during the day, but it was so hot we returned to the hotel after 2 hours. We walked along the beach back to our resort which took under an hour. Just wear a hat and bring a bottle of water and you're good to go! You'll get a good view of the other resorts in the area, if you take this route. The vendors can be a bit pushy but politely say 'no' and keep on walking. We did go back at night and I highly recommend going at this time. The energy is much different. It's cooler and fifth avenue is lit up and there's music coming from all directions and the bars and restaurants are full and people seem much happier. Don't miss Playa Del Carmen at night!!

We spent months reviewing resort options, talking to travel agents, quizzing well-traveled friends. We settled on the Iberostar Tucan for several reasons - it was in Playa Del Carmen, which was supposed to be more peaceful and nicer than Cancun; a co-worker had just come back from another Iberostar resort in Playa and said it was the best vacation of his life; it wasn't just for children; we could afford it (though still pricey!) It wasn't the hotel's fault that it rained all week, my husband got tonsilitis ($100 to visit the on-site doctor and $100 for the medications, available at the pharmacy at the Riu next door), I got bad sunburn and massive indigestion (from eating too much bacon...). Regardless, we had a good time just being \"disconnected.\" I recommend booking a tour with The Jungle Place Monkey Sanctuary before you leave for your trip - but for my husband's tonsilitis, we would have gone, and we really respected the way they safeguarded their monkeys. http://thejungleplace.com/tours.html This list is compiled with my husband's help :) : Pros: 1. Really clean - didn't see a single spider, and not more than 5 other bugs (including mosquitoes - which isn't to say I didn't get bitten) 2. Loved the environment - tons of trees, short walk to the beach, and we think we saw more animals in the first 20 minutes when we arrived, than in a day at the zoo! 3. Staff was friendly and helpful - a few of them started remembering us, mostly at the restaurant. 4. Food was good (but not stunning - I was actually expecting better, something really fancy and rare that I wouldn't be able to get at home) - buffet had TONS of choices, with lots of fresh fruit. A La Cartes weren't bad (we went to the Japanese, Steakhouse, Mexican and Italian), although again, not better than we could get at home. The Mexican restaurant was the best of the lot. There was a beach-side hut with American food (sausages, fries, etc.) which was good for a mid-morning snack (or if you slept in too late and missed breakfast ;) 5. Tours can be booked in the hotel - we went to Tulum, which was interesting, and were picked up and dropped off at our hotel. (The tour guide then spent the entire bus ride to Tulum trying to sell us a gold cartouche of our names in Mayan characters, \"made by real Mayans!\") 6. Minibar - stocked with water, Coke, some beer although I seem to remember a shortage of Corona 7. Pools were nice - we didn't go in all of them, but we used the main one, which was big enough for all the people using it. 8. Beach - was great, although some bits were better than others. Hard to get a deck chair (people should NOT \"save\" them - if you don't need it now, why would you prevent someone who does?? Come on people). Sand was nice and white. Some areas in the water were rocky, but if you moved 10 feet away, they were fine. The water sometimes had strong undercurrents, but was generally great, and clean. 9. Drinks - easy to get, but not that alcoholic. The booze you can buy in town (in bottles) is AMAZINGLY cheap (big bottle of Kahlua for $9, bottle of absinthe for $46, bottle of tequila for $10), and is definitely cheaper than at Duty Free. 10. People - this was oddly not a noisy place, there was no one disruptive, we didn't witness any arguments or clashes between guests or with staff. Cons: 1. This stupid screaming monkey at the top of a tree outside our window went off like an alarm clock at 6:06am every morning.... The only monkey we saw in the entire resort. What do screaming monkeys sound like? Like roaring lions. Our first morning, we thought the resort next door had a zoo. 2. The bed. Ask for a mattress topper when you check in. You'll thank me later. 3. Housekeeping really needs to learn to say \"Housekeeping!\" and knock loudly before they enter a room, especially a room in which people are trying to shower sand out of various places. And leave quickly and without giggling. 4. The bargaining - we are used to Canada, where people hate bargaining. We are not used to being gouged simply because we are on vacation. My lord, but the people in Playa try to rip you off! They also don't expect you to walk away because they've named a ridiculous price. We were quite offended at first (although I did end up getting 2 large hammocks for $70... and I'm sure they were still laughing all the way to the bank. AND the vendor tried to give me a small hammock \"by mistake\".) It takes some getting used to. If you're not comfortable with that, don't get sucked into conversation. If you are comfortable, offer 1/10th their price, say you can get it cheaper at home AND made in Mexico (maybe even by \"real Mayans\"), then settle for something in between. Also, the husband was offered drugs in the middle of the day, in the middle of the street, in a really cliched \"Hey man, you wanna get high?\" kind of way. Also, within 10 feet of a soldier with an automatic. Hmmm. We didn't really explore the nightlife, mostly ate dinner late or stayed in to watch Spanish-language TV. Overall, good trip. We don't drink much so \"all inclusive\" wasn't especially valuable, but if we had been feeling better, we probably would have. I'm not sure I would go back to the Caribbean in general, but if I did, the Tucan (or Quetzal, same hotel in adjoining building) would definitely be an option.", "Date": "February 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brodhead, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cAwesome\u201d", "Author": "plainjane1", "ReviewID": "UR95708693", "Content": "we had a wonderful time everything could not have been better from the moment we arrived til we left ...... we got an extra day due to the weather at home and trip insurance covered the xtra day in Paradise will return next year for 10 days", "Date": "February 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hilliard, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cGood value, liked the Riu's better, but would visit again if on sale\u201d", "Author": "tltj29", "ReviewID": "UR95682971", "Content": "Ladies: Hair dryer is a tube that blows hot air...if you're particular about being able to really style your hair, bring your own.

Stayed for one week in Jan 2011. First time to this hotel in about 5 years. It's still good. Would recommend it without hesitation. Check-in was fast and easy. Room was exactly as we remembered from our last visit and showed only a few minor signs of deterioration but overall was very well maintained. Daily housekeeping service was very good - a daily tip of 20-30 pesos may have helped as our mini fridge was restocked with bottled water every day. Restaurant service was mostly good - usually very attentive and prompt. Buffet food was fine although not as good or varied as it was 5 years ago. Food quality was high compared to lower-priced AIs. Specialty restaurants we tried were Japanese - fun!, Steakhouse - quite good menu but appetizer buffet was not to our taste, Mexican - our favourite! Food selection at the pool/beachside restaurant was quite good and offered some different selections each day in addition to standard lunch and snack favourites - burgers, fries, hot dogs, pizza were available every day. We are not big drinkers and couldn't really judge the quality of the liquor served so can only say that we quite enjoyed the tropical drinks at both the beach and lobby bars but were a little disappointed with the cerveza - the bottled cerveza in our mini fridge tasted nicer. I believe the draft beer served in the bars is Dos Equis. Overall service, cleanliness, quality and location were very good. Hotel shop prices are reasonable - same or better than in town. Hotel offers a highly competitive currency exchange rate. I saw only one or two cambios in town that offered a slightly better rate. The beach is excellent - it has been very nicely restored since it had been eroded by winter storms. Wide and beautiful. Great for long walks on soft white sand in either direction from the resort. Didn't use the pool but it looks lovely - lots of pool and beach activities are led by the activites staff daily. Evening shows are often fun and usually put on by the activities staff but sometimes are performed by professional entertainers. Don't miss the Mexican Folklore show - it's wonderful - similar to the evening show performed at Xcaret. There is a shopping plaza a short walk down the street from the hotel that is well worth a visit - several shops offering better prices than in Playa del Carmen. We walked to PDC in 25 minutes. It's very safe to walk around in Playacar - it is a secured gated community. We enjoyed going off the resort for our morning jogs through the area. Didn't use the hotel fitness facility or spa but did have a quick look at it and found it to be surprisingly well equipped and clean, complete with towels and drinking water. One thing we disliked was that they have placed netting around all of the open-air restaurants, apparently to keep the wild birds out, which we recall as being a problem during our previous visits, although it never really bothered us. Beautiful gardens and very well maintained grounds. Sculptures and replica mayan ruins and carvings placed throughout. Interpretive signs describing the flora and fauna. Lots of wildlife on the property - quite interesting and entertaining, especially the howler monkeys. This is not a huge resort like several others in the Riviera Maya and it is quite easy and quick to get around. During our week, the hotel was not full - after the first few days one of the buffet restaurants was closed at dinner time. My only real point of dissatisfaction was not with the hotel but rather with other guests. This is a popular resort for families - found that children could be annoying when left on their own. Wish parents would leave them at home if they want to take a vacation from parenting, otherwise keep an eye on their kids, especially around the buffets, and help them to get their food. Observed several small children having difficulty serving their own food and making a mess at the buffets and snack bars with no parents in sight.

The resort serves purified water and the restaurants were spotless. We stayed for four ights and loved every minute of it. We felt safe the entire time. The animals on the resort were fun. The monkeys could be seen in the trees and on the top of the building every day. There was a beautiful peacock walking in a grassy area. There were beautiful swans and parrots. We are so glad that we booked at this hotel. We saw a magic show one evening and it was really fun. There was a dance contest around the beach area and the teens and young adults were having a blast. There is Wi Fi available in the lobby for a cost..about six american dollars and hour. The hotel also has a small computer room wtih two computers that you can access the internet from for about four american dollars. The alcohol was top shelf and the service was great at the bars as well as around the pool and on the beach. The mini bar was also well-stocked in the room as well. The rooms are clean, not plush but very acceptable. We took a taxi to fifth avenue to shop which was ten min cab ride for five dollars. Can't say more...loved it and we will go back. The kids loved it too. Our favorite restaurant was the italian restaurant although we thoroughly enjoyed the japanese hibachi with an excellent show..first class! We also ate at the mexican restaurant which was good but not our favorite although the service was exceptional. The snack bar area around the pool was good. Our boys played ping pong near the pool area and had a blast. The beach was beautiful, nice huts on the beach, no problem getting a beach chair the whole time that we were there. There were a few vendors on the beach that tried to get us to parasail, etc but not high-pressure. We had two rooms and they were adjoining with a door between the rooms...exactly what we ordered, a king for my hubby and I and a room with two doubles for the boys.

Main hotel and lobby: Very nice. Liked the bar and lounge area in the lobby and the bar service was great. Very attentive staff! BEACH: Is AWESOME and probably the best feature of the resort. Beautiful, warm turquoise water. White powdery sand! The beach is large and it was never difficult to find a spot on the beach. Even the huts were relatively easy to come by (not sure if the resort was at capacity). My husband and I walked to Playa del Carmen via the beach from our resort (took us about 30 mins.) and our opinion was the Iberostar Tucan/Quetzal had the nicest beach of all the resorts on this stretch of beach! POOL: Very nice large pool but it was cold! I have to say though that on a very hot day the cold pool was refreshing! It was a bit harder to find spots by the pool if you wanted a hut for shade, especially on days when it was windier at the beach. If you are at the pool by 9:00 though there should be spaces available. The hotel rules say no reserving beds by pool/beach but everyone does and we didn't see it enforced by hotel staff. FOOD: Overall food was good. We went to Italian, Mexican and Steakhouse a la cartes. Service at the mexican restaurant was awesome and they were so attentive! We liked the buffets as there was a lot of choice. However food was the same most days except they changed some of the main dishes each night. Overall though the food was good and there was definately enough variety for us. DRINKS: Always good and any drink you can imagine was available. I am a huge popcorn fan and loved that after 5:00 p.m. you could get popcorn with your drink :) Just a nice little addition! GROUNDS: Kept very very clean. There are many animals that can be seen on this resort as the jungle is right in the middle of the resort. Despite all the animals, the resort staff keep it very clean and are always busy cleaning. The jungle aspect is neat and it was fun to walk through, never knowing which animal you may see. The animals seem very used to humans and do not appear at all aggressive. ROOMS: This would be an area that I can say the hotel could improve on. The room was clean but could use some updating. Maybe some fresh paint or something! The volume on our tv remote didn't work and we mentioned it to the staff but it was never fixed. On arrival our hairdryer didn't work but by that afternoon that was fixed. They say that the mini bar fridge will be restocked every other day but if you give them a tip you will get things replenished every day (especially bottled water). We used a lot of bottled water as we also used it to brush our teeth. DO NOT DRINK THE WATER! The water has a smell to it and the bar of soap we used to wash our hands turned yellow! This is the case anywhere in Mexico though. NIGHTLIFE: There is a night club which we didn't go to. There is a nightime show for kids at 8:30 and 9:30 for adults every night. Some of the shows were good and the the staff did practice during the day to get ready for it! Some shows seemed a little outdated. The place where the shows are held also has a bar which is really nice and the staff are very attentive to getting you drinks during the show! LOCATION: AWESOME location. 5 min. cab ride to town of playa del carmen and 5 minute walk to Playacar Plaza which has lots of cute little stores and vendors.

The rooms would be outdated: We had oceanfront suite, and the rooms were on the older side, but the bathroom looked recently renovated. 2. The rooms would be dirty: Our room was not spotless. I asked that it be cleaned again on arrival and a few times again after the maid was done, but they cleaned up quickly, and their attitude was great - therefore this was not a negative. 3. The food would be terrible - since I was with two small kids and a very picky husband, I was really worried about this one. We were pleasantly surprised by the varied selection. Grilled chicken and fish were tender, moist and tasty, fresh quacamole, salads, rice, etc, my kids were very satisfied. My husband was too! This was a huge improvement to Beaches, where the kids menu consisted of chicken nuggets and fries. I was initially upset that we were only \"allowed\" 3 specialty restaurants, but it turned out to be more than enough and we really enjoyed eating at the buffet the other times. For specialty restaurants, it was a little hit and miss - at the steakhouse I had a perfect steak, but the steaks my husband and one of our friends ordered were like rubber. We ate at the Japanese restaurant twice. The first time we had the only female chef, and although her tricks were not mindblowing, the food was good, the second time we got more antics but dry food, so I guess you may have a different view depending on what you want more! 4. Strong waves and currents: This was partially true. We unfortunately had bad weather for all but 2 days of our stay. When the weather was calm and sunny, the ocean was calm, shallow and great for the kids. In more windy weather, the waves were downright dangerous. We didn't let the kids to go in those days. 5. Lack of entertainment: The shows put on every night were fine, and our kids really enjoyed the kids shows beforehand. 6. The beds would be rock hard: they were! We asked for pads, and they helped a bit, but it definitely not sleeping on a feather top! 7. Poor service: The service was great overall! we found people generally to be very helpful, smiling and willing to help - we tipped all the time as well - I don't think it helped get the good service, but was a nice way to show your appreciation for the hard work. Our kids liked all the animals on the property, and almost every morning the peackocks would be out walking in front of our room, it was very nice. Really appreciated the Star Friends, they were great with our kids and showed them a good time at the kids shows. Our direct comparisons to this are really only the Ritz at Naples and Beaches at Turks and Caicos. If you have to have a certain room type, you may be dissapointed, but the service here was great, and with the all inclusive you were not feeling nickel and dimed like you do sometimes at the Ritz properties.

When the 8 guests from Manchester arrived on 6/12/10 courtesy of flight TCX 234K a reception staff primed and ready for action would have been appreciated after a delayed 11 hour flight and a transfer time in excess of two hours from the airport. Alas, there was only one person on reception and when reinforcements arrived to check us in it was obvious arrangements were not in place for our visit. Rooms seemed to be getting allocated on the spot and that wasn't done with very well with two of the party being told to wait as there was not a room available. As for us, we had been booked to stay in the Quetzal. Imagine our surprise when we were told we were in Tucan. We were delighted! We actually wanted to be there anyway but this wasn't an option in the Thomas Cook brochure!! This decision was only on the basis that Tucan seems to have better scores than Quetzal on this site! ROOM We had requested high accommodation in blocks 23/24 (Quetzal) based on other reviewers feedback but ended up in block 18 on the first floor on the Tucan side with a Panoramic view of a pink block in the neighbouring Sandos hotel and some trees. Cant really complain about the location, it was right next to Tucan lobby/bar/restaurant. Okay, it was as far from the beach as you just about get The beds were twin rather than single king but the room was adequate for a fortnights stay. Toilet was a bit small but it had a large walk in shower. It would do, and we unpacked and made ourselves at home. People have complained about the firmness of the beds! We thought they were really comfy and having seen the condition foam supplements that some people requested .... Next morning we went to the welcome meeting, just us I'm afraid, and the tour rep seemed a bit concerned at our plight and keen to relocate us to Quetzal! But unless we were going to be offered something considerably better (which it didn't look like was going to happen) we elected to stay. And we did. And that really was the end of any gripes I have about the Iberostar. Any other complaints I had about the adventure were totally outwith the managements control! ISSUES Might as well get them off my chest.....it was kinda cool at night in the first week! Two things I didn't pack, long sleeve shirts and jumpers. Cant believe I have holiday pics of us wearing the fleeces we left England in, at night. In Mexico!! Had a 24hr flu type bug but cant blame that on the hotel either I suspect and worst of all, we had a bag stolen. But this was on the bus from Playa del Carmen up to Cancun. Put the bag in the overhead rack and when we went to get off...it was gone! Be careful if using public transport!!!!!! So....moans out of the way, what about the stay? It was really enjoyable. Reception excepted the staff were very helpful and service excellent despite the accommodation being fully taken and the place being very busy. Will need to go back, never yet ventured into the pool (or the swim up bar) didn't really take in the evening entertainment either and I am sure there are a few cocktails on the menu that I missed out on! Plus we never did go to sports bar/discoteca Mascara. Our body clocks just didn't make up the time difference for a late night! BARS The cocktails is an area I give the staff much appreciation. Although there is a list they regularly made up drinks not on the list, no questions asked. One observation I would make is that waitress ordered drinks were of a lesser strength than going up to bar and ordering them. Sitting at the bar and drinking was potentially damaging to your health. Offered a Mexican flag shot by one bar man we soon became partial to them !! Our one drink order disappointment was they didn't do Irish coffee but it was suggested cappuccino and baileys as an alternative. Became rather partial to them to!! Wonder if Iberostar will foot rehab bill! The bars on both sides of the hotel are mirror images of each other and each night you will get either Mr Guitar man or Keyboard wizard and they swap side the next evening. A bit more variety in the bar entertainment wouldn't have gone amiss as the tunes were largely the same each night. In our experience the Tucan had the livelier bar when we were there. We sparingly visited the entertainment area but didn't experience any issues with service here or on the beach where there were a couple of bar areas including in the Uxmal restaurant. If you were feeling really decadent then there was always waitress service on the beach. If you like to drink you will not have too many gripes here! RESTAURANTS And so to the food. Cant really disagree with most other comments. The specialist restaurants really are not that special so Iberostar could perhaps raise the bar here. If you didn't go to any of them then you really didn't miss very much. I wouldn't disagree with anyone who says that the buffets are better than five theme restaurants. If you have experience of similar specialist eateries in other hotels then you will be under whelmed I suspect. They are adequate and the chance to buy a wine that wasn't house was welcome. Not many have rated the Italian but I found the food most tasty in here and the steak at La Marimba highly rated. The revamped Uxmal tropical restaurant was perhaps the poorest of the five. The meal that exceeded my expectations was the breakfast with a vast selection of everything you could ever want. I normally steer clear of cooked breakfasts but had a sneaky mouthful of sausage on first day and found it to be rather tasty for a holiday hotel. The poor soul at the melon/fruit counter certainly had to work hard for their money as demand was substantial! And the choices of freshly squeezed fruit juices was impressive. I am pleased to confirm that the Iberostars pass my World Famous Orange Juice Test! LEISURE ACTIVITY Mexico has a wide range of leisure activities these days ranging from historical to theme parks. We had been a couple of times before so our agenda this time was relax relax and relax. We spent most of our day time on the beach venturing up to the Cozumel buffet for lunch which was more civilised than the frantic atmosphere of the junk food providing Uxmal next to the beach. At night we took the ten minute walk to the Playacar chopping centre to break the evening up or the longer 30 minute walk into Playa de Carmen itself, have a couple of drinks then get a 50 peso taxi back. We checked out Cozumel and Cancun but wouldn't rush back to either. Every retailer in the land seems desperate to get you inside to buy their wares. It gets really irritating after a while. CONCLUSION AND TIPS A few tips and hints Sunloungers with umbrellas were at a premium on the beach when we were there. I went down after 7.30am a couple of days and struggled to find two loungers. Gotta get up earlier folks. The hotel give you a notice on arrival discouraging lounger reservation but don't seem to police this. Additional fold up umbrellas can be obtained from towel hut though. Our room was cleaned every day before 11am bar one. I suspect this was because I used the please make up room notice each day. Shower as early as possible in evening, after 1800 hrs the water got tepid in our experience. At lunchtime La Marimba steakhouse restaurant next to the pool is also open. It is a lot less frenetic than Uxmal and you can relax more and enjoy your meal in comparative peace. Most of the blocks lack a decent view and the ones on the beach will cost, for sure. So it really comes down to location in relation to what you want and noise levels. If you are in blocks 16 or 17 facing Sandos I think you will experience inconvenience form their generators.

We used Exeltur transfer from Cancun Airport to the Tucan. They have the best transfer prices that we found. Eddie Clarke (owner) was waiting for us at the airport holding a sign up with our name. Eddie and the drivers were very professional and on time. What I like about Exeltur was that they didn't pick us up 4 hours prior to our departure, which most of transfer companies do and then you sit at the Airport. Now on to my review about the Tucan. The resort is Fabulous and the staff is simply awesome. My wife and I traveled with our two boys, 21 and 19. We booked two rooms next to each other. When we arrived we were told that they were over booked didn't have two rooms next to each other as per our request. Before I could say a word, they quickly told us that they gave us a complementary upgrade to the Presidential Suite. The room was unbelievable. Ocean front with a view of Cozumel from our large Balcony. I would guess that the suite was over 1200 square ft. The service was top notch. The staff at the Tucan will work their tails off for you. Room service was good and our house keeper was great. She always kept our refrigerator stocked with beer. I always left a trip for the house keeper as she worked so hard to keep our large room so nice. We had no problems making reservations at the restaurants. We spent 9 days which entitled us three reservations. However you can also book last minute additional reservation from cancellations. Even if they are fully booked, don't hesitate to ask the hostess at the restaurants. If someone doesn't' show they will try to get you in. A $5.00 tip helps, it worked for us. The steak house was my favorite and the buffet was always good. The grounds are amazing and my wife enjoyed looking for the Monkeys in the morning. The night life is a family setting. The disco was quiet, but Playa del Carment is a 50 peso taxi fare away. Beach volleyball was a fun activity. The dive shop at the Tucan was expensive. They wanted $170 per person for a discovery dive. We walked next door and booked the same dive from Scuba Caribe for $99. The beach is beautiful so you will not be disappointed. We traveled to Tulum and Akumal via the Colectivo buses. The bus drivers were friendly and very helpful. The cost is about 35 peso per person. This is our second trip to the Mexico Riviera.

Food was excellent - their are different restaurants and you can have 5 over 2 weeks and you have to make your reservation. Was going to use the spa but didnt bother as it was very expensive $900 for foot massage - got my bf to do it for free instead :o). The markets near nice walk you can either walk road way or the beach which does take bit longer but much nice view on the beach. You can get a ferry to Cozumel from playa car market which is 260 pesos each way well worth a trip.

We went to tulum, the water park and went snorkelling which was amazing get a underwater camera!! Zipling was a good experience too - try it!! Have a great time and enjoy.. wish I was their. :o). Also the adapter plugs you need are American style flat pins - it does say you need to wear long trousers and men shirt with sleeves to restaurant meals but some did not adhere to dress code but I would just to be on the safe side.

Its a nice resort with excellent service providers. The drinks were plentiful, the room was kept very clean and the wait staff were excellent.

The beach is gorgeous with plenty of seating and if you can get shade you can borrow an umbrella. The 10 kids in the group were very happy with the trip, the pool is great, the animals sell the place. Its very safe and the kids wandered a lot. The best: The buffets were good and the beach snack bar was terrific with burgers, hot dogs and ice cream. The room service was great too. The bars were quick and good. The worst: The towel thing is really annoying, why not just give us towels? They are not that nice, nobody would steal them. The restaurant reservations were a pain. I emailed over a week in advance and could not get anything before 8:30pm and yet others got earlier reservations once they arrived with more people then us (we split up for dinner). This rubbed me the wrong way since we have young children. The spa is absurdly priced, $150 for just a pedicure? Really? I expected expensive but this made us not use the spa at all.

We still enjoyed ourselves and had a nice time. We've stayed in Iberostar resorts before and always were so impressed with the cleanliness, staff, food, etc. This was the first five-star resort I've stayed at but it did not seem as nice as others we've stayed at with lesser ratings. The hotel staff told me the hotel was full though, so I think that may have contributed to some of the issues. I can't say for sure, but just too many people could have been the biggest problem. The beach was so beautiful and we enjoyed it so much particularly early in the day until it got packed. The weather was cooperative. We enjoyed meeting a variety of guests from other places and made some wonderful new friends, as well as fitting in some much-needed family time, sports, etc. There is a small man-made reef a short walk down the beach and we enjoyed snorkeling there each day. It was fun to shop in the evenings at the vendors set up between resorts. The shows in the evening were fun and the Star Friend did a fun set of activities each evening for little kids. She was very sweet and great with them. Two of us got food poisoning mid-trip and spent the better part of a day throwing up. Later in the trip, I saw kitchen staff refilling the empty (dirty) guacamole dish and refilling the pico di gallo the same way at the buffet instead of removing the dirty dish and figured that might have been a practice that could contribute to food-borne illness. This aside, there was a lot of choice for meals and the food was good. Everyone was able to find food they really enjoyed at every meal. Food was available during the whole day. Service during meals was sporadic, however, there was a fellow at the beach restaurant who was super every time we ate there. The pizza at the beach restaurant was delicious and we went for it almost every time. We loved the meal and service we had at the steak restaurant - thank you to Daniel and his staff :) Service by the pool for drinks was great. The bartender in the lobby bar was fast and very fancy as he made drinks! We tipped all staff regularly as they seemed to be doing what they could to make it great for everyone in spite of being overloaded. The resort itself is beautiful. It was so packed with people though that it was a bit of an amusement park atmosphere. It became noticeable that every day we constantly saw and heard children crying and screaming - at the ocean, in the restaurants, by the pool, outside our rooms, etc. In addition, lots of kids were not supervised around the pool and spent their days in large groups running among the beach chairs, etc. where families were having their own time. We noticed groups of kids at the lobby bar in the evening, again unsupervised and loud. At other Iberostars, the \"Star Friends\" (or their parents!) have kept the kids busy and made sure everyone was having fun, but they didn't seem to be around, except to provide the contests at one end of the pool. The most hysterical thing about that was one evening when we went to the main buffet for dinner, there was an evaluation survey being undertaken by a group possibly employed by the resort and it was the only time we saw \"Star Friends\" doing their usual \"working\" of the crowd and talking with families, etc. In fact, we couldn't get away from them as they has positioned theymselves at the ends of the walkways and the entrance to the buffet striking up conversation with all passersby about going to the show that evening. The animals and birds in the resort are beautiful. We enjoyed walking through the resort which has a jungle atmosphere and the kids were thrilled to be able to see the monkeys. Unfortunately the monkeys also pooped on our balcony and this was not cleaned up over the week which meant we did not use our balcony. In addition, pathways around the resort were not kept clean and had a variety of animal feces which we had to watch out not to walk in. The staff seemed to be cleaning parts of walkways sometimes, but there was no routine cleaning. Another downside was a strong smell of sewage which seemed to crop up at different points throughout the resort and garbage that was left on the beach overnight, in the ash trays, etc. At other Iberostars, there is a \"refreshing\" of the resort that seems to happen overnight where every morning everything is clean - not the case here. Our rooms were identical to rooms we've had in other Iberostar resorts. Very pretty, clean and comfortable. There was always a beautiful towel arrangement on the beds made by the team that was cleaning rooms and without exception they did a nice job. I often see people write in their review that the beds were hard - yes, they are but that has never stopped me from having a great sleep. What did stop us from sleeping was the regular racket in the hallways over the course of the night. Drunk people at all hours, yelling, slamming doors, etc., and every night. We eventually got ear plugs and that solved it. The front desk staff were just wonderful. They were helpful and kind. We appreciated their competence and happy attitude. The concierge was great and helped us get a taxi to the airport. Orlando was cooking in various places and was always smiling and nice to our family. So, I'm really not sure what to rate this as, only because I think due to the volume of guests this resort was overloaded.

Just got back from spending a week at the IB Quetzal. It was a family trip, and our first time ever to PDC. The Beach at the Quetzal/Tucan was great! The towel game was annoying, but the beach itself was wonderful. The resort is big, but not too big. Really enjoyed the strolls through the jungle at night on our way to dinner. The rooms were simple and the beds comfortable. I had read previously that they had very hard beds at this hotel. Both of our rooms had matress toppers already in place, and I found them very comfortable. The water tempature tended to fluctuate from morning to night. For some reason, we couldn't get a hot shower in the evening, but it was fine in the morning. Go figure. There were virtually no insects anywhere to be seen. Must be a seasonal thing I guess! There were, however the cutest little rodents called \"agoutis\" all over the place! They look like guinea pigs with long legs, and they just kind of saunter through the brush munching on leaves and other vegetation. Neat little creatures! The Staff at the IB were great. Housekeeping was excellent as were the pool and beach staff. Special tip of the hat to Omar at the front desk. He helped me several times, and gave me great advice on resturants. Also, Carla at the Front Desk was very cheerful and helpful. The food was very middle of the road, but then so was the price we paid for an AI. We enjoyed the buffet. It had plenty of variety and was very convenient. If we stayed longer than one week, I would probably tire of it though. We were only able to try two of the ala carte resturaunts. The Japanese and the Carribean. Neither were anything to write home about. the Japanese was just plain bad IMO. I have eaten at many modest Japanese Teppenyaki/Sushi resturaunts, and this place was not even close. The sushi was almost inedible, the rice was acttually crunchy! And no sauces served with seafood or steak. The other place was ok, but not very memorable. I discovered it was far preferrable to take a cheap cab ride to 5th Ave and eat somewhere like La Parilla. That place rocked! Don't let my food review carry too much weight though. Overall we really loved our stay at the Quetzal, and would probably go back.

Here's a general list of pros/cons - and to me the \"cons\" were really not that negative or didn't matter to us. Pros: -Super clean and spacious rooms, wonderful maid service (new towel animal everyday - very cute) -We left a small tip for the maid every day and our minibar was restocked everyday even though there's a sign saying that it will be stocked every other day. -Excellent service, everyone goes out of their way to say hello, assist you and help you with anything that you need. We arrived very late Friday night and had a problem with our key to our room (none of them would work). Since we were going to bed, we said we'd take care of it in the morning. We woke up, went to the front desk, we were told to go to breakfast. By the time we were done eating, we went back to the reception and our new key cards (this time working ones) were waiting for us. I believe there was something wrong with the lock itself on our door, but they worked on it while we were at breakfast as to not disturb us while we were in our room. -AMAZING beach! From what I understand, the beach reclamation project finished in January of 2010 (from all the damage to the reef/beaches from the last big hurricane). Water was crystal clear, was very calm and still quite warm for this time of year. We only had some small waves on our last morning there. Nice, big and very wide/long sandy beach. -Beautiful pool, although we are ocean people so we did not use it. Cons: -The hotel was FULL! This was no fault of theirs, but because of the time of year we went (over holiday break) there were A LOT of families and kids. I will admit, we've been spoiled because we normally stay at Adults Only resorts or smaller boutique hotels/inns, but for the price, this couldn't be beat. -Due to the hotel being at maximum capacity, it was next to impossible to get a beach chair unless you were up at the crack of dawn (not my thing while I'm on Holiday). We didn't mind lying on our towels on the sand, but it would have been nice not having to snatch up a chair the second it became available and/or feel like you might be \"stealing\" someone's chair. I did like that the hotel gives you a little \"welcome\" packet with all the information, etc. in it. Within this there is a note about not \"reserving\" chairs, but people do it anyway, and they do not seem to enforce this (how can they?). -Beds were very hard - this is Mexico, what can you do ;o) I prefer a more firm mattress though, so this was not a problem. -They need to find a better way to do the dinner reservation system - we had to wait on line one morning for 45 minutes to make our dinner reservations. I understand why they do the reservations - staying here while it was at full capacity, there definitely wouldn't be enough room for everyone. However, it would have been nice to have more than 2 \"guaranteed\" reservations. -One thing that I thought was odd; there was a basket with tea, coffee, etc. but no coffee maker or way to heat water. Regardless of these small things I really don't have any real \"complaints\". (It's always easier to remember the negative things than the positive). The resort was much more beautiful than I expected and they do a wonderful job of keeping the beach/public areas very clean. There is a \"jungle\" in the middle with all sorts of animals/birds/monkeys/iguanas, etc. It was very nice to stroll through on the way to the beach as well as at night when the paths were dimly lit. The location is great....far enough away from town/public beaches, but close enough to walk if you wanted to. We took taxis a couple times, but we rented a car the last few days which was great. We drove down to Tulum and Akumal, very relaxing and nice to get away from the resort. The buffet food was your average all inclusive resort food...nothing special, but by no means was it terrible. There was a big selection and they tried to change it up a little night to night so we didn't find it that boring. We tried the steakhouse and the Japanese restaurants, both were very good. I would definitely recommend this hotel to families - super family friendly! If you are a younger couple who doesn't mind the occasional screaming kid (haha) than I would recommend it to you as well. I don't think we would stay here again, but it was really great and the price couldn't be beat. We normally don't travel at this time of year because of the crowds and the prices are always higher, but the cost of staying here was one of the best deals I found for an all-inclusive the week we went. I will try to post pictures later, as well as they layout/map of the resort so if you do decide to book here, you can request a particular building if you want. We were in building 19 which was all the way in the back. At first I thought this would be a little problematic/a pain, but it wasn\u2019t that bad. It was right next to the lobby, fairly close to the restaurants and about a 5 minute (leisurely) stroll down to the beach. It was really nice the last few days when we rented our car because we got to park practically right outside our room. All in all, it was a great vacation!

Iberostar Tucan/Quetzal (they are the same hotels in a large complex with one on the left and the other on the right of the complex) is a good choice for those vacationing in Playacar (private ring road of resorts south of the downtown Playa Del Carmen). The resort was very clean and welcoming. There were no peddlars on the private beach and we did not have any sales pitches. We opted for the all inclusive package and would say that it was worth it given the hassle of taking a taxi into town everytime you want to eat. The specialty restaurants are good (our favorite being the Japanese Teppanyaki one) and need a reservation. You should make reservations as soon as you check in since th early slots fill up quickly. The daily buffet can get very repetitive and options for vegetarians are limited to pizza, basic pasta, bread, rice and salad. Mixed drinks are good and the beer is limited to a basic \"light\" beer. We had two young kids (2 1/2 yr old and a 6 month old) and thus did not venture into any tours and activities. There seem to be plenty of things to do within the resort on any given day (water sports, aerobics, yoga, soccer, volleyball, kayaking etc.) coupled with a kids show and normal show at night every day. Even though the hotel rules say that you are not allowed to reserve a hammock or beach chair, everybody seemed to be breaking the rules and putting their blue towels in the morning to reserve a spot. Thus, if you are not a early bird and get to the beach or the pool around 10 or 10 30, you might not be able to find any spots. I am not sure what the solution to this problem is except participating in the problem itself and reserving a beach chair! The mini jungle in the middle of the resort has all sorts of birds and small animals that the kids might enjoy. Further, it is right next to the buffer restaurants so that you can't miss it.", "Date": "December 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary", "Title": "\u201cVery good resort\u201d", "Author": "northern_prairie", "ReviewID": "UR90762827", "Content": "In one sentence we loved it! Airport After you pass the customs you enter a \"time share sharks\" hall. There are lots of people claiming that they work for the airport and are concerned about one's transportation. In fact they try to get you to a time share presentation or some other kind of membership. I heard that these presentations do not take 90 minutes as they say but rather half a day. This year there were more sales representative compared to the last year and very persuasive as far as it goes to be airport officers. Ignore them and leave the building, unless you want to pay with your time for some tickets to Chichen Itza or other attractions. Grounds Perfect. There is a jungle with live harmless animals in the middle of the twin resorts Iberostar Tucan and Iberostar Quetzal and main attraction for the kids. To find the monkeys look up in the trees and follow a terrible cry/roar of the male monkeys.The twin resorts were a little small for my taste but I discovered the easiness to be close to everything. Also it is about 3km off Playa del Carmen along the beach or along the Playacar road. And about 2 km from Sam's club... if you would like to buy cheaper alcohol to take home. Room Our room was in block 11. Reasonable size with big terrace. No bathtub, which we prefer. Close to pool, beach and 2 restaurants. The only problem with the room was the key. We had to fix it about 5 times. Although it was not close to cell phone or camera it lost its code every 3rd day. The room has no charge safe. The water in the fridge is replenished daily (I do not care for soft drinks so as long as there is water we were fine). We left tips for the maid who seemed to be in charge for the water bottles too. A pillow top for the mattresses is a must. Require if missing. Food There is a huge selection for everyone. We did not find any trouble finding food for us. All the a-la-cart restaurants except the Japanese Bonsai have buffet style appetizers which I find offer bigger selection of such as opposed to ordering only an appetizer. Drinks The barmen would try to put more ice in your drink but if you ask for less ice or a certain brand name of alcohol you will get it. I did not have to wait for my drinks or to speak Spanish to get their attention. I like Iberostar house wines better than the ones of Grand Bahia Principe. Weather A little bit colder than last year at the same time. This time we had temperatures ranging from 17 to 28 deg C. Ocean and pools The ocean was calm most of the time. The beach is cleaned from sea weeds immediately after wind. No stones or corrals. Relatively fine sand and warmer water than the pool (The pools are colder, but still OK; cleaned daily or sometimes more often.). There is drinks service ... for the lazy ones around the pool and along the beach. There are a few intrusive businesses along the beach and pool. One is a scuba diving and snorkeling lady trying to persuade everybody to go on a trip. Other are the spa people who go looking for customers and finally there is para sailing who go only along the beach to offer their services. Say \"No\" if you are not interested and they will not bug you... except the first one. To get a nice spot around the pool or on the beach one has to be up at 7-8am. We used the catamaran almost daily and we loved it. My kids, 6 and 9 years and I learned to kayak. Animation and Entertainment teams The best so far. There are a few guys, Ivan, Alexis and Isac who are very athletic break-dansers who like to perform whenever they get a chance. Very entertaining, especially for my 6 year old boy. Daily there are dancing classes teaching Merengue or Salsa. The teachers are very good so pay attention and learn. The night program starts quite late at 9:30pm and lasts to 10:30-11pm. After that there is live music and dancing till 11:30pm. I wish the program started early. At the end after dancing till 11;30pm we felt quite tired. During airgun practice at 10:30 am there is usually only one gun so it is very slow to get to one's turn. Iberostar do not rent out bicycles which is quite disappointing. They offer two tours daily. The morning one is at 10am to Playa del Carmen and the afternoon one is at 3pm, around Playacar. Disco Mascara Very good except for the cigarette smoke. Appart from that you will hear the current dance music (it is not only Latin as in Grand Bahia Principe Hacienda) Rent-a-car In Iberostar Quetzal lobby there is a Thrifty desk. It is quite expensive with 100% insurance. However it is comparable to the Playa del Carmen prices from Hertz and Budget (for less insurance). About $80/day for an automatic car, Nissan Tiida. (In the town there were people offering rent-a-car, but we did not listen to their offers. We wanted full insurance.) Despite the rent-a-car price it is still cheaper to rent a car and go on a private family trip than to use the ones offered in the lobbies.

The grounds and buildings are exquisitely maintained, the staff is very friendly and take great pride in their work. The location can't be beat--just a couple of minutes from the heart of Playa, but set apart by the jungle-like grounds and animals. We awoke each morning to the sounds of birds and monkeys, went to the beach and set up our chairs/umbrellas (I know, it's annoying that everyone \"saves\" chairs, but it's the system so you have to follow it or expect to sit on sand), headed to breakfast, and then hit the beach. Beach drink service was wonderful and frequent. The water is gorgeous, but if you want a more secluded beach, just walk South a few minutes and you'll have the water to yourself. Three of us did have a day of tummy trouble (we think it was food-related, but not sure what), but they have a doctor on staff 24 hours a day and she came right to our rooms with medicine, so we we didn't miss much. The buffets were plentiful and varied in choices, but the quality was ordinary at best. We dined at the Japanese, Italian, and Steak restaurants. They were all fair, but the steak was the best in our opinion. We went \"off campus\" to Alux, a fascinating restaurant in a cave, for a great meal one night. You're definitely not going to starve! The girls in our group all got massages in the palapa hut on the beach--so relaxing. We arranged a private van and driver for eight hours ($200) through Facundo, who works the beach selling tours and arranging condo sales presentations. Our driver, Mariano, was wonderful and took us to Tulum, where we hired a tour guide (so glad we did--we wouldn't have had any appreciation of what we were seeing without it). Then he took us to Pollo Brujo for great chicken and tortillas, then to one of the many roadside cenotes (to check it off our list), then shopping. Our last night was Christmas Eve and the staff worked very hard to put on a much nicer dinner with lobster, shrimp, tenderloin, etc., but like all the meals served buffet style, it was just fair. The decorations and ice sculptures were lovely. We really, really liked this resort and recommend it highly for families with tweens or teens.

Service is above average. We did experience a few mess-ups but those seems like exceptions to the general rule. Room was being made up every day, the territory is mostly clean and tidy, buffets, restaurants, bathrooms and beach are clean and we saw them being cleaned up all the time. Here are a few examples of below-average service: check-in took 40 minutes; our tennis reservation for 8 pm almost didn't work out once when the fitness center staff forgot to bring the rackets and balls to the front desk (since the fitness center is closed at 6pm), and the front desk lady was very reluctant to fetch a security guard to open the fitness center and get us the equipment; but she did it and we got to play after all; on the departure day I had to call the front desk 3 times to get someone to bring our luggage to the lobby to be on time for the shuttle departure. An example of above average service: our 4yo broke a glass in our room and the service lady came immediately and cleaned everything up; we also lost one of the towels and were forgiven for it. The room was nice, with a large window and balcony. Bathroom was also very nice. Air conditioner worked as expected. There was no DVD player in the room but TV worked fine. Sound-proof quality of the walls and window was rather low, so we heard birds from the outside and neighbors passing by our door as well. Our room was on the ground floor, and next time I would take the 3rd floor where there is less traffic, especially late at night. The mattresses were pretty hard, and even though I slept OK on them, I did notice them; my wife complained as well. Hotel is really a collection of small very beautifully painted 3-story buildings, all within a 5 minute walk to the beach. Territory is very nice, with a mini forest in the middle, with various birds and small animals in it (monkeys, turtles, iguanas, etc). With monkeys and other animals on the territory one could expect some traces of them all other the place but only once did I see... er... some by-products of animal (I hope it was animal!) life on the foot path. I imagine they were quickly cleaned up. The hotel has a few large swimming pools but we never swam in them because the water was too cold (the hotel should really invest in the water heaters!) The air temperature during our stay was upper 70s - lower 80s and the water in the ocean was much warmer than in the pool for some reason. Throughout that week the pool was mostly empty even though the weather was rather windy and the waves were very big so not too many people were in the ocean either. The drinks that the resort offers are perfectly adequate (we are not big on that), although I have to say their apple juice (the drink of choice of our 4yo) is nothing like the apple juice in the US. The buffets are very very good; the restaurants are mostly good (Japanese - OK, Caribbean - so-so, Italian - the best!!!). The entertainment (both kids and adults shows) are lousy - just like I expected. We also took a walk to a nearby town, Playa del Carmen, and visited a couple of tourist trap souvenir shops but there was nothing interesting there (shop for your souvenirs at the Cancun airport - it's much more convenient if maybe a little more expensive). We played tennis a few times, the 8 pm time slot is always free, the courts are lit, and you only need to make sure that the fitness center person leaves rackets and balls at the reception for you. Hotel offers wireless internet in the lobby (for pay, I didn't use it), and there are 2 computers in the lobby where you cab buy some time online (I used that). The only catch there is the time you buy is valid on the same day only. Prices were reasonable. We haven't done any tours so no opinion there. I liked best the restaurants and buffets.

We've never been disappointed. Food quality has gone downhill a bit, but is still good enough. Never went hungry. The location is unique and lush. The jungle trail is not something we've seen at any other resort.It really gives the place a special feeling. The Star Friends team is friendly--and they put on one hell of a show at night. Some of them have been there for years. Very polished performers. The Star Band is excellent as always. Lorenzo on the guitar was excellent. The rooms were clean--a bit worn, but it IS a very busy hotel. Lots of use over the years. It is beginning to show in some spots, but don't let that or anything else dissuade you from booking here. We have been back 8 times--and we plan to keep coming back. The beach is the best in the Cancun area. No rocks. No weeds. Crystal clear water. Beautiful, wide beaches. They have been rebuilt after the hurricanes of the last few years nearly eroded them away. The beach is back--and more beautiful than ever. The spa service is excellent. AND--the spa facilities are open for all to use without additional charge. The massages and treatments are not free. But they are wonderful if you like that sort of thing. I do. But free use of the hot tub, steam room, and cool tub is a big plus to me. Lately, at other resorts I see a trend toward charging a fee for every VISIT to the spa--whether you got a massage or not. Not the case here. Very important to me. Now some negatives....One big one---beach chairs. If you don't get down to the beach early each day--you will not get a chair. It seems a simple enough thing for the hotel to acquire and put out more chairs when the resort is full. For some reason, they do not. Don't understand it. It would make such a big difference for guests. The spa gets heavy use, but does not get heavy cleaning. The hot tub had visible dead skin crusted on it. Very gross. Easy enough to remedy, I think. We have been there 8 times. We told the desk clerk that it was our 8th visit in hopes that maybe we would get some kind of favorable room assignment. Did not happen. Our first room was on the outside of the 2800 building an the Qetzal side. 3rd floor. Directly overlooking the loading dock for the hotel next door. All day and all night trucks rolling in and out. Terrible view too. Trucks all beeping when they back up. 3 in the morning, 10 a night. All around the clock. And the 24 hour opportunity to hear empty beer kegs rolled up and down the loading ramp. Lovely sound. Exciting too. Never failed to wake me up. We asked for a transfer--and eventually got it. Had to wait three days though. You'd think the staff would know these are not great rooms in that building--and would therefore treat repeat customers to better room assignments when they check in--not when they have to raise a stink about getting a room change. Avoid the 2800 building on the Quetzal side.Unless you hate sleep. Lastly, one big positive. They have a flamenco/classical guitarist playing in the lounges at night by the name of Luis Laclette. Do not miss his show. He is spectacular. He does not sing. He has no band--just himself. But his playing is breathtaking. I watched him 4 of the nights we were there instead of going to the main show at the auditorium. I LOVE the big shows, but gladly gave them up to watch Luis. I'm sure we'll be back again. We have begun to think of the place as \"ours\". Don't let the negatives above scare you away. Very few people leave this place unsatisfied.

The entire chain just does a great job. I am shocked by some of the negative reviews. I am probably the most nit-picky person that I know, and I could find very little to complain about. Here are a few helpful hints and highlights: POOL: Amazing and clean, but cold. And the \"hot tub\" in the middle is cold. Don't jump in the water at night hoping it is warm. You will be disappointed. RESTAURANTS: Seriously great. No complaints. Italian - my favorite. The pasta noodles are homemade and thick. Yum. And the appetizers are awesome. Get the lasagna or tortellini. Mexican - ok. Be ready to eat beef. Tropical - great. The grouper was fabulous. Japanese - fun. The food is good too. Please though, if you order beef, don't change your mind after the food is made and ask to have some of that chicken you see. You are depriving someone who ordered chicken of her chicken! Lunch - For lunch, we found that the beach buffet on the Quetzal side was always eerily empty compared to the one on the Tucan side. LOVED THAT. After watching way too many people lick their fingers and then go back for more...I was grateful to find something with less traffic. RESERVATIONS - we got them for EVERY night we were there. Email the hotel before you go and request your guaranteed ones for the weekend nights, when the hotel is most full. Then, when you get there, visit the reservations desk during their MORNING HOURS (seriously, don't go at 6pm hoping to get a reservation for 6:30) and be flexible with your meal times. We requested reservations for every night the first day we were there (aside from those we booked). We ate everywhere we wanted to and the girl helping us didn't care how many we already had. Print out the email they will send you back with your confirmation for dinners before you go. Piece of cake. ROOM SERVICE: Yikes. Took (NO JOKE) four hours to get a pizza. Called after the first hour, was told they came and no one answered. Weird. Never left the room. Then after hour two called again and was told they would make a new one. At hour three chicken nuggets were delivered. Confusion ensued. Asked to please have our pizza (which I had ordered in Spanish with perfect precision...so there shouldn't have been a problem). An hour later, a cold floppy (dare I say nasty) pizza came. Didn't order room service after that. ALCOHOL: Ok, they have great great GREAT brands...but the top shelf stuff is all hiding on the bottom shelf in cabinets. So if you would rather have Bombay instead of generic gin (same idea for all other liquor), you are going to have to ask. And then watch them make it. Don't order from a waitress, order at the bar. And no top shelf brands at the beach, you have to go to the lobby. Wish we would have discovered the bottom shelf sooner! I was pleasantly surprised by the house red wine. Much better than many I have had at all-inclusives. BEDS: Not that bad. Sheesh. Have another drink and ask for a foam topper. You will sleep like a baby. HEAT RASH: Ok, I don't want to get graphic here, but my friend and I got heat rash. Bad. And I have traveled a great many hot places with plenty of sun and humidity. Not sure what happened here. The reason I mention it is that the hotel pharmacy runs out of Benadryl frequently. And when you spend 15 bucks on hydrocortisone cream, then another 18 on pills from some pharmacist in town...you are going to be annoyed that you couldn't get Benadryl until your last day. Because that will take care of your problem in about 5 minutes. So stock up on Benadryl. Just in case. Few final thoughts: If you are eating food while getting food at the buffet, you are grossing people out. If you find it necessary to consistently lick your fingers while partaking in the goodness of a buffet, please bring hand sanitizer to said buffet. You are grossing people out. If you are coughing in the buffet, please cover your mouth and then use your other hand to scoop your food. Otherwise, it is your fault that people get sick at resorts. Watching your phlegm fly into the food...ew. If you are feeding the animals even though you aren't supposed to, it is possible that you might kill them, and make people mad (and it isn't fun watching you do it. please stop. it is a nature preserve, they feed the animals. do you want to buy the iberostar a new koi fish? probably not. look, take pictures, stop feeding. saw a poor bird who couldn't swallow the mountain of food he was given. geez).

Often smelled as sewer erupted somewhere. Grounds are not kept as it used to be. When we arrived - there was a gallon of purified water in the room, which lasted about 2 days and was never replenished, even after I asked several times. Drinking water bottles in the fridge were replaced once in a week. Sheets had some spots on them, don\u2019t even want to guess... as far as service from people working there in the bars and restaurants - I would give 6 stars - hard working always smiling and ready to serve. Beach was kind of messy too. Pool was cold, but because of the low 50-60 F temps at night. Overall was a nice vacation on the beach but we would not come back to this resort.", "Date": "December 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cincinnati, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cWet floors at hotel caused my wife to fall and fracture her wrist in two places\u201d", "Author": "bronson10", "ReviewID": "UR89516898", "Content": "The hotel's walkways leaked badly during rainy weather.

They said we needed to see the on-site doctor, we waited for him for about 45 minutes. He would'nt see us unless we paid him $190.00 cash, which we did, no receipt from him. While wwe were there they tried to get to sign paperwork that we caused the injury, not the wet floors that they failed to keep dry and safe. The doctor said we needed to go to the Hospital, I asked if they could take us since we had no idea where it was, they refused and we had to get a cab from the front of the hotel. When we got to the hospital, we had to use our American Express card for a charge of 10,000 pesos before she could be seen . A cast was put on her arm. We then had to get a cab back to the hotel. They should be ashamed of the way we were treated. I would never ever stay at this Hotel again. If you get hurt there you're in big trouble if you don't havea credit card or cash. They would let you die before helping. Think long and hard about using this Hoet or any of Iberostar in their chain. My wife had to have the cast removed once we returned home, because it was not installed correctly. This was a nightmare trip all because the hotel management failed to provide safe walk areas.

I would recommend asking for a top floor room. We had the top floor with a great view of the jungle, pool and a little slice of the ocean. The pool was beautiful and the ocean even better. We did wave riding every day and also woke up early to watch the sun rise of Cozumel. We only left the resort once and did not have any complaints. The staff was so kind and very attentive. If you stay on the Tucan side, you should walk over to the other side and through their side of the jungle - each has a slightly different feel. Even though this was one of the bigger resorts we have stayed at, we never felt overrun with people. We had plenty of room to spread out no matter where were. I contacted the resort directly ahead of time and requested a top floor room close to the beach and was very happy with our placement. I also let them know we were celebrating our wedding anniversary and we arrived to our room being available early and a special gift from the hotel.

We were looking for a nice place at a low price, and that is exactly what we got! Our rooms were nice, spacious, and well-kept (and the showers were amazing). We had jungle views and were able to get two adjoining rooms, which was great for us. The beach was fun -- it was pretty wavy when we were there so there were some \"red flag\" days we weren't allowed to do all of the water activities, but even then just sitting on the beach was great (and we could still swim in the pool of course). There are large rocks that protect some of the beach from the waves, which is nice for relaxing or taking small children in the water. Sometimes we were allowed to climb onto the rocks in deeper water, which was fun but a little dangerous as they were very slippery! Actually, watching people fall off the rock was endless entertainment! We never had any problem getting a chair on the beach and we were usually able to find an umbrella for shade. We went on the snorkeling trip, which took us on a boat ride to a reef (according to the guide, the 2nd largest reef in the world). There, we saw lots of fish, starfish, nice coral, and several sea turtles -- they swam right up to us! We also went on the excursion to Tulum. The process of getting there was very well-coordinated and easy to follow. The city was beautiful and actually, we got a very educational and interesting tour from the guide for about the first 30-45 minutes, although spending that much time in the hot sun was rough for us. After that, we were free to run around and take pictures and go down to the beach. There were iguanas all over that loved posing for pictures! There were some serious waves at the Tulum beach and lots of seaweed, but we had fun and got some really great pictures. My FAVORITE part of the resort was the wildlife. They have tucans, flamingos, koi, peacocks, and best of all -- wild monkeys that climbed through the trees and onto people's balconies. My LEAST FAVORITE part was the food at the buffet restaurant. It was pretty bland. However, the food at the seaside grill was fine and the a la carte restaurants were very good, so we didn't go hungry. We asked for a resort that was \"not a spring break\" type of place, and that is what we got. There is not much nightlife on the resort. The nightclub was usually empty and they played the same songs, in the same order, each night. The shows with the \"Star Friends\" were fine but not exactly a wild time. If you are looking for nightlife you'll probably want to check out places off the resort, which the Star Friends are happy to tell you about as I think they get paid extra for taking people to sponsored locations offsite. My observation was that the guests were mostly couples and families. I saw few single people and I think we were one of the only groups of friends there at the time. Overall, I'd say that this is not an ultra high-end luxury resort, but it is comfortable and nice.

When we eventually got settled but we could'nt get any reservations for dinner prior to 9:00pm for the rest of the week. This is a little late when you have kids. The buffet was ok but we prefer the dinners. When we went by the restaurants earlier we noticed numerous empty tables and we didn\u2019t understand why. When we spoke with other people that had the earlier seating\u2019s they said the restaurants were never full. \u2022 We were told by our travel agent that they were sending something to the room for our aggravation.

The agents there told me Best Day is never here, so back to our resort. It\u2019s now 10:00 am. Still no Lionel. He finally shows up at 10:15am. He was no help what so ever. He offered me nothing. His prices were no different than anyone else. As we are discussing things he continued to answer his phone. My frustration level was at its max by this point. It\u2019s now 11:00am and I walked away. More wasted vacation time, I never heard from him again.

The location is well situated from the main tourist area and easily accessible by taxi or a long leisurely walk. The food at the buffet was very good all week and there was lots of variety. For the a la carte restaurants the Japanese was the best. The Italian and Mexican restaurants were okay for the main course - their appetizer buffet area was actually better. The beach is extremely large and they provide sun umbrellas which is something I've never seen before and a wonderful touch. The hotel has a wildlife sanctuary that you pass through to access the beach and that perhaps takes a couple of days to get used to with all the little critters running around. After a few days you'll forget about them and they definitely won't harm you. The quality of the activity team is also something that I've never seen before. Their evening shows had a very high production quality in the main theatre. From a social point of view, the resort does have more of a family vibe. I was travelling with a fellow single friend and there definitely was a lack of fun singles to mingle with - but that was easily remedied by hanging out in town in the evenings. This is a small thing but notable - I was surprised that the main bar areas would pour international brand drinks without issue if you asked which is generally out of the norm at all-inclusives.

The pool is located very close to the beach and also to one of the restaurants The lobbies of both resorts and the shared entertainment areas are an easy stroll from one area to another. Beach and Pool service for drinks is a big plus, as is the availability of room service. The people we met were fun and friendly. The only negative was the hard mattress on the bed.

We stayed the week of Oct. 24 thru Oct. 31. The weather was terrific, highs of 87 daily, and only two brief showers, remnants of Hurricane Richard who thankfully stayed south of the Yucatan. The Tucan has not changed much in the 5 years we have been visiting, the rooms look identical to our first visit, the amenities have not changed, but it is still the Tucan, and that's the great thing about it. It is not the fanciest facility you will find in Playcar, and if that's all you are looking for, you could be disappointed. If you are looking for a relaxing atmosphere, exceptionally maintained building and grounds, then you will be fine here. The jungle area between the Tucan and Quetzel is very unique. Look for the little agoutis, the limurs, peacocks and of course the monkeys...they will definitely get your attention. We love the beach and spend most of our time there when we go. Without exception, the Tucan is the best resort along this stretch of the Riviera Maya for beach lovers. When you are on the beach, you are literally within 25 yards of a bar, a restaurant (open all day long) and the pool. All of the other resorts along this same stretch of beach are anywhere from 150 yards to 250 yards to their closest bars, restaurants and beaches. The Tucan has approximately 150 shaded palapas to enjoy, most of the other resorts leave you with little or no protection from the sun should you want it. I will say in fairness to the other resorts, they all now have wide beaches, due to a remarkable beach reclamation project that has taken place over the past couple of years, so the lack of beach area is no longer a problem at any of the resorts. The food has also not changed much in 5 years, except that for the past two years they have not had a lobster tail night at the buffet which they used to have on occasion, at least we have not seen it. The food does get redundant if you are there for several days, but unless you are extremely picky, you can always find something to fill you up. The breakfast is really good, and the restaurant at the beach offers food all day long, including grilled hamburgers and hot dogs at a stand outside, and many other offerings inside the restaurant. They also do an outside paella lunch once per week with entertainment. You always have the specialty restaurants, the Japanese (which is probably the best), the Steakhouse, the Mexican and the Italian. They are all good for a change of pace from the buffet. The pool is huge and also kept clean. The swim up bar was closed while we were there, but it could use some work. It seems as though they are noticing the complaints about the hard beds, we were going to order a mattress pad when we noticed that our bed now had a pillow top mattress which was very comfortable. Not sure if all rooms have this but thankfully, ours did. Some of the waiters and bartenders have been there all 5 years that we have been going there, and some of the peddlers who work the beach have also been there the whole time. Roberto can hook you up with some great Mexican Oakley sunglasses, and Antonia can provide you with some beautiful necklaces. These folks don't bother you unless you want to engage them, but we've actually become friends with these two folks and they are very nice people just trying to make a living and support their families. Tip the bartenders, waiters and maids, they do a nice job and you would tip them if you were at home. In closing, we always look for a reason to try somewhere else for a vacation, but we always come back here because we know what we are getting. It's like putting on an old shoe, it feels really comfortable. Disregard any negative reviews you read on here about the Tucan, and don't hesitate to book your stay with them.

Now on to the positives: beach was great and close to the hotel. this hotel is absolutely perfect for families and multi-generational families. i would not recommend for bachelor/bachelorette parties or for swinging singles. this is a nice family friendly happy resort. the pool is large and odd-shaped which allows one to get sun or shade. plenty of seats by pool or at ocean. food was americanized and fine. there were 2 places by the pool that always had ice cream available. kids felt safe there. staff walked by pool and beach to bring drinks. okay the best part of this resort has to be the jungle in the middle with the waterfalls and all the animals. it's like living at the zoo. i expected to see a couple animals, but they were everywhere. there were a dozen monkeys that were on people's balconies and jumping from roof to roof and putting on a show every am on the way to breakfast. they are small, but incredibly bone-chilling loud. there were also peacocks, chickens, iguanas, geckos, flamingos, goldfish pond, turtles, ducks, swans, agoutis, a raccon looking animal with a long tail, toucans, and a few other birds/animals that i couldn't identify. between all this excitement and the great beach and pool, i couldn't imagine a better rersort for families with children. this place is vibrant and colorful with a mexican feel. a cab ride to 5th ave. for all of us was only $5. my son had 7 donuts and french fries for breakfast one a.m. he thought he had died and gone to heaven. when we go back we will go at a cooler time of the year. the reason we chose this resort to begin with was it was one of the cheaper resorts with the best rating from tripadvisor. we are so pleased and like i mentioned i am difficult to please.", "Date": "November 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lancaster, PA", "Title": "\u201cThe Iberostar Tucan is Perfect for a Relaxing Week in the Sun.\u201d", "Author": "Nittannee", "ReviewID": "UR85479944", "Content": "We just got back from a trip October 23-30 at the Iberostar Tucan. We booked the trip with Apple Vacations and got a great deal direct out of Baltimore. From the moment we arrived at the resort, we knew we had made the right decision. We are already looking forward to going back! Our room was on the third floor of Building 13, facing towards the neighboring resort. This made for a great feeling of privacy while also allowing us to enjoy visits from the resident monkeys throughout the week. Our room was sparkling clean, and we were delighted that the resort had noticed our travel agent's note that we were celebrating our 10th anniversary, and had left a two swan-shaped towel decoration on the bed surrounded by red rose petals. Shortly after arrival in the room, we had a knock on the door with a delivery of a nice fruit basket as well. We quickly changed and left to explore the beach and pool area, which is absolutely wonderful. As a matter of fact, we ended up spending most of our time enjoying the beach and pool, rather than going on lots of the available excursions you can book. Highlights and traveler's tips: At the hotel, don't miss walking down the beach to the end on the right. Take along some water shoes or flip flops and your snorkeling gear, as there is a really nice sheltered area past the rocks where you can snorkel. It is beautiful there! The pools are awesome and the large one is 5' deep, so if you have kids bring along a float. There is also a shallow pool for the little kids. If you plan to snorkel, you can check out gear at the hotel for an hour per day. If you want to have more access to equipment, I recommend bringing your own. The hotel has a nice workout room with new equipment. The spa is also very nice - great jacuzzis and whirlpools that are free to use. Food and drink: We enjoyed drinks on the beach and having lunch at the pool restaurant. The grilled fish, rice and quacamole were spectacular. We ate at the Mexican restaurant our last evening and it was really good. The Japanese was nice as well, but the food was salty (as you will find in any Teppanyaki restaurant). Most evenings we ate at the dinner buffet, which was awesome and had a lot of choices. The breakfast buffet was also wonderful. The breakfast, lunch and dinner buffets are all in a large, open air area surrounded by pools of koi swimming ground amidst water fountains and tropical foliage. We enjoyed sitting and watching the fish while enjoying our meals. Rooms: The rooms are very comfortable, with big showers. The water in the bathrooms is not drinkable, but they provide you with a ton of bottled water to use. I recommend bringing your own blow dryer, especially if you have high-maintenance hair like me. The built-in ones are good for clearing the mirrors of fog. Also if you have a lot of clothes to hang, throw a few extra pants hangers in your suitcase. The room does have a small coffee maker. I brought along some packets of vanilla creamer and Starbucks Via, which was nice for first thing in the morning. The beds are extremely firm. We slept OK the first night, but I did request the foam mattress topper the next day and that made it perfect. Other things about the hotel: Don't miss the shows in the evening! The Boogie Nights disco show was my favorite and the Broadway show is good as well. There are a lot of things to take pictures of throughout the jungle paths, etc. so bring along a large storage card for your camera. We found that the shops at the hotel had good prices and good quality merchandise. Also, you will see many people suggesting that you bring along bubba kegs to the all-inclusives. Don't bother - we found that our beer koozies were perfect for the plastic cups at the resort. Outings: We enjoyed a day out saltwater fishing with Ivan, who is located at 14th street and the beach in Playa. His boat is called the Papa Kees. We caught two barracuda and almost had a sailfish as well! They have a nice website and you can book everything in advance over email. Our other outing for the week as a day at Xcaret. We got the Plus tickets and enjoyed everything about it and plan to go back. Don't miss the show in the evening.", "Date": "October 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Basildon, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyable fantastic holiday in a great location\u201d", "Author": "bobcaz33", "ReviewID": "UR84650326", "Content": "My Husband and i have just returned from the Iberostar Tucan Hotel. The hotel itself is set in beautiful grounds with varies wild life roaming around and the Howler monkies are definately a treat. We emailed the hotel direct and requested the top level which gave us a great view of the monkies who even came on the balcony. Also ask for blocks 11 - 14 as these are in best location. We found the food very good and would definately recommend the Japanesse as our favourite followed by the steak house and Mexican, although the italian was very nice there was a very musty smell which slightly took the edge off our meal. (book ala carte as soon as you get there, and take a pair of long trousers for ala carte) Best tip i would recommend is catching the ferry over to cozemel which leaves hourly, ensure you sit at the top deck at the back as it can be very choppy, less movement at back as its the heaviest part of the ferry. Also hire a moped at playa del carmen just before you board ferry which we collected once over at Cozumel, its very handy to do this before hand as you are given a sticker and as you walk through cozemel you are not hassled as they know you are already sorted. Once there we paid in total $25.00 for the two seater scooter and $3.00 tax. We travelled around the island and stopped at the sister hotel of Iberostar on the island and had our lunch,drinks afternoon swim ready and refreshed for the remainder of the island. (which is still free as its part of the iberostar chain if u are All Inc) Stopped at some very chilled out bars and and did some good snorkelling. Change travel money into Peso's although some trips you can still pay in dollars. Weather was very good often cloudy but still hot for swimwear. Fishing is good off the rocks at the right end side of the beach. Man made reef is ok for snorkeling again turn right on the beach, you will see a black line in the water. Got to see some baby turtles go into the sea (9pm at night they let them go), you will see the fenced off the areas on beach and date that they will hatch. Make sure if you go on a fishing trip to check they have a licence to take passengers!!!!! All in all a great holiday great hotel. Very friendly hardworking staff.

The beach was perfect, beautiful, white sand, warm turquoise water, plenty of lounge chairs and a very cool cat who hung out. Our rooms were very nice, beds were firm, but we all slept well. I cannot say enough about the service. Everyone we encountered was so friendly and happy. They went out of their way to cater to us. The pool was lovely, a nice respite from the sand and blazing sun on the beach. We visited the swim up bar a couple times and that was a lot of fun. We met some great people there. Music at this bar would have made it even more festive! Food is plentiful and good, although we would have liked a bit more variety. We visited the Italian, Mexican and Steak house restaurants. Our favorite was the Italian one. They were good, but full service, without any buffet would have been even nicer. I have to say the house wine is not good, but we brought our own wine and the staff was happy to serve it to us. The entertainment was cheesy, although those guys work very hard on the shows and you also see them throughout the resort during the day. How about a good director, like me? :-) The property is very long and narrow, and it can be a long walk to the beach and buffet if you're staying by the reception area. Request a room close to the beach. We did, and it worked out great. I had a lovely massage on the beach which was heaven. We went into the 5th avenue shopping area couple times and that was great fun, although the shop keepers can be very agressive. Just ignore them if you're not interested, otherwise you'll be there all day. Visited Senior Frogs for a drink and had a great time, complete with balloon hats for everyone. The resort is in a gated community and we felt safe 100% of the time, even going into the 5th avenue area. So don't worry about that. There's also a smaller shopping area within walking distance of the resort, and that had the same merchandise as 5th avenue. We went to Tulum - great if you're into archeology. Xel-Ha, a natural water park is about an hour south and we spent a fantastic day there. Snorkeling with gorgeous fish, manatees, swiming with dolphins (extra), lazy river ride and swimming in the cave were all so much fun. It's about $120 for the day, but all inclusive and well worth it, with excellent food included, drinks and snorkeling equipment. Definitely a highlight of our trip! You can't go wrong with Iberostar.

From the beach, Tucan is the half of the resort on the left, Quetzal the one on the right. Virtually the same, minor difference would be that on the Quetzal side of the pool you're closer to music and sports, and on the Tucan side you're closer to towels and pool-lunch area. When we were there (low season), the restaurant on the Tucan side was open, where the one on the Quetzal side was not. Had been to Iberostar Bavaro in the Dominican Republic before, so can compare here. Room: Spacious (seating area not as big as in the DR) and comfortable, with small balcony. We stayed in a room in block 11 (blocks run from 10 on the beach to 19 near the reception, Quetzal has similar numbering from 20 to 29). So close to pool-side restaurant, beach, towels, and away from the sounds of the jungle & monkeys located between the beach and restaurant. Room was thoroughly cleaned every day. Food & Drinks: Good quality food and drinks (I liked the fruit and vegetables a little better in the DR), and friendly service. Of the restaurants besides the buffet (Italian, Mexican, Japanese, and Steak House), we favored the Italian. Steak House is also good, but as it's open-walled near the beach, we had mosquitos bothering us there at night. Grounds: Beautiful (better than DR) and spacious, with a jungle full of animals (great for our daughter) to walk through on your way to the bigger of the 2 breakfast buffet areas. Agoutis, Monkeys, Tucans, Peacocks, Flamingos, Chickens, Lizzards, Turtles, and many more animals were present. There is a separate childrens pool, and right next to it a slide, climb rack and the usual playground apparatus in the sand for the little ones: ideal! Location: This hotel is located just 5 minutes and 50 pesos (roughly usd 5 or eur 3) by taxi from Playa del Carmen. Good for shopping, a massage, or diving (significant cost difference with those services at or around the hotel), and the ferry to Cozumel (140 pesos one way, 30 minutes by boat). About 5 minutes walk towards Playa del Carmen from the hotel you can find a Starbucks with free internet. (fyi - In case you're considering different Iberostars - the Iberostar Paraiso Maya is located away from everything between Cancun and Playa del Carmen). Other: Thrifty has on-site car rental available next to the Quetzal reception, and it's easy to rent a car and visit Chichen Itza and the city of Valladolid together in a day. Pre-arranged and organized excursions are bookable on-site as well if you like. Hotel also has tennis courts, a fitness center, a spa, and a night club, though I didn't make use of them.

We had a party of 35 coming to see us on our special day so we wanted to make sure it was special for not only us but for all of them as well. Let me break it down for you :) The Resort: We wanted a place that was plush with trees, not one of those resorts that have a palm tree thrown around every 50 feet or more. It is in the middle of a jungle. So many different trees, plants, flowers etc. There is also many animals that are able to roam free around the grounds. Don't worry...they don't bother you at all:) You've got monkeys swinging in the trees, tortoise, peacocks, swans and so many more. The pathways through the resort are beautiful, but are slightly hard to walk on. They are made out of some kind of stone, but you can always take the outside walkway to get to where you want as well. The Quetzel side has some beautiful scenery through out the walkways with waterfalls and ponds. Also there is this crazy tree that looks like it is growing in and out of itself next to building 25 on the Quetzel side...you have to check it out. The food at the buffets and snack bars is good. We stayed 11 days so it did get boring at that point! Wasn't too fond of any of the fish though so that was a bummer, but there was plenty variety there anyhow. All of our guests were pleased as well with their menu options. Restaurants were great as well. There is a great pool...just be careful when getting into the pool from the stairs...there is a big drop! It was funny watching everyone get in for their first time. The swim up bar and Iray the bartender were outstanding! We spent much of our time there during our trip. It has to be our favorite spot! It's a great way to chill out, have some good drinks and even meet some great people! (Hello Fiona and Ian!!!) The beach was renovated earlier this year and it looked great. Very big with plenty of chairs to sit. The water was very blue and warm. Because of our wedding we stayed in two different rooms. The first was in building 13. The beds in most rooms were hard, as you'll read in several other reviews, but have a drink and you'll sleep just fine. We brought our own pillows because we both use memory foam so I am not sure how those were. This building has a path that goes directly to the pool so its a great location! Also the monkeys tend to hang out near this building so you'll hear them and catch them often. We then moved our wedding day morning to the beach front building 10. Beautiful view and quite. The bed was much more comfortable. Both rooms were nice. The staff at the resort are all so great. They are always around taking care of the grounds. Room service and maids do a great job. The bartenders make great drinks...no gipping you out of anything! They are all wonderful from the second you step onto their grounds to the second you leave. Things to do: As I said, great pool and even better pool bar. They have all kinds of water sports you could do. None of us did any of that though. We did rent some snorkels and walked down the beach past the Sandos resort and did some snorkeling. They have this area not too far out that has some great fish and even octopus were seen. I have snorkeled twice in the past with adventure tours and this was the best I've seen! The town of Playa Del Carmen is just a 5 minute $5.00 cab ride away. You can get some great things there. There are many restaurants as well if you want to get out of the resort for the day. Check out the \"Jelly Fish\" store! http://www.jellyfish.com.mx/ Weather: Hot! We went in September knowing the temps would be in the 80's and 90's and that it was in the middle of hurricane season. But after a few days of the heat...you get used to it no problem. Put that sunscreen on! Don't try to \"get a tan\"! The day my husband and I left..the bellman came to get our bags and when we came back out it was pouring! First time all trip. That day the hurricane came through and it was crappy weather for at least 2 wks. Talk about timing huh?!? The Wedding: Gabriella, the wedding coordinator, was wonderful from start to finish! We started through email in the beginning of the year. It's a little hard to plan a wedding from so far away, but she tried to help make it as easy and as stress free as possible. She is a great asset to their resort. On Friday September 10 I watched from my balcony as the ceremony was set up and the guests started to arrive. We didn't want too much decor...but the decorations we did choose looked beautiful. Especially with the ocean behind it! Everything on our wedding day went great! The ceremony was beautiful, the dinner at the Italian restaurant was tasty, the private after party at the beach bar was so much fun and to end the night anyone left standing went to the disco to finish the party! FANTASTIC WEDDING! Thank you to our coordinators,Gabriella and Liliana, for making our wedding that special day that we will never forget! We are still hearing comments from our guests that came how much fun they had and how beautiful the resort and wedding was.

This was our fourth time to Mexico. Our one friend has been one other time to Cancun and her boyfriend had never been to Mexico or and all inclusive resort. For someone who has never been to a all inclusive resort , this wasnt a bad first impression. However for my husband and I, who usually stay at a Secrets property, we were a little disappointed. Ill admit that we are a little spoiled by Secrets properties . None the less this is just my opinion and I hope that it helps make your trip decision a little easier. When we arrived we were not greeted with a cocktail or a nice cool wet towel , which is a special touch I have become accustomed too. When they proceeded to give us our room keys no one was there to take us to our rooms or even show us where they would be located, keep in mind the resort is big. Luckily, a bell boy happened to be coming up at the time we were about to head to our rooms and offered to take us. Had that not happened we would have been walking all around looking for our rooms. Once in the room it left a lot to be desired. It was not luxurious at all. I guess the best way to describe it was \" authentic \". Our mini fridge was not really cold at all nor was the beverages in it. The bed was hard, but you could still get a good nights sleep. The balcony view was like you were in the jungle, which you are, but it still was not exactly the view I was expecting. The bathroom is very small and it smells bad, we assume it is due to the water which out of the spout is not purified. There is no drawers to put any of your clothes in although there are shelves in the closet and they do the trick. I will say that the maid service was very good. We made sure we tipped her everyday. As for the food and restaurants they were ok at best. Let's start with the restaurant situation. Depending on the length of your stay depends on how many guaranteed reservations you could make. Yes that is right I said reservations. I personally have never stayed at an all inclusive that made you have reservations to go to the restaurants or for that matter limit how many you could go to. We stayed 5 nights and 6 days. That entitled us to 2 guaranteed spots at any of the 5 restaurants but if we wanted to eat at a restaurant instead of the buffet on any of the other nights then IF they had space available then we could make a reservation. The funny thing was we made 3 reservations and every time the restaurants were barely full so I did not see the need for reservations. Not to mention having to stick to a reservation when you hanging out on the beach and you don't feel like going back in and getting ready puts a damper on things. However we were lucky that it was not the height of the busy season so we didn't have a problem getting into the restaurants. The food at all of them was ok. It wasn't horrible but it was not fantastic by any means. The good news is you won't starve and you can always find something you'll like. My favorite was the red snapper at the mexican restaurant. As for the buffet it was just a generic buffet as buffets usually are. The one thing I did not care for was the fact that the breakfast buffet closed at 10am. When I am on vacation I like to sleep in a little so rushing to be at the buffet before they closed failed for us on more then one occasion. Luckily the lobby bar did have coffee , espresso, and assorted pastries so you will not starve if you are a little bit of a later riser. They do have room service which we did not partake in because the hours are from 11am to 11pm and the food sounded like it had a lot to be desired. They do have a snack bar between the beach and the pool which has burgers, hot dogs , potato wedges and nachos but that is about it. I was not impressed but I was happy it was there in the middle of the day when I didn't feel like going to the lunch buffett which closes at 3pm. As for the drinks. Be warned there isn't really a functional swim up bar. They do have one in the Adult pool but where it is located the sun never hits it therefore the water is cold and the pool is a little dirty from debris due to the trees surrounding it. Needless to say not too many people are in that pool. However the main outside bar does have ok drinks. They are not very strong and sometimes you have to tell them to put extra this or that in it. On a good note it serves its purpose. By the way they only beer they serve is Dos Equis throughout the whole resort. The only place you can get anything top shelf is at the Lobby bar and you have to ask for it. On the whole the drinks aren't bad they just aren't great. The entertainment. The star friends do a decent job putting on shows, yeah they are a little corny but they are amusing. After the show ends at 11 or so then if you still want something to do you can go to the disco tech , mascara , which is open until 2am. Just a note it is on the Queztal side of the resort , the tucan and queztal are attached and all share the same pools and beaches. So if your looking for it in Tucan you won't find it. Playa del Carmen is also a 5 minute cab ride and 5 us dollars if you want to head out there for some nightlife. Which I would highly suggest going at least once. As for the outside areas they are good. The beach is beautiful and the water is amazing. You never have to fight for a beach lounger or for a palapa so don't worry about getting up extra early to snag one. Keep in mind we were not in the height of the season either so that probably depends on the time you are traveling. The pool was beautiful. There were only two problems I found. One, they do not give you floats or rafts if you want one you must purchase it and they are 14 US dollars in the gift shop in the lobby, I personally thought that was ridiculous. Secondly, the pool is a little on the deep side for the majority of the pool. This is not a problem for a taller person. However I am 5'3\" and the main part of the pool is 5.5ft so needless to say unless I really wanted a workout a raft was needed. The pool was very clean however and the kids generally stayed at the shallower ends, which I am guessing is why the pool is that depth, to keep the kiddies out. Due to the fact that the Tucan is designed to look like you are staying in the jungle there are lots of odd animals running around. They are wild and there are lots of signs saying that they could potentially bite. We did not have that problem. There is a little path that has lots of animals in it, the flamingos were our favorite. Overall it was not a BAD experience it just a left a little to be desired. I would never return to an Iberostar property due to my own experience and that of a few people we talked to who had stayed at others. However if you just want a quick get away and you want to save some money then this isn't a bad way to go. Keep in mind if you have stayed at a sandals or secrets or another resort like that you will be a little disappointed but you are also paying for those little extras you receive at those types of properties. If you are still trying to find the type of resort that fits you then give it a try at least once you may like it.

We found the hotel was in a really good location, within walking distance to Playa del Carmen & also a nice little plaza 10 mins walk from hotel. I think a taxi was a set price of about $5 into town & it was nice to have a wander out & a drink in a couple of different bars. When we first arrived at the hotel I was a little disappointed as the rooms are quite dated & ours only had a shower & no bath. I'd also stayed in Mexico before at the Paraiso del Mar in Riviera Maya & because the Tucan was a fair bit more expensive I think my expectations were probably a bit high & therefore I felt let down. I put this down to being grumpy after a long journey & by the next morning I put everything in perspective & remembered that a 4/5 star hotel in Mexico is not going to be the same standard as in the UK & just got on with enjoying the hotel as the rooms were perfectly adequate, the hotel was kept spotless, the food was excellent & the staff were great, especially the entertainment team.

My first impression of Cancun airport was how clean it was! The journey from the airport was 45 mins in a minibus! Our friends were waiting for us at the hotel and after check in we were given the grand tour! I will start with the hotel first! The room itself was quite spacious but no drawer space?? the fridge was well stocked with cans of pop, water and beer (refilled every 2 days!) The beds were not hard as I had read on other reviews and had no trouble in sleeping! the towel art was amazing!!! something different every day! the view we had was near the main buffet and we still got to see the monkeys!!! The down side was that we got no sun!!! so our swimsuits that you put out to dry (balcony has its own clothes airer) didnt dry properly and with the high humidity they just ended up smelling awful!! The grounds are kept immaculate!! even early in the morning the staff are busy making sure everything is tidy! night time is a joy walking through the hotel as it is lit up with lanterns.Every day brings something different when you walk through the grounds, the wildlife is amazing from the monkeys to the peacocks, squirrels, geckos you cannot put a price on such sightings, it is not like seeing the animals behind wire, these animals are free to wander! The pool is huge and clean!! however it is like swimming in a hot bath! The beach is in my opinion is the best because of the sea breeze!! it again is lovely and clean, the staff are there early cleaning the beach! there are lifeguards present! my only niggle is the sunbeds, they are so uncomfortable as they dont lay completely flat so when you sit on them they spring back into the seating position!! (the poolside sunbeds are better!) I am an early riser on holiday so the eternal battle for the sunbed with the shade was not a problem! but having said that you could still get a sun bed WITH SHADE after 9am on the beach! ( In late August) If you like to sleep in you could always get an umberella from the towel hut so shade is not a problem here! You can also get waitress service on the beach/pool for your drinks so you need never leave your sunbed! I didnt for the entire fortnight! It is well worth tipping the waitress the odd $ for the day! as they work really hard and you get good service!!! Now the food! I am a very fussy eater but had no problem with the food! they really do try and cater for all nations! Other reviews say the food wasnt hot, well that is true it isnt steaming hot like in the UK but you are not in the UK! They had everything from seafood,(mussels, prawns, grouper even large crab!) to lamb, veal, beef and pork they did pizza chips hamburgers and hot dogs something for everyone! my favourite was the ice cream they had 3 flavours (changed daily!) but they had all the sauces and sprinkles!!! they do have some great desserts including homemade biscuits! The a la cartes were ok! the best being the japanese because of the show they put on! however you are seated around a cooking station which seats 16 so if you were like me I was last in getting served (they dish the rice first then go round again with your chosen meat so when it got to me my rice was stone cold) but the experience was worth it!! They do free room service (11am to 11.00pm allow half an hour for delivery) from a selected menu! we used this on our last day as we left before lunch! it was fabulous!! the menu said ham and cheese on english bread it came complete with side salad and chips, sauce on proper china and yes it was hot!! My hubbies complaint would be the wine! it is just a basic white or red and thats it! unless you want to pay for something different! we wanted a white zinfrandel which was 325 pesos which was about \u00a320.00 for a \u00a35.00 bottle of plonk! The drinks were really generous measures top brands in the lobby bar! you just have to remember to ask for them by name (gordons gin and tonic) or you would just get the local brand! The entertainment staff work really hard during the day they are very friendly and are not offended if you choose not to join in! They even did santa on his vacation on the beach which was very funny!!! I cannot comment on the evening entertainment as I just enjoyed a quiet drink with friends in the lobby! but I'm sure it would of been good! If you are wondering what currency to bring well we brought dollars but if you bought something you were given the change in pesos, but for tipping dollars were the easiest option! the exchange rate was roughly 10 pesos to the dollar! Being from the Uk we do not always tip for service but please tip the staff, they are so friendly and helpful and I suspect that they do not earn a great deal and would be grateful, we did and am sure we got good service from housekeeping, the waitresses at the pool, bar and the waiters in the restaurants! All in all I cannot fault this hotel, from the towel guy, to the housekeeping, guest services even our rep Noe (he was so friendly!) they all go that extra mile so your holiday is a memorable one! So to our friends who recommended this paradise! WELL DONE WE LOVED IT!! AND THANKS FOR SPANISH LESSONS!!!! HA HA!!!

My parents, sister and nephew stayed at the hotel last year and were really enthusiastic about it and wanted to return this year. By all accounts it hasn't declined in any way. The location is great with a lovely white sand beach and plenty of shade, which was essential at this time of year. The RIU hotel next door only had palm trees for shade - am so glad we didn't stay there. We spent most of our time on the beach, the pool area also had plenty of shade if the pool area is your thing and the swimming pool is a great size so you are not swimming on top of each other The rooms are in apartment style blocks and if you are planning to stay at this hotel I would suggest you ask to stay in a block from 11 through to 15, anything further back is quite near the reception and bar area. Our room was on the top floor, we had very little noise from adjoining rooms, it also meant we had a great view of the Howler monekys when they went from tree to tree!! The room was comfortable enough, we had some of the best sleep we have ever had on holiday. There was always plenty of hot water and the chambermaids kept the rooms nice and clean. The food in the main buffet area was very good, - if some what repetative. There was always plenty to choose from and as much as there were some consistent faithfuls like chips and pasta there were always different types of cold salads etc and lovely Mexican choices. In addition to the buffet restaurant there is an Italian, Japenese, Mexican a la carte restaurants, and the length of your stay drives how many bookings you get in these restaurants. The Japense had the best food, the Mexican restaurant bizzarely wasn't the best. The entertainment team were great, they treated everyone like old friends and the children were very well looked after. Dressel divers ran the on site dive school and they were a very professional team who ensured that everyone who went to them was well looked after and given a first class service.

We usually stay at RIU\u2019s but the reviews of this resort were so good we decided to give it a try. It was very comparable in food and service to the RIUs, with the edge going to the Iberostar for food and RIU for service. The grounds of the resort are large and beautiful. Lots of wildlife, monkeys, peacocks, etc. around every turn. It was the slow time of year and it appeared that they had closed half of the resort. Still, there were plenty of bars and specialty restaurants open. The only downside of the low occupancy was the buffets were a bit limited. This was probably a good thing. I would much rather have a more limited selection of fresh food, rather than a huge selection of food that has been sitting for a long time. Room was very nice with a view of the pool and a bit of the water. No elevators, rustic walkways through the jungle (ladies be prepared to take off your heels in certain places) and quite a few steps in some areas may cause concerns for those with mobility issues. We thought it added to the ambiance of the resort. Beach was nice, but a little torn up because of the weather. No worries, the hotel roped off the areas and had crews out to level off areas of the beach whenever a drop-off materialized. We loved being able to walk into PDC (20 -30 min.) for food (El Fogon, Carboncito\u2019s, etc.), bars and shopping. I even enjoyed going into the Mega and Walmart to see the different foods and how they display things (Milk is ultra pasteurized, stacked on the floor and not refrigerated. The same with eggs). Both Mega and Walmart are excellent, safe options for using the ATM. A short ride in a taxi back is 50 pesos or $5. Only downside is the cost of the Internet at the resort.

I'm not sure why reviewers are complaining about this point, most of the hotel is pretty much open so air conditioning is going to be difficult to acheive. Checked in no problem, found room air-conditioned and clean. Maids always left us some towel art, different every day. Bed was firm but very comfortable, I'm not sure why this seems to be a complaint in other reviews, we had no issues whatsoever and did not have to ask for additional mattresses. Breakfast was good, plenty of choice if you want the healthy low-fat option or if you want the high-cholestrol stuff. Lunch was either by the pool restaurants (fewer choices here) or get dressed and go into the main complex for more varied choice. We ate by the pool restaurants every day, snack type stuff, but again, heathy food was available. Evening meal was good, again plenty of choice which was varied through the two weeks we were there. We are fussy eaters and had no problems. Don't expect top-end restaurant food, that's ridiculous, they are catering for hundreds of guests, but what was served was fine, no complaints. We did try the a la carte restaurants and found the service in the italian and mexican excellent, the food was best in the italian. Again, don't expect too much choice, but the experience was good, and the restaurants have dress code so no beach clothes. That includes a no 'open toe' shoe for the males. Apparently the hotel can provide trousers if you forget them. The japanese was fun and different, again choice is limited. The main pool was good, however it is often very warm (despite the size of it) which was a little surprising as we are used to the european cold swimming pools. The smaller pool used for the water polo and basketball, etc was a little cooler. We did not use the adult swim-up bar pool as it looked a little worse for wear. The beach was big and clean, water was clear and (again, surprisingly) fairly warm. Water was shallow quite far out, occassionally you do get big waves and sometimes there is an undercurrent which you would have to watch with small kids. Plenty of sunbeds but if you couldn't get ones with the static covers, the hotel will provide parasols that you can take to the beach. People reserve the sunbeds, get used to this. Some do this either at the crack of dawn, or the night before, and some of these are then not occupied until the middle of the day. The hotel give you a letter when you arrive stating you should not do this but it is ignored. We are early risers and found if you were not in place by 0900 you would struggle to get a sunbed by the pool. I'm sure this varies according to the occupancy, but be aware you may need to get down by the pool quite early. One gripe we had was people eating and drinking in the pool. It's one thing to be sat on the steps or sat on the edge of the pool, but bobbing up and down in the middle of the pool holding a cocktail or a beer or eating a burger or ice cream doesn't seem sanitary. Kids see this and do it en masse, so drinks are getting spilled into the water regularly. Thankfully the drinks served around the pool are in plastic 'glasses' becasue you will find some empties in the pool. And with people eating in the pool you will occassionally find a discarded cone going to mush floating around. Fortunately the pool is large enough that this isn't too much an issue, but that was definitely a downside. Pool cleaners are at work daily, early in the morning. Also, you are in the jungle and some leaves and twigs get in the water, but not so much as to put you off swimming. We found the staff great, friendly and helpful. We did tip, either $1 or 20 pesos depending on the cash we had. If you tip you will get regular visits from the waitresses. The star friends team were great fun, we took part in most of the activities. They try and get you involved in the daytime activities but there is no pressure, and you find yourself joining in and having a better time for it. We did the aqua aerobics, water polo/volleyball, dancing, etc. and avoided being bored sat around the pool all day. The evening shows were great, we were expecting something more cheesy but they really try and put on a good show and we were pleasantly surprised at the standard. The pre-show 'ice-breaker' games are fun, they are supposed to be a joke so it's better to get in the swing of things. The star team will walk around during the pre-show music (the live band are very good) and get ladies up to dance, even my very shy teenage daughter. The kids seem to have a great time and appear well looked after and one night even put on a 'Grease' song and dance which must have took some preparation. The theatre gets full quickly so get in there for the end of the kids show if you want a good seat. It gets very hot and humid, but certain areas get hit with some form of air-conditoned air, so look around. We only went on one trip, the Coba Maya pyramid, which was very good and we were fortunate to have an excellent guide. If you go, take some gifts for the Mayan families (not money). We didn't go on more trips as we seemed to be having such a good time at the pool. We took dollars and pesos but next time we will take dollars only (and plenty of 1's for tips) as it seems the favoured currency. You are in a jungle setting so expect to see monkeys, lizards, igunas, etc. We did get bitten by bugs, no surprises there, take bug repellant. In summary we had a great time, it's hot and humid, there is plenty of stuff to do by the pool and activities for the kids and adults, we found the star team great and very friendly and the evening shows were very good.

It was our first visit to Mexico and overall we had a great time, but there are a few areas that need attention. Unlike some recent posters, our experience with the employees working at the Tucan was first rate. Now I don't know if our \"generous\" tipping (usually a 20 peso note, about a buck-and-a-half), had anything to do with it, but we had no issues at all with the front desk staff, wait staff, or housekeeping. Everyone we encountered appeared happy and willing to help out any way they could. The main pool was beautiful, but was occasionally uncomfortably warm. Unless you get there early (before 9AM), forget about getting a primo palapa location next to the pool, and just forget about the poolside beds entirely. The swim-up bar pool did not appear to receive the same attention as the main pool and appeared to be not as clean.The beach was very, very nice. Use caution as you enter the water, as there are a few rocks to contend with for the first 20-30 feet - water shoes are recommended for tender feet, but certainly not an absolute necessity. Once you get past the rocks, the Caribbean was picture perfect! OK, lets talk about the beds. If you enjoy sleeping on an \"extra extra firm\" mattress at home, you will adore the beds at the Tucan. Unfortunately we like our bedding to be \"smooshy\" and had a very tough time with the beds.The \"foams\" that you can get from housekeeping help moderate the firmness slightly, but if you require a \"Sheraton Sweet Sleeper Mattress\", it could be a deal breaker for the Tucan. Food was typical buffet fare, and we could always find something that tasted good, but after a week it was starting to get pretty repetitive. The ala carte restaurants were a mixed bag; we enjoyed the Mexican and Italian, but weren't very impressed with the Japanese. We took full advantage of the ice cream cart next to the beach bar, but the \"serve yourself\" soda dispenser located at the beach bar attracted swarms of bee-like insects, making it difficult to get a soft drink. Two final points - there is no internet access in the rooms. Now ten years ago this wouldn't be a big deal, but here in the 21st century high-speed internet access in your hotel room is becoming as necessary as a telephone or television. Also, be very, very careful walking on the marble tiles located throughout the resort. We slipped on them repeatedly and they should be treated with extreme caution - especially when wet. Yes, we absolutely loved the Tucan and highly recommend it, especially for families. Its high rating here on Tripadvisor is well deserved, but know in advance the pluses and minuses of this (or any resort) and decide for yourself.", "Date": "August 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madison, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cA Very Mediocre Resort on a Beautiful Beach.\u201d", "Author": "WorldTraveler10_63", "ReviewID": "UR77231509", "Content": "We came to the Tucan with an open mind but expecting the same kind of magical experience that we had last August at the Grand Pallidium. I am a single Mom traveling with 3 teens ages 19, 16 and 13. Our trip did not get off to a great start with Apple Vacations. Our shuttle van had little air conditioning and the air circulating reeked of exhaust fumes. The driver trapped us in the van at the airport for an extra hour while he waited for more passengers. By the time I got to the Tucan I felt ill and ready to pass out. We checked in at 5 pm and our room was NOT READY. (are you kidding me?) Drenched in sweat and feeling ill we were sent to the unairconditioned restaurant to wait. When we finally got in the room clearly there had been a rush to prepare it. The floor was filthy with sand and dirt, there was unsavory garbage in various places, and I noticed that the complementary samples and water bottles had been used - yuck. I trudged down to the front desk and spoke with the manager. He said that all he could do was send housekeeping. There were no rooms available to change us to. Housekeeping finally arrived at 9 pm by which time I had washed the floor myself and cleaned up the mess. It is hot in Mexico in August. We knew this but somehow at the Tucan the heat was truly unbearably oppressive. The super hot pool water, the unairconditioned restaurants, the lack of air circulation at the outside stage shows, etc. The only cool water was in the filthy adult pool bar area. One suspects new water comes to this pool in the form of human urine as the pool is stagnant and you would truly have to be inebriated to hang out there. The staff at the Tucan/Queztal seem a grim bunch. I am sure that they have suckish jobs for the most part...but you know what? my job is hard too. When I am on vacation I don't want to be constantly reminded of how miserable people are in their jobs. I got the distinct feeling that the staff at the Tucan want you to tip them for every little service performed. The entertainent staff seemed to get on the bandwagon of passive-aggressive resentment of guests during their pre-show entertainment. During one \"sketch\" they deliberately asked certain couples from the audience to come up on stage. Most of the women were on the heavy side. The partners then had to physically pick up the women during a dance - changing partners along the way. This may be funny to some people - but all I could think about was someone's vacation ruined due to back strain or humiliation. The evening entertainment offered was mostly tedious and the same grating repetitive music by the \"Star Friends\" was annoying. I went to the hotel gift shop and bought an overpriced float for my kids to use at the pool. We left it secured with our stuff at the side of the pool while we went to lunch. Someone stole it while we were gone. If you take a float make sure it is clearly marked with your name. Perhaps because this hotel is affordable thieves are in your midst at this resort. The main pool area is very average. They have some cool \"lounging huts\" by the side of the pool but if you want one you have to get your stuff down there before the sun comes up. There is some entertainment in the pool area but it is mostly quiet with no fun music. My kids were pretty bored despite participating in all offered poolside activities. We are not picky eaters. My teenagers foraged for food at the buffet and always found something edible. I rarely eat meat but the best meal I had was a grilled burger from the beach cart. They make a big deal here about their restaurants and having to make reservations, wear formal clothes, etc. They tell you they have no openings, that everything is full, but when you go to the restaurants they are always 50% empty. I think they simply want to limit the extra expense of feeding people at anywhere other than the buffet. The spa is very small. There are 2 jaccuzzi's - one hot and one cold - and a steam room. Services are expensive. I treated myself to a Hot Stone Massage ($135) and ended up with a stiff neck for the rest of the trip. In my 30 years of traveling this was the first time I was overwhelmingly glad to be home. We are done with Mexico.

We stuck with the fish and some chicken dishes. The paella at the beach was nice and the cooking team was great as well as the Star friends with their entertainment. These people work hard to keep everyone happy. Now what ruin our trip was an incident that has never occurred to us. Someone stole my husband's cologne ( full bottle ) from a makeup bag that I brought. We believe it happened the first day we were there. The only reason why I am mentioning it is to warn others to be careful with your belongings. I hope whoever took it enjoys it. Btw, we were in roomn 1244. The other incident was that for the first time since we have been going to Mexico one of our bags was delayed an entire day. We tried to get assistance to make a phone call to our insurance company and got no assistance at all. The phone in our room didn't work so we couldn't do that either. The phone did get fixed a couple of days later. So truly customer service for us has a low grade.

We are open-minded and by no means picky people nor chronic complainers. We are just an average middle class family from the Midwest who follow the quote, \"IT IS WHAT IT IS\". So this is how the quetzal/tucan is...... As stated in other reviews, the food, plain and simple, is not good!! I personally can eat whatever you put in front of me and I was only able to survive the week by eating the same damn grilled chicken and salsa verde everyday. All the buffets are terrible......no variety, same thing every day, with lack of flavor and freshness. Our son lived off of pizza, hotdogs and ice-cream. He tried the pancakes and waffles and said, \"Mommy, this tastes funny,\" mind you he's only five and pretty much eats it all too. However, we kept saying to ourselves, \u201cstay positive, it is what it is\u2026.\u201d The most disappointing part of the trip was the service. In the many resorts that we have stayed in the past, we have never come across such poor bartenders and servers who looked so miserable and had major attitude. We are tippers and we had plenty of singles to pass around. The problem with this is that the servers/bartenders expected you to tip at this resort. It was not viewed as an extra bonus for them for going out of their way for you. After all, it is all-inclusive right? Towards the end of the week, we didn\u2019t even feel like going to the bar anymore because we actually started to feel intimidated by their abrasiveness. In many cases the bartenders would only serve the people who had the money exposed in hand and ignored the rest. But we kept telling ourselves to stay positive\u2026.it is what it is\u2026\u2026. In the entertainment department, the day entertainment was very low key. We even asked the entertainment people to play some music around the pool area since it was so quiet (the speakers were there) but they never did. It was overly boring and not very festive. The night entertainment was even worse, dull, depressing and non-inviting. The turning point was when my 5 yr old approached me during one of the shows and said very loud and clear, \u201cTHIS PLACE SUCKS.\u201d At this point I realized it wasn\u2019t about staying positive anymore. Towards the end of our stay we met 2 other families from 2 different states and we found out that they were having the very same issues that we had concerning service, food and entertainment. We realized it wasn\u2019t us, it was the resort, that simple. It got to the point where we were so desperate for some action that we trespassed over to the Riu next door where the party was happening every night!!! There were other issues too, like the 1.5 hour room service wait, the extremely warm pool, the nasty dirty water adult pool, watered down drinks, the condition of our room (warm moldy fridge, ants, moldy sink, cracked toilet, cement slab bed) but those were just minor details. After all, it is an older hotel and we knew this but thought they would compensate for that with excellent service. With all that being said I am so glad that this site is here to help future travelers not spoil their vacation and waste their hard earned money and time off.

We had been 9 years ago, and then 6 years ago we stayed at the Iberostar Lindo. While we loved the Lindo we also enjoyed the smaller size and closeness to town of the Tucan, so we decided to return. It was just as wonderful as remembered. The rooms are clean and comfortable and always cool. We ate in the Italian, Mexican and Japanese restaurants and enjoyed them all. The food at the buffet was good, varied and plentiful - I do have to agree that it got pretty warm in there, however. Of course going to Mexico in August we certainly expected that. Breakfasts were great as well, with so much choice. We usually ate lunch at the pool/beach restaurant where the food was again plentiful and varied and the breezes kept us comfortable. We especially like the Tucan because it is a smaller resort and so easy to get around. We like the pool and beach area because they are so close and you can easily go back and forth between them. The beach is good and the ocean is just gorgeous - clear and turquoise. The pools were so warm that we spent most of our time at the beach. We love the jungle - it is so unique and so much fun. While we were there one of the guests was feeding the monkeys (against the rules and certainly very stupid), but it did allow us to get great views of them and even two babies. The help is wonderful, kind and so friendly. They go out of their way to make sure that everyone has a great time, and the service is excellent. Remember to bring plenty of US dollars for tips!! The proximity to downtown Playa del Carmen is a real plus - just a 50 peso cab ride (about $4). You could walk or bike but it was too hot for us to do that. One day we took the ferry over to Cozumel, rented a car and snorkeled at Chankanaub (sp?) Park - it's a great place with good snorkeling. We took advantage of the reciprocal program at the Iberostar over on Cozumel and had lunch there and then returned after snorkeling for drinks. That is a great perk! We wanted to do some additional snorkeling so we took the Mayan Adventure Snorkeling Tour which I highly recommend. They picked us up at the hotel in a beautiful air conditioned van and took us to 3 locations - an outdoor cenote, Ya-Kul Lagoon in Akumal and finally an indoor cenote (translated a cave!). They also served a lovely lunch. The guides were knowledgeable and fun. Finally we rented a car and drove to Coba - very hot once again but so awesome.

The other end of the pool was quieter so you could choose where to sit. The beach? wow!! what can I say, white 'talcum powder' sand, turquoise sea, a lovely breeze HEAVEN!!!!!

There were 30 of us - 14 adults and 16 children ranging in ages from 7-23, the majority being teens. I would absolutely rate this as a family vacation - not so much for honeymooners, although the place is beautiful, there are alot of kids/families. The beautiful Iberostar Tucan was an amazing, fun vacation. I absolutely hated to leave and really needed more time there - 9 days would have been perfect. I am still missing it terribly and haven't been able to fully get back to normal life yet - I keep daydreaming about the Tucan, truly amazing.. I would highly recommend spending the extra $ and getting suites if a view is important - the suites were really nicely appointed (except storage for clothes was minimal). A standard room could never compare to the beautiful view afforded by the suite, we were only steps from the sand - our suites were on the first floor (building #10) and were close to the pool, buffet and ocean -- although we had thought we wanted a higher floor, the first floor was just perfect and we were very, very happy - If you book a standard, please understand that unless you are in building #11, #12 or #13 (Tucan side), or #21, 22, 23 (Quetzal) side, you are not near the pool/ocean and your view will be of the jungle. The jungle paths are fun to walk through - we saw fish, monkeys, flamingos, swans, peacocks, chickens, turtles, tucans and those pig-squirrel looking agoutis, etc.. I would recommend the Iberostar Tucan hands down - we received 3 al la carte reservations (Mexican-delicious; Japanese-delicious and Steak-pretty good) and then 4 nites we ate buffet. The buffets were OK, but the al la cartes were delicious. I do have to say that the \"open air\" concept for the buffets were uncomfortable for me in July -- I was extremely hot and uncomfortable most nights --- they really should look into enclosing these buffets w/glass and air conditioning as the Barcelo Colonial has done. The Star Friends Entertainment Staff was incredible and made everything alot of fun - gave me a feel like a smaller scale of the GO's at Club Med -- the teens really had a fabulous, memorable vacation . The pool was so beautiful, the beach chairs plentiful and the palapas were very pretty - and the ocean is so nice - we had some rain while there and the ocean was very rough and had some seaweed beause of the storms at sea - the pool to my delight, was at most times refreshing, unlike the Barcelo last year which early-afternoon was like soup. I do not have anything nice to say about the swim-up bar - which actually is in a separate location and you have to walk down stairs to get into -- it is old and the floor looks stained, which does not make for a good impression - also it has shrubbery surrounding it so leaves constantly fall into the pool and makes it look messy - I think the Iberostar should get rid of it or seriously scale back the shrubbery surrounding it and completely refurbish it. I did not go into the swim up pool at all and didn't miss it - as the BEACH BAR was fabulous and the waitress service around the pool and the ocean was fabulous. The jetskiis on the beach was alot of fun and they let you take the jetskiis out by yourself - also there are great guys on the beach selling beautiful real silver jewelry very inexpensively - I bought a bracelet on the beach for $15, that the started at $125 in Playa del Carmen/5th Ave. Unless you are going to do some higher end shopping, I would stick to buying jewelry on the beach and going a few blocks across from the Tucan/Quetzal to a big flea market that sells everything they had on 5th Avenue. The Disco, Mascara, was tons of fun as it was for EVERYONE -- everyone was allowed in the Disco - they only differentiated for drinking by the wrist band - but everyone was allowed to dance - there was teens off by themselves and families with little ones 6, 7,10, 11 13, etc. who came to dance for a while - it truly, absolutely was the perfect family place as no-one was left out and the parents of the younger kids were able to go to the disco as they could bring them -- so they kids had a ball and so did the parents!!! amazing family vacation, truly! I hope this Disco policy wasn't just the week we were there as it really was incredible for all the families that everyone was able to go -- I wonder if this family-friendly Disco policy is at all the Iberostars???? I have been to many all inclusives - Breezes, Riu Ocho Rios and Barcelo Colonial and, although I loved all those places and had wonderful times, I have to stay the Iberostar Tucan was more fun than any of the others.", "Date": "August 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario", "Title": "\u201cMonkeys Everywhere!\u201d", "Author": "SpecialKH", "ReviewID": "UR74073542", "Content": "We decided to stay at the Iberostar Tucan first because we enjoy Iberostar resorts and second because of all the animals on site. We arrived early and while our room was not ready, we were able to go eat and explore the grounds while our bags were watched by the staff. As we explored, we were in awe at how beautiful the grounds were. Everything was very well designed with Mayan sculptures everywhere, marble floors and ponds full of huge koi (and the birds who watched them). Then we came to a path that led you through a jungle where we saw so many animals: chicken, huge lizards, capibaras and monkeys! We were so excited to be able to spend the week with these guys! Then we arrived at the pool which massive and gorgeous, over looking the beach. While we were there construction had started, but it was finished by the end of the trip and we got to enjoy some good days on the huge beach. When our room was ready, the bellboy walked us there and gave us a tour of the place, explaining what they had to offer and the hidden gems on site like the bird sanctuary and the other animals on the grounds. The food was excellent - as someone who is first vegetarian and second a picky eater, I always found something to eat and ate way too much! My boyfriend (who is not vegetarian) really enjoyed the food as well and had not one complaint. The rooms were simple, but they were clean and the bathroom was very big. I enjoyed the block we stayed in (our oom was 1203) since every morning and every night at dusk, the monkeys were right outside our door, playing in the trees and making beautiful sounds (ok, so they are howler monkeys and kin of loud, but where else do you get to hear that!!). The shows were really good and the service was excellent everywhere you went. Never were we left without a drink or a smile. Another great part of it all is that you are a short cab ride away to Playa del Carmen where you can do some serious shopping and there is a small plaza close to the resort where you can look around as well. I enjoy exploring my surrounding so I appreciated that things were close (as well as Xel-Ha and many other attractions). If you do decide to head to Mexico, make sure you visit the Jungle Place which is a Spider Monkey sanctuary about 40 minutes away. You get to spend time with the monkeys, playing with them, hugging them and it is the most amazing experience.

I want to address some of the complaints that I have read on this site that made me nervous to go here. Beds are hard: They were not uncomfortable at all... I was injured mid-way through the week and I still had no problem falling asleep and staying asleep on the mattress. It's hot: Really?? It's Mexico!! In the Summer!!! The food is not good: False. We've go every year to a different resort, and this was some of the best food we have ever tasted at a resort. I will say that a bigger variety of main dishes would have been nice at the buffet, but what was there was good, and always fresh. The beach is topless: Many of the resort beaches in Mexico are public, and they have the european standard, which is women that are topless are okay. They're boobs, people. Not dirty bombs. There were plenty of children around, and not a one went insane and stabbed somebody because they saw a breast. I was much more offended by the fat guys with the tiny leopard skin speedos. \"A minor incident occured to me that ruined my entire trip. Waaa!\": Nothing is perfect. There will be problems and mix-ups everywhere. Especially if there is a language barrier. Sometimes, crap happens. Hell, I had a laceration on my eye and had to ride in an ambulance at 2 in the morning to Cancun to get it fixed, but I still had a great time. Buck up, you spent money on this trip. Enjoy it. The beach was washed away: Not anymore. it looks awesome. Pros: Everything. This place was one of the best we have ever stayed at. The animals around the resort were varied and unique, and they were everywhere. We especially loved the chilled out cat that hung around in the mornings and the evenings. We loved the apple excursions, and thought that the lady at the desk who we dealt with was very nice and helpful. For those of you that plan on hurting yourself on vacation, the infirmary is open 24 hours a day, and the Dr. in charge when I went in (i'm sorry i don't remember your name, but i was blind at the time) was incredibly nice and spoke great English. She even waited for me until the ambulance arrived. Be prepared to spent some money if you do need the infirmary, however. Nothing is free. The al a carte restaurants were a lot of fun, though we were surprised to find that the Mexican restaurant was the least of our favorites, given the location. The drinks: Wow. Like I said, I've been to a lot of places, and I have never had stronger or better made drinks than I have had here. The bloody mary's were absolutely great, for those that care for such things. Cons: Few and far between. More variety during dinner at the buffets would be nice. Yeah, it's hard to find shade on the beach after 8AM, but you can request a beach umbrella from the towel dude and sit wherever you want, so that wasn't that bad. The disco often played bad music (much to the chagrin of our female companions), and whenever they requested a song, all the \"dj\" would say was \"later.\" If you hear that, he will not come through on that request.

I have stayed at the Royal Playa Del Carmen and usually we stay at the Iberostar Cozumel...so this was a nice change. The Tucan had great ala carte restaraunts! We enjoyed the Tropical and the Mexican onr the most. We emailed ahead and made reservations because I had read that someone else on this board did that. It worked out beautifully! We stayed in an Ocean Front Junior Suite and I was sooo glad we did. I loved sitting on the Balcony and hearing the ocean. If you want a total clear view of the ocean from your suite...ask for a 1st floor or a third floor room as the Palm trees are right in from of your room on the second floor! Nonetheless...we were happy with our room! We did notice many people saving chairs at the pool and at the beach very early in the am...kind of a drag, but on our third day we learned and ended up doing that too. The swimming right outside the hotel was beautiful! The beach has been redone since we visited for the day last year and it is AWESOME! Bigger and more beautiful than I remember it! I had a massage on the beach at the hotel...It was wonderful. The only thing was it was almost twice what I pay in California...Kind of pricey...But, hey, I was on vacation so I did it! I loved it. Had one i town too...It was wodnerful as well and half the price. The staff at the hotel was friendly for the most part...I think the difference between Cozumel Iberostar and The Tucan is that in Cozumel the resort is smaller, much smaller, so there is more personal attention and better service overall as there are not so many guests. The Tucan has so much to do, I still feel like I missed some stuff. We walked one night to town. It was not that bad or long of a walk....But then again it is only a $5.00 cab ride, so we did that the rest of the time! The only thing we decided we were bummed about at the Tucan was that there was not the real swim up bar at the pool. There was a small section outside the pool that had a bar in it, but it was not appealing and it was not connected to the rest of the pool. The maid service in the rooms was great as well! Very clean and stocked our fridge anytime we needed it. As for excursions...We hired a driver for the day that I got a recommendation from on this board. his name was Salvador Mercado! He was AWESOME! Well worth the money. I will always hire him when we go back. He drove us where we wanted to go and also recommended some swimming holes to us! We had a fabulous time! His van was clean and safe and he was a perfect gentleman! One last thing...I noticed NO ONE TIPPING. Wow....Any chance we received good service we tipped. We had a nice lady find us out at the beach for drinks and once we tipped her she came back and checked with us everytime if we needed refills. PLEASE TIP these hardworking people!

We want to start by saying this was our first trip to Mexico, so we were not sure of what to expect. We will probably not vacation in the U.S. ever again after staying here. This place is just so much more beautiful than the beaches I've been to here, and I've been to almost all of the beaches on the east & west coast and the Gulf Coast. The Tucan is unique in that there are all of the animals that are mentioned in other reviews. This made it so much more interesting than the other resorts we saw. There are really no words to describe seeing these animals in their natural environment. Things we loved: Snorkeling was great, lots to see and you don't need to set aside an entire day. They leave from the beach and it is just a short boat ride away to a very pretty reef with turtles and beautiful fish and plant life. The service at the hotel is second to none. The star friends that do the shows at night are often the same people who are working in the daytime, and remember you if you talk to them. People I would like to mention by name are Ofelia-the BEST beach waitress ever (although all of them were fabulous), Hilario-the sweetest and funniest bartender ever, the boy at the towel hut (don't know his name, unfortunately), who always was joking and smiling, and Carmen-the best bar maid! We love you and miss you already! We never got a chance to meet our room maid, but whoever you are, you were fabulous as well, always stocking what we needed and asked for. We felt the food was very good, so much to choose from and always were able to find many good things to eat. Be careful of the hot peppers, I burned my throat and it is still swollen even days later! Lesson learned! We loved the shows, even though we are in our late 30's early 40's, we thought they did a wonderful job. Yes, the resort does not have much to do after about 11pm, but we were so tired from laying in the sun or doing other things all day that we were tired and ready for bed. We stayed in building 13 and loved that we were close to both the lobby and the beach/pool area. We loved the friendly people from the other countries we met. We loved the beach volleyball and the beach party. I have read other reviews and can't believe that some have mentioned how \"hot\" this place is. It is July and it is Mexico. I would imagine that is par for the course for the tropics at this time of the year. We felt our room was kept very cool and pleasant, and certainly, we came here for the warm weather and if we had preferred to be cool, we would never have chosen Mexico in July. The resort is so VERY clean, the grounds, lobby, restaurants and rooms! The employees at this resort do their job so well and please tip them, they are so good at what they do. They work so incredibly hard to make sure that you are having a good time. We are planning to take our entire family here next year and cannot wait to return! Some negatives: We never went into the swim up bar pool, it didn't look very good and there were better places to swim, for sure. The beds are hard, but I almost hate to even mention that because it really didn't bother us at all. We were just fine with them but I can see where some would not like that. We did not like visiting 5th Avenue in Playa Del Carmen, but that is because we are inexperienced at negotiating prices and didn't like being approached to spend money in the shops. We just have so much to learn! Overall, we absolutely will return to this resort and highly recommend it for families. Beautiful!

We ate in the Italian twice & the steakhouse once, both meals were cooked to perfection. The al la carte restaurants may be booked at the guest services pyramid which is open twice daily 10am-12 & again 6pm-8pm. It does state that in all these restaurants gentlemen MUST wear long trousers & I saw no evidence to the contrary. The rooms were fine mini bar topped up every other day & the maid kept the room clean & supplied plenty of water, there was also some pretty cool towel art. We found the air con more that adequate, & very rarely kept it on full at night. The beds have a concrete base & a thick but firm matress, we all found them fine, some of the best nights sleep I've had in a long time. Yes it was hot outside but nowhere near as humid as we expected, but then again we were in Mexico in July & didn't expect it to snow! The lobby bar in my opinion was the best place to get a drink during the day or evening, all the cocktails we tried were mixed well, during the evenings the entertainment was a keyboard player one night & a guitarist the next, both were pretty good. The hotel has a policy of not to reserve sunbeds, sadly unlike other Iberostars that we've stayed in they do not enforce it. I used to have an early morning swim around 7am & saw that some beds already had towels, shoes etc on them with nobody insight. Luckily we're more beach people & we never had a problem getting a bed with a shade. The mini jungle in the centre of the hotel is a nice touch, with plenty of wildlife to see, The monkeys were very entertaining but it;s all about being in the right place at the right time. All in all we had a great family holiday, would we go back to this hotel & area, the answer is no, but only because we try never to go to the same place twice, life is too short & the world is to big to double up on holidays.

I booked my reservations directly with hotel using the online link on their web page. At the last minute,we had a change from one adult person to another. While trying to check-in, the receptionist told me that I had to go back online and change my reservation to include the correct name or they couldn't check us in. Of course that meant that we had to purchase internet time, and then wait for one of the 2 computers to be available before we could complete the check-in process and get our keys. Never understood why the receptionist couldn't manage that herself! 2. Dinner reservations. They only accept dinner reservations in person during a short 2 hour window everyday. At that time, you are only allowed to make 2 guaranteed pre-bookings. The rest of time, you have to show up to see what they might have available that night. So, no guarantee that you will ever get to eat at all the restaurants. 3. The HEAT. My family and I are from Houston TX. We are no strangers to Heat and Humidity. The way the resort is built imbedded in the jungle is beautiful, but there is absolutely no breeze. The instant you step outside your door, you are going to melt. The only relief we found was the Ocean. It was beautiful. No sea grass as in previous visits to Playa. We tried the pool one day and found that it was like hot bath water. It was not refreshing and it was impossible to get a chair. I am not one of those people who wakes up early to go put a towl across chairs... 4. (did I mention the Heat) We showed up at the Japenase Restaurant (1 of our 2 dinner reservations), and my husband and son (who were wearing collared shirts and nice bermuda shorts, were told that they would not be allowed to stay in the restaurant without long pants. All the while, at the table next to us, there was a girl in cut-off blue jeans and a TShirt. 5. The beds are cement blocks with sheets on them. By the end of the week, both my husband and myself were in desperate need of a message. I know that if I had requested, they had a foam mattress that they would accomodate us with. However, the linen closet was next to our room with the door often left open. We had a first had look at foam mattresses, and the lack of care for which they were storing them, and decided to pass. 6. The massage. Yes our backs were so racked from sleeping in those beds, that I thought it might be nice to get the kinks worked out before we headed home. My husband and I stopped by the Spa after breakfast to make our reservation. We were quoted a price and scheduled a time for later in the day. I happened to ask if we would be able to be in the same room. \"No problem\". After receiving an absolutely wonderful massage and feeling oh-so relaxed, we were checking out. My husband was offered a ticket to sign that would be charged to our room. The ticket was in pesos (we were quoted in dollars earlier). Quickly trying to do the math, I mentioned that it seemed too high. It was acually $58 more. The girl behind the counter said that it was because we shared a room. Remember, we are still in the Spa at this time, I had my husband go ahead and sign the ticket knowing full well that I was going to take up the matter with the Spa managment. 7. The refund. Let's just say after many rounds of he-said/she-said, the hotel \"doing the right thing\" by offering me a 10% discount, I finally got the price that was originally quoted to me. 8.

First word of advice- get a direct flight because otherwise its just a hassle and really kills the excitement of being on vacation. PROS Did I mention beautiful? Being here is exactly what I imagine a tropical destination would look like- waterfalls, jungle, exotic birds-if this was a date it'd be love at first sight. Food was awesome-but if you like gourmet food then you might be a little disappointed. We ate at the Tropical and Steak House restaurants, had steak at both and it was delicious. The staff was excellent-very helpful. We are late risers so by the time we arrived at the pool each day there were no vacant chairs. But, all I had to do was ask a staff member and they appeared out of nowhere with two chairs for us (I always made sure to give tips for this service). Drinks were excellent- not watered down. Our fav -a Congo with white rum and mojitos from Santos (the bartender in the lobby). I had an hour long massage at the spa and it was worth every second- best massage I have ever had (air conditioned too) CONS I know its the tropics but this hotel was waay too hot for our comfort. We usually like the ac blasting but the room didn't get nearly as cold as we'd like it and other than the spa and our room there really was no other place to escape from the heat and humidity. All the restaurants are open air which I didn't mind too much because of the ambiance but still hot-including our beloved lobby bar, which was probably the hottest place in the hotel. Continuing with the heat- the pool area had almost no shade but under a palapa-if you were lucky enough to get one of those spots. To cool off we went in the water and exposed our heads to direct sunlight (both of us had burned scalps after 2 days and wore hats the rest of the time). The only other complaint we had is that the amenities at this hotel are more geared towards families than the 20 something crowd. There were too many kids here and while they were entertaining to watch (especially the ones who insisted on climbing the fountain and getting yelled at by staff members), they just seemed to take over all areas of the hotel- thank god for the lobby bar. There was not much nightlife at this hotel either. Our concensus of the nightly shows is that they were kinda lame- entertaining for older people but not for us. The club at the hotel-Mascara- was embarrassingly dead 2 nights in a row and we quickly made an escape. At night we just wanted to do some dancing and mingling with other people our age but there were none to be found. If you want some nightlife you'll have to go into Playa del Carmen. Conclusion: Excellent hotel during the day. Not so entertaining at night. Great Food, Great Staff and wonderful drinks. Would I stay here again? Yes, at a slightly cooler time of year and would definitely spend my nights in town instead of at the hotel.", "Date": "July 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Snellville, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cAWESOME PLACE - WILL GO BACK HERE\u201d", "Author": "rob35267", "ReviewID": "UR71564524", "Content": "This really is a place to check out and for your money, definately go all-inclusive. Also never trust the weather forecast. It was predicted rain all week and we saw a total of 3 hours. For the most part everything was great. My wife and I were joined by our daughter's family. Upon arrival to the hotel my wife tripped on the raised step at the hotel entrance and most likley tore knee ligament. You will be amazed at the beauty but watch out for the first step! The hotel staff didn't seem to want to help nor the Apple Rep. We were given a FREE wheelchair for a few days for our inconvenience. WOW....Our daughter was double booked into a room when we arrived and her husband walked in on a lady changing clothes. They got a free upgrade to a oceanfront junior suite for a week for their inconvenience. What is wrong with this picture? Day two, I rolled the wife to the pool and it rained 3 hours (the only rain of the entire week). Ok now the good. Everything else.......The staff were extremely friendly, especially Ophelia on the beach. She works hard so please tip her well. We never went thirsty. She even hugged us good bye. Hilario was awesome at the beach bar. The Mojitas were awesome but also ask him to make you a dirty monkey. Compares to a top grade mudslide. The Star Friends were everywhere. You will know Luigi when you see him. My wife fell in love with him. The nightly shows were awesome. You have to see the Grammy show they put on. The guy that does the Michael Jackson skit should be on TV. He has perfected every move. The danceing was phenominal. The food was great everywhere. Although the steaks were cooked perfectly, it is outside and was hot and humid. Somewhat uncomfortable. The Japenese and Italian restaraunts were spot on. There is plenty to do and see while exploring the grounds. I took 355 photos. The beaches, pools, were always being cleaned. Say hello to Eduardo at the towel hut. A young but cool chap. Look around before you decide on an excursion, you can find a good deal. I didn't care for the tour bus service to Tulum or Xel-ha but the sights were well worth it. You can learn to scuba dive in the pool and for a modest fee you can get 2 dives. Cross that off my bucket list. Playa Del Carmen was awesome for a 5 dollar cab ride. Beware of being asked to come into every store. You can negotiate a good deal on most items. My wife was happy with her jewelry. Finally, yes the beds were soemwhat hard but not bad. We tipped our room maid 5 bucks a nite and our fridge was always full. Bring dollars because these folks work hard for their tips. We stayed for a week but after the first day it was awesome. Yes I will go back here if possible. We met several people from other countries that were repeat guests. Say hello to Lara & Jon at the scuba hut.

The food was a little disappointing but the specialty restaurants were great. The beach is fantastic and all that you could ask for. The kids loved all of the nightly shows and spent a lot of time at the disco. I guess the things that were disappointing was the lack of a true swim up bar. Instead it was an adults only pool that had very cloudy water(yuk) and was very cold in a shady spot. The other thing was that the beds were very hard. We called for a mattress pad and that did help.

The Tucan is clean and lovely, and everyone was helpful. I spoke some rusty Spanish, and the staff did their best to understand me. Our children (8 & 11) quickly met many other kids to play with, and could spend their days alternating between the beach and the pool. We took out kayaks and a hobie cat - both were fun. We didn't use the mini-club, or go to the shows or disco (couldn't stay up that late). We *liked* the firm mattresses. The mediocre: The food is just OK. No worries - we weren't going for the gourmet experience and found plenty to eat. The mojitos were really good. The horrible: Nothing to do with the hotel, but we went to Tulum on a hot, hot day. I almost melted. After that, though, we stopped at Cenote Azul - gorgeous, refreshing, and COOL. Things I'm glad we had: Bubba kegs; pool rafts (Target: $2.99 v. gift shop: $15); an over-door plastic shoe holder for toiletries in the bathroom; a laundry line to tie across the shower for wet swim suits; our own mask/snorkel/fins for Xel-ha and Akumal; hats & sunscreen.

The room is clean, nice, and refrigerator stocked daily. Staff EVERYWHERE are unbelievable! They are happy, excited to be there, always smiling and greeting you! The bartenders on the beach (Reuben and Horacio) were so funny and nice. Beach waitresses (Ofelia) is adorable. We loved playing beach volleyball with all the guests. We went on the snorkling excursion offered at the hotel, it was GREAT! It was a 20 minute boat ride which was beautiful, then snorkled with the guide for about an hour...saw sea turtles, sting rays, gorgeous fish, etc. It was only $36 dollars a person! WELL WORTH IT and doesn't take up the whole day! Beach massage was GREAT! Our 17 and 18 year olds rented the jet skis, and had a ball. There was never any waiting around, the staff is always so quick to keep things moving. Food: Buffets are GREAT. Hibachi is the BEST and its air conditioned! Steak restrauant was not that great at all, and it was OPEN air! HOT steak dinner in July with no air was horrible. The buffet that is pool side is great for snacks, and the burger grill is really really good. Eat breakfast and dinner in the main buffet, there is a much better selection of food then at poolside. The swim up bar is dirty..and needs updating. The best part of this property is by far the grounds and all the animals walking around. it is clean and just a beautiful unusual setting. The jungle walk to the rooms is fun...carry your camera at all times you never know what animal you will run into (peacocks, monkeys, igunas, tucans, flamingo's etc. :) We stayed in building 11 and it was a perfect location! Close to pool, beach, towels, etc. You could run back to your room without hiking through the jungle! Go into town! It is a must. Go in the evenings, it is lively, fun and totally safe. It is a $5 cab ride. We ate dinner early then went to town for shopping, music, drinks! The stores all start closing around 930 or 10pm. The restraunt Carboncitos is around 5th and 12th and it is SO good and cheap! It is a family resort and there were a lot of kids, but at no time was it distracting or bothersome. It was fun to watch all the kids and listen to all the accents from all over the world. Our teenagers liked the activity staff members, they were fun and had a lot of activities to do in the pool or on the beach. Bring LOTS of sunscreen, it is very expensive at the resort and in town. ($30 a tube) We have been to Cancun many many times, and I now can call Playa Del Carmen my favorite spot.

Food was good,beds hard, and yes no pool chairs after 9am. kids loved the kids show they had every night. The walk through jungle is what makes this resort stand out. Two days we left to shop at 5th ave! that's the place to do it. I was Leary of leaving the resort with kids not sure how safe it was , but definitely safe an awesome shopping no worries there. We did 3 excursions. 4 wheeler, snorkeling and ruins. All good although last day we were their we did the ruins and it rained all day which didn't make for good sight seeing.

The service that we received throughout the stay was commendable, with everyone being as helpful and friendly as possible. Staff quickly began to recognise us which gave the hotel a very personal feel which we greatly appreciated, particularly for a large establishment like this. The grounds were amazing, with the integration of the jungle and animals being the central feature of the hotel. It was beautiful and really made you appreciate that you were in Mexico, instead of just being 'abroad.' The pool was great and never over crowded, though we did find that people persisted to reserve the chairs at the poolside, regardless of the rules against this. The beach was also amazing with clear waters and white sand. The food at this hotel was really good, with there being so much variety. The dishes were changed all the time so food never had time to go stale or cold as happens in other buffets. My partner is quite a picky eater and never had problems finding things to eat. I would say that breakfast was my favourite meal of the day, with there being everything that you could imagine! We travelled with First Choice and found that Noe, our Holiday Advisor, was fantastic, always being on hand with really good advice. We went on two trips - Tulum and Coba Mayan Village - on his recommendation and had two great days out. The room was lovely and was a nice retreat. We were placed in a great block (17) which was near the buffet and lobby but not so near that it was noisy or that we didn't enjoy a view of the jungle. Although the beds are hard, we both slept very well and had no need to ask for any softener. Overall, this holiday was wonderful and we would go back in a second. The only consideration that I may make would be in regards to the weather - we had a very wet six days at the beginning of our stay, but I don't think that this is a common problem, just bad luck.

If you are a family with young children and you like being on the beach (rather than the pool) then this may not be the best place for you.

In short the resort was fantastic. It did not disappoint. The grounds were beautiful, the food great, the beach was beautiful, & the hotel itself was nice and clean. We would definitely return to this resort. Great place for families and couples. There were a lot of young 20 something\u2019s as well but this could have just been because of the time of year\u2026.school\u2019s just out. Our only real complaint was that it was very crowed (we had overheard that were actually overbooked) so finding an umbrella or good seat at the show was impossible. For those who are interested the long detailed version of my review follows. GETTING THERE: We had missed our flight & arrived 1 day later so we did not get to the resort with our included tour bus. We did take a cab the next day which ended up costing us $60.00 US from the Cancun airport to the resort. That was the cheapest price we could find after haggling with a few drivers who weren\u2019t affiliated with the airport. For those of you traveling on your own as we did, beware of the endless line our people selling time shares at the airport. CHECK IN: As I said before we didn\u2019t check in with the rest of the group that would have been on our first scheduled flight so I can\u2019t say how that would have went. Checking in on our own was no problem. We couldn\u2019t get the building we requested because they were overbooked (the staff did try) Most of the staff members at the reception desk spoke fluent English which made it easy. RESORT & GROUNDS: The buildings themselves were very clean (including public bathrooms) & well kept. Pretty standard looking inside (the grounds were so nice we didn\u2019t really care what the inside looked like anyway) the grounds were stunning. The grounds around the buildings were well groomed. The paths leading to the beach were like walking through a jungle or a zoo exhibit. There were cages with exotic birds as well as monkeys, lizards, & other types of birds roaming free everywhere! The Tucan side was designed to look like ancient Mayan ruins & looked even prettier when it was lit up at night. The Quetzal side had an amazing waterfall around the buffet restaurant where we had breakfast every morning just to sit and look at it. Although we weren\u2019t ever able to get a good seat in the theatre room it was huge, and probably more than sufficient the majority of the year. The main pool was huge. There was also a pool set up with basketball nets for sports games & a kids wading pool. All were kept clean as were the surrounding areas & loungers. There was an adult\u2019s only pool with a swim up bar that we didn\u2019t use. It looked pretty dirty & old surprisingly. And when you never see anyone come out to use the bathroom\u2026..hmmmmm???????? * One note about the paths to the beach: They are made of natural stone & are not level, so take care when walking through them especially at night. ROOM: Standard room. Very clean. The beds were a little hard but not too bad. Always hot water. There is an iron/ironing board, a mini bar that is stocked every other day, & a hair dryer. There is a safe in every room that is free to use. The balcony had a drying rack. FOOD: The breakfast buffet was always good. There was just about every breakfast item you could think of every day. The snack bar on the beach was really good. There was grill located just outside where you could get freshly made hamburgers & hot digs etc. every day. There was always a good selection of food. There was also a self serve ice cream machine at the grill as well as another vender who would serve ice cream cones beside the pool daily. We went to the lunch buffet one day & we found it wasn\u2019t really worth leaving the beach and changing to eat there. The food was good but we were happy enough with the snack bar selection. The dinner buffet was always good with a pretty big selection. We only ate at the dinner buffet a couple of times though. Overall I only had a couple of things I didn\u2019t like (one being a paella dish filled with chicken bones) We went to 2 a la carte restaurants\u2026None of them were really decorated nicely. The steak house was really good, we went twice. We went to the tropical seafood restaurant once. We didn\u2019t like this one at all. We couldn\u2019t go to the Japanese restaurant which looked liked it was decorated the nicest because my husband didn\u2019t have any pants with him (they do offer loners) we ordered room service twice which is open until 11\u2026 good selection/food for room service. DRINKS: The drinks were great. My husband died over the apple juice of all things. The blender drinks were really good & slushy like they\u2019re supposed to be. The coffee, red house wine and juices were all good. Some of the bars served premium liquor as well. STAFF: Overall the staff was generally friendly. The service was always good (Jaime at the tropical was outstanding) the wait staff were a little slow at times, but considering how busy the hotel was that was to be expected. GUESTS: Mostly Americans. There was definitely a mix of age groups. Lots of families and large groups travelling together. Overall everyone was very friendly. BEACH: The beach was huge & really pretty. The sand was a tiny bit coarse because of the bits of shell in it but still nice. The water was an amazing color but not really clear due to the time of year. There was lots of little bits of seaweed when you first walked in the water the first few feet (also due to the time of year)There was only one resort beside the Iberostar on the Tucan side so you could walk down the beach for about 20 minutes and have the entire area pretty much to yourself. The water was calm all but 1 day, so it was good for young kids (bring floats) The resort did offer umbrellas on the beach as well as the huts that were set up but we were never able to get one! There is a life guard on duty at all times. You also have the use of kayaks & paddle boats. You can get the staff to take you out on a Catamaran or parasailing as well as rent the snorkel gear. The beach is all sand. There is no reef, so no snorkeling. They do offer snorkel tours and diving tours for a fee. ENTERTAINMENT: The nightly shows were really good. There was no lip syncing & the band was live. The props were impressive. Worth seeing the shows. There is also a mini disco for the kids before the show. There were always activities going on around the pool and on the beach. The staff did an excellent job at keeping activities going throughout the day so there was always something to do. There was also a kids club for small children as well as a craft table set up daily where you could purchase a ceramic piece to paint & they would glaze it for you. Not sure what the cost was for this though. CHECK OUT: Check out time is 12:00. You can pay $10.00 US per hour to keep your room longer depending on availability. We weren\u2019t able to keep our room because they were overbooked & needed the time in between the next check in time to clean. EXTRAS & TIPS: The resort itself is situated inside a gated community, it\u2019s is very safe area if you want to leave the resort grounds & check things out (they have bikes you can take out until 3pm) Depending on your all inclusive package you get up to 4 a la carte reservations. We received a complimentary bottle of Tequila in our room. No robes, slippers, or amenities, just the basic soaps & things. You will receive 30 minutes of internet usage per room. A cab ride to & from Playa Del Carmen (about a 3 minute drive) will cost you $5.00. A rental car in Playa Del Carmen will cost you about $45.00 (includes tax & basic coverage) we used Hertz & Explora. The Hertz cars are better but Explora will accept a cash deposit rather than credit card should you forget to bring one. Just outside the resort you will find a small market area where you can do some shopping. Most prices compared with the hotel gift shop & Playa Del Carmen shops. As always bring you sunscreen, it\u2019s very expensive to buy there. EXCURSIONS-COZUMEL: We went to Cozumel twice. If you rent your car on the mainland in Playa Del Carmen you\u2019ll get a cheaper rate. The ferry cost is about $47.00 US round trip for 2 people. Once you are in Cozumel you can use the Iberostar there until 6 pm (food etc. still free) Just go to the front desk when you get there & they\u2019ll give you a bracelet. It\u2019s not as good as the Tucan resort, & has a small selection of food, but still nice. We snorkeled on our own the first day around a dock in front of a beach club that (not sure of the name) directly across from the Fiesta Americana hotel. That was pretty good if you\u2019ve never done it before. Not a lot of coral but lots of little fish will come (especially if you feed them) There wasn\u2019t any good snorkeling at the Iberostar here either. In Cozumel we went on the MYSTIC SNORKEL TOUR given by Roswitha Flurry. She takes you to 3 or different reefs & the tour lasts about 41/2 hours (we had prebooked this with Rosie before we left home. The tour cost us $70.00 each & was well worth it. She only takes out a small group of people so it\u2019s no crowded & you get a lot of time to swim around while Rosie points out the different fish she finds & any interesting coral. She\u2019s a lot of fun! For anyone who really enjoys or would like to try snorkeling I recommend her tour. She was really good with the other people on the tour who were new to snorkeling. There wasn\u2019t an abundance of fish but we were still happy with what we did see. The tour also provides fresh fruit & beverages. PLAYA DEL CARMEN: This is a really nice tourist area to visit. Only a 3 minute cab ride ($5.00 US) it\u2019s nicer at night because everything is lit up. There were hundreds of stores to shop in or just look around. The beer is cheap just about everywhere. We ate a restaurant called Ula Gula. They have a nice top floor overlooking the street. We just had a couple of drinks & some quesadillas that were really good. The only down side to Playa Del Carmen was that the locals at the shops were relentless & a lot of items were pretty pricey (most prices were firm) Overall it was one of the best resorts we have stayed at so far.

All hotel people were very helpful, supportive, friendly and professional. ALL of them speak very good English so we had no problems with communications. We did not need to tip any bar tenders to be served quickly, professionally and with smile. Drinks, alcohols, beers and beverages has been to highest standard and top quality. As we have booked ourselves for 12 days we had received invitations for 4 evenings at dedicated restaurants. We have enjoyed all 4 dinners with excellent service and superb food. Have to add that food at the Ibersotar Tucan was delicious and never bored with selection. We get lot of weight over this time as we could not resist excellent Mexican and international food served all the day. Another great experience is wild garden inside the hotel territory with lot of wild and semi wild animals (coati, mara etc) and plenty of different, friendly birds. Special attention for group of wild monkey with little ones on their backs. We felt like to be life with National Geographic. Location and the end of Playa Del Carmen beach is a great advantage as in just few minutes we were out on wild beach if we wanted but also 25 minute walk was enough to get to the City with all attractions for tourists. Hotel also has great pools and is offering bar service on the beach. Number of palapas and sun beds was just enough to get one every day and do not need to fight or reserve. Great thanks to manger Mr Oskar for his help and attention and special thanks again to Cesar from reception.

Everybody is incredibly friendly, smiling, and has a great attitude. The staff, particularly the waiters and activities staffmembers, are enthusiastic and seem to really enjoy their jobs. I never once felt like I was putting anybody out by asking for a favor from a staffmember. Second only to the awesome staff is the beauty of the place itself. An open-air lobby with a few shops and a bar greet guests. A winding boardwalk takes you past some of the restaurants - the Japanese, Mexican, and buffet restaurants - with koi ponds on one side and jungle on the other. The property is shared with the Iberostar Quetzal, which is basically the mirror image of the Tucan. They share a large, beautiful pool and a covered open-air theater. They had a spectacular pre-Colombian Mayan show the first night of our stay and they seem to have something fun going on there each evening. There are all kinds of animals - peacocks, monkeys, tortoises, and several others living on the property. On some evenings, local vendors set up inside of the property and sell items. These vendors are NOT pushy like some of the vendors in town. They have a lot of jewelry, carvings, handbags, and artwork. If you are not interested in buying anything but need to pass by they do not bother you, but I highly recommend taking a look. There is always something to do at the Tucan - dance lessons, archery and rifle shooting tutorials, an introduction to scuba diving in the pool, beach volleyball, table tennis, billiards, and I'm sure there are other things that I didn't even know about. We had no children with us but it looked like there were lots of fun activities for kids too. There is a playground and a kiddie pool and arts and crafts. There were always plenty of lounge chairs by the pool and on the beach. The beach is great and there are lifeguards posted just in case. We never had any trouble getting tables in any of the restaurants either. The food is good and they are very generous with their drinks. There is actually a good variety of food in the buffets and in the grill. We ate at the Caribbean restaurant and the Japanese restaurant. Both had very good food and, of course, friendly service. The Quetzal may be a bit better suited for travelers who like to be out late as the discoteca and late night snack buffet are both on the Quetzal side, but we had no problem skipping across the property at all hours of the night. One of the beauties of Iberostar is that you can use the amenities at either property while you are a guest. The only thing that really caused any kind of problem for us during our stay was, unfortunately, the beds. I have read some reviews that say that the beds are as hard as rocks. These reviews are not entirely wrong. The beds are HARD. It took a little extra stretching each morning to work out whatever knots had developed in our backs overnight. The pillows are nice though.

The \"jungle\" with its monkeys and other animals clearly made this resort more interesting than most. My major complaint was the quality of the buffets. I read many reviews where most people seemed to think the food was good and a few didn't agree. I thought that the few were probably too picky and that they probably had other issues . I am not that hard to please, but I and my entire family of 4 found the food unacceptable with very little variety day after day, so if you did not like the food, you were stuck with the same food meal after meal. Cheese on the buffet in the 90 plus degree weather was not very appetizing. Luncheon type sliced meet that we saw day after day was also not very appealing. The lettuce in their watery containers, the list goes on and on. I also cannot blame the resort for the extremely hot weather this time of year in Mexico, but anyone who goes to Mexico this time of year needs to truly understand how hot it is going to be. It was extremely uncomfortable most of the time and the pool water was actually hot. I was resting by the pool when a couple walked by and said \"is it my imagination or do you feel the heat rising from the pool too.) I promise that it was not their imagination. I also thought that there was going to be a swim up bar in the pool to offset the heat and found that the only swim up bar was in a separate little pool that required you to leave the real pool to enjoy. I do not consider that to be a swim up bar.

Top shelf alcohol found at the lobby bar and theater bar..Absolute vodka and Glenfiddich scotch. I enjoyed that..Not a big fruity drink girl!

I'm an ocean person so this did not bother me at all. But if you have younger kids that LOVE the pool I would try to go in early spring! The entertainment was relaxing and enjoyable in the theater! Beach volleyball was THE BEST ! ..Kayaking fun! The rooms were great ,clean and all Marble walk -in shower! The best part of this vacation was the people..The workers were soo impressive to me.They have an amazing work ethic which I don't see as much at home and they are happy all the time!!!

The beach is great with the most beautiful blue sea, and the pool is huge and very nice. We had no problems with the room, on arrival we had been allocated a room with twin beds, but on request we were switched to a room with a kingsize bed. The bad things. We are early risers, but it was incredibly frustrating to get to the beach at 8:15 am only to find that there were very few people there, but the sunbeds in the best positions had already been reserved. If you want a good place by the pool or on the beach then be prepared to get up early and go down and reserve beds, a lot of people do and all the best spots are gone by 8:00-8:30 am, this is despite signs everywhere saying this is not allowed, but like most rules of the resort they do not seem to be enforced. We also struggled to find somewhere to have a relaxed drink in the evening, after 7pm the choices are the main stage bar or the lobby bar, at the stage bar from 8pm there is an hour of kids entertainment, followed by a show by the Star Friends. If like us you are not into that sort of thing, then the only option is the lobby bar, which really is pretty much part of the hotel lobby/reception and lacked any ambience. The swim up bar was very disappointing, it is in a separate pool and the couple of times we tried it, it was full of very drunken middle aged Americans, who wolf whistled and cat called any woman who went into or even walked past the place. However the biggest problem we had was that I came down with food poisoning, I don\u2019t know exactly what from but we had not been outside the resort in the previous 48 hours, so it was something I picked up there, I was completely laid up for 2 days and it took another week to get over it completely.

I think the resort has a very nice blend of having all the amenities but it also is very comfortable feeling and we loved the open layout of the resort. ROOM: Yes, the beds are very firm, but we asked for a foam pad to be installed and had it in minutes. Rooms are not 5 star but decent. Fridge stocked with beer, soda, water all included. Also, there is a jungle and they have peacocks and howler monkeys. The peacocks can be a little loud sometimes so if that annoys you, you may want to stay closer to the lobby. We were in bldg 24 and it was perfectly centered between the dining and beach area. FOOD: The standard buffets are pretty good if you're not too picky. A variety of foods, but we always found something to eat we liked. Too many to list here. You can book on-site restaurants the day you arrive. They say you can only book 2 if you're staying 6 nights but we got in 4 nights. We loved the Japanese restaurant. The Italian was also very good. Again, not 5 star but still very good. BEACH:Huge pool. Your not suppose to put a towel out to save chairs by the pool or on the beach but as is typical people don't think the rules apply to them. You want a chair near the pool or under the straw huts on the beach?? Better get out there early, or break the rules. Loved the beach. Much nicer than most of the resorts. No top shelf liquor at the beach and Dos Equis beer only. If you want top shelf liquor you have to go to the bars inside the lobby. AREA: Very nice and safe area.

Room was very nice the wife thought the bed was a little hard not me but aditional padding can be requested, spacious inside clean and colorful nice view from balcony no elevator's and my bad knee could not take more than the second floor shouls have asked for 1st floor room, bathroon very nice. Food adequate and fairly good in general especially breakfast. Beach was outstanding clean confortable well planed out enough chairs for everybody but get there early so you can get some shade for the afternoon. Pool area was super very large but laid out perfectly kinda \"sexy\" the only way I can describe it. The food at lunch either at the grill of the buffett exceptional.

I said the food was fairly good the exception was the steak house and suprisingly Mexican rest. which you had to make reservations for I have no reason why . The Japanese rest. Bonsai was excellent, what we expected. The steakhouse was the biggest disapointment, over cooked thin very thin rib eye and a filet that was tough, never saw a filet that tough and also over done. Mexican rest. still realing at the lack of creativity there, they really should be ashamed at what they put out there The dress code is something that has to be explained to me men had to wear long pants but women could wear the shortest skirts I ever saw, not that I am complaining, swimsuits with beach coverups should not count as acceptable attire and we saw both on the women Of the seven places you could eat only 2 speciality rest. were air conditioned, you would never have known it, could not wait to get out of the required long pants. Bars were very good but should be better stocked for mixed drinks(I bartend sometimes so this maybe a little pickey) asked for a couple of drinks they never heard of and not a lot of top shelf stuff. Maybe be better in winter months but the heat just ate you up exhausted by 11pm so not a lot of extra hour adventures.

So to compare this one to the other two, they were all very similar in many ways. The service has always been good and friendly at all places. The rooms always festive and fine. No cockroaches seen at this one, a nice change from the others. The food was average. Lots and lots of variety, and you see lots of the same dishes repeating, but this is still good, you just need to try something new. I tried deep fried hotdogs after swearing I wouldn't and ... omg they were good. My 6 yr old son loved the ice cream on tap and had several helpings a day. The fruit was delicious. The booze was yummy, at dinner and at the pool. The kid's club was quite basic, but the kids loved it on the ocassions that they were there. My complaints: ~the evening shows were too late for us. After a day playing in the sun everyone was sleepy and snoring by 9:30 pm. ~the toilets plug easily, so you can't flush toilet paper down them ~not all the ala cart restuarants seemed kid friendly but we did really enjoy the Japanese grill as a couple (left the kids with Grandma). The weather was rainy for spells on a couple days but we welcomed this. Rain in the jungle is lovely and it gave us a break from the hot sun. We sat in the huge lobby and people watched and sipped drinks instead. By far the best part of the resort was the grounds. It's a gorgeous jungle you have to walk through to get from the rooms to the pools/beach and it's full of animals. We saw the monkey's on most days, heard them daily otherwise. There are different types of birds, exotic and otherwise (parrots, flamingos, swans, ducks, peacocks and others. Different rodents not seen in Canada. Different types of lizards. It's truly lovely. In the mornings we would walk through the grounds to say good morning to the animals. The kids loved it. I also took some time to go to the spa and found my hot stone massage extremely relaxing and wished it would never end. The ladies hands were magic on my body. I walked out of there all loosey goosey and drunk on relaxation. Highly recommend this place as a family vacation.", "Date": "June 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Yorkshire", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely Fantastic.\u201d", "Author": "familyfun056", "ReviewID": "UR66457272", "Content": "Booked with First Choice.

At the bar at bottom of pool near the beach you and your children can help yourselves to soft drinks and water at the self serve dispenser. All brand named soft drinks. There is waiter/ress service around the pool as well. Food-nice burger bar near the beach at lunch time and buffet restaurants away from the pool which was nice to have lunch away from the pool. Evening buffet restaurants very good. We went to the al a carte steak house which was delish. The steak was cooked to perfection-well done for me and medium for my husband. They also have a childrens menu here. The Japanese Restaurant is a must - what a show. Food delish-especially the steak. Our daughters had chicken but wanted to go again just for the show. Entertainment-The 'Star Friends' make an effort with all holidaymakers and make a massive effort with the children when they do daily dance routines in the pool.

We had an awesome time. Check in was a breeze. We got to the resort at around 4:00. I emailed the resort the week before we arrived and requested a room on the top floor near the beach and that is exactly what we got. We had to wait about 15 minutes for our room to be ready, but that wasn\u2019t a problem. We just hit the bar and took our time walking to the room. The room was very clean. I tipped Alberto, our cleaning person, a couple of dollars every day and he stocked up our fridge everyday, instead of every other day with plenty of drinks and made the room look very nice. The beach is better than ever. The days we were there were a bit on the windy side, so it was a yellow flag day most days, but we were still able to go out into the water. You have to get there early to get a palapa, or you can check out a beach umbrella from the towel hut. We also rented kayaks and a Hobie cat and had a great time taking those out into the water. The pool is beautiful and very large. We never had a problem finding a chair around the pool. They say that you cannot save chairs with books or towels, but they do not enforce that rule. I do wish that they would have had more fun pool activities and more music throughout the day. It seemed like the music was somewhat sporadic. The staff is super friendly and very helpful. Most everybody speaks English and Spanish, but they do appreciate when you try to speak Spanish. The food at the buffet was decent, pretty typical for buffet food. The ala carte restaurants were fabulous. We ate at the Mexican, Italian and Japanese. The Mexican and Italian were excellent and the Japanese was good, but more fun. Again, I was able to email the resort ahead of time to get 2 of the 3 restaurant reservations. The other reservation was made at the hotel after 4:00 at guest services. Drinks were very good. They will give you the good stuff if you specifically ask for it at the lobby bar. They have a list of all of the liquor that is available. The grounds are beautifully maintained. The monkeys are fun to watch, but be careful when you walk underneath them, speaking from personal experience. The Quetzal side has a beautiful water fall and lots of flamingoes, swans, ducks and other animals. Overall it was a great experience.

It's a little confusing at times to figure out the restaurants and what's open and when, but there is no shortage of food and I thought the food was very good. The basics for the kids that won't eat much all the way up to fairly exotic foods. We had a blast. Monkeys in the trees 15 minutes after arrival, woke up the next morning to monkeys right outside our window. We had an iguana that was living underneath the sidewalk out in front of our building that the kids would go check routinely. The staff was always extremely helpful and courteous. Now we decided that we would tip even though tipping is included. Even prior to that though, the staff was always incredible, however you could tell the new ones versus the veterans. The evening entertainment was at times cheesy, but our family routinely found it to be lots of fun and our kids couldn't wait for \"The Big Show\" each night. They even took short siestas in the afternoon to be able to make it through the program at night. The pool closes at 7pm and the beach starts to close up around 5 even though the beach technically doesn't close. If you don't want kids around this is not the resort for you, but there was enough programming, things to do, and families, that I never found it to be over the top or distracting at all.

We never tired of watching them perform acrobatics and we enjoyed watching their baby.

We purchased massages which were phenomenal. The only disappointment we had with the Tucan was the evening entertainment. We had hoped to go dancing a few nights but the lobby bar entertainers are for easy listening background music only. The disco DJ played loud Latin techno music exclusively for salsa dancing.

Only music in restauraunts and lobby bar (at night) Nothing to do at night but watch shows Adult swim up bar is tiny and main pool is to deep to hang out in No elevator , we had to climb 4 flights of stairs to get to our room wich was hard when there is already a ton of walking just to get from one place to the next in this hotel. THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW!!!! Iberostar Tucan and Iberostar Quetzal DO NOT MIRROR each other as it has been said! They share the same pool, beach and restauraurants but the QUETZAL side is much nicer. That is where all the wildlife is. If you like the Monkes, flamingos, waterfall, ducks, peacocks.... you will want to stay on the quetzal side! Peacocks can be seen every now and then on the Tucan side but mostly enjoy hanging out at Quetzal. I had a wonderful and peacful time, but I was plenty sore from all the walking. My friend and I went to combine party and relax time. There were absolutely no singles at this hotel. Only couples and families with small children. Most of the other guest were from other countries so not a lot of english speaking, which makes it hard if you like to intract with other vacationers. I will definately choose this hotel when returning with my 9 year old daughter! It would be perfect for her and I, but... When I go back as a single with friends looking for some nightlife and poolside parties I will not choose this place. In conclusion, I was very happy with Iberostar.

The hotel is huge and has excellent facilities. The rooms were comfortable, spacious and clean with a rustic/traditional mexican feel to them. We moved from block 15 to block 12 without a problem (block 15 was just a little bit too close to the entertainment and could be a bit noisy). The food was faultless and considering the amount of guests and nationalalities they cater for they had a wide variety of food for breakfast, lunch and dinner, which was always fresh and replenished. The A La Carte restaurants were very good, however a little confusing when you book they offer you 6 places even though the rep advised we should be able to have 8. The pool area is very busy and within the 1st few days we could not get a bed - the \"strict\" rule of no reserving sun beds clearly does not apply and we saw beds reserved that were'nt used all day! Having collected a couple from the beach we were satisfied - it may have been so busy because there were strong winds on the beach and you got sand blasted, after a few days the beach seemed to return to normal and there were a few spare beds available if you happened to venture down after 9am.. The beach is great and you can get a bed under the parasols or further down where you get a lovely sea breeze. You can also gaze out at the beautiful ocean! The staff at this resort are brilliant! So happy and helpful, they really cannot do enough for you. Tipping is recommended as they are paid such low wages; they really appreciate the tip whatever amount. The star friends entertainers are always out and about and always doing something to keep people entertained, toward the end of our holiday they seemed to be doing more and had giant jenga round the pool and were doing games on the beach. Its great to have the beach so close to the pool as you have the best of both and we found the staff to be constantly cleaning the pool area and grounds. The grounds are well kept and have a wide variety of animal life already mentioned on previous posts. They do not bother you at all, its nice to see and always makes you smile when you see another bird or animal. Its worth having a walk round both sides of the hotels (they are a mirror image of each other). We went into Playa del carmen a few times and its worth noting if you havent been before to have dollars and pesos with you. We were not advised that we would need to use dollars for trips, excursions and entry into places like coco bongo and peso's for shopping, drinks etc. You can change dollars at 5th avenue for a better deal than the hotel. We did a trip to isla mejeures but would not recommend this, the only thing that was good about it was the snorkeling. We wished we had of gone to Cozumel instead.

We stayed on the \u201cTucan\u201d side \u2013 though the whole resort is open to you no matter which side your room is on. Initial Impressions: We arrived at the hotel at 3:45pm on Saturday after suffering a horrendous flight from BOS to CUN (due to the pilots use of a \u2018shortcut\u2019 which, on the whole, turned out to be a bad idea due to the turbulence we encountered because of it.) needless to say, we were exhausted and just wanted to get into our rooms. When we pulled up we were greeted by the bell persons who took care of our luggage, but we were not greeted with drinks or anything like that, which is unusual for this type of resort I\u2019m told. One of our rooms was not ready and we were told that check-in wasn\u2019t until 3pm. The problem with that was that it was already 3:45pm so that was no excuse. To make matters even worse, we were told the room wouldn\u2019t be ready for another hour still. When finally it was ready, it was the wrong room type but at that point we just wanted to get settled in so we didn\u2019t make a fuss about it. It would have been nice for the staff to offer to take the key to us instead of the couples who\u2019s room wasn\u2019t ready having to trek all the way back to the lobby to get it. The rooms: We were in building #12. I felt they were more than adequate. They were big enough to suit our needs, we all had balconies or patios with different views, and we were close to the pool and beach. The bathrooms were decent, and the showers were nice and spacious. Nobody in my party had problems with water temp or pressure. The beds were firm, just like the reviews say, but I thought they were very comfortable, even though I\u2019m used to a pillow top mattress. There is a mini-bar that contains domestic beer, (no American beers are served at the resort, but you can get them in town and at most restaurants, same is true for other international beers.) Coca-Cola products, (they DO NOT taste the same as those bottled in the U.S.) and water. The policy is that the mini bar will be restocked every other day, but mine was restocked every day. Lastly but most importantly, the rooms were always very clean, though one day one of the rooms was not cleaned until early evening, and even then only at the request of the couple occupying it. Lobby and Grounds: The lobby is open-air, with lots of seating and a relaxed bar area. They have a gift shop but it is WAY over-priced so only shop there if you need to. There are ceiling fans throughout the area but it still gets very warm and muggy, however this is Mexico and hot and humid is how it goes down there. The grounds are very well kept for the size of the resort and the amount of people milling about with food and drinks and such. Once in a while, you will see the odd glass or can here and there, but that is due more to inconsiderate guests than to lack of upkeep on the part of the staff. There are a lot of paths and trails throughout the resort with lots of animals roaming about \u2013 peacocks, monkeys, chickens, lizards, swans, flamingos, and these rodent things that look like over-sized rats with no tails. All of the trees and vegetation seemed in good shape and well looked after. Be sure to take the time to walk all of the different paths throughout the property, that way you will maximize your chances of seeing all of the different animals, and I am sure there are more than those I\u2019ve listed. Pool/Beach area: The beach was beautiful! The sand was clean and maintained everyday, and there were plenty of chairs. The erosion is very noticeable though \u2013 but the staff tries to smooth it out as much as possible. The water was perfect and a gorgeous azure blue. The pool was also great \u2013 very big and relatively clean for the size and the amount of people in it. The pool bar was not great though \u2013 it was set towards the back and wasn\u2019t very clean at all. We were able to get the same row of seats right next to the edge of the pool everyday except one, but even then we were only one row back. We stayed under those big umbrella things (not really umbrellas, they are made of wood and straw, I forget the proper name for them) because the sun was very strong as we had perfect weather every day. One thing about the weather though \u2013 I made the mistake of constantly checking the weather forecast starting a week before we left for vacation. The forecast was rain for almost every day but as I checked the current days weather, it was always sunny. I read that the forecast almost always calls for rain on most days, but that it rarely rains during this season. Of course it will rain from time to time but just don\u2019t stress yourself out about forecasts. Food: The food was Ok\u2026 but nothing to write home about. The breakfast was pretty good and certainly had the most to offer, but the lunch and dinner buffets seemed very repetitive, though to be fair they did offer some variety on the more exotic types of food. Some of my party (me included) are very picky and somewhat \u2018plain\u2019 eaters, while the others were a little more adventurous so really it depends on what you are looking for. This being an all-inclusive resort, they have to try and balance pleasing everybody and being mindful of cost and waste so I understand it\u2019s no easy task. I think they do alright though. At lunch we mostly ate at the pool snack bar \u2013 pizza, burgers, hot dogs, french-fries and the like. We didn\u2019t try the sit-down restaurants because we were not interested in dressing for dinner \u2013 just a quick note on that though: I understands the desire for some people to sit in a restaurant with table service and I also understand that there should be a dress code, however, I feel that at a resort like this the \u201clong pants for gentleman\u201d requirement is a little too much. Certainly a nice pair of shorts and a polo-shirt should suffice. The drinks were pretty good but on the weak side. The taste of the ice also made a difference in most of their drinks. The deserts were pretty good, again depending on your taste, and the service in the Cozumel buffet (Quetzal side) was a lot better than that in the Tulum buffet. One last note on the food \u2013 try the hard ice cream by the beach/pool area \u2013 it\u2019s a lot better than the soft-serve. Staff/Service: The staff was very friendly and for the most part worked really hard to get things done. Its true that they don\u2019t expect to be tipped, but do so when you can because they appreciate it and they certainly earn it- especially the servers who do all the running around at the pool/beach area \u2013 they have A LOT of ground to cover. We saw just one show (the Hollywood show) and it was pretty good. The \u201cStar Friends\u201d work hard to put the shows on- on top of being around during the day to play pool games and do regular tasks such as serving drinks and handing out towels and pool equipment. They seem to work very long hours. As far as off of the resort \u2013 we went to 5th Avenue a couple of times and did some eating/drinking/shopping which was fun but we were all really, really turned off by the shop keepers trying to call us into their stores. They don\u2019t like to be told \u201cno\u201d and one of them even called us a name when we refused to stop for him. There is also a small shopping plaza within walking distance of the hotel if you need a Starbucks fix or if you want to do some souvenir shopping. Some of us took an excursion to Shel-Ha which was a lot of fun, and others of us took an excursion with Discovery Jungle Tours (zipline/ATV) which was also fun but make sure you bring some mosquito repellant!!! All having been said, everyone had a good time and the resort was nice and relatively well run. The two of us who vacation in Mexico semi-yearly feel that their experiences at the RUI resorts were better overall and will be returning to that brand next time. (Their reasoning is that the RUI brand, in their opinion, provides slightly better service and a better food selection \u2013 as well as rights to its sister properties. Of course the Iberostar also provides rights to their sister properties, but they are a distance away whereas with RUI they are all within walking distance.) I think you need to really think about what is important to you before making your decision, if its gourmet food, all-inclusives are probably not the best idea. If its water and the beach, with a mind to budget-friendliness, then an all-inclusive would probably serve you well and Iberostar Tucan may be just what you\u2019re looking for.", "Date": "May 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "boston", "Title": "\u201cApril vacation\u201d", "Author": "redsoxBoston", "ReviewID": "UR63415423", "Content": "Overall this was a great hotel,resort, it was right on the ocean.

We stayed in an Oceanfront Jr. Suite and the room was large and spacious and clean. They need more towel racks in the bathroom/shower as there is no real place to hang anything and lighting could be better in there.

I had also requested a room with an upper level balcony but received a ground floor room.

You may not necessarily want to share a bed with your friends.

The Japanes was the worst of the bunch (God-awful) and the Steakhouse the best although the meat arrived cold. However, when you are dealing with the masses and all-inclusive , I did not expect fine food so I was not totally bummed out.

I can see why other reviewers might think they are hard, but I didn't find them uncomfortable. I've also seen reviews say the safe it too small. It easily fit my SLR camera and everything else we needed locked up. Beach - spectacular, can't beat it Food - I preferred the Japanese restaurant the most. If you schmooze with the staff, you can get extra reservations. All of the restaurants were fine, depending upon what you ordered. All restaurants have a great ambience. You can't beat all-inclusive drinks all day long. Breakfast was especially great. Ask Jose Fernandez for the Mexican Coffee at the Mexican restaurant. You won't be disappointed. Service - All of the workers are very committed to customer satisfaction. We received top-notch service at every restaurant, from the ladies serving drinks at the pool, etc. Of course, I would recommend bringing a bunch of $1-bills to reinforce that. It certainly worked for us! Entertainment - the shows are pretty kid-focused, but they make an effort! Suggestions for improvement- overall, I loved this place. It was great for our couples-only adventure and would be a perfect family trip as well. I do wish they had a bar open late into the evening right on the beach.

Went with 25 other people. We were all there for our wedding. Everyone really enjoyed the resort and the area. Because we were getting married in Mexico, we had spent a lot of time looking for the right resort. We had to consider the ages of the people with us. (ranging from 8 to 70) And also had to consider which place had the best wedding package and wedding setting. Pricing for resorts was a consideration, but after we found the Tucan, we loosened the purse strings a bit. Lucky we did, because it turned out to be Amazing!! Food- There were 2 Buffet buildings on site. Both were about the same size. Buffet food was good. Always an abundance of food, and never saw an empty serving container on the buffet. Lunch was a bit repetitive, but always tasty. Always left there feeling satisfied. Dinner was great, Great selection of mains, sides and desserts. Ohh and the special flaming coffee! Wow was that ever good! Never had to wait in line at the serving stations, or anywhere at the buffet. A La Carte restaurants were very nice. We tried the Japanese, which is teppanyaki style, where they cook in front of you. It is always busy, so book ahead, and you should try the sake with dinner! The Mexican restaurant was good. Very Authentic and great service. Also we tried the Steak House, and that was for our wedding dinner with all of our guests. We had a choice between a couple menu selections and everyone loved their meals. The wedding cake was Outstanding!! I often think about that cake, and the chocolate covered strawberries. Beach Restaurant was great for a quick snack on the way to/from rooms , or just go get out of the sun for a while. Seafood, finger foods, burgers.. hits the spot. Rooms were Very clean and cool. Only on the first night did we notice and noise from the entertainment show. All of the buildings are pretty much the same, except the ones right at the water. Cleaning staff did a great job of tidying up and restocking the minibar. Also, they often left cute towel art on the beds, and fresh fruit. Safe in the room, accessed by a code that you program into it. Bathrooms very clean, water pressure and temperature was great. Pool/Beach/Grounds - didn\u2019t actually swim in the pool, but it looked very nice. The Beach was where it\u2019s at for me. Nice deep beach with many chairs and shade if you want it. Never had a problem finding chairs on the beach, and I think the resort was just about 80% Capacity? Not sure. Beach was always clean and there were sports games to play if you wanted to, and boats to rent.. Lots to do. Water was nice and clean. On one side of the Tucan, there were many resorts heading up to Playa Del Carmen, but on the other side, there was only 1 resort, and then open beach. This made for less traffic on the beach, and it tended to be a bit quieter than the others up the beach. Sand was nice and didn\u2019t look like there was any problems with erosion. There was \u2018whales\u2019 or sandbags in the water , but after a day of seeing them, you really get used to them. The rest of the resort was laid out very well. I really enjoyed walking through the jungle setting in the middle of the resort. It was surprisingly big and you can almost get lost in there! I like it because it felt like you were transitioning between beach and buildings, and it was a refreshing scenario to be in, the scenery really made the day seem longer, or that you were seeing so many different things. Also it was fun to see the WILD life on the way. Peacocks and the little furry creatures, I forget their names. Chickens and other Birds. They also had a few animals that were on display. Giant Turtles, Flamingos, Macaws and of course, Tucans!! Great for kids, or anyone for that matter. Ohh and I can\u2019t forget about the monkeys! Didn\u2019t see them too often, but some of our guests heard them a couple times during the night. Location- the resort is located in Playacar community, it\u2019s a great little subdivision, right beside Playa Del Carmen. But as I said earlier about the beach, it\u2019s almost the furthest away from the town. But still it\u2019s only a 4 minute cab ride away. Not far at all. You could even walk there if you were so inclined. Playa del Carmen isn\u2019t too far away from Cancun, but enough to make it feel like you are really on a holiday, away from a big city. Also close to attractions off site, Cozumel, ruins, parks etc. Staff- Resort staff were always friendly and helpful. Starfriends entertainment group were over the top! Great nightly entertainment and each day they were leading activities on the beach. Front desk staff were accommodating and polite. Didn\u2019t have any problems with them. Restaurant and buffet Staff were excellent. No complaints there. Lobby Bar waitress was always there, and she was great. She got to know what we were drinking and would show up with 2 drinks for each person without asking. They work hard. They provided great service and I respect them for that. Wedding- We honestly couldn\u2019t have picked a better location for our wedding. It was absolutely beautiful. We were very lucky to be able to work with the wedding coordinator, Gabriella and her team, to make our wedding special. Gabriella took care of all the details and timed everything perfectly. I was really impressed that everything went off without any problems. Even when dealing with her via Email before we arrived, she was prompt and polite. She wasn\u2019t reluctant to offer and advise. She is an expert. Her and the rest of the staff made us feel like royalty on our wedding day. The ceremony location is great for photos, it\u2019s right at the beach, and it has quite a few palm trees nearby. Ceremony decorations were just what we wanted. A great thing about this resort, is that they only do 1 wedding per day here. Which means you get the full attention of the wedding coordinator on your special day, and you aren\u2019t rushed in or out of the ceremony/dinner/dancing. Overall I would rate this resort Very Highly, and recommend it to any group of people, or just couples. It a pretty diverse resort, with lots to see and do. I will be back to this resort!

This helps to avoid the \"all inclusive blahs\" - whereby you feel like you are in a bubble. We also greatly enjoyed the Dolphina excusion, where you spend 45 minutes with dolphins. A lot of fun, especially for children. The so so's - service is only OK. But certainly not outstanding (as in Jamaica). Food is good but not great, and we certainly got tired of the buffet. Make sure to get your reservations for the specialty restaurants the day you arrive. The do fill up, and it is hard to get a seat standby (unlike Jamaica). Finally, I hope you don't get the type of heavy rain we experienced half the time we were there. It seemed like a freak of nature (but I've read other reviews suggesting that it was fairly common this year). When it rains, there is not a heck of a lot to do at this resort, other than drink.

Decided we'd pay extra for the beach ocean-view junior suite. I had read on line that the Quetzal side was a a little nicer and had a better overall view than the Tucan side. When we booked through our agent we requested the Quetzal side and were told we had it. Also asked her to confirm the day before we left which she did. Upon arrival we were booked into the Tucan side and were told there were no other rooms available. Not a good start. Once in the room I looked it over pretty thoroughly. The view was fine. The Tucan has a few more palms out in front but I didn't mind that and we could still see plenty of the ocean. The room was a bit \"tired' looking but nothing a fresh coat of paint and some refinishing of the wood work wouldn't fix. The bath was fine. Nice big shower for two (even three?). Sticker on the mirror over the sink warned you to not drink the faucet water so we always had a bottle or two of water for drinking or brushing our teeth. Guests in other rooms said they didn't have the sticker in their bathrooms. The biggest problem we had with the room was the presence of tiny little bugs. Very small and fast moving. We saw them mainly over near the mini-bar fridge but they were also in other spots around the room. Seemed like they would congregate in areas where there might have been something spilled or dropped in the past. Maybe we were over reacting but I feel that when you are paying $300 plus a night you shouldn't have something like this in your room. We contacted the desk and they acted surprised and a little offended that we would suggest there was such a thing possible. They said they'd send maintenance up to check. We left and came back a few hours later and the bugs were gone. Couldn't smell the insecticide but we still opened the patio doors and turned on the ceiling fan before leaving for the evening. The next morning the bugs were back but in fewer numbers. Eventually, supposedly after two more visits by maintenance (were were never there when they came) we still had bugs so we called our agent and she contacted the desk. Within 15 minutes there was a knock and two young guys came into the room with can of Raid House and Garden spray and sprayed where I showed them the bugs seemed to be congregating. After they finished, I told them to leave the can so we could use it again if necessary. They did and it was. The little critters were pretty persistent and would show up every other day or so but never in the numbers which we saw at first. It became my routine to check the problem areas and do a little light spraying before leaving the room in the morning and that seemed to do the trick. Spoke to other guests and some in the other ocean front rooms said they also had them but guests in rooms away from the beach said they didn't. Did it spoil our trip? No. It was more of a nuisance than anything but I do feel that it shouldn't happen and that some sort of compensation would have been a nice way to make up for the experience. Would I book an ocean front room again? Yes - but I'd pack my own can of spray to take along with me. We had no problem with mosquitoes or sand fleas while we were there. Now for the rest of the review: PROS: * The grounds are truly amazing. The paths through the \"jungle\" area between the lobby and main buffet restaurants and the beach were beautiful. We always had our camera ready since we never knew what we'd see. Monkeys, peacocks, guinea fowl, the large guinea pig like rodents (very cute and timid - never threatening), lemurs, iguanas, and a variety of birds all helped to make it a very special place to be. We even enjoyed the resort's resident cats who wandered around the grounds. Very friendly but never a nuisance. All of the beach problems from back in January and February are gone. You couldn't find a nicer beach and the palm thatched shelters provided much needed shade. The beach was kept quite clean in spite of the idiots who don't seem to care where they throw their trash or cigarette butts. * Maintenance was very good (the \"room bugs\" issue aside). There was an army of people constantly working to keep the area and grounds clean. There were always staff busy cutting and raking, wiping up, picking up, cleaning the pools, you name it. As much effort as they put into the grounds I had to wonder why the rooms seemed to be somewhat neglected. * Service was outstanding. Our room was always well cleaned (aside from the bug issue) and the mini-bar restocked every day. We went through a lot of water so we were always leaving a note requesting more. About the third day there was a gallon of bottled water when we returned. Guess our maid felt that was the best way to deal with us. Always had a new towel sculpture on the bed, fresh sheets, and plenty of clean towels. Service was equally good in all of the restaurants and beach/pool areas. Rarely went for more than fifteen minutes while on the beach or at the pool before someone would come by to ask if we wanted something from the bar. The waiters in the restaurants were always attentive and friendly and would suggest things that might be special for that evening or morning (example - ground Mexican coffee with rum the first night in the buffet. Served in little clay mugs - very strong but good. A real teat for a coffee lover). * Food was more than adequate. Let's face it. If you want truly gourmet food why are you going to an all inclusive? The buffet venue had it's good and not so good items - just like any buffet. The selection was more than adequate at all meals but the breakfasts were hard to beat. Freshly made omelets, a large variety of fresh fruit juices, a large tureen of hot chocolate (not instant coco), great coffee. Dinners in the buffets were perhaps not quite as good but again I felt there was more than enough to choose from and you soon found the things that you really liked. We ate in the Italian, Japanese, and steakhouse specialty restaurants. The Italian was our least favorite. The Japanese was very good as was the steakhouse. Didn't do the Mexican or tropical restaurants. There are also two smaller buffet style restaurants down near the beach. They serve pretty much the same quality of food the two large buffets but with a smaller selection (these were open for breakfast and lunch but then became the tropical and steakhouse restaurants at night). There was also a burger and hot-dog grill near the beach which serve good fare - the mojos were my weakness. There was self serve soft ice cream and in the afternoon a guy would show up with an ice cream cart and serve various flavors of hard ice cream. It's true the mixed drinks were generally pretty weak. That was fine with my wife bit I'd always request a double or triple shot and was never refused. We're not big drinkers but I'd have to say the alcohol quality in most of the drinks was on the lower end. However, they did have the better stuff there so all you needed to do was ask and they'd provide. * Entertainment was okay. As others have noted, the staff works hard at it but it's sort of hit and miss. Still, I appreciated the effort and didn't really expect much to begin with. * Check out was easy. We weren't being picked up until 2:00 so we were were allowed to keep our bracelets after the noon check out time and still had access to a changing facility, with shower and sink, up near the lobby. made it nice to still enjoy a few more hours by the pool and be able to eat, drink, and clean-up before leaving. CONS: * Rooms were nothing special. Adequate, but not as nice as other resorts seemed to boast. In our opinion the grounds and beach made up for it. * Communication between the front desk and maintenance staff. I blame the front desk for this. Our concerns didn't seem to be too important to them. A good example was the afore mentioned insect issue. Another example is when the hair dryer in the bathroom wouldn't work . We reported it early in the morning before we left for the day on a tour. When we returned that evening, it still wasn't fixed. We then directly called maintenance and there was someone there within ten minutes. Special note to the ladies - my wife says you should definitely bring your own hair dryer. I have very short hair so I never use one but my wife, who also has short hair, says it's the worst hotel hair dryer she's ever used. She said she'd pity a woman with long hair trying to use it. It was the one thing she regretted not bringing. * The \"chair game\". As mentioned by others, people would start to reserve chairs early in the morning. If you didn't have yours by 9:30 or so, you might be out of luck. Although there are signs everywhere saying it isn't allowed, as well as a notice in your room, it was never enforced. I could understand someone leaving their chairs for an hour or so to go have lunch or to take a walk, but some people claimed a chair or hut and then disappeared for half the day. I feel it would be well served to have one person in charge of the beach area and another in the pool area whose job would be to patrol the areas and remove towels and personal items from chairs which went unoccupied for more than two hours. After a few times of this occurring, people would realize that the hotel meant it and the problem would pretty much disappear. As it was, everyone ignored the posting because it was never enforced. The larger pool side cabanas were even worse. We saw one older couple in the same one all day long for three days in a row. There are only a few of these so you should be allowed to use one once for half a day during a six day visit (we figured they must have been getting down there at 4;00 every morning to claim it). The resort staff could easily monitor this and make these available for more people to enjoy. MISC: * Smokers are a pain in the [--] ! This isn't the resort's fault and I'm sure it's the same at any resort down there but I have to mention it. I guess we're spoiled here in the states with the largely non-smoking areas we are used to but for me it just comes down to a matter of courtesy. You would be sitting in your chairs on the beach only to have someone sit down next to you and proceed to smoke their brains out (wait - these people don't HAVE any brains) for the rest of the day - totally oblivious to the fact that you are choking on it. You'd like to move except by then there often wouldn't be any other chairs or shelters to move to. Again, not the resort's fault but still a major annoyance. * For almost the entire seven days we were there I was very impressed by the behavior of the other guests (except the smokers). We never worried about a book or cap being taken if left on a chair for a while (although you wouldn't want to push your luck and leave a camera or ipod laying about). There was very little rowdiness or drunken behavior observed. A few times people came up to their rooms late at night and were somewhat noisy but it was nothing excessive (I always use silicone earplugs when sleeping in a hotel). On our last full day a newly arrived group showed up on the beach and proceeded to turn on their boom box and then act like drunken idiots. I'm all for enjoying yourself and having a good time but I can never fathom the mentality of people who behave in a manner that negatively impacts everyone around them. I was ashamed to note that they were from the states. We hope they all ended up with horrendous sunburns and killer hangovers the next morning. * We thought the beds were fine. Firm, but not the concrete like slabs as many others described. Some may prefer really soft beds and for them the beds would probably be uncomfortable. Summary: Good value for the money. Beautiful grounds and beach. Adequate rooms and food. Outstanding service from the regular staff - the main desk needs to be more attentive and be sure to follow through on reasonable requests. Would I stay here again? Yes, but we'll likely go to a different resort because part of the fun is going to new places.", "Date": "April 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lenexa, KS", "Title": "\u201cMagnificent!!!\u201d", "Author": "LadyPLenexa", "ReviewID": "UR62102800", "Content": "We recently took our first trip to Mexico and stayed at the Iberostar Tucan in Playa del Carmen.

The Iberostar Quetzel (located right next door) has a disco that opens at 11 pm nightly which played great disco music.

It was fantastic! Rooms: The rooms were nice and very clean. We were on the third floor and had monkeys on our balcony all of the time. Food: The lunch buffets became repetitive but we were there for 2 weeks. The food was good and the dinner buffets had many options. The restaurants were delicious and you have to book your reservations early in the week. Our favorite a-la-carte restaurants were the Italian and the Japanese. Pool/beach: Beautiful! The beach was clean and there were lots of chairs available. If you want a cabana or umbrella you have to get to the beach early. The pool was refreshing but quite deep. If you want prime seating around the pool you have to get there around 7am! My only complaint is that we had to wake up at 6:30am to get chairs around the pool because people reserve chairs and then dont actually sit in them!! Playa del Carmen: For $5 the cabs will take you to the shopping centre in town. That is also where you get onto the ferry to get to Cozumel. There is another shopping centre which is only a 5 minute walk from the hotel. Wedding: Gabriela was our wedding planner and she was amazing. She helped us through the entire day. Our initial meeting with her only took about 45 minutes and she explained exactly what would happen on our wedding day. The sunset ceremony on the beach was beautiful and exactly what we wanted. The hotel only does one wedding a day so you never feel rushed or unimportant. Dinner in the Tropical restaurant was delicious and all of our guests loved the meal. The cheese cake was very yummy! With 43 guests we had the entire restaurant to ourselves. We rented the disco between 8:30 -10:30pm and it was well worth the money. The DJ will play his own music or your personal IPOD or CD.

I read many reviews and agree that this is a great hotel on a great beach for families. I felt the hotel and grounds were safe for my 10 year old and 14 year old to roam around without holding their hand. The jungle setting and animals delighted my boys. They especially liked the peacocks and I was thrilled to see the monkeys. The beach was beautiful with enough chairs and shade. The pool was warm and clean. The pool games were fun for kids of all ages and the opportunity to try scuba diving in the pool was a treat. The staff tried hard to keep up with all the glasses, plates, and towels that just accumulate. I felt many guest could have tried to clean up after themselves better. The beach bar was great...they churned out an amazing number of cocktails. I didn't not go to the swim up bar. The ice-cream on the beach every day was yummy. The food was good. Not great but good. There was a little bit of everything with the entrees changing nightly. I enjoyed the grouper and seafood kabobs the best. They also had roast turkey one evening which was good. If you like Mexican food you would be very satisfied. There were Mexican dishes on the buffet-morning, noon and night. The Adobe chicken and guacamole were my lunch favorites. I also enjoyed the made to order eggs and the vast amount of fruit offered. I didn't think the wine was very good so I didn't drink much of that choosing cocktails instead. We went to the Japenese restaurant and I didn't think it was very good. The food was just stir fryed without any real flavor of ginger or spice. We also went to the steak house and it was okay. We couldn't get in until 9 so I think I just wasn't interested in food by then. The rooms were adequate. They are showing their age but we weren't in the room much. The cleaning people did a good job. I did leave a few dollars/pesos for them every day. There was plenty of towels, soap, etc. The room worked out well for us as the coach was really a platform bed-giving my boys seperate beds. The beds were hard-but I got use to it after the first night. Didn't think it was worth the trouble to get the pads. We rented a car at the hotel and went to Coba and Tulum one day. It was alot for one day but doable.

We have been to Mexico several times, and a couple times on the Riviera Maya... This was definitely the best trip yet. The only thing I didn't like about the whole trip was the fact that it took us so long to get to the resort from the airport. We were transported on a huge bus and had to stop at several resorts to drop off other people. We were the 2nd to the last to be dropped off. The bus was air-conditioned... but a long ride as we were anxious to arrive. The entire week was wonderful. Our check-in was effortless, our bags arrived to the room within 15 min. after we arrived. Our room was very clean, bright and had all the ammenities. Since most of the rooms (except the junior suites) don't face the ocean, I thought I would be disappointed... but just the opposite. Our balcony looked over the jungle and beautiful flowers, etc. Every morning we sat on our balcony and watched a family of monkies play. We could hear the ocean and smell the salt air. The gardens and grounds are amazingly beautiful... and so natural for a tropical setting. It's like no other place I've been. The staff was just wonderful. They responded to every need and then some. I took one yoga class on the beach and the woman who led the class remembered me the rest of the week and greeted me each time we ran across each other. The beach is wonderful... huge and open. Lots for us and the teens to do. The tennis courts are in great shape, the pool is huge and wonderful. The food was great (although we never ate in any of the restaurants, didn't make reservations in advance)... the buffet was perfect! The beach restaurant was great too... and so convenient. Nice shopping a few blocks down the street... don't even have to go into Playa Del Carmen if you don't want to... but if so, it's only a $5 cab.

The staff is great and super friendly. They really come and get to know you. They have different games and funny stuff to keep you entertained. There is one huge pool. Very nice with shallow ends that a great for little kids. No really a bar in the pool. There is a aqua bar but it didn't look appealing and it was closed most of the time. Dance lessons and aqua aerobics every day. Games at the pool and animations. The food is acceptable. Breakfast was the best. Not a lot of choices for picky eater kids.

We have stayed at various resorts along the Playacar/ Playa del Carmen beach, and this one is our favorite. First I will say that it is not a luxury property, and those of you that require 5 star accommodations in the US may want to look at properties more like the Riu Palace, just a few doors up. However, rates reflects this. I feel that the Iberostar is more of a moderate property, but has so many wonderful things going for it that we always feel like our time there was a little slice of heaven. ROOMS: We pay a little extra for the ocean front jr.suite, and feel it is totally worth it. It is so nice to wake up to the scent and sounds of the ocean, and your balcony has a gorgeous view of the turquoise waters and white sand. These rooms are more spacious, have additional toiletries and white robes, flat screen TV (standard rooms still have the old kind), have the special mattress toppers already on the beds for you, and a beautiful birds of paradise flower arrangement. On this particular trip there was also a tropical fruit basket, bottle of wine and two t shirts to say thank you for visiting again. All of the rooms still have the same decor which could use some updating. But we still love the travertine marble and granite bathroom. The shower is huge, but no tub. BEACH: For those of you that witnessed the erosion of the beaches here a couple of years ago, do not worry. They have been completely restored and you can walk all the way to town again along the shore. The Iberostar has a huge beach area now. FOOD: I am a foodie and although I would not rate this as top notch cuisine, I am always able to find great things to eat at the buffets. I look for the local dishes, which are excellent. I really enjoy their local fish topped with pico de gallo , gaspacho soup, guacamole, shredded pork and beef dishes, etc. They try to cater to many different nationalities and there foods that just don't appeal to others. There are many offerings that will work for kids. We also ate at the Steak house and Mexican sit down restaurants and had very good meals. By the way, we e-mailed the hotel ahead of time [--] and they made our reservations for us so we didn't have to deal with that when we got there. The contact is Caroline Rodriguez. DRINKS: Much better at the lobby bar and restaurants. So...why do we like this place more than the rest? Beautiful lush, tropical grounds, gorgeous, huge pool area, one of the best beaches in the area, good food, family friendly (but not Disney Cruise crazy) able to book ocean front room (some resorts face differently), property is easy to navigate and everything is convenient,can walk to town by shore or through Playacar development.

This resort is also called the Iberostar Quetzel, which is on the other side but connected. The resort is very different with its jungle type atmosphere. All the staff and guests were really friendly. The rooms are 4 star and definetly not 5 star, very basic. We stayed in bldg. 11 near the beach which was pretty quiet. Yes the beds are hard, no big deal, we asked for a foamy for the bed and staff were re-making the beds in 10mins. This is quick because it is at least a 5 min. golf cart ride from the lobby to our room. The buffet is good, pretty comparable to most other buffets, breakfeast is usually the best at all inclusive resorts from my experience. The restaurants are ok, this is very subjective as it depends on what type of food you are used to eating, still a nice change from the buffet. For us the Japanese was sub-par but we have cheap excellent Japanese food at home. We did not make it to the la carumba steak restaurant as it was booked up. I have heard that the la carumba is really good from other guests. The nightly entertainment is pretty corny and funny and is was some of the largest production shows that I have seen for a resort anywhere in Mexico. The beach and pools are great, we were able to always find chairs at the beach or by the pool at anytime of the day, we were staying during the end of spring break. The dive centre Dressel Divers are very professional and provide a convienient service but are expensive. My girlfiend received her open water diving training from during our stay and the intruction was pretty much a private lesson the entire course which is great. The best thing about this resort is the jungle like atmoshpere and the service. All of the workers seem happy and I have never been offered so many beverages while sitting at the pool or bar. They will create any drink that you request. I used the gym facilities which could us a little updating as far as the weight are concerned, the dumbells go up to 55lbs. newer cardio machines. Anything to do with the staff at this resort was 5plus star rating, the resort is no more than a 4star but the staff makes it worth everything.

We had an absolutely fantastic time and would highly recommend this hotel. We would not hesitate to stay here again! I have broken down my review into sections to make it easier to read (and for me to write everything I want to) LOCATION The hotel is located in Playacar, approx 1 hour drive from Cancun airport. Playacar is a gated community so we felt very safe staying there. The hotel is a 5 minute taxi ride into the town of Playa del Carmen, very cheap, and the taxis can be found either driving past outside the hotel or a 5 minute walk up to Playacar Plaza. There are a few shops and market stalls at Playacar Plaza, along with a bank and other amenities. RECEPTION / LOBBY The Tucan and Quetzal have separate reception areas but are alongside each other, so all facilities can be used by anyone staying in either the Tucan or the Quetzal. We were booked to stay in the Tucan so checked in here. The reception area is very big and spacious, and immaculately clean. Check in time was very quick, less than 10 minutes, and the porter took our suitcases to take to our room for us. We were given a map of the hotel and all the information we required, and set along our way to our room. There are a few shops in the reception area, including a \u2018Tequilaria\u2019 which was great! ROOMS We stayed in room 1150, which is in block 11, close to the beach. Ahead of staying at the Tucan I emailed the hotel and requested to have a room close to the beach, which was granted and the customer relations manager was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms themselves are large and clean, and we had 2 large double beds. The balcony looked out onto the pool area and also we had a view of the beach. The bathroom was clean with a large walk in shower. The mini-bar was full with water, beer and sodas / fizzy drinks and this was stocked up daily! The television had a fair number of English speaking channels which was great when you just wanted to relax in your room for a while. The maids were all very friendly and our room was always cleaned daily, and a new animal shape made out of towels! GROUNDS The grounds of the Tucan/Quetzal are amazing, the rooms are either side, with a mini-jungle in between the beach and the reception area / restaurants. There is a winding path through the jungle area, and along our travels we saw new wildlife every day! This included peacocks, lizards, agoutis, tucans, iguanas, flamingos, and even monkeys!! The grounds of the hotel are kept spotlessly clean and it there are pieces of Mayan sculptures dotted about the place. The wildlife made the walks around the grounds very interesting and entertaining, FOOD The food at the Tucan was delicious \u2013 lots of variety and everything freshly cooked! I am a vegetarian so sometimes find it hard when eating abroad, but here there was so much to choose from I was spoilt for choice. There were 2 big buffet restaurants where you could have breakfast, amazing huge breakfasts with everything you can possibly think of. There were different \u2018themes\u2019 in the buffet restaurants each night, with the food following suit. The lunches were served in these buffet restaurants and also the restaurants by the beach, which was very useful when you wanted to just leave the sun lounger for half an hour to grab something to eat. We ate in the al la cart restaurants 4 nights out of 10 \u2013 we tried the Italian, Tropical and Mexican twice. All were fantastic. We did not try to get any further al la cart reservations but I had heard other holiday makers saying that if you went to the reservations desk on the night you can easily get some if they did not have a full house. We also took advantage of the room service on a couple of occasions which was brilliant! The only negative I would say is that the buffet restaurants are not air conditioned, which my boyfriend moaned about a few times but for me it was no problem. POOL There was one big pool of varying depths, shared by both Tucan and Quetzal side. This was lovely, the only problem was finding a sun lounger next to the pool, which seemed to be the most popular spot when we were staying there. There was also a \u2018swim-up bar\u2019 pool separate to the main pool, we went in there a couple of times but it did seem to get a bit crowded and some people had brought their own CD player to blast out music \u2013 which was OK but just not for us. I also noticed another pool which I believe was used for games and such but I did not really ever see anyone in here. BEACH The beach was amazing, powder white sand and turquoise seas. When we stayed there the \u2018sand whales\u2019 were still there, but this did not stop our enjoyment. I believe now this has had a massive renovation and the beach rebuilt, and looking even more amazing! We are beach people and spent every day there, we did not ever have a problem finding a sun lounger, no matter what time we went down there. My boyfriend spent most of the day in the sea, while I relaxed in the sun reading a book! You can borrow towels and also parasols from the towel hut near the pool, which we did every morning, and returned them that evening when we were finished. I also took advantage of the ice cream cart by the beach, serving delicious ice creams which were amazing especially in the hot weather! ENTERTAINMENT During the day there are lots of activities to do, but we liked to relax on the beach so did not take part in any of these. The entertainment in the evenings was all focused away from the beach, around the reception / lobby bars and theatre. There were different shows put on every night which were amazing, and the entertainment team were fantastic. They would always be in the crowd chatting to the guests. We used to go to see the shows every night after dinner. We spent a lot of time in the reception bar, which was where a lot of people seemed to hang about. It was nice to go and relax here with a few drinks, and also bowls of popcorn which were on each table and filled up constantly! We also spent a few nights at the hotel nightclub, \u2018Mascara\u2019, which was great for a laugh, a dance and for a few more drinks after the other bars had closed! In terms of the alcohol, all of your usual branded drinks and top shelf spirits were included in with your \u2018All Inclusive\u2019 package which was brilliant, my boyfriend even tried to test them by requesting a little known type of whiskey, but they then produced it from behind the bar! They had every drink you can think of. I drank my way through a fair few cocktails, lots of tequila obviously and also our favourites of the holiday \u2013 the \u2018Mexican Flag\u2019 shots!! EXCURSIONS We took 3 excursions in our 10-night stay, which we booked through our First Choice rep. We went to Tulum \u2013 which was great but very crowded with tourists which spoiled it a bit. Next we went to Chichen Itza \u2013 I was put off by the 3-hour coach journey but it actually flew by, the coach was air conditioned and had a toilet on board, and also drinks and cakes were provided regularly. Chichen Itza itself is amazing and I am so pleased to say I have actually been there. We also stopped at a Cenote on the way, my boyfriend had a swim in this while I watched the bags! We also spent a day at Xel-Ha, which was my favourite and amazing to swim and snorkel with all those colourful fish, stingray and we also saw a barracuda, scared me a bit though! I loved Xel-Ha and would recommend it to anyone. In all we had an amazing time, fantastic hotel, staff so friendly and will go out of their way to help you and make your holiday as eventful or relaxing as you want it to be.

The property is near jungle and wildlife is abundant from the moment you pass through the impressive, open aired lobby. After checking in, we were greeted by the large resident male peacock that could be seen displaying his feathers daily on the resort path. Keep your eyes open for families of monkeys running from rooftop to rooftop. Other wildlife includes iguanas, beautiful tropical birds and agoutis (rodent like creatures). My family enjoyed walking around the resort to find all sorts of exotic creatures in ravines and just off the beaten path. We found our room satisfactory; however there are no dressers to put cloths in (room 5013) and the temperature/electricity fluctuated without warning from time to time. The shower had good water pressure and our room had a porch that looked out onto a garden. The room bar was stocked every other day with soda, water and beer which we enjoyed. The tv received international channels from American to Mexican to Italian. Each afternoon we would find a new towel creature created for us on the bed with flowers and chocolates. A nice touch. I was looking forward to the food at this all inclusive resort. Our favorite place to eat was La Hacienda, the Mexican restaurant. Here, we were served Mexican chicken as an appetizer, an a la carte meal complete with a flaming tequila demonstration over my father\u2019s steak and to finish everything off the Mariachi band played songs for us right at our table-delightful! We ate at the Japanese restaurant one night and found the show impressive but the food mediocre. Buffet was available most of the time and there were plenty of options for plenty of tastes. Stay away from the hotdogs at the beach grill; they tasted a bit funky. There are other a la carte options but we only made two reservations. They had a cooking demonstration on the beach one day and made paella for everyone. There are plenty of bar options; the only one we did not visit was the pool bar because it is separate from the other pool and it is in the shade\u2026at least a few degrees cooler than the other pool! By far the best drink mixed is the banana daiquiri-try it and you will not be sorry. We traveled to Riviera Maya to do some water activities such as snorkeling and SCUBA diving, however directly off the resorts beach is fairly clear water but little fish life. A dive center complete with night diving is available at the Tucan, however my family and I decided to travel to Cozumel on two occasions and use the facilities at the Iberostar Cozumel for diving. This was free from 9 am -6 pm and we ate at their restaurants and swam in their pools while we visited. You could also go to the Iberostar Paraiso in Riveria Maya to play golf and use their facilities if you wanted a change in scenery. I would highly recommend visiting the Palancar reef if you are in Mexico to either snorkel, dive or go on a glass bottom boat. Beware of people trying to sell you trips just off the ferry between Playa del Carmen and Cozumel\u2026use your discretion. The other great excursion we went on was the Tulum ruin/Xel-ha ecopark tour. I highly recommend them. Overall, Iberostar Tucan is a family resort not so good for the singles scene but a place full of activities and bursting with life.

I can't count the times my daughter said that it was the nicest hotel she had ever stayed at. I am quite picky when choosing hotels and I did an awful lot of research before choosing the Tucan. Best choice I ever made. It was the week before Easter and the place was sold out and packed! I felt that even under those circumstances the hotel ran smoothly and the service was excellent. The lightbulb went out in the bathroom and one call and it was fixed immediately. It was hot so we needed extra bottles of water every day. $2.00 a day for the maid and we had everything we needed and then some. The room was always totally clean and done so in a timely manner. There are four restaurants for lunch which accommodated everyone with no lines. Here are the things I stressed over and what was true: 1. The beach. Huge and absolutely gorgeous. Many chairs and palapas. True you may not get a palapa, but they have umbrellas if you ask for them at the building where you get the towels. There was a problem with people reserving chairs, so the hotel sent everyone a letter stating that no one can reserve chairs and if they do, they just might find their towels, shoes, books, etc. gone when they got down to the beach. That sure stopped people from reserving chairs! 2. Sunscreen - That sun is super strong there. More so than anywhere else I've been. I never saw so many people with sunburns in one place. I used a 50 and had to keep reapplying it OFTEN or I burnt. My daughter, who is olive-skinned, used a 30 and burnt. I would use a 50 minimum there. 3. Forecast for rain. I fretted over this big time. #3 out of the 7 days said rain. Never saw a drop. A few more clouds, maybe, but that was only in the morning. I asked a tour specialist about it and she said that if it does rain, it is usually only at night. Next time I won't watch the weather there at all. 4. Water sports. Went kayaking and sailing. Yes, the men who work there aren't the friendliest, but it's not really a problem of being friendly, it's just that they don't speak much English--at all! Girls who worked the booth were extremely knowledgeable and helpful. Took the excursion to Cozumel to snorkel and had a great time, even if I did get lost in the ocean (my fault for not hearing directions!) You can sail for an hour a day or if someone doesn't want the whole hour you can jump in and finish their time. 5. Restaurants---A week before i went I emailed the restaurant and had no trouble reserving all three restaurants. Steakhouse-fair--their beef tastes odd. If you like medium rare, order medium. Japanese was great, but all of us had mild intestinal problems from that dinner on. Cancelled the Italian because after we realized how close Playa Del Carmen was, we took a cab and ate there. Carlos and Charlies---had the best quesadilla there in my life! Reservations are in sittings---6:30 and 7:00, the 8:30 and 9:00. 6. Montezuma's Revenge - all of us had gastrointestinal problems, but nothing that Immodium wouldn't help. We were very very careful about what we ate and drank --no washed fruits and vegetables, etc. I think it's just that we were eating different foods and different spices. The weirdest thing is that for three days I had a black tongue. Gone now---so strange! 7. The beds - no way were they as hard as I imagined from all the reviews. I think we're all getting so accustomed to cushion-topped mattresses that when we sleep on a \"regular\" mattress it feels hard. Actually, my husband and I said that we had less aches from sleeping on the firm mattress. Plus, you ARE so tired when you get to bed that you don't really care. 8. Room location--we were in the 1200 building behind the towel hut. Not the greatest view, but you're hardly in the room at all. I kept saying I wanted to sit on my terrace and have a beer, but I never did. Too much else to do. Their XX beer is really good! 9. The shows---are really good and the Stars do put forth an amazing amount of effort. They do get a bit repetitive, so we only went to 3. Kids love the 8:30 show. 10. Apple shuttle bus---Apple was great all around, except for the bus. It took us over 2 and a half hours to get from the airport to the hotel. The Tucan is the second to last hotel as you travel toward Tulum so there are 3-5 hotels that are gone to to drop off guests. We decided to pay the $45+a $5 tip to go the the airport at the end of our stay. Well worth it. We were there in 45 minutes. 11. Clothes - bring clothes for hot and cooler weather. We dripped sweat the first two nights, wore light sweaters the next three nights and then were comfortable the last few nights. On the beach you might want to bring a long sleeved t-shirt for the cooler afternoons as the sun lowers--if the wind is blowing. 12. Guests--all ages from infant to elderly. Children were never a problem - anywhere. Majority of the guests were not from the USA, which to me made it more interesting. The only thing that was annoying was that they smoke a lot and I feel like I smoked right along with them, even on the beach. There is some topless, but it wasn't an issue at all. Loved, loved, loved out stay and plan to go back next year for sure. Just walking the grounds is special. The way the place is lit at night makes it magical.

It went missing from the disco and a camera is a teen girls best friend and I would have appreciated a bit more effort in locating it...oh well. They really can't do much if someone else took it but there effort was really lax in helping. On our way to the resort our bus broke down which made it a very long 2hr ride, not fun after a long day of travelling. The other issue is with the Cancun, Mexico airport, my oldest daughters suitcase was ransacked on the way in to Mexico and her jewellery was stolen , on the way home my mother-in-laws suitcase had been gone through and her purses that she had brought in the suitcase had been literally ripped apart. On arrival at Detroit airport my daughters suitcase had been demolished and was being held together with massive amounts of duct tape????

There is not a great deal of difference between the sister hotel Iberstar Quetzal and this one, personally we preferred the Tucan overall as through it had a little more charm and character. The rooms are quite large, with the mini bar was restocked every couple of days but if you needed anything, room service would provide without a problem. Each day the maid would make animals of all varying shapes and sizes with your towels. The Pool was first class, large and with plenty sun loungers to pick from, so no need to get up early for a bed! Hotel was right on the beach but did not venture down to sunbath, but again looked as a large number of sun loungers available if you like the beach. The hotel grounds are home to a number of animals with the odd monkey, peacock or iguana never to far away. This made the trip to the restaurants very interesting and a whole lot of fun guessing what you might see.. Its also a reminder to always take your camera through the jungle area.. Could not complaint about any of the themed restaurants even the buffet restaurant was superb with a fine chose of food for everyone, we were spoilt for choice The entertainment & entertainment staff was excellent, they put their hearts and soles into everything they did. With a different show every night they kept you entertained. We did go into 5th Ave a number of nights, taxis can be found at the entrance to the hotel. Around \u00a32 would get you to 5th Ave area (downtown). Along 5th avenue you will find a large number of shop, bars and restaurants and with the evening shows at the hotel not starting until 21:00 it give you ample time to do a little exploring around the downtown area.

The positive reviews are accurate- it's a wonderful resort. However, I would like to mention a few problems. We paid extra for an ocean front suite through a travel agency, Pleasant Holiday, but when we arrived there was no such room available. The other problem was making our dinner reservations. I began emailing my request a couple of weeks before we were to arrive. I understood that if you stay 6 nights, you could have 2 nights in the a la carte restaurants. I received an email stating my reservations had been made as requested. Unfortunately, we realized later Yasemin only made one reservation for us and it was not on either of the nights I had requested. Yasemin did a horrible job handling the situation. She let me know she did exactly what was asked of her, and that I was mistaken. She told me she has been working there for 3 years and has never had a complaint. There were 16 of us in the group, 8 of them children, all dressed up for the Japanese restaurant, only to find out we had no reservation and it had ABSOLUTELY nothing to do with her. I have the emails I sent, so I know what I requested. We had a great time at this resort. The Star Frinds are amazing- I don't know how they do it. The only negatives are booking your room can be tricky ( we are unsure if we will be reimbursed for the suite we did not get) and Yasemin.

This was my first time to Mexico so I wanted this trip to be perfect. And it was! This resort is absolutely beautiful. Its in the middle of a jungle with wildlife everywhere. Monkeys, peacocks, flamingos, chickens and swans! I have to say that the Quetzal side was more beautiful then the Tucan side. So I will start this review from check in to check out! My boyfriend and I went through signature vacations so we had a shuttle take us to our resort which was nice cuz its free BUT it was a very long ride, about 2 hrs. We had to stop at every resort on the way to drop of people and we didnt get to the Tucan till around 630. A cab ride is around 50 bucks so thats something to consider. Check in was very fast and easy. We had a nice welcome drink waiting for us! The rooms are alright, they need to be updated. The beds are hard as every review says but I actually slept better at the resort than I do at home. Your so busy and beat by the end of the night from sun and booze that you dont even realize how hard the beds are. At least I didnt! The shower is pretty big, but theres no tub. I was really happy with the view of the jungle we had from our room 1745, it was amazing! We had a dozen monkeys roaming in a tree a couple afternoons, and even a couple monkeys right on our balcony! Wow! Okay, the beach is aaaaamazing! So huge! Not very busy either. Nice white sand that was cool on the feet and the bluest water imaginable! The only problem was that the water was pretty rough during our stay so we stayed by the pool a lot since we liked to swim and cool off. We didnt get up too early, usually around 830 or 9 but always seemed to find a spot by the pool, some spots better then others. I loved the pool. It was also huge! And the water wasnt too cold at all! It was so nice to jump in and cool off from the hot Mexican sun! We never went to the swim up bar pool but if we wanted a drink, it was easy to get one. The bar was close by and there were waitresses around too. The grounds of the resort are out of this world! You literally feel like your staying in the middle of a jungle. So much wildlife and the sounds of birds and the howler monkeys were awesome. We never got lost, and it never seemed like a long walk to the beach, even from our room. It was mapped out very nicely! So now for the restaurants. We did Japanese, Mexican and Steakhouse. All of them were awesome, especially the Japanese. Try the banana dessert! Yum! My boyfriend really enjoyed the Mexican one. The buffet was great. Alot to choose from, and always a main meal every night like turkey or ribs or prime rib. I was a bit worried about the buffet since reading some bad reviews but they must be extremely picky. And I even think Im a bit picky, but it was great! Breakfast was awesome, lots of donuts, pancakes, eggs, bacon etc. everything you can think of! Check out was easy. Handed in our towel cards and room cards and that was it. How depressing! I didnt want to leave.. I had fallen in love! We had a shuttle bus take us back to the airport, with no stops so it was fast. My boyfriend and I both loved this resort and definitely recommend it.

The grounds of the hotel are excellent, with the jungle you get to see all the animals and our room had monkeys running around in trees opposite which were great to watch every day (all be it quite noisy at 6AM in the morning !!) The pool area seemed really nice although we spend every day down on the beach. THE BEACH IS FAB - we went literally just weeks after they had re-opened it from all th work they did and it was great. Its is really big and you can always get a sunbed. We grabbed 2 everyday and pulled them down to the side of the ocean and just sat there all day (apart from going off to get some lunch everyday). There is a drinks service on the beach but it can be a bit slow and often they forget who they had taken a drinks order for and we often watched our drinks going to someone else !! but the beach bar is just 2 minutes walk away so no great problem getting your own. The Ocean has very strong currents so be warned ! The waves are excellent fun but they are strong an can knock you right over and drag you under. On some days the waves were really big and great to watch but I didn't go in until it calmed down a bit. Personally i prefer this though to a boring 'pond' with nothing going on and on lots of days the waves were perfect for having fun in without them being to strong. Food - was good, the buffet always had a good choice and you would have to be really picky not to find something you didn't like. The A la carte's were also good (oddly we found the mexican the worse) and we loved the steak house. I think you are supposed to be limited on the number of visits you made to these but they didn't really seem to control that and you could go as often as you wanted. Availability was never a problem. Rooms - were good size, had AC and we couldn't fault them. I have read other reviews about hard beds but personally i found them very comfortable. We tried to pay for an upgrade to the junior suites on the front but they were all full, however in hindsight we wouldn't of seen half the animals if we had been down on the front. Hotel grounds were really nice and the layout is great. The walk through jungle through the centre was really nice and you got to see so many animals as we walked up and down there everyday. One warning though - because of the jungle the mozzies etc were rife !! I had 19 bites after 2 days from the knee down - after that we bathed in in mozzie repellent before we went out every night and during dusk we didn't sit on the balcony unless we were covered in repellant. The location of this hotel was perfect, you could walk up to the plaza shopping area in just 5 minutes and a cab to fifth avenue was 5 dollars and took about 10 mins max. I deff recommend going to fifth avenue , its really nice, with shops, bar, cafes, restaurants, and its good to be able to get out in the evening as with a lot of all inclusive resorts there isn't anywhere else to go at night. The staff were a real credit to the hotel , we have been to the dominican several times and always felt to get exceptional service you really needed to tip, however here it didn't seem like that. We tipped when we wanted to and when we felt it was deserved but it certainly wasn't a case of tips being expected. Service was always top notch !! Entertainment Team - We don't really pay attention to the entertainment as its not our thing but from we saw and what people said it seemed excellent. The shows in the evening were not 'tacky' like I have seen in other places and they made a real effort with them - they were certainly popular and always full. During the day the team worked really hard to entertain the ones that wanted it and if you didn't want to join in you said no and that was it. Overall I cant fault the hotel - we had an excellent stay and I would highly recommend it. Both my partner and I work in hotels so we are often too critical but we truly loved it.

We arrived at noon and the room was not ready yet but we got in by 3pm. We had planned for this and had bathing suits at the ready. The room was great with no complaints. We left a couple dollars everyday and a note of our minifridge preferences and were restocked almost daily. The beds are hard but we didn't mind. The floors did seem a little thin and we could hear the every move of the people above us but we were really only ever there when we went to bed at night. The pool is very nice with lots of cabana's. The choice spots were gone by about 8am but there were no real bad spots and yu could almost always find a couple loungers together. The beach was amazing and our favorite spot. There are lots of cabana's and you can find one up to about 9am. If they are all gone the resort lends out portable beach umbrellas. One big issue about the beach is that it rapidly erroded the week we were there. We had 2 days of heavier surf and they lost about 30 feet of beach in those two days. I understand they just rebuilt the beach a month ago and really wonder how much they will have left by next year. We also go bit by sand fleas so bring some bugspray. My only other beach complaint was with the people lending out the sailboats. They were unfriendly and not very healpful. I did fine because i sail back home but I watched time and time again as they lent boats to people with no knowledge of sailing who quickly drifted into the swimming area and put people in danger while the attendant just stood by and watched. One great service is the beach and poolside drink waitress service. Also, the icecream is very good. Tip the waitresses a couple buck during the day and you will get more frequent service. We found the food a little repetative. We may have been spoiled though because last year we went to the Iberostar in Puerto Plata and the food was amazing. There was a different main entree most days but everything else was always the same. The Japanese restaurant is fun and a good show, the steak house ok but lacked atmosphere, the mexican restaurant was just all around bad and we never went to the Italian restaurant. We stopped by the lobby bar everynight and it was ok. They have a guitar or piano player most nights. The atmosphere is ok but not great., The guitar player was good when he just played guitar (no drum machine in the background) but the piano player was terrible with canned music and it really started bothering me after a while. We only went to a few evening shows but what we saw was not so hot. Again, we were a little spoiled by going to another Iberostar last year where the shows were much better. Overall, it was a great trip and pretty much everthing was good. The negatives above were really only minor and did not detract from our time there. Would we go back?

The breakfast buffet had plenty of fresh fruits and fresh juices in the morning as well as various cereals, yogurts, etc. The omelet station was popular. We tried three of the a la carte restaurants and all were just good to OK. We mostly enjoyed, not surprisingly, the Mexican options at the buffets. There was always fresh pico de gallo and guacamole, and we added the tasty fish, chicken or pork to freshly warmed tortillas at lunch and dinner. We didn't really find too many desserts we liked, but the ice cream was pretty good. The Japanese restaurant that many people had raved about, we didn't like that much. If you really like Japanese food, this place won't appeal to you, it's mostly like a Benihana, I guess, and the sushi wasn't very good and was served with wasabi that was a little dried out.

This year was our 2nd trip to Iberostar Toucan ( \u201c IT\u201d ) in a row. The children staged a revolt at a mere possibility that we may go someplace different this year, so we had to do it. In our opinion, this resort is good for : families with pre-teen kids. In our opinion, this resort is not so good for you if you are looking for a major non-stop party spring break , crowd of singles, or if the on site off-shore snorkeling is your priority. Hotel itself : Upon arrival to Cancun, walk without stopping straight through the gauntlet of crowd of interceptors peddling \u201cfree\u201d advice, tours, etc and out of airport doors to meet your ride. I.T. is ~ 40 min drive from Cancun airport if you go straight there. If you agency arranges transfer, the car will likely have to deposit other tourists to their hotels, so the trip will likely take 1 to 2 hours. If possible, discuss with your agency subtracting the transfer from the price and paying for taxi yourself ( $40-$45,o/w ) to save both time and $. Unlike Cancun high-rise hotels, Toucan consists of two parallel rows of three-store thatch-roofed buildings going from the reception halls towards the ocean. ( If you want to be close to the beach, ask for a room in the buildings 11 to 15, or 21 to 26; either by calling week or so in advance, or at arrival. ). Between these rows is a wonderfully landscaped jungle with a maze of paths. It is inhabited by free roaming peacocks, pheasants , howler monkeys, agouties and coatis ( look this up \u2013 or just be surprised). Kids are thrilled. Rooms: We had a standard room, which easily sleeps four. Room is clean, spacious, has a hair dryer, refrigerator with drinks ( incl. in your all-inclusive package), and nice balcony. Ask for one facing the jungle. Beach and pool: I.T. has broad sandy beach, clean and well maintained. The huge ugly sandbag wave breakers were gone this year ( great improvement). There were no problems getting towels or beach chairs. IT has a beachside massage center ( expensive out of proportion, did not use) bar and ice-cream stand . On this part of the shore, the sea bottom is mostly sand and dead coral, so there is no reefs i.e. no off shore snorkeling at the hotel . If you walk south ~ 5-10 min to the end of the Playacar hotel zone , you\u2019ll find a few off-shore rocks and underwater concrete man-made \u201creef\u201d , marked by buoys. Snorkeling there will show you some common reef fishes. Otherwise, see the suggestions below. Guests : Mostly families, many with young children of pre- and elem. school ages. Good number of Canadians, South Americans and Europeans. IT is for some reason popular with middle class Russian-speaking families from US. It didn\u2019t appear to be a major center of the spring-break atmosphere , at least during the school vacation periods when we were there. Food. No complaints. I.T .has large, convenient, fresh, diverse buffets with excellent , if perhaps not the Tour-d\u2019Argent haut-cuisine. The menu restaurants (some included in all-incl. package) we tried were OK but in my opinion nothing of ordinary and comparing to the buffets not worth the time loss if you are with young children. Staff : No complaints. The staff is not only polite and helpful, but always look cheerful and friendly unlike in some other popular Caribbean touristy locations. Everyone speaks English, although even a few symbolic words in Spanish by you are greeted with appreciation. We tipped our maid $2-4/day, and occasionally the waiters, bellman & barkeepers. I.T. has a wonderful kid\u2019s Club and our kids insisted on going there most of the days. Entertainments: I graded the evening shows from OK to very good. My wife thought all of them were outstanding and didn\u2019t want to miss a single one. IT also has a kid\u2019s show at 8:30 pm, always a hit. Day trips: Because of cost and mostly need to schedule around the stamina of our kids and the Kids Club hours ( 10;30-4 pm) we didn\u2019t take any organized tours and explored area on our own. Nearby Xcaret park is a must with kids, although $$; Plan the whole day, review the info and plan ahead . Lots of things to do, evening show is worth staying late. For off-shore snorkeling, take taxi ($60 r/t with taxi waiting for you 2-3 hrs ) south to Acumal Bay ( ~ 30 min ride). There you can either go to Yal-Ku lagoon to see the fish ( $9 entrance), and/or go to their Dive Shop, hire a 1 hr off-shore snorkeling tour with the guide+ locker +all equipment and see the sea turtles . Mayan ruins: we went to Coba by ourselves ( ~1.20 hr drive, $160 for two, including taxi r/t, guide and rent of bicycles at the site. ) Weather : last week of February was a little cloudy but with an exception of one rainy morning in general it was a good beach weather. Last week of April was hot, but tolerable. March/April is probably an ideal time to go in the spring. Useful things to bring with you: 1) Double amount of any simple supplies you can possibly run out of : (sunscreen, batteries, Kleenex, toothpaste etc.) \u2013 unless you are OK with paying 500% at the resort\u2019s shop. 2) Couple of extra bathing suits in addition of what you would normally take : in this humid climate, it may literally take days for a hanged wet b. suit to dry out. 3) if you have a larger group, a set of good walkie-talkies is useful to be in touch on the resort grounds. 4) a lot of cash, especially $1 bills you\u2019ll use for tips.

Quetzal for 2 weeks this past Feb. We were very happy with the stay overall. Our room was not in the best of locations(bldg.29) but we did not complain or ask to be moved as sometimes you end up with worse. Our balconey did face the working area of the Riu next door however we did not find it too noisy and since we found there to be a few too many mosquitoes this time we usually kept the patio door closed most of the time we were in the room or using the balconey. Yes the beds are hard but we found the mattress pad helped to soften the blow even though they are very thin pads. The food at the buffets was in our opinion for the most part very good unless you got there close to the time they were closing the buffet. Then it was a little stale. So get there early.The food at the a la cartes was usually very good with our favs. the steakhouse by the beach and the Caribbean across from it. You can eat at the a la cartes more often than they say but it usually means eating earlier or later than you most people like.We did it a couple times and had one early seating and one late one. We found the staff to be generally very friendly always saying Hola with our only complaint being about the inconsistent maids. The beach had just been finished being remade after being pretty much destroyed by the last hurricane there about 4 yrs. ago and they did a fabulous job. It's huge now with miles of great beach to walk in the day. I recommend going out in the evening to the beach after dark and sitting and just enjoying the night and the ocean. The pool is quite large as most pools in mexico are and usually quite cool as most pools in Mexico are. We did not like the \"pool bar\" set up either. It is separate from the main pool and looked dirty so we never used it. We ate at the beach barbecue almost every day. Orlando was the fella doing the barbecue all the time we were there and he did a marvelous job keeping up with the demand for burgers,dogs and his awesome potato wedges ( you have to have some). Toss him a tip into his chef's hat for a job well done. Our biggest complaint I think would be a lack of bathroom facilities out by the beach. You had to walk back in to the pool area to access bathrooms when at the beach. Somewhat inconvenient. We have stayed at Iberostar Paraiso in the past and would rate the facilities there as better than Tucan/Quetzal however all in all we thoroughly enjoyed our time at the Tucan/Quetzal and highly recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "March 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wales", "Title": "\u201cWhat more can you ask for?\u201d", "Author": "speakerknees", "ReviewID": "UR58124519", "Content": "Stayed with a large group of family and friends and it is the best hotel we have all EVER stayed in, The ground's are superb the service recived from the staff also superb our only complaint would be the poolbar it is pretty much surrouned by trees, the beach is out of this world, the shows are top quality and the star friend's great..

Unfortunately it took 2 hours to get to the resort and were really hoping for a welcome drink but the tray was empty so we had to go to the bar to get the drink ourselves! Check in was decent, the room was adequate but ours was up front so it was close to the restaurants. Some room are down by the beach so if you get a room there, it might take them an hour to get your luggage to you. It was about a 5 min walk to the beach but was neat to walk through the \"jungle\" to see all the wild animals walking around. Biggest complaint was the swim up bar, it was completely separate from everything, which wasn't a big deal but had very little sun light, was dirty and you had to walk down 14 wet concrete stairs to get there. Well some drunk guy, not me, fell down all 14 stairs and knocked himself out. Not a smart set up!! The beach was very nice and never any problem to get a chair. The Mexican, Steak and Japonese restaurants were awesome!!! I recommend booking them as much as you can. We ate at one the first 5 nites we were there. The pool needs music all day, they only played it when they were going to announce something or an activitey was going on and was very cold!! Kind of boring activities also. The bar near the beach was good and the bartenders Jesus and Humberto were outstanding!!! Tell Jesus you want a strawberry daquari with vodka \"the Chicago Way\" and you will have no problem feeling great in no time. Or simply ask them to add more alcohol and they will oblige. I had no problem tipping them at all. We took a $5 taxi ride into Playa Del Carmen and on the advise of some people at the hotel, we got 2, yes 2 full body massages for $46 at Harmony Massage!!! Thats almost a quarter of what the hotel will charge you for 1. It was not shady or dirty at all. My wife and I plus the couple we traveled with all got one. So that was 4 one hour massages for less then what the hotel charged for 1. Ok back to the hotel, the beds were rock hard. The wife called after the first nite and requested a pad, which they put one on the bed but helped very little. Shower pressure was very good. Then came the 5th day of our trip where I became very sick. Im sure that could happen anywhere but appearantly several other people became sick also because the hotel then were placing extra hand sanitizers out. The service in the restaurants was very good but if you were to call the front desk, you had to call sometimes 2 or 3 times to get what you wanted. The computers seemed to always be down and I recommend you bring lots of small bills, $1, and $5 for tips because half the time the hotel did not have change for American money. The shows at nite were decent but we never made it to the disco. It gets kind of cold for the ladies at night so I would suggest they bring a few jackets or sweaters so they aren't freezing like our wives were.

The food, service, and room was top notch although I would recommend getting once closer to the beach and on a higher floor to avoid the noise from people in the morning.

We had a wonderful time. The beach, grounds, rooms and service were all wonderful. We loved to wake up each morning and take a walk through the jungle to see the abundance of wildlife. We loved walking along the beach, and swimming in the clear ocean. We loved hearing the mariachis each night, and waking up the birds each morning. Another positive was this all inclusive was less over run with children than others I\u2019ve experienced, but was still kid friendly. Go here if you want to have fun, and stay on the move. I would suggest avoiding this resort if you are looking for privacy and quiet (go to the Fiesta American Grand Coral Beach in Cancun). Or do what we did, and spend half of your trip in a quiet hotel, and the other half at the all inclusive to get the best of both worlds. D\u00e9cor / Theming: The d\u00e9cor and theme of the hotel follow Mayan tradition. There are large statues of Mayan warriors, stone tablets depicting gruesome acts (little Chichen Itza!), Mayan \u201ctiki\u201d huts, and much more. Add to this white marble floors, mariachis, a multitude of animals awaiting your every step (monkeys, parrots, peacocks, iguanas, etc, and the lush beautiful rainforest and you have immersed yourself in a tropical vacation paradise. The rooms also follow this motif, and are lovely and spacious. All rooms offer a patio or balcony but beware- monkeys may share your seating with you! The Beach: The beach features white sand, beach chairs and an abundance of palapas. The water is clear and beautiful, when the water is calm. However, this was only the case for two of the four days of our trip. The other two days the water was so rough that you would legitimately risk your life to swim. What was particularly strange was during these rough days, it was sunny and not all that windy. I would imagine the sea here is rough very often, so if this is a deal breaker for you, you may want to consider staying on the north side of Cancun (where the beaches are protected by a natural reef). Or do what we did- split the stay between the two. The Pool: The main pool is large and lovely with palapas and chairs surrounding it on all sides. In the middle of the pool is a tub filled with jets, but don\u2019t mistake this for a hot tub- the water is not heated. There is also a children\u2019s pool, an adult pool, and a pool with a swim up bar. Note that the pool with the swim up bar was the dirtiest of all the pools (so much so that we did not go in). Activities: The resort does a very good job of keeping their guests entertained. My husband and I do not participate in classes, games, etc but we witnessed so many activities going around us from salsa lessons to large scale tug of war. Additionally, there are ping pong tables, tennis courts, water volleyball, soccer, nightly shows, a dance club (by the way if you go to real clubs, this may not be for you it is VERY family friendly) and so much more. I would imagine children would have a wonderful time here, but at the same time kids do not overrun the resort (however this may be because we visited during the school year). Restaurants/Bars: I was very happy with the food here, which I found surprising as my husband and I consider ourselves \u201cfoodies\u201d who eat out in NYC several times per week. Additionally, while I read in several reviews that you are only allotted a certain amount of sit down dinners per your stay, my husband and I ate at one of the restaurants each night of our visit with the exception of one night where we were too exhausted. You also have the ability to have round the clock room service (have the brownies!). Breakfast: Breakfast features anything you could ask for. Every morning you are given the opportunity to have juice, coffee, tea or mimosas. Traditional American and European fare is served in abundance (cereals, pancakes, French toast, croissants, muffins/pastries, meats, cheeses, omelet\u2019s etc). Lunch: Each day my husband and I ate lunch at the pool side buffet. It was good beach food (burgers, pizza, hot dogs, guacamole, chips with salsa verde, crema fresca etc.). Desserts are also available (ice cream, cakes, etc). You also have the option to eat each afternoon in the main buffet, where I imagine there was a more varied selection. Restaurants: We ate at the Mexican restaurant, the steakhouse (have the ribs), the Japanese/hibatchi, the Italian restaurant and the buffet. Our preference was in this order: Mexican (huge surprise being in Mexico!), steakhouse, Japanese, buffet, Italian. All was very good, though don\u2019t expect to get spicy mayo with your sushi, or authentic Italian food. It wasn\u2019t the four seasons, but it was very pleasing. No complaints. Also to be noted is the buffet has mariachis each night. A big plus. Alcohol: There are not a huge number of bars at the resort. There\u2019s the lobby bar, the pool bar, a bar where they host the shows at night, and drinks and wine are available at the restaurant, but that\u2019s it. There\u2019s also a slightly scary club (imagine children line dancing with Grandma even after midnight). The main bar and restaurants had a decent selection (Bacardi, Absolut, Jack Daniels, Dom etc), but the beach bar had only the cheapest of cheap. It was still good though! Also to be noted that there is beer stocked each day in your mini bar (included in the all inclusive). Day Trips: While in Mexico my husband and I visited Isla Mujeres (a lovely island half an hour from Cancun), Chichen Itza (you have to do it once), Coco Bongo (a must), Akumal (lovely water and snorkeling), and Xcaret. I would give all a thumbs up with the exception of Xcaret. This park is dirty and a huge rip off. Skip it.

We flew from Winnipeg, Canada with a direct flight into Cancun airport where we then took a comfortable bus ride to the resort. Finally arriving at the Iberostar Tucan side, our jaws dropped with how clean and nice the lobby area was! We knew it would be a great stay already. The downside when checking in was we had to wait roughly an hour or so get into our rooms. But during that time of waiting we hit up the lobby bar and started drinking! Met our favorite bartender, Victor. He is a kind, funny person, who makes the best mojitos. Tip him and you'll get almost all his attention. A few shots of Don Julio tequila, mojitos and margaritas later we then checked into our rooms. Typical room I must say. We were facing jungle side, which felt more private. The shower portion in the bathroom is pretty nice, and has pretty good hot water pressure! The mini fridge was stocked daily with bottled water, beer, and variety of sodas. Room service food is sub-par. I'd recommend it only really if your lazy to leave the room. The food: I'd recommend booking a la carte at the steakhouse location and the Japanese a la carte. We tried the Mexican a la carte, and was not fully satisifed. We found going to the buffets were a lot better! We couldn't understand why other reviews hated the \"repeatative\" food at the buffets, because in all honesty, though you do see some of the same foods, there is still quite a variety to choose from. Drinks: Please try Don Julio tequila! Smooth, blanco, makes you feel good kind of tequila! Another highly recommended thing to do is to go to COCO BONGO, which is about a 10 min ride away from the resort in Playa del Carmen. COCO BONGO was recommended by Star friend, Freddie, and let me tell you, its something you cannot pass on by. Freddie hooked it up with an open bar wrist band which included transportation there and back plus free drinks all night. COCO BONGO is a place where you pay for a show. It's not quite a club but you do dance throughout the area. There are random acts performing, impersonating famous celebs/characters, like Madonna, the late Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley, Moulin Rouge, Spiderman,etc. Very random and very fun!!! Look out for Freddie to get you into COCO BONGO. Other events we participated in was going to the Mayan Ruins at Tulum and Coba. Chichen Itza was too far, 3 hrs away from the resort. Where Tulum and Coba were closer. Visiting the Tulum ruins was ok, more of less walking area, taking pictures, not so tall structures, where as in Coba there was the Nohoch Mul Pyramid, an 140 foot high pyramid where tourists can climb it to the top! An exhilerating experience! Beautiful view from the top, with such history. When in the Coba ruins, rent a bicycle for $3 usd to explore the area. It's more efficient to get around than walking, which can take way longer. We also did an ATV/Cave/Cenotes tour for only $49.95 usd, booking from www.playadelcarmentours.com comparable price to $100 or more. We were booked with Eco-Ventura Punta Venado; our tour guide's name is Henry, super cool guy. Took the atv's throughout the jungle, where we stopped and walked inside a cave. Then drove over to the refreshing cenotes and cooled off. After swimming in the cenotes, we rode the ATV's over sand dunes at full speed. All in all, well worth 50 bucks. Go for it! Back to the resort, the star friends are craziest most outgoing people in the resport, and I can see why. They are there to motivate those who are staying to particiapte in daily activities they offer inside the resort. Rafael, who is one of the main hosts of star friends is the most energetic person I've met. The after dinner shows were pretty fun to watch. I appreciate the hard work the Star Friends go above and beyond to make you happy and enjoy your time. For my second last day, Rafael volunteerd me to sumo wrestle on the beach! I did it, and had fun. Maybe because I had my 1L thermos of margarita half finished... :) Other places to go: Plaza Playa, 5 minute walk from resort, small shopping area. Quinta Avenida or 5th Avenue. Shopping markets/restaurants/Bars. Prepare yourself for pushy salesmen/women.. It's their everyday grind, if you are bothered by it, then leave. If you are simply not interested just say no. If you are making purchases, bargain as much as you can, and if no luck, move onto the next! Every store has almost the same product. You you check out the beach area, where the Ferry dock is that takes people to and from the Cozumel island. To finish this off, eat, drink, tip and be merry! ;) Ciao.", "Date": "March 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Centerville, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cFabulous time- wish we could stay longer, will return!\u201d", "Author": "cherylb-rn", "ReviewID": "UR57212025", "Content": "We stayed for 9 nights Feb 2010, and couldn't have had a better time.Can't think of anything I liked least; maybe the internet service available (see later), but not important. I had read reviews on Trip Advisor (of course), and they were overall positive, so I felt reassured. We had stayed the last 2 years in Cancun/Tulum area, and love the area & the gracious people & beautiful beaches. As much as we loved Grand Sirenis 2 years ago, we really loved the Tucan/Quetzal. The surroundings, food, entertainment were unsurpassed for the cost. We only wished our family & good friends could have joined us. But, we made good friends there as well, from many different countries. We love interacting with different cultures & people, and it was a great experience. We met folks & kids from Chile,Germany,Poland, & others, and they were all so nice. The flora & fauna were so beautiful & so much fun. The critters were a source of endless interest & amusement- monkies, peacocks every morning on our patio, little piggies, flamingoes, ducks, roosters, Tucan, parrots, swans,kitties& more, all interacting in a great ecosystem. The food was excellent- any resort which has brie,smoked salmon,prosciutto hearts of palm,superb fresh salsa & guacamole,paella, (cooked on the beach with authentic stone crab claws ceviche & saffron rice) is a place I like to be).the Quetzal restauant was particularly nice, with the lovely waterfalls & water sounds The breakfasts were awesome, and the cookout hut on the beach was good & fun too. All beautifully presented & with a variety every day & night. The specialty restaurants were ok, the Japanese was the best. Be sure the men wear long pants; the women can wear practically anything. We drink (usually) only wine, which was Spanish & more than adequate. I did indulge in an occasional Bloody Mary, 1 time a Blue Hawaian, occ Margarita, all good. The beach barstaff were great. And, we positioned ourselves between the pool, the bar & the ice cream stand. I don't usually eat much ice cream (although I love it), but we were so active I had 1 scoop every day. The entertainment staff was also surprisingly talented & professional. We enjoyed all the shows, and the Star staff was non stop energetic & fun during the day. I don't know how they maintained their schedule. We also really enjoyed our morning stretch class, & \"Yoga on the beach\". Also, the dancing after the shows, and the dance lessons were so much fun! We walked to Playa del Carmen one day via the beach; a nice (long) walk, but a good one. There is also a decent mall via the walking/bike path with everything anyone could want, within about a mile or less. Internet cafe, too. Avoid, if you can, the sales pitch for the \"Real\" time shares (unless you are into that kind of thing). We almost got caught last year at the Barcelo. Its a waste of a good half day, listening to the pitch. The internet at the resort was a little lacking, only 2 stations per resort, and had to get pw's at the desk, which was often busy with other priorities. But, not there to surf the net... The beach & water were beautiful- beach recently renovated. Nice little shelters for keeping out of the strong rays, as at the pool. Our room was fine, adequate, quiet & all we needed. We loved the location, because we had our own little slice of jungle between us & the path, where we could enjoy the animal life & privacy on our patio. We were in the 2500 building, & loved it. Yes, the beds were hard, but we slept great! Our maid made cute towel animals every night. I tipped them every day,and we tipped the bar staff often. They really appreciate it. What else is there to say- probably more, but it was one of the best trips ever, and we have been on many. When we were checking in, I heard someone say this was their 4th year there- I can see why.

The food is even better than previous trips because there is a little more variety in the buffet. Javier oversees the restaurants and has been there a long time. His management skills and training abilities are obvious through all of the staff. Everyone is always busy and eager to provide top-notch service to the guests.

In fact a friend is there now and his daughter says he is loving it. They 'skype' everyday. He is there alone and says that everyone is very friendly and he is enjoying the walks through the 'jungle' and watching the birds and animals.

What can i say, i would go back tomorrow. Front desk was brilliant. We ate in all the restaurants the al acarte 12 times as we were under 3 different booking names, we took our chances and it paid off, all of them were superb apart from the Mexican as needed a little more spice so was a little disappointed. We have ate in many 5star hotels before but found this one to be one of the best. All waiting staff very friendly and could not do enough for you. We did tip but did not see many other people do this but seem to have got the same service. Plenty to do through the day for all age groups. The pool was lovely but a little cold. We did not use the swim up bar as it was very shaded so even colder. The beach and sea were picture postcard perfect. Plenty of sun beds. People were putting towels out early but we did not find this a problem. The star friends WERE SIMPLY THE BEST. The evening entertainment that they put on was something else. We did not feel that we needed to leave the hotel at all in the evenings to find entertainment as this could not of been beaten here. I don't no how they keep up the pace all day and all night. We made really good friends with them and had lots of fun! We went out one night to Coco Bongo with some star friends. It was very well organized and we had the time of our life, this can be arranged with any of them, we would thoroughly recommend it. We went to Chitza Nitza it was a really long day none of us really enjoyed it,wish we would have saved our money. We see plenty of wildlife whilst walking around, got woke up plenty of times from the monkeys but it did not bother us as it was all part of the fun of staying in this hotel. The rooms were our only disappointment as a little dated, and not enough hanging and draw space. The fridge was well stocked, they were kept very clean and we did not have any problems with the hard beds as we are used to a firm mattress. I would defiantly go back and tell all my friends. Ps. i would just like to mention to be aware that i did have a item of jewelry taken from the room which i only put in my suit case the morning we were going to leave. It was someone who had a key to the room as there was no forced entry. It had been locked in the safe all week, so i was angry, i have emailed the hotel to let them know how i feel.", "Date": "February 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manitoba", "Title": "\u201cThe perfect vacation and wedding destination\u201d", "Author": "FunInTheSunManitoba", "ReviewID": "UR56948450", "Content": "We planned this vacation as a destination wedding and choose this Hotel from amongst many in the Maya Riviera. What it came down to was the reviews that I read on Trip Adivsor where we made our final decision to book with the Hotel. We are glad we did, as everything was unbelievable and all of our guests were extremely happy. We had a group of 40 travelling with us, all ranging in age from 9 to 65 years old and all of us with different tastes and lifestyles- there was something for everyone at the Tucan. The wedding co-ordinator Gabby was extremely helpful and quick with her emails through out the course of planning our wedding and our Signature Vacations Rep was just as accomodating. Gabby was very honest and helpful with all the details and especially on the wedding day- I know I could not have made it without her assistance! Unfortunately, the week that we were there, our beach was commencing construction and we were advised the day before we arrived, via email from Gabby, that our beach wedding was going to be interrupted (by huge CAT trucks). She sent us pictures on email and gave us other options. We ended up choosing a garden wedding, which actually turned out great! On our wedding day, there was just enough sun and it was hot! We had the garden exclusively to ourselves and it was alot more private. The beach on that day, probably would have been too windy and our guests wouldn't have been able to hear us and our Photos would have been distracted by on-lookers and construction equiptment. We had our cocktail party planned after the ceremony, on the beach and were able to take beautiful photos by the ocean right before the sun went down. I would recommend using the photographer the Hotel has as the photos turned out great and they know how to positition everyone and where to take the best pictures.They have an on site photo lab, so you get your photos very quickly. The Mexican themed cocktail party was perfect with tasty appetizers and our dinner at the Italian Restaurant was great too. We rented out the disco area for after dinner so we could do our first dance, and from there on, partied like there was no tomorrow. It all went by so fast and it was all so perfect! We had arrived on a Sunday and were married on the Tuesday, which I am glad we did, as everyone, including ourselves, had the rest of the week to do as you please. Although our beach was out of service, the staff and front desk were always so good to let us know what was going on when we asked. The hotel had a sign posted in the lobby with shuttle times for a bus to take you to the other Iberostar Hotel 30 mins away and here you could use all their facilities and beach for free. Our Signature rep had also given all of us the option of moving to the other Iberostar hotel at no charge for the rest of our stay, if any of us were not happy (because of the beach). We took the free shuttle and visited the other Iberostar Hotels, a couple of times, to make use of the beach and it was alot of fun. We got to experience a larger resort on a much grander scale as this one was 3 times bigger than the Tucan. No one from our group moved and were very happy with the size of the Tucan hotel as its not too big and not too small. The other hotel had a 15 min walk to the beach and we could easily loose each other. At the Tucan/Quetzal, we managed to always find someone in our group. The rooms at the hotel were just perfect. We were all satisfied with our rooms and accomodations and really like the shower! I have to say though, the beds were pretty hard, but if you kick back a few tequillas before bed, you don't really notice. We were in building 11 on the 3rd (top) floor, which was perfect for us and the rest of our group were scattered in either buildings 13 or 14, all close by. We were later upgraded to the Presidential Suite that over-looked the ocean. This was an amazing room with 3 baths, 3 beds and all the fixings fit for royalty. I would recommend upgrading to this room for any brides, as it would have been the perfect space to get ready in. We tried all the restaurants in the Hotel except for the Tropical- as it wasnt open at the time for dinner. Although that restaurant area was open for the breakfast buffet which was nice as you get the ocean view. The main buffet in either the Tucan or Quetzal had alot more to offer for breakfast/Lunch so it was nice to get that variety. The beach grill area was great too - nachos- amazing- and the icecream bar during the day was irresistable. The japanese restaurant was our favorite! Make your reservations early in the week so that you can get in at the times you want. The nite shows were worth watching and the Star Friends were alot of fun and very personable. They took us out one nite to CocoBongos in Playa and made us feel safe and of course made sure we all had the time of our lives! And we did! The hotel grounds were perfectly manicured and the staff were always cleaning. Housekeeping staff were nice to come back to clean when we weren't ready. One of our guests accidently left their safe opened and the staff were honest enough to shut it safely. If you needed anything at nite, we always found the storage room on our floor left opened and you could grab extra towels, pillows or water bottles if needed. The staff were all friendly and the bartender Sevi in the Lobby bar knew just how to make the perfect drink! We were lucky and had 7 days of sunny and hot weather. It was fun to walk around the resort and see the many birds and animals. It was always fun to see the crazy monkeys in the trees and hear them howling at 5 am. We were only a $5 cab ride away from Playa Del Carmen, and a 45 min walk down the street which was full of shops and even a StarBucks. The beach opened up on our last day and we played in the ocean and dug for huge sea shells. Since re-building the beach consisted of pumping in sand from the middle of the ocean, the entire beach front area as a gold mine for sea shells. If you are in the ocean swimming and you step on a hard 'rock', pick it up as it could be a huge conch! With the beach being closed most of the week, we still made the most of it all. We went on excursions during the day and even danced at the on site disco at nite. The pool area was just as nice and it was great to visit another resort too. All in all it was an amazing trip for all of us- so good that we have friends who ironically caught the bouquet and garter on our wedding, and want to return to this same hotel to get married! I can't wait to visit the Iberostar Tucan again and this time enjoy more of the restored beach and turquoise waters.", "Date": "February 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Jersey", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay\u201d", "Author": "SJersey037", "ReviewID": "UR56580597", "Content": "Excellent service all week.

Our kids are 16 and 13 years. Overall, very nice resort. Pros are definitely the beautiful grounds with abundant animal life. Amazing staff. The exterior buildings and layout of the resort are very nice. One caution: Many of the lobby and main restaurant area floors are marble and VERY slippery, especially after a rain. Although they put out plentiful caution signs, there is absolutely no traction on these floors, and we saw several people take fairly major tumbles when they hyrdoplaned on water puddles. Also the path through the jungle from the pool area to the lobby is fairly uneven and at night, the lighting is quite poor. Suggest that you do the path at least once during the day before you attempt a night trip unprepared! Pool is large, deep and well maintained (very clean). I found the \"Star Friends\" entertainment people quite tolerable compared so some of the other Mexican resorts that I have stayed where some of the poolside staff seem to be on sterioids and won't take \"no, I don't wish to participate in the activity\" as a personal affront. The beach front is absolutely fabulous, and the water is out of this world. The Iberostar is nicely situated near the end of the Playacar beach so aside from one resort south, you can walk for quite awhile without any developments. The bird life is much more abundant and \"present\" further south where there is less development and fewer people. There are two main buffets at the resort (both serve identically the same food), but it is nice to have the choice to eat on the Tucan or the Quesal side as a change. The food is good, but repetitive and abit greasy if you choose the grill option for breakfast (e.g. fried eggs or omelette). There are 5 restaurants onsite. We found the Japanese the most \"unique\" in terms of the menu. There is a pretty good tableside display of food preparation in this restaurant, and we found the staff very friendly and entertaining. The other restaurants offered fare which was basically buffet food presented a different way. There is only one lounge available after dinner and this is the one in the main lobby. It has miminal ambience. I would suggest that the hotel consider adding another lounge, perhaps abit more casual and closer to the beach for after sundown hours. Also, depending on how \"airy\" the evening, there is a fair amount of cigar and cigarette smoke which accumulates in the lounge which can just be plain disgusting, even for non-smokers like myself who have a high tolerence for second hand smoke. On the not so good side, despite the beautiful grounds, poolside and fabulous beach, the individual rooms are at best, adequate. The decor is dated, and our room had a pungent, musty smell, usually in the late evening and early morning. Plugs were coming out of the walls. The fan in the bathroom was totally inadequate and once one person had a shower, the bathroom was completely fogged for at least an hour. The hair dryer in the bathroom was something from the 1970s so make sure to bring you own if you require one. The beds were very hard. Noise carried very easily in the cabanas, so if you are at all noise sensitive, bring earplugs. (We found most of the noise internally generated versus from outside the unit). More good news- no cockaroachas noticed in the room!!! - though a few outside the room on the stairs and main level (all upside down, feet in air, and very dead!!). Finally, despite several calls to the front desk, we only ever really had our mini bar filled with water and a couple soft drinks. We finally got a couple beer a few days after our arrival but these typically didn't get refilled too easily. So, all in all, a good time. I would think twice about paying the amount that we payed for the room that we had at the Iberostar, but the resort was pretty good. My sisters went to Playa Carmen in November and payed the same as we did at the Valentin resort, (adult exclusive) and their experience was far more consistent and satisfying, But that is not to say that the Iberostar Tucan doesn't have it's redeeming qualities. I would just be sure to do your homework and check out other comparable resorts before booking.", "Date": "February 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cFantastic holiday! One of the best!\u201d", "Author": "petersonpol", "ReviewID": "UR56258018", "Content": "We traveled there in Jan-Feb - 2weeks. To get to the point I will make a list of good things and bad things about this hotel/resort. Good things: 1.Buildings and jungle. Somebody had a great idea to build a hotel within a jungle. Everything connects together perfectly. The buildings are hidden in the jungle. The restaurants are open (no walls) and there are nice paths between all the areas. This makes the whole resort very pleasant and enjoyable. 2.Service. People there work very hard to make everybody special. It was a pleasure to give a tip sometime. The glasses were always full. 3.Drinks. I drink a lot. I saw one complaint that the drinks are weak and give bad hangover. Not at ALL! I tried almost everything and each drink was very good. No hangover whatsoever. I tried drinks in Xel-Ha and it was awful! And yes... I was drunk many times so the drinks are not weak! When you go to the bars in Cancun don't take all inclusive. The drinks there are very weak, almost like drinking water. 4.Location. It is good location for people who want a little bit more relaxed atmosphere. There are no crowds on the beach because it is one of the last hotels on the beach before Sandos hotel. It is 5min walk to Playacar where you can buy souvenirs or go to Starbucks (Internet free when you buy a coffee but it was very slow). Now, as the beach is restored you can go to Playa del carmen all along the beach - 30min walk. 5.Beach. After the restoration the beach is brilliant. It is much bigger than in other hotels there. Yes, you have to walk now from your chair/palapa to the water. They are installing new palapas so there is and will be plenty of space and chairs. Much more than other hotels have there. 6.Food. Good a\u2019l carte restaurants. Very nice japanese and steakhouse. Also tried mexican - nice too. Didn\u2019t try Italian. Food in buffets nice especially freshly made. Yes you can get freshly prepared food there from cooks. They made the food on your eyes for example nice eggs or omelets. Go when the buffets are just open so you will have plenty of fresh food to choose and won\u2019t be crowded. The buffet next to the lobby has the biggest variety of food to choose. 7.Pool. Very nice, good size. Plenty of space and clean. Only shame that the hot tub in the middle of the pool is not heated. That was always a surprise for people coming there for the first time. Other good things: -nice spacious balconies in the rooms -wild animals in the jungle and around -nice bathroom in the room with good size shower -very good and professional night shows (could be noisy at night in rooms close to the shows) -very good entertaining during the day -free 1 lesson of diving in the pool (trips from the hotel by boat for snorkeling and diving) -a lot of sun-beds around the pool and on the beach (a lot of shadow too) -very friendly people (guests mainly from Canada & USA) -close everywhere, resort is not huge so you can easily go anywhere very quickly. -great hamburgers on the beach made by Orlando -playacar - safe place with guards on entries. Playa del carmen also very nice and friendly with many tourists. Yes the mexicans are trying to sell you something all the time and they are pushy but you just have to get used to it. This is not really that bad and they are always friendly. Bad things: 1.No Internet in the rooms. If you have your own laptop you can connect wifi in the lobby 13$ per day. There are also ONLY 2 computers available in the lobby - not free too. 2.Small safe. Maybe other rooms have bigger one but I couldn\u2019t put my small 13\u2019 laptop there. 3.Swimming bar separated from the main pool. I think it would be better if it was connected somehow. A bit dark there and chili (Jan-Feb) but still very nice. Maybe it is even better when it is separated because drunk people could be noisy :) 4.Rooms. They are clean and spacious but some of the things could be fixed or replaced. For example noisy air conditioning or out dated furniture. Yes, the TV is old but it works. Who is coming there to watch TV anyway? 5.Beds. Yes they are hard but if you want they can give some mattresses. There wasn\u2019t enough welcome drinks so we didn\u2019t get one :( 6.We did ask by email 2 weeks before we went to be placed on the highest floor close to the swimming pool but I don\u2019t think they respected our request. I don\u2019t think they were fully booked because many people decided to move to the other hotel because of the beach restoration. 7.When we asked about the beach restoration they didn\u2019t reply either.", "Date": "February 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fairview, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cAwesome\u201d", "Author": "BMead73", "ReviewID": "UR56198688", "Content": "This was our 4th trip to this resort.

We can\u2019t wait to return to such a beautiful Caribbean/Mayan style complex, with huge newly restored beach, wonderful staff and an extremely professional management team. We are from Alaska have talked to quiet a few repeat clients from United States who know most hotels in the area and agree on the high quality standard of all major aspects (value for money, rooms, location service, food, cleanliness, etc\u2026) in comparison with the rest of hotels of the area (Riu, Sandos, Viva, Alegro, Wyndham, Reef, Royal Hideaway, etc\u2026). From the very first time we hit the ground in Cancun international airport, everything went really smooth. We didn\u2019t have to wait long for luggage reclaim and as soon as we came out of the airport, the agency transportation was already waiting for us to take us to the hotel. Our check-in was breezy with a delicious welcome cocktail. That was a nice touch!!!!!!!. Reception staff were courteous and explained to us where everything was and how to make reservations for the a la carte restaurants. I was quite surprised at their good command of foreign languages, their professionalism and attitude of service. Our room was close to both the pool and the beach. The comfy waffle robes were a nice touch after a long day at the beach and a hot shower. Speaking of which... the showers were fabulous! There were always fresh clean towels and it was amusing to see what sort of art the maids had managed to make from them. We had just one minor problem with the tv channel changer but it was solved in a matter of minutes. I must say the maintenance staff is really efficient and the state of the property is superb. Regarding all this confusion about beach reconstruction, forget all exaggerated and negative comments. In our view, the whole beach renewal process was a complete success and was extremely well organized by the management team, really close to all guests, always willing to answer questions and in constant supervision. First, they removed the ugly sandbags and pumped tones of sand onto the beach and then leveled everything. This all resulted in a gain of about 40 meters of beach towards the sea! AN SPECTACULAR PIECE OF PARADISE! The resort did offer free shuttle service to the other Iberostar resorts to enjoy the beach there, where you could also use all inclusive privileges. To be honest, in spite of the fact that the Mexican Government closed off the beach for a couple of days, the management organized it so well that we still managed to have a three hour beach snooze every day and enjoy all details of this wonderful resort. They made an access to a swimming area while the rest of neighboring hotels didn\u2019t allow their guests to go near the sea. Furthermore, I remember some clients from other hotels coming to the entertainment activities of Tucan & Quetzal, saying that the organization in their hotels was a disaster. This property is a \"fun\". With an eco-friendly design that has done well to incorporate a jungle atmosphere among its walkways and buildings, the \"feel\" of the property is enough to send us back here. On our last trip to the Playacar/Playa del Carmen area, we walked the resort area and stopped into many of the other area resorts. Playa del Carmen is only 3 km away from the resort. You can take a cab (3$) or go for a walk (25 minutes). Playa is a wonderful small town. We love the more authentic Mayan/Mexican/Caribbean feel (palm frond roofing, open air lobbies, cultural icons) of the Quetzal/Tucan in comparison to the other resorts in this area. The in/outdoor seating for the buffets makes eating breakfast more enjoyable (and really, you\u2019re in the Caribbean and SHOULD be able to eat outdoors \u2013 who needs windows!). The property had a beautiful little spa, I took advantage of the lovely outdoor jacuzzi and plunge pool, and the tiny, though steamy, steamroom, all for free! We borrowed a hobie cat and went for a lovely sail along the beach, again, for free. I ran on a couple of occasions outside the premises of the hotel, in a closed neighbourhood called Playacar, with its own golfcourse. The streets were really clean with beautiful houses and quite a lot of tourists doing sport. While running each day, I passed maya ruins from centuries ago (incredible!), beautiful beaches, sacred places, and more friendly faces than I can shake a stick at. I've run in worse neighborhoods at home. We rented a car from Thrifty, which happened to have an office onsite and did a little exploring, to Tulum and to Playa del Carmen for some shopping. This place is a little gem compared to a lot of the gigantic neighboring resorts. Besides, you can enjoy hundreds of activities/excursions per payment through the travel agents in the lobby counters of the hotel. During the day, the pool area is a nice place to relax .There is a nice bar nearby, ice cream is served just off the beach in the afternoon (try the strawberry ice cream!), and the outdoor showers are perfect to rinse your feet as you return to the pool area or room from the beach. The palapas are AWESOME and maybe my favorite part of this resort. The beach is just there, next to the rooms and is kept immaculately cleaned during the day. In other words, the property is extremely well maintained. The staff is very friendly. The resort itself was brimming with wildlife: tucans, peacocks, cranes, flamingos, swans, exotic bids, lizards, turtles and monkeys! The sounds of nature around you are sensational as you stroll through the jungle and explore the twists and turns that lead you out to the pool and eventually to the beach area. I've never seen a resort that integrates the wildlife so well. It is an ideal place for families with kids. The food was great. I'm a bit of a gourmet with tight standards when it comes to restaurants, but I must say everything was superb. Some of my favorite meals were shrimps on the lunch buffet and fried tortillas with onions, tomato, parsley and fresh cheese in the morning. However, breakfast is as traditional or as international as you want it to be. Great omelettes, bacon and eggs and lots of sweet things to start your day. If you happen to have a hungover, try some Chaya juice, which is good for detoxifying and native to the Yucatan peninsula. Pulled Sucking pig to make tacos from\u2026DELISH!!!!. Nachos (get the freshly fried, unsalted chips) with guacamole and (mexican salsa) for your most authentic experience. AMAZING!!!!!!! The a la carte restaurants were spectacular. It was nice to be served. We were allowed only three, but made an extra one for our last night and the management kindly agreed. The ambiance was nice but the food was spectacular. The service was impeccable. It was rare that my glass was not full or my plate left dirty on the. Everyone was super friendly and funny!!!!. Having said that, the bar service was fabulous. Serverario in the lobby bar was a hoot and Cesar in the pool bar was awesome, making us laugh. Besides, the lobby bar is well-stocked (ask for brand beverages), the servers are friendly and most attentive, the occasional guitarist was good (live music is a must on any Mexican vacation), and the drinks were well made. It didn't lack for anything. If you prefer quiet, you can find quiet, if you're like us and you desire lots of activity, it's there for you! I cannot say enough about the Star staff. They are incredible. During the day they make sure you're kept busy w/games, dance, exercise, etc., etc. If you don't wish to participate the staff will not push you to do something you do not want to do. The evening shows are so worth it. There is an early show for the children that the adults will enjoy also. Afterwards there's approx. 45 min-an hour theme shows. These shows range from comedy to hispanic culture. It is the best entertainment I have ever seen , I am reaching the age of 40, I have seen a lot already and many well traveled guests totally agree. I do recommend it 100%. I just love Iberostar, especially the staff and the management of Tucan & Quetzal, the beach, the jungle, the star friends, the friendliness, the excellence of the food and the high quality standard of service in bars and restaurants alike. You just have to try it. For us there is only one place we are going back to and that is Tucan-Quetzal. Missing you from Alaska.

Staff friendly, smiling and work extremely hard everyday. The animals were taken care of well, fed and their areas were clean. Woke up the first morning to see a peacock on our balcony then on the way to breakfast, he was strutting his plumes for everyone to see. Monkeys made an appearance almost everyday and we saw a number of iguanas, gopher like animals, turtles, tortoises and birds. The food in the buffet was pretty much the same everyday but there was always something there that wasn't there the day before. If you loved a certain food, it was there for you like the Hot Oat cereal in the morning (a must to try), the guacamole & salsa, chicken and the veal just to mention a few of my favorites. We visited every restaurant for dinner and was able to get reservations for 6:30 every night but you need to book these as soon as you get there to get a good time. Don't leave it to the last minute, you will be eating late every night if you do. Had no problem with room and sound. Maybe we didn't have anyone above us but the room was always clean and neat. Very little on TV but I wasn't there to watch TV. No internet in room and computers old in hotel but again, I was not there to be on the computer everyday. Beach was beautiful, fence from construction was pulled down the night we arrived, so access to the water was great. Lots of chairs and hummocks on beach and the beach drink service was great. Lunch buffet was accessible from the beach or pool so no need to go for longer walk to get food. You could get stuff like hamburgers, hotdogs, wedge fries, ice cream etc right on the edge of beach or go into the buffet area for more extensive lunch selection. Lots of activities/games for everyone of all ages. Didn't see my spouse much as he was gone playing the games. He really liked the air gun, archery, darts and beach games. Shops in the hotel were expensive but we walked into Playa (about 30 minute walk) and got some great deals in the stores there. The hotel had some street vendors come in every second night (good not to overload the patrons with pressure sales) and we managed to barter some good prices then too.

Days prior to our flight, a friend advised that there was a recent comment on the site which stated that there was a restoration project being completed by the Mexican Government at our beach and that our beach was closed. We did some quick research in order to find a possible completion date and found a \"Blog\" which said that guests were being offered an alternative...either request a transfer to one of two other Iberostar resorts (at the time of check-in and only 30 minutes away) or be transported back and forth from either resort at no additional charge. When we arrived at the resort, on February 6, 2010, the project had been completed and the beach looked AWESOME!! **We travelled as a family of eight and we all agreed that the Iberostar Tucan is a fabulous resort!! We enjoyed the resort as a whole. The staff were absolutely AWESOME!! They were very friendly, attentive and courteous. The resort and rooms were kept amazingly clean with the walks being pressure washed. The rooms included towels, shampoo, soap/gel, hair dryer, free bar and free safe. The food/meals, in both the Iberostar Tucan and Iberostar Quetzel (neighboring resorts on the same property and accessible to the guests) were excellent! There were several Buffet Restaurants as well as ala carte Restaurants...three ala cartes were included with our all-inclusive package. The beach was amazing with it's fine white sand, lounge chairs and palapas...towel cards were given to each guest upon check-in. There were also numerous pools with lounge chairs and palapas to enjoy. The daily events and evening enterainment was very well-planned and a great deal of fun. You also get to enjoy a jungle-like environment where you will see monkeys, chickens and peacocks wandering freely and there were swans, ducks, tucans, parrots and flamingos on the resort as well. The resort is within close proximity and accessibility to many excursions and shopping opportunities in and around Playa del Carmen. The size of the resort was perfect as you can get from one end of the resort to the other within minutes. You also get to know the staff by name and they, in turn, got to know us by name. **All in all, it was an excellent vacation and a wonderful experience!! It is our intention to return to the Iberostar Tucan Resort and we feel 100% confident in referring this resort to all of our family and friends.

Straight out did not tell me that I could not go to the beach and swim in the ocean at this resort, found that out the next day when I walked to the fence at the beach and was not permitted to go any further. They also failed to tell me that they would gladly relocate me to their other resort in Cancun if I wanted, that information was only disclosed if you complained loudly. But they did offer buses at 10:00 and 12:00 am to take you to the other resort to swim at that beach and return at 3:00 and 5:00pm. And no Apple Vacations did not tell me about the beach either. The bed was hard but tolerable, actually I think it may have helped me somehow, and the AC in the room cannot be adjusted any lower than 20 C whatever that is in Fahrenheit. But this is what I did while we were there and at night when we went to bed. I put the fan on the thermostat to high and the ceiling fan was going counter clockwise, so I stopped the fan, and pushed the little black switch on the ceiling fan to make the fan go clockwise and placed it on high speed and at about 10:30 or 11:00 at night I was pulling the covers up on me because things had cooled down.

This year we decided to return toTucan for the 6th time after 3 years of wandering through other mexican hotels. Upon arrival we learned that the beach was closed for government-sponsored repairs. The hotel was probably 1/3 full, and what Tucan management should have done was to offer to transfer us to Paraiso Beach right away. Instead, they told us that the beach will reopen in 1-2 days (the workers next day told us couple of weeks), and offered a shuttle to Paraiso, which turned out to be a disaster. So, next day we requested to be transferred, and we were. Of course, it involved packing, checking out, checking in, waiting for the room, etc. So, the vacation got delayed, and mostly happened at Iberostar Paraiso Beach. Other than that - Iberostar was great. There is liitle I can complain about - - certainly food is good enough, and the Star Friends do a great job at keeping everyone entertained all day long. I like the set up of the lobby with the bar, where people congregate in the evening, and the theater in the center of the resort - it seems to bring people together. I guess it is a matter of taste, but I prefer the smaller Iberostar Tucan/Quetzal and it's location in Playacar, however my family and our friends liked the spaciousness of Iberostar Paraiso beach/Del Mar. Since the Playa Paraiso complex expanded, they build a new spa, which is an experience to behold, with the various massage baths and salt-water pool - and I am not even a spa person. If I may suggest couple of things to the management: 1. get modern and bring internet to the rooms. I know we don't go to Iberostar to browse the internet, but there is nothing wrong with catching up with the news and e-mails at the end of the day in the quiet of your room. The option they have now - wireless access in the lobby for $15 is ridiculously expensive and inconvenient, especially in the large resort. 2. Do away with the towel cards. Beaches resorts have towels everywhere without any cards - and they do fine. Trust us, we don't come to Iberostar to steal your towels. We did a tour with the Dressel Divers (Iberostar's dive shop): snorkeling in cenotes (Dos Ojos) and in the lagoon (Yal-Ku). We've done the same type of tour before with Mayan Adventures (same lagoon, but their privately owned cenote), and with Emilio (same lagoon, some other cenote). Of all of them, I would prefer Mayan Adventures. The good thing about Dressel Divers - they gave us wet suites - the water in cenotes is cool. I wish they also gave us underwater lights.

I would definitely go back again and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to get away for a quiet vacation. The Tucan is not a 'wild/crazy' resport. In fact, most of the activities die down after the show each night. It was nice to get away and not be surrounded by a bunch of drunk college kids. On our 5th day, we woke up to a surprise. Our beach was closed. We were not notified by our Agent or by any employees of the hotel until the morning. After an hour discussion with Oscar (General Manager), the Iberostar offered us a room at the Iberostar Lindo resort. They even paid for our taxi to the resort. Everything worked out and was a very smooth and seamless transition. My only negatives about the Tucan are: The rooms are a little outdated. I know... you don't spend a lot of time in the rooms. But, it would be nice to have a semi modern room to come back to after a day at the beach/pool. The beds are rock solid. I felt like I was from the Flinstones sleeping on a rock hard bed.

The corridors were immaculate and was always maintained. However, The grounds on the Quetzal side needed a little more upkeep. On with the food: -We tried 3 of their 4 a la carte restaurants and we found that the Mexican was the worse ( ironically). Both the Japanese and Steakhouse were very good. -A MUST is their breakfast buffet. From the custom omelets and a vast variety of fresh fruit juices, to huevos ranchios, sausage and fried crispy discs topped with cinnamon and sugar ( don't know what there\"re called), You just have to try it. - The buffets were plentiful and tasted pretty good. Just stay away from the hot dogs, it tastes like plastic spam. you'll see what i mean. I really want to give a \"shoutout\" to the star friends. They work long hours to keep all the guests entertained and puts on shows at night. They tried to be creative and perfrom something different every night. They also eat with you during lunch hours so you get to get to know them a little. all in all, We had a really good time. It was a girls getaway for us and we all had something to do.

But aside from that, the staff were friendly and very attentive, the starfriends worked impressively hard with everything from daytime yoga to vegas-style evening shows, the food was good all of the time and sometimes outstanding, and the gardens were magical, with beautiful peacocks, sereque, lizards and monkeys all around.

Make sure you get to xel-ha and xcaret where you can see beautiful habitats and wonderful creatures, but most importantly do not pass over the chance to swim with manatees - the encounter has left me obsessed with these gentle endangered creatures. You can swim with them at Xel-ha but we did it through the sea life discovery at Puerto Aventuras near Playa del Carmen, where you get to swim with dolphins, sea lions and manatees in one morning (you can book all the trips through the hotel) Though it's very rushed and you are in large swimming pools, it's amazing to be in the water with these beautiful sea creatures and the manatees in particular are out of this world. We have since adopted one through www.savethemanatee.org. The evening show at xcaret is amazing and best seen after visiting chichen itza, so that you can appreciate some of the history and the skills reenacted in the sacrificial ball game. All in all, the trip to playacar was brilliant and having seen many of the surrounding hotels when the trip coaches went to pick up other guests on the way, whilst the Tucan may not have been as posh as some of the other major hotels, it certainly seemed to be the one most in harmony with its surrounding and I have recommended it to all my friends!", "Date": "February 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "chicago,il", "Title": "\u201cWorse vacation so ever\u201d", "Author": "nattoday", "ReviewID": "UR54939984", "Content": "We just return from our 8th trip to iberostar tucan We stayed in iberostar tucan from 01/21/2010 to 01/30/2010.

These shows range from comedy-hispanic culture. The other reviews rave about the beach, grounds, ice cream, food, animals, sand whales, pools, etc. These are all excellent.

Once there you can go to the bus station and go to Cancun in an ac bus (1hr drive) for $4.00 one way. That's if you're looking for an inexpensive day and would like to see Cancun. We're in our 60's and will be back w/kids and grandkids. Thank you Iberostar!

Staff were courteous and explained to us where everything was and how to make reservations for the a la carte restaurants. Our room was close to both the pool and the beach. Yes... the beds were hard, but actually quite supportive and good for your back. The comfy waffle robes were an nice touch after a long day at the beach and a hot shower. Speaking of which... the showers were fabulous! Nicely tiled with lots of hot water and great pressure. They do have soap and shampoo there, but I always bring my own stuff. Make sure you bring conditioner--that's the one thing they don't provide. There were always lots of fresh clean towels and it was amusing to see what sort of art the maids had managed to make from them. After our first evening we were awakened from a nap by a large howler monkey who lived in the trees near our room. The first time he woke us up, i thought it was quite hilarious and really cool. I was not so amused when he decided to make some noise at 5:30 am one morning. After a while, he shut up and I went back to sleep to awaken to another fabulous day. Looking back... it was still cool. I had heard that the week before was quite cold in Playa del Carmen. We were very lucky and the weather was perfect. The pool was cold, but on a hot day it was lovely and refreshing! The beach and ocean were fabulous. The water was warm and crystal clear, crashing on soft white sand. The sand whales detracted a bit, but necessary for them to repair the beach. The only negative comment to be made about the beach was the fact that they closed it off and began reconstruction on the second last day that we were there. A little disappointing, but we still managed to find a chair behind the roped off area and have a three hour beach snooze. The resort did offer free shuttle service to the other Iberostar resorts to enjoy the beaches there, where you can also make use of your all inclusive privileges. I'm excited to go back to Playa del Carmen when the beaches are finished as I'm sure it will be a perfect and heavenly little slice of paradise! (it already kinda was.) The resort itself was brimming with wildlife: tucans, peacocks, cranes, flamingos, swans, exotic bids, lizards, turtles and yes...our monkey friends! The sounds of nature around you are sensational as you stroll through the jungle and explore the twists and turns that lead you out to the pool and eventually to the beach area. You can walk on the paved roads that run parallel on either side of the resort, as well, but I've never seen a resort that integrates the wildlife so well. Kids would have a blast here! The food was good. I'm a bit of a gourmet with tight standards when it comes to restaurants, but I have to say that there were always things that I liked. Some of the things that I thought were fabulous were: -Delicious shrimp on the lunch buffet. They did have the legs and head on, but this is how shrimp come. They were deliciously grilled in light seasoning and I had a nice feed. -At the dinner buffet one night they had a wonderful cream of Avocado and Pistachio soup that was delicate and rich at the same time. Very nice. -Uh....we're in Mexico, so I ate chilaquiles for brekky every morning. In my mind there are few things more authentic and delicious than fried tortillas, onions, tomato, cilantro and queso fresco in the morning. However, breakfast is as traditional or as international as you want it to be. Great omelettes, bacon and eggs and lots of sweet things to start your day. If you're hungover, try some Chaya juice, which is good for detoxifying and native to the Yucatan peninsula. -Pulled Sucking pig to make tacos from... DELISH! -Nachos (get the freshly fried, unsalted chips) with guacamole and pico de gallo (mexican salsa) for your most authentic experience. AMAZING! -BEWARE the habernero peppers on the buffet. They are beside the roasted jalapenos, and they are not called haberneros on the sign. HOLY CRAP! I love hot food, I mean , I'm a freak for it... but I grabbed a few of these things and was totally unprepared for the rush of pain, giddiness and exhilaration that ensued! This was one of the best food moments of my life! The a la cartes were okay. It was nice to be served. We had no trouble getting reservations. we were allowed three, but made an extra one for our last night and they said nothing. Mexican was the best. The ambiance in the Italian was nice but the food was not spectacular. The Japanese was fun: it was our friend's b-day and the staff all came out, clanging pots and pans and singing happy birthday. The tempura is not really tempura, but I mean, come on....who goes to Mexico for sushi or tempura? The Steakhouse was nice. The tenderloin I had was delicious but not very tender. Please keep in mind that these are not complaints, I had a great time, and did not expect anything there to be rated in Gourmet magazine, but I feel that it's important to tell you what a real foodie thought of the food an how you can get a more gourmet experience from what is offered. But we all have different tastes. The service was impeccable. It was rare that my glass was not full or my plate left dirty on the table or that we we were not greeted with \"hola, senoritas\" wherever we went. Everyone was super friendly and funny! It was really nice that the resort was within walking distance to Fifth Ave. It is a long walk, and you can take the beach half way up, but you'll have to cut through one of the resorts on the way in as there is a barrier that extends farther out from the shore than you'd be willing to venture for a stroll. Good to work off those nachos and margaritas! The second day we were lazy and took a cab which was $5 US one way. 5th Ave is bustling with bars, shops and great people watching. I'll close this review with the only thing that I found not to be substandard about this resort: The booze. When I'm on vacation, I love my cocktails and indulging in the nightlife. However, top shelf liquors were scarce at this resort. If you asked, they MIGHT pull out a bottle of Absolut or Jose Cuervo, but I question whether it's not just the same bad booze poured into a premium bottle. I suffered badly from that cheap booze. Every time I drank on the resort, I got a screaming headache and felt dizzy followed by a MASSIVE hangover. If I drank off the resort, I was fine. Having said that, the bar service was fabulous. Serverario in the lobby bar was a hoot and Cesar in the pool bar was awesome, making us laugh. All in all a fabulous vacation!!!

Not always top notch but if you read bad reviews about the food I will let you use your imagination as to the type of person that would be complaining. Staff is very friendly and they don't ignore you if you don't tip them, although I like to throw the especially friendly ones a few dollars. Pool is huge and plenty of chairs even though you get the typical chair reservations. One of these times I am going to throw someones gear right in the pool. Rooms are decent. Only complaint is that the toilet would barely flush. Beds are very very hard, which I actually liked with my bad back. WARNING: The beach is fantastic with plenty of chairs and palapas. However, the last day we were there, the government shut down the beach in order to do some repairs due to the erosion. I had heard that the beach was going to be closed the entire week of the 24th Jan, but this is hearsay. A lot of people were complaining and demanding to go to another resort.

After booking through the travel agents, I did contact the hotel directly to try to ensure we were assigned a room with two beds. We were there for New Year's Eve and a month before our departure from the UK, I was contacted by the hotel giving details of New Year's Eve arrangements and offering to make our gala dinner reservations for our preferred time. WOW! This was impressive! Check in was efficient, and we did receive a welcome drink. These drinks, as with others I've had, are VERY sweet. We were assigned room 1127. Block 11, 2nd floor. It was a good location, near to the pool and the beach. In fact, it was quicker to use the bathroom in your room from the beach than to use the facilities by the pool! And much nicer. The room was quite basic but very clean. I've attached a picture. Plenty of towels in the bathroom. The shower had a decent pressure. The air conditioning was efficient. And, as others have said, we were always greeted by a different piece of towel artwork each evening. The beds were quite firm, but they didn't stop us sleeping. On one occasion our room was very late in being serviced. And we found that the bare minimum had been done, ie beds made, towels replaced. That's it. The floors were not cleaned (there was still sand from the day before), toiletries bottles knocked over and the mini bar had not been restocked for the 3rd day on the trot. In fact, mini bar re-stocking was quite random, and certainly not on the alternate days promised. We got into the habit of refilling our water bottles on our way back from the beach! Not much of a view from the balcony as we looked over the pathway running between the beach and reception. No water views, plenty of greenery. But as it got dark early that time of year, we had little opportunity to use it, preferring to have our drinks in one of the hotel bars. The bar staff were all very good, and made a mean Bloody Mary! We did find one or two of the waitresses a little surly though. The main restaurant was massive. We never had to wait for a seat in there. Normally a nice one over looking the ponds with koi carp in them. The restaurant on the Quetzal side was similar but had a stunning waterfall setting complete with swans. Bearing in mind that the set up is to cater for large numbers of diners, buffet style and not cooked to order a la carte style, we found the food to be good. There was plenty of choice and even the most fussy of eaters should be able to find something to eat - various meats and fish in sauces, or just grilled. Seafood. Plenty of vegetables which were still slightly crisp and not over cooked. Salads. Charcuterie. Tacos. Pasta and sauces. Pizzas and burgers, etc for the children. Breakfast was standard fare to be found in big international hotels. Again, plenty of choice. Everything hot. The freshly cooked omelettes were especially good. Plenty of fresh fruit and juices. We mainly ate lunch in the smaller restaurant by the beach. There was a fresh burger/hotdog station outside with food available all afternoon, and a very hardworking chef there. Or lunch in the restaurant was, again, grilled meat and fish, salads. Pizza and pasta also always available. Here, whichever option you choose, you can eat as healthily or unhealthily as you wish. Each afternoon, afternoon tea is also served here. With real cake and gateaux, really tempting! Much better than other places I've visited offering afternoon tea. If you really want it, you can even have room service until 11 pm, included in your all inclusive price. Others have said they had problems booking in the a la carte restaurants. We had no issues at all and managed to use all 3 of our allocations - the Mexican. Well, we were in Mexico! It was nice to be served for a change, but I would say that I didn't go over-board with the food. It was nice but not great. Especially as the next one we visited was the steak restaurant. That was great. Our steaks were delicious (we had fillets). And were served with well cooked vegetables and baked potatoes. Our 3rd choice was the tropical restaurant. It was mainly fish on the menu with Caribbean spicing. Tuna was my choice here and it was beautifully cooked. In all 3 restaurant, it was a help yourself buffet appetizers, and then the main course and dessert was served a la carte. If I was doing this again, I'd probably try the Japanese restaurant instead of the Mexican one. We were also surprised that despite being told the restaurants were busy, they were only half full when we dined in them so I can only assume that the booking numbers are determined by what the kitchen can manage, rather than how many the restaurant can hold. We were very well looked after by the waiters in all 3 of the a la carte restaurants. We only visited the evening entertainment twice (one occasion was on New Year's Eve). From what we saw, compared to other places I have been, the entertainment was of a good standard. The dancing was especially good. It certainly looked like they were very well rehearsed. A word of warning, if you like eating late (or later than about 7:30 pm) you will never get a seat in the entertainment theatre. We rarely ate before 8 pm! The beach was very clean, with powdery white sand. Plenty of sunbeds. Despite the \"no reservation\" rule, there were always towels on the sunbeds under the shaded areas before 7:30 am. If you are not bothered where you sit, there are plenty of sunbeds to be had. Most days we preferred to drag our sunbeds onto the open beach area where others were not on top of us. Fortunately, at this end of Playacar, the beach is wide enough to do this. The beds under the umbrellas are fairly close together. BUT not as close as the beds around the pool. Which were side by side touching. So you'd need to crawl onto them from the bottom. Why do hotels do this? Consequently, we didn't use the pool area so can't comment on it. We did none of the Starfriends activities so can't comment here either. Overall I'd say that this is a nice hotel, the pluses being friendly staff, plenty of good food, and drink! Nice grounds, and interesting with all the wildlife around the hotel. Good beach area. Reasonably priced. On the downside, if you did want to walk into Playa del Carmen town, it is quite a schlepp - especially if you then walk all the way down 5th, and then back again. (Previously, I've stayed at the other end in the Continental Plaza, now the Playacar Palace - great location around the corner from 5th but minimum beach space). If you just want a week in the sunshine to relax, and be well fed and well watered you could do worse than here.", "Date": "January 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cWaited 2 years to get back, and would leave again tomorrow if I could\u201d", "Author": "Frego", "ReviewID": "UR54135492", "Content": "Our family spent the best vacation of our lives at Iberostar Quetzal in 2008, and everytime we even said the word vacation, we wanted to go back.

We traveled this time with Apple Vacations-LOVE the direct flight! We were able to check in early at 11:30am and stayed this time in Tucan, room 1223. This is a great building, close to the pool and beach. Everything we love about this resort has not changed. It is clean, well maintained, you walk in the jungle and feel as if no one is there but you. Everyone you encounter is friendly with a smile and an \"ola\". We tried to do more of the activities this trip, so we did the bike tour 2 times, beach vollyball, bocci, soccer, water aerobics, stretching...love that Luigi, ask him about \"child's box\". The best thing about the activites is getting to know the Star Friends and people from all over the world. We love the diversity! I have recently found that I am gluten intolerant, and I found I had no problem finding great meals...but at breakfast there was usually a table full of donuts, pastries, pancakes, and muffins, which I called the \"table of pain\". I am in the hospitality business and it is really hard to not find fault in service or food quality normally, but even the second time around, I felt I was a VIP guest at every buffet, and there is something for everyone in the menus. We had three trips to the buffet every evening...first the appetizers, then the Mexican plate, then the regular entree, oops! and even found dessert with the creme caramel. I guess that's 4 trips. The beach was so great to see again, 2 years ago the beach had undergone a terrible erosion, and the big sand bags were just being filled! The only disappointment in the 2nd time around is the pristene beach everyone refers to on the other side of the Sandos resort....there were big trucks, building blocks, and cranes, constructing a long pier and blocking the beach path with big \"caution\" signs.

I'd do them both again, and there's no reason why I wouldn't consider the Iberostar Tucan for a repeat visit. This hotel is part of a two-hotel complex, with the other half called the Iberostar Quetzal. It's not really clear why the management makes a distinction, since both hotels share common dining, swimming, and entertainment venues. The hotels consist of two parallel rows of 12 three-story buildings each. The rows of buildings run perpendicular to the beach. Each building contains about 24 rooms. Between the two rows of buildings, the developer retained a bit of the native landscape, and constructed paved paths through the forest. Traveling from reception and the dining rooms to the pools and the beach can involve a calming walk through the forest, replete with animals including spider monkeys, howler monkeys, capybaras, and many more. Guests who don't want to navigate the woods can walk on sidewalks behind the rows of buildings. The hotel is one of about eight hotels included in a gated residential-golf-resort development called Playacar on the southern outskirts of Playa del Carmen, about 30 miles south of Cancun. We were the second furthest resort from town, and it took a pleasant 45 minutes to walk to town. Playacar is much quieter and much more relaxing than town. We were glad we stayed at Playacar and had access to town, because many resorts along the Riviera Maya are very isolated from towns and require a taxi ride to get to \"civilization.\" The service staff members at the Tucan are wonderful and will go out of their way to make sure you have a wonderful time. They are unfailingly friendly and solicitous. The food is fine, but nothing to write home about. It seemed to my wife and me that the food was rather bland, but I guess if you're cooking for large numbers of people with many different tastes, you've got to find a proper middle ground. In addition to the buffets, the hotel has five themed restaurants (i.e., Italian, Mexican, Japanese, Steakhouse, and Tropical [closed when we visited] ). Guests may visit 2 or more of the themed restaurants (the number depends on how many nights you book). We ate at the Japanese (great show) and the Steakhouse (great steaks) restaurants. It was unusually cool when we visited in January, so the swimming pools were all but empty. The pools are large, but I can imagine that they could get pretty crowded if the weather were perfect. The beach is fine. It's packed with beach chairs which I understand get filled to capacity when the weather's perfect. We had no trouble finding a chair because the weather was cool. We walked the beach two times. It is possible to walk from end to end of the beach in 45 minutes. At the north end, a hotel building encroaches on the beach, limiting access further north (toward Playa del Carmen). At the south end, builders are constructing a new resort, and access is barred by construction workers guarding orange fencing. The beach is eroding; to limit the damage, the hotels along Playacar have installed gigantic sand-filled fabric bags to break the waves. We nicknamed them \"beach whales.\" They're numerous, not particularly attractive, and also not particularly effective. Our room was not well soundproofed. When drunken revelers climbed the stairs in the wee hours of the morning, there was no sleeping through the ruckus. It was even possible to hear people having normal conversations on the stair landings. The room was clean and cheery and the beds were firm.

The cons for us were the food. Below average for an all-inclusive. They did get a few items right here and there, but a lot of it bland and definitely some cases of re-using breakfast food for lunch, and lunch food for dinner. They at least could've done the Mexican food a bit better. On the other hand, my wife and I are foodies to a degree. But, having said that, we thought it was still below-average for an all-inclusive.

The location is great- close to playa del carmen, the trips to Tulum, and other spots worth seeing. The rooms are outdated, some of the furniture is in pretty bad shape and the wonderful stonework in the rooms on the walls tends to be nicked or broken off in places. We have requested other rooms, but all tend to have all or a few of these problems. Compared with other hotels in the area at the same price range, check in lacks the friendly greeting and drink that all others offer. The food is pretty much the same in the buffets day in and day out, and it is the same food you get at the restaurants- although given in a nicer presentation. This hotel also has a tendency of servicing at the lunch or dinner buffets what did not go the night before in the restaurants. In general, there is a lot of salt used and the foods are prepared either fried or sauteed. The drinks are made of low priced liquors and are sugar mixes, not fresh, except for some pretty darn good mojitos. But for the price one pays for this hotel, this is still a good value. The service is really good in general, but there are a few bad apples in every place. The bartenders are super friendly. English is in general not a problem. Sometimes, however, there is the slight feel as if guests are either treated like children or simply herded from one activity/place to another. And activities there are a plenty. If you enjoy games, competition, making yourself or others look silly- all for a bottle of tequila- this is a great place. Pool games are fun, and the \"Star Friends\" keep the guests busy and entertained. However, they do tend to push guests sometimes too much into joining the nightly shows or such- so much that one of our party felt almost harassed. In general, this is a great place for young college people, with a disco on site in the hotel, they can party all night and all day long and nobody will bat an eye. However, if you are expecting quiet ( there is none with the constant \"hey baby\" singing and games) or are seeking more luxury or a romantic escape or just plain don't feel comfortable participating, this is not the right choice of hotel.", "Date": "January 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norwich", "Title": "\u201cignor bad reviews... its fantastic!!!!\u201d", "Author": "Ruth039", "ReviewID": "UR52977235", "Content": "Hotel was very clean and well kept.

This resort was beautiful in all ways. My wife and I were accompanied by my daughter, son-in-law and grand children ages 11 and 14. The hotel and grounds were immaculate and kept that way throughout our stay of seven days. The resort is actually built around a jungle. It has peacocks, monkeys, tons of different kinds of birds that roam freely in their natural habitat shared with the resort. The beach is spectacular. The pools are very clean and the staff is focused on keeping everything clean and tidy. The hotel grounds are lush, tropical, and very pretty with paths that connect different parts of the resort - where you can spot all kinds of animals. The Howler monkeys are a bit harder to spot than the rest, but they are around, you hear them daily. The dining area near the Quetzal side is particularly beautiful, with a great waterfall/wildlife area. So many people have mentioned that this resort's food is a main weakness. What is everyone expecting? Food is, get this... quite good. It may not be 5 star resort quality, but it was definitely way better than I expected after reading some of the reviews on here. You will not be disappointed. I found the food to be diverse, with an exceptional variety of meats, fruits & vegetables all very tasty - as did everyone I was with. The buffet food was excellent, especially the fresh fish, and changed daily. Breakfast was the best for me but dinner was my wife\u2019s choice. For someone who isn\u2019t an ice cream lover, she fell in love with the ice cream bar -- I liked the one at the beach. We made dinner reservations at the Japanese steak house and the Italian restaurant. Both were excellent. I was, however, surprised to see empty tables at our 8:30 seating when I had been told they were booked. Our room in unit 14 was large and lovely (No ants, AC worked, curtains closed, etc. as reported by some). It was immaculate and made up daily. The maid made towel art figures daily out of the wash clothes and they were a hit with everyone. The night entertainment was unexpected and quite good compared to what I expected. I would wait \u2018til 9:30 to go unless I had small children. The \u201cStar friends\u201d really do put noticeable effort into the shows, with beautiful costumes, musicians that are actually talented, and dancers that can actually dance. I really enjoyed the ambiance of the hotel. The lobby and restaurant areas were very beautiful and decorated for the holidays. The waterfall at the other side of the hotel was so neat! I loved the decor of the rooms and found them to be quite up-to-date. Newsflash, the beds are hard, but we slept well every night since we sleep on a firm mattress at home. This resort has exceptional employees who are the most helpful and friendly you will ever meet. Every employee you encounter will treat you like royalty. Mexico\u2019s second biggest business, just behind oil, is tourism and these people appreciate your choosing to come here for vacation. The Tucan is truly a paradise run by the finest staff you will ever meet from beginning to end.

To begin with when we were planning our vacation our choices were the Riu Palace and the Iberostar Tucan. Based on the trip advisor\u2019s reviews, The Iberostar Tucan got the most positive reviews therefore the Tucan was our chosen one. And oh boy! I was so glad that we selected the Tucan hotel. The Iberostar Tucan has the best beach in that area. The Riu Palace is very pretty and majestic but it has a tiny little beach where you can\u2019t swing or play in the water, the Riu palace beach is mainly for sunbathing. A difference with the Tucan\u2019s beach where you can do whatever you want. We booked our vacation package through United Airline and everything went well. We arrived after 4:00pm and our room was ready and waiting for us. Our room was the 2714. It has a balcony and has a view of trees. As a matter of fact by the end of our vacation, the family of monkeys was hanging around in those trees. The service at the hotel was great, from the people at the reception desk, to the waiters and waitresses at the buffet, specialty restaurants and different bars. The Iberostar Tucan employees were very friendly and nice they always had a smile on their faces. The food in the buffet restaurants was good and plenty; one piece of advice, if you want to go to any of the specialty restaurants you \u201cMUST\u201d do your reservation the day that you check in. because we were there for ten days we were able to had reservations in all of the specialty restaurants. We booked them right after we checked in. My favorite was the Mexican one. As a matter of fact the steak that I had at the Mexican restaurant was better that the steak at the \u201csteak house\u201d Regarding the entertainment it was kind of good. The best shows for me were: \u201cViva Mexico\u201d, \u201cLas Vegas\u201d and the \u201cPrehispanic Show\u201d the other shows were kind of cheesy. The worst one was called \u201cTutti-Frutti\u201d. The \u201cStar Friends\u201d team people were very friendly and they were always trying to motivate people to participate on their different activities. Our only complain in this area is that some beach activities were canceled without any notifications. Per example: the Boccie tournament at the beach was canceled even thou people were waiting for the game to start, unfortunately the \u201cStar Friend employee\u201d never showed up. The \u201cbingo game\u201d is only for one round that was kind of silly, because people were expecting to play a little bit longer. Regarding tours, we went to Tulum, Chichen Itza and Xel-ha. We booked the trip to Tulum using \u201cLomas Travel\u201d their desk is in the Quetzal side. We only paid $76 dollars for the two of us but we got the basic tour. This tour was a half day tour but it was very good. We booked the other tours using the travel agency which is located between the Jewelry place and the Tequileria it the Tucan side. We selected that particular travel agency because they gave us a 10% discount. All other agencies were charging $99.00 per person for most of the tours. If you are planning in visiting Chichen Itza I will recommend you to use the \u201cDeluxe Tour\u201d their service was great and the fact that the bus has a very clean bathroom is a plus.

Upon arrival at the hotel we received a welcome pack which included details of the time and place we were to meet Gabriella to make the final arrangements. At the meeting we finalised all the details for the big day along with the blood tests!!!. We then met with the onsite photographer and discussed the package we wanted, the results were amazing. I originally wanted a package of 100 photos and in the end we bought the full 203 pictures excessive you may think but it was so hard to make a choice. We also had the ceremony filmed which was great. The spa on site is great although I would say it is pricey to have bridal hair along with the bridesmaids (cost nearly \u00a3190 for 4 of us). It really was perfect and was more than we could have ever wished for. I would recommend anybody to get married at the Iberostar Tucan. The wildlife around the grounds was jaw dropping how many other hotels have monkeys swining through the trees (although the alpha male was very noisey at 5am), peacocks wandering around the pool area, iguanas on the paths it was totally amazing!!!

My friend commented the entire time that she couldn't believe how nice it was considering all the negative reviews she read before we went (even if she does tend to mainly read the negative ones). We found the Tucan to be a great value - the positives much outweighing the negatives. My husband and I were partial to spending our days at the pool. Getting outside a little before 9:00am seemed to get us better seats at the pool vs. the beach everyday. The pool was very clean and refreshing. I liked how the deeper water meant that the children mainly congregated at the one shallow end. This way we could separate ourselves and not feel overwhelmed by families. Of course, the \"reserving seats is forbidden signs\" didn't stop anyone. On our last day there, we were at the pool by 7am to soak up some last minute sun and I couldn't believe how many reserved seats I saw. I don't blame the resort as much as a blame the guests. The same couples/families grabbed the 4-5 \"huts\" they had around the pool everyday! Ever heard of sharing? Worse yet, most wouldn't sit in them all day. They were just nice beds for their towels to rest. Don't worry, we never had a problem getting a seat but the prime locations were always taken. Our husbands enjoyed the activities the hotel offered although on some days it seemed as though nobody cared to organize them. Our first day there, the staff was always walking around trying to gather up participants but on the second and third day, we weren't asked once. The guys would hang around the game pool for the scheduled water polo game and nobody would show up. I'm not quite sure why it was so hit and miss! But, they did manage to play water basketball and beach volleyball once each. We were only staying 4 days which therefore entitled to 1 restaurant reservation. We actually ate at 3 of the 4 available restaurants just by stopping by guest services at 4:00pm and asking if anything was available. We weren't picky about the time or the place and typically found the earlier reservation to be most available. I thought the Japanese steak house was delicious and my whole group really enjoyed our steaks at the steak house. The Mexican restaurant wasn't really my taste but the rest of my group enjoyed themselves. We gave the restaurants a big thumbs up. Another couple told us they liked to go to the buffet after their restaurant meals because of the variety of desserts. The breakfast buffet was excellent and contained anything and everything you could think of. We found lunch to be the most random and lacking at points but we always found plenty to eat. Near the end of the trip we found out we could eat on the Quetzal side which was serving the same food to much fewer people. I wish I had discovered that sooner! Our one night at the dinner buffet was also pretty good although we were quite disappointed at the lack of actual Mexican food present. We ate and drank plenty on our trip! I really enjoyed the ambiance of the hotel. The lobby and restaurant areas were very beautiful and decorated for the holidays. The waterfall at the other side of the hotel was so neat! I loved the decor of the rooms and found them to be quite up-to-date. Newsflash, the beds are hard, but we slept well every night. I didn't feel like I was on a budget vacation. The shows were a bit cheesy but still enjoyable. We especially liked the Movie Night presentation. They obviously put a lot of time and money into the shows - great costumes, sets, and dancing.

I cannot speak for the Bride and Groom but do know they were disappointed with the service their friends received. The staff was very cold and did not seem to care about anyone other then themselves. Room keys did not work very often. It would take on the average 10 -12 times to get it to unlock the door. I went twice in during our stay and got new keys but none corrected the problem. I was told twice that they would have maintenance check but to my knowledge it never happened. Even if they did check, they did not fix anything. I had to call three times and finally received a remote for the TV 6 hours later. We had ants in our room however I never reported it, so that was my bad. The worst thing were the meals and restaurants. Sorry, I should not say restaurants, because I was never able to get a reservation to eat at one. In our vacation package, it firmly states that you are guaranteed at least one reservations for up to a four day stay and it increases with longer stays. For three days I was told that all restaurants were booked. I finally asked to talk to a manager and 30 minutes later I finally get to tell her my complaint and she gracefully started helping someone else, simply turning her back to me. I did not interrupt her helping the other customer because I was not going to be rude to the customers as the manager was to me. Finally, she turns to me and tells me that I could have a reservation at the Italian restaurant at 6:30 pm that night. It was 6:00 and I do not like Italian food. So basically \"tuff\" we are booked. They have no concern for the customers at all. The rudest staff I have ever seen. It was like \"HAHA we already have your money, so what are you going to do about it\". People, this was the worst resort I have ever stayed at. I have stayed at many resorts in Mexico and have always had exemplary service. I will never be guilty of spending money at the Iberostar Tucan again. Would not stay there if someone else paid for the trip. I realize there will be a lot of people read this and say that I am just vindictive and it was not nearly as bad as I am posting. Everyone has a right to believe that I am exaggerating and for them, I wish you would spend the money to find out the hard way. The service I received was so ridiculous!

So if you're looking for a straight forward review from a sane person, put this in that category. The hotel grounds are lush, tropical, and very pretty. What seems to most separate this from other hotels out there are the jungle-y paths that connect different parts of the resort - where you can spot everything from flamingos to tapirs to turtles and monkeys. The monkeys are a bit harder to spot than the rest, but they are around, and very cool to see when/if you can find them. So all in all, if you're an animal lover or with kids who are, this can be a very special experience, and reason to pick this hotel versus another. The dining area near the Quetzal side is particularly beautiful, with a great waterfall/wildlife area. Very tropical and scenic. The rooms are spacious and comfortable - with a nice, Mayan charm to them. (I can only speak to the Quetzal side as far as rooms are concerned. Note, though, that in almost every way, Tucan and Quetzal are the exact same resort, and it REALLY does not matter which you book. REALLY. You are booking the same resort, sharing all the same amenities.) Unless you're getting an ocean view room, you may want to ask for a balcony overlooking the jungle, but beware of the animal sounds you may hear. Personally, I think that's a plus. If you end up being close to the neighboring hotels, you may hear their nightclubs/entertainment instead. Personally I prefer the animal sounds.) The beds, as some have mentioned, are not the softest in the world, but I didn't mind them at all. Never had trouble sleeping during my week+ there. Food is, get this... quite good. So many people have mentioned that this resort's food as a main weaknesses. What are you people expecting? I found the food to be diverse, plentiful, and very tasty - as did everyone I was with. There was more than enough for all of us to eat way too much because we were enjoying the food so much. It may not be 5 star resort quality, but it was definitely way better than I expected after reading some of the reviews on here. You will not be disappointed. You will probably gain weight, in fact. (though the plentiful drinks won't help either.) The pool is very big and very nice. In the day, the staff runs games for the kids there, and possibly the adults too. I did my best to avoid this, because I preferred to find serenity over this noise. Be aware, the pool can certainly get noisy. The beach and pool both got very crowded - to the point where you may have trouble finding a chair if you come in the afternoon. Or to be more specific, you may have trouble finding a desirable chair. If you don't mind being in the middle of a billion people, you can probably find one. I walked down the beach and saw some of the neighboring hotels' beach areas were much less crowded - a good thing if you're looking for chairs/privacy, but perhaps spoke to the Tucan/Quetzal being better and thus more popular- who knows? The night entertainment was good compared to what I expected. I can be a little hokey as you would imagine, but they really do put noticeable effort into the shows, with beautiful costumes, musicians that are actually talented, and dancers that can actually dance. That is all for now. I'm sure there is much more, but this is getting a bit long.

We spent our time going to the gym in the early morning (weights are old, cardio equipment is ok, but good enough for a short vacation work out), hit the breakfast buffet (wonderful french toast and more egg and omelet choices than I could have imagined) and spent the rest of the day laying on the beach, swimming in the pool and playing sand volleyball. The drinks were not too great unless you specifically asked for the better liquor. The swim up bar had the best mojitos and margaritas. Bring an extra insulated mug to keep your drinks cold longer. If we go back here, we probably would stick to the buffet for dinner instead of the restaurants. The Japanese steak house wasn't bad, but not as good as the ones we have been to back home and the buffet has a great selection. We also tried the Italian which was just ok. I have to admit, though, this was the first international trip we went on that we didn't need to use any medicine to calm our stomachs! The setting of the resort is wonderful. We spent a lot of time just wandering around, checking the different types of animals and trees. The resort had some games and competitions planned throughout the day, but I didn't think the staff was too great at advertising it and getting people to join. I also liked how the other resorts we had been to would give away free tshirts or bottles of tequila for the winners. I also didn't think the nightly entertainment was very good. We ended up going back to the room early almost every night to watch whatever movie was on tv in English. We met a few other travelers who said they have stayed at this resort multiple times. One couple had been there 6 times. They said this beach was the best and the staff was the friendliest. One afternoon we walked along the beach to Playa Del Carmen and I agree that our beach looked the nicest. There was plenty of umbrellas and space to spread out. I guess we went during the slow tourist season, but we didn't have to scramble to claim our spot on the beach. We were usually out by 8:30, but all throughout the day it seemed like there was plenty of space.", "Date": "December 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel stay and value\u201d", "Author": "Snugdad", "ReviewID": "UR51601087", "Content": "We stayed a week at the Tucan and were very happy. There were some things we liked more than others but nothing during the week was bad. On the other hand nothing was what we'd consider exceptional either. For the price this was a really great deal however. The checkin process was not great. We arrived at 2:45 (check-in is not until 3pm) and we weren't settled in a room until 5:30. We were first told the rooms wouldn't be ready until around 4 and we could take a walk or have a drink. That was no problem so we did some walking and had a cocktail. At around 4 we checked back, and the rooms were ready so we headed up. What we found was, my wife and I were placed in a room with 2 double beds. This was not what we wanted so we headed back down and had to wait until 5:30 before a king room was available. Not a big deal but the process seemed a little inefficient. Overall the rooms seem like their about ready for renovation. There was a lot of wear and tear showing in general but by and large it was not a problem. The air conditioning was a bit weak (and could only be set to 20C minimum) and we had to run the ceiling fan on high all night. Again no major problem. Cleaning by houskeeping was very good. The food we found very good in all restaurants. The buffett was perhaps a little less varied than others we've been to but the quality was very good. We visited the Japanese, Mexican and Steak house specialty restaurants and were impressed by all of them. Very good food in all. We found the bars to be limited at the resort. The only real choice in the evening is the lobby bar. There is a bar at the show center and of course one at the disco but they are only open during the shows/disco and don't lend themselves to just relaxing and chatting. Not a big deal, but another choice would have been nice. The bar selection was OK but not extensive. If you like DosXX's beer you'll be ok (I don't think they have any other). The liquor selection was about average and not a problem. The waitresses are pretty typical of all inclusives, don't be in a hurry if you want something. The beach was quite nice and we weren't put off by the \"sand whales\" placed for errosion control. In fact they were quite entertaining to \"play\" around so it wasn't an issue. We hardly went to the pool so I can't comment. It was however a very pleasant looking layout. We did go to the dedicated pool bar one day. We had a good time but its location wasn't great (sunken into the shade) and somone \"borrowed\" my towel which was placed in the storage bins at the top of the steps. We attended several of the shows during the week but the talent and the facility were average at best. The room had poorly placed columns that made viewing a problem from many locations. The shows themselves were average. Perhaps the oddest thing about this hotel is the layout (Tucan on one side and Quetzal on the other). This meant there was a lobby bar on both sides, a buffet on both sides (although the hours are split making some times convenient and others not). Also the disco is on the Quetzal side. All facilities are available to both resorts, it just seem inefficient and at times inconvenient. I would recommend this as a great value for a budget priced vacation. We have stayed in better places but at this price it's hard to argue against the value received.", "Date": "December 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel, Great for people with Food Allergies\u201d", "Author": "michielou25", "ReviewID": "UR51570512", "Content": "The Tucan is a lovely hotel.

I will try my best to review this hotel in some kind of order but it is hard when a million and one fantastic memories come to mind at once. We went there for two weeks Nov 2-16 2009. I travelled with my partner and 3 year old daughter. It was love at first sight. We stayed on the Tucan side of the hotel. I have to say the Tucan Lobby was really nice and the atmospher was brilliant. The quitzil side was also very nice as it has a waterfall and swans swimming aroung below the walk way. This hotle has it all ,there is a wonderful walk you can take to the beach which feels abit like walking through the jungle. There are monkeys, racoon looking animals, pecocks, lizards, turtles ect. The gardens are beautiful. The beach is like nothing you have ever seen before!! It is cleaned every night and cleared of every single dect chair ect so in the morning it is just as nice as before. They do have sand bags at this resort that protect the beach from disapearing. If you have looked at he pictures you ill see these. I did not see the sand bags as a problem at all, some people may find them ugly but you forget they are there when your stood on that amazing beach with your feet in that gorgeous warm water. The service at this hotle is fab, you are never left with a empty drink. The entertainment team are amazing, they treat you like they have known you all your lives lol and they were great with my little girl. Although she is very shy they got her up on stage to dance with the other kids. The shows are pretty good too at this resort although the adult shows dont start till 9:45 so if you have kids then you may find this a little late but i would deffinatley reccomend you go to a few shows throughout your stay. The food here is catered for mainly Americans, although they do have excellent japanesse, italian, mexican and stake house resteraunts. Although i found some of the food served a little strange for my tast ( sushi ect) i tried every thing they put in front of me and enjoyed the experience. The service in these resteraunts were fantastic. BAR NONE!! THE ONLY THING THAT BUGGED ME about our holiday was that some people acted like kids were not wanted at this hotel and they should not be there. NEWS FLASH!! This is a FAMILY RESORT!!! IF YOU do not want to be around children you should go to an all inclusive ADULTS ONLY RESORT! EXCURSIONS: XEL HA - FANTASTIC good for all ages Catamerange ( sorry for the spelling) Fab- These guys will show you the best time ever. Tulum-Coba- Not for children really, fantastic beach at tulum though, alot of walking involved unless you hire a man to push bike you around. Me and my 3 year old did and it was the best bit. They are fab with children at this resort, they will always stop what they are doing to say hola to you and ask about where your from ect. The staff here are worth there wait in gold. OH FOOD- I will eat just about any thing in England but i found it hard to pick some thing to eat some times. Dont get me wrong the Americans couldnt get enough of the stuff so it must be good. I got a bit of a funny stomache whilst at his hotel but then i did last year in the dominican. I think the breakfast buffet was pretty good i even started eating american waffels ect. I cannot think of any thing else at the moment except i loved this place and i feel so sad when i think about it. I hope some day to go back. If you have any questions i would be happy to help.

He made it very easy to organize a large group for multiple excursions and all of our guests were so impressed by how well organized the entire vacation was. The resort has something for everyone.

We had excellent meals in the Italian & Mexican restaurants both times we visited. Steakhouse was ok, bit rushed, starter, main course and dessert in 35 mins. Didn\u2019t bother with the Japanese. The burgers from the grill at lunchtime were a bit addictive. There was a very high level of cleanliness in all the restaurants. Staff members wearing hair nets, gloves using tongs etc. . If anyone gets ill while they are there, I\u2019m sure it would be down to the hygiene of other guests and their children who couldn\u2019t resist picking at the buffet food with their fingers before putting it on their plates ! No consideration for other diners. All the staff are helpful and genuinely friendly. Always smiling. Never a problem getting sunbeds at the pool or the beach. Huge sand bags on the beach are doing their job as the beach is wider, lots more sand than the last time we visited. The jungle is fascinating as ever with some new animals (white face coati). They are a bit tame though as guests feed them bread despite the signs that tell you not to! Feeding gulls bread on the beach should also be discouraged. We were in block 19 near reception. Nice and quiet. The room and common areas of the hotel were spotlessly clean. Different towel art every day and not even a fallen leaf on a path despite the high winds. Always someone sweeping ! Only one very small complaint and that is the guitarist and keyboard players that entertain in the lobby bar. (same as 2 yrs ago.)

Same goes for massages! They want $100 for an hour deep tissue massage and they're not licensed! At Veronica's on 5th avenue next to Karma Bagels my wife got a professional one hour massage and a 45 minute facial, both for $55.00. Also, La Delicioso in town had lobster tacos, 3 for $12 and they were great! Mexicans in Playa ( and all over the area) were polite and helpful. Roads are clean and there was little graffiti.

It wasn't just a hotel - it was an experience. My kids had a blast not to mention how much fun and enjoyment my husband and I got out of it too. I love to read the reviews - infact that's exactly how I chose this resort in the first place. It probably had the least amount of negative reviews. And boy was I glad that I based my decision on that. Was it truly a 5 star - no definitely not, but 4 star, for sure. We've stayed in luxury hotels across the world and some not so luxury, this was absolutely perfect. With younger kids (7 and 9), we didn't want the stuffiness of a true 5 star hotel where kids are frowned upon and people are obnoxious and feel the need to throw their weight around - we just wanted a relaxing wonderful holiday - and did we ever find this here. Many people that we had spoken to had been here 2 or three times already - and some had stayed at other resorts along the Mayan Riviera , but found this one to be the best. Staff were extremely attentive and couldn't help us quickly enough. If we did have a problem - it was seen to immediately. We first stayed in the Tucan side - which we loved, but we were in the middle of the forest and I yearned to see the ocean - so halfway through the holiday we moved to the Quetzal side to an oceanfront view. It was beautiful. The rooms are very standard - but incredibly clean and if you're not a fussy individual - they are perfect - nothing more was needed. We prefered the oceanfront units on the Quetzal side as there is just one row of palapas in front - whereas there are palm trees and 2 rows of palapas on the Tucan side - so unless you're on the 3rd floor - you're view is completely obscured. Both sides of the hotel are lovely and you can see different animals on either side. One thing though - there are a lot of birds on the Quetzal side closer to the reception area - I'm sure this could be noisy first thing in the morning .... so if you're a late riser - this could be a bit of a problem for you. The food was generally very good. The buffet is just that - how much can you change a buffet - but the Steakhouse and Japanese was out of this world - I enjoyed the Italian too. The Mexican was sadly a bit of a disappointment though. The beach was beautiful - in one of the previous reviews it was mentioned that the beach was never cleaned - this is definitely not the case - the beach was always pristine. I would go so far as to say that we probably had the best beach of the 6 or 7 hotels closest to ours. You need NEVER worry about cleanliness - this seemed to be one of their top priorities ! THe sandbags were huge and yes a bit of an eyesore - but oh my gosh - the hours and hours of fun that they provided for kids and adults alike - endless. My children spent hours playing in the ocean with their floaties trying to be washed onto or off these sandbags. It also provided some protection from the waves - so it was very pleasant for families with younger children too. This resort is definitely not only for families - infact whilst we were there there were very few children as it isn't school holidays. It was mainly couples and their friends. And let me tell you - no matter who you spoke to - everyone was having a good time. My children chose not to join in with the Iberostar friends - we were just too happy that they enjoyed being with us - but the kids that did join the club all seemed to enjoy it very much. The nightly entertainment was good fun - the Oscar evening was the best. We didn't go to all the shows as they only started around 10pm and my kids, and myself actually were bushed by that time. It did amaze me just how hard these people work. They work 6 day weeks, many for shifts longer than 10 hours (iberostar friends were on the beach during the day and did the late night shows too) - yet they always had a gracious smile and seemed genuinely so happy. It was quite refreshing to witness. The waiters only earn $600 a month - so please do tip - the service will always be outstanding, but I\"m sure they are grateful for every extra little dollar they earn. We also took a bunch of crayola sets ($1 from the dollar store) and all the left over candy from Halloween. We gave some to our chambermaids - and took the rest into Playa del Carmen. Wow was this an eye opener - there are young kids everywhere - some whose families are just too poor to send them to school. Well they flocked around us in no time - and within seconds my sets were gone. How I wished I had taken more with me. Next time I take an entire carry on bag full - to see the pleasure and gratitude on these kids faces - will remain with me forever - I also wanted my children to see just how lucky and privileged they are - and to see that small things like this make such a difference to some. We live in a throwaway society - when some people are grateful for the most insignificant little thing. We did two tours in our 10 days - one was to Xcaret. It was absolutely out of this world. Breathtaking beautiful - we were blown away. The way they designed the park is mind blowing. You feel as though you are in the jungle and it's quite easy to lose direction. What I loved most was the simpleness of the park - no high barriers or awful signage warning stuipid people not to jump into the water with the crocodiles ! just the simple expectation that people take responsibility for their own actions ..... I LOVED that. A nation not filled with lawsuits made by people who blame everything on everyone else. Very special. The way it should be. The park is HUGE - be prepared for a lot of walking, but enjoyable walking - if you have younger kids - definitely take a stroller along. We didn't do the river swim - too much else to do and this would have taken up too much time. The water at this time of the year was also a little cold for my childrens liking. The nightshow was spectacular - my very tired kids perked up immediately and were mesmerised by it all. The other park we did was Xplore. Infact that was one of the bonuses about staying at the Iberostar Tucan/Quetzal - both Xcaret and Xplore are literally 5 minutes away. This is a huge bonus. We loved Xplore. Although my son is just 7, as a family we all ziplined (3km of line), paddled through the most exquisite caves and drove little jeeps through the jungle. My kids got a huge kick from this and loved every minute of it. It is an all inclusive and the buffet food was excellent. What a great day ! What more can I say, we truly had a dream holiday - one that will be hard to top. Next time we will go back with friends - we've just got to share this with more people. Hope that if you choose this wonderful hotel - you will have just as good an experience as we did.", "Date": "November 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mississauga", "Title": "\u201cDeblyn\u201d", "Author": "deblyn0", "ReviewID": "UR49857566", "Content": "We have just returned from a week at the Iberostar Tucan.

We picked the Iberostar Tucan for a variety of reasons. Flying into Cancun is so much easier and cheaper than most of the Caribbean islands. The Tucan offered so many amenities for our varied group at a most reasonable price. In this economy, budget must be considered when asking so many people to make this trip. Our whole experience at the Tucan was above and beyond our expectations. We had 55 family and friends from all over the country fly down for the wedding. As you can imagine, the tastes of such a large and varied group of people could be very hard to meet. The Iberostar staff from the front desk to all the service people were amazing.. First and foremost was Gabriela, the wedding coordinator, who made all our dreams and wishes her top priority. Unlike other resorts, the Iberostar plans only one wedding at a time, so it really is your special time. The venue for the wedding was spectacular, beachfront and private. The staff was very courteous and made sure the area was special for us. Our beachfront cocktail hour and reception dinner were elegant and perfect. The food from the Steakhouse restaurant was delicious and beautifully served. Thanks to Gabriela the set-up and decorations for the reception were gorgeous. After the reception, many of us went to the resort disco, to continue our party.. Amazing time was had by all!!! The grounds are beautiful. There is a central jungle trail from the lobby to the beach that is wild and beautiful. To see all the monkeys, birds, turtles and some kind of strange marsupial is like walking thru a zoo. There also is a flat, smooth, well-lighted path for those that don't want the jungle adventure (or are in a hurry!). We never were. The service staff was friendly and very prompt with any requests we had. We messed up our safe, and within 5 minutes someone was there to fix it. I've never seen another hotel that actually had a door hanger that you could check for any needed repairs or problems. That, to me, is keeping ahead of problems!! The buffets were more than adequete.. So much variety it took us days to find our favorites. The wait staff was always very attentive with refills of coffee, juice, wine, and anything else that was needed. Unlike some other resorts we've been to with open-air dining, here, with netting, they made sure no birds were flying around among the tables.. That has alway been a gross-out for me. We ate in the air-conditioned Mexican restaurant.. It was just ok, didn't think it was any better than our mexican restaurant back home. We also ate twice at the air-conditioned Japanese restaurant and all were very impressed with the food. It was delicious. The sushi apps and grilled shrimp especially were tasty. The first time our chef was very talented and put on quite a show, the second time however, even tho the food was as good, we were disappointed there was no performance.. Oh, well, we still filled our bellies!! The drinks we had all week were excellent. Top-shelf liquor was always available, just ask, and double shots for those who need it!! We did splurge on an ocean-front jr suite.. It was so worth the money. After all, we were losing a daughter.. I had heard horror stories about the hard beds, so I was very nervous.. They are hard, but after a bit of soreness the first morning, I slept like a baby all week.. Its probably better for your back than those soft lumpy beds!! Our room was always cleaned thoroughly, with towel animals, fresh fruit, and daily replacing of soaps, lotions, water and beer.. And never so much as spotted one bug or received one bug bite all week. Being a beach person, I didn't spend much time in the pool. It was cooler than the ocean, but still very swimable. Lots of shady spots, if you've had too much sun. Again, saw no bugs in or around the area... The swim-up bar didn't much appeal, although some in our party enjoyed. Some days, it seemed the crowd there was extra loud and irritating. The beach had lots of people, but always found a lounge chair. The water was so blue and the beach was always free of seaweed. They must rake it everyday, although I never saw that. We got there as Ida was going thru, so a couple days there were a few pieces of seaweed floating in, but after all, it was a hurricane! One of the things I tried to do was answer some of the strange complaints I read here. We found few problems and all were easily fixed. We found the curbside luggage check-in was not always manned, which made for an unnecessary delay at check-in. With our large group coming in all week, there were a few room problems, but all again easily fixed and everyone was happy. For whatever reason, none of your purchases from the shops could be charged to your room. Since I never seemed to have any money on me, they did miss out on a lot of sales. We do wish there was a beach bar open in the evening. Could have easily spent many hours there. The only bar easily accesible in the evening was the lobby bar, and that did get fairly crowded when a few large groups wanted to get together. Altogether, we had a wonderful experience at the Iberostar Tucan.. They made one of our life highlights so very special and memorable. We are already planning a reunion to renew old friendships and again see a beautiful and special part of Mexico.", "Date": "November 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Riverside, NJ", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Resort, Great Time\u201d", "Author": "JerseyCasey11", "ReviewID": "UR49440090", "Content": "Arrived on Saturday the 7th and left Sunday the 15th. This trip was well worth the price we paid. No problems transfering to or from the airport. Keep in mind though that this is an hour trip away from Cancun Airport. The grounds were immaculate. The lobby, rooms, resturaunts, the jungle setting, the pool area and the beach. Everything was really beautiful. There were plenty of chairs in both the pool area and the beach. Many in the sun and the shade under the Palapa trees. The only issue I had were the cabana's in the pool area being reserved with towels and bags for hours without people being in them. The food was not terrible, nor was it spectactular. The breakfast buffet was probably the best of all with omelettes, eggs, french toast, pancakes, waffels, and a variety of fresh cut fruit and juices every morning. The Steakhouse and Italian resturaunt which we ate at were just ok as well. The buffets for lunch really hit the spot, offering french fries, nachos, pizza, burgers, hot dogs, pasta, chicken, pork, fruit, and ice cream. The dinner buffets seem to run together a lot. Offering much of the same thing as the lunch buffets. We were a little dissapointed with the Medditaranian Resturaunt being unavailable due to construction. The Drinks were plentiful. I do suggest to bring a insulated mug, bottle, or Bubba Keg as we brought because the cups that the bar serves drinks in go down really quick. Some prefer strong drinks, if so ask to top it off. Samuel, Diego and Henry will really take care of you. Keep in mind this is an all inclusive resort, and the need to tip is not necessary. However, my fiance and I felt the need to tip because of how hard the employee's work and how friendly they are. Believe me, the employee's will not treat you any different whether you tip or not, but if you do, it does not go unnoticed and is greatly greatly appreciated by them. The entertainment \"IberoFriends\" were spectacular. Courteous and friendly. They always asked if you wanted to participate in Beach Volleyball, Soccer, Pool Basketball, Horseshoes, if you want to participate, feel free, if not, a simple no thanks will do and off they go to find someone else to recruit. They are always looking to communicate with you, wondering if you are enjoying yourself, and are always asking you for ways to improve the entertainment. The nightly shows that we did attend were great. Tuesday I believe were \"Oscar\" night, and Saturday was Ancient Mexico which was about the Aztec and Mayan decent. They work very very hard and it really shows. Luigi, Mauricio and Jose really work hard and try their best to make your vacation as enjoyable as possible. I really cannot say enough about everyone at the resort. We met people from Reading Pa, Albany NY, Ohio, Washington and a few couples from Canada. Everyone was really friendly and willing to share their own stories.

The beds are very comfortable, sheets changed everyday, and everything thoroughly cleaned. The bathroom was maybe a little tired looking but well-kept and with a very powerful large walk-in shower. We loved the walk up through the gardens to the restaurants etc - so much flora and fauna to observe. Do bring Jungle Formula - you WILL get bitten! The all-inclusive is excellent: long meal times and plenty of facilities ensure that you can always get what you want no matter what hours you keep (a limited room service is included too) without queueing, even all-day ice-creams at the beach which is a nice touch. The staff are attentive and jolly; nothing is too much trouble, and whenever you sit down anywhere someone will offer to bring you a drink (even on the beach). The main complaints in the reviews we read before we went seem to centre on the food, but I don't think are justified. Yes, there are similar dishes each day in the buffets, but it's a bit hard not to be a little repetitive when you're offering an enormous variety of things at every meal. I thought it was great fun and tried lots of things I hadn't had before (eg cactus juice at breakfast, out of the many juices on offer). If you can't find something interesting and delicious every time out of such a display, you are surely too difficult to please and need to broaden your horizons . Also you can book three a la carte restaurant meals at the small restaurants, which are lovely for a change: we chose Italian, the Steak House and the Mexican (there are also Japanese and Tropical). Maybe the food wasn't gourmet restaurant quality but it was good and we were made to feel quite special. We found the pool rather cold (the weather had been stormy) but the sea was lovely: a good beach where you can walk for miles, though it shelves into the sea (which is OK but having had my hips replaced recently, I found a bit tricky!). This is also a good base for trips to various water parks, eco parks and archaeological sites: we went to Tulum and Coba, and also took a ferry over to Cozumel. It's possible to walk into Playa del Carmen for shops (about 40 mins) but taxis are cheap.

The service from the friendly staff was outstanding. The location, facilities and grounds were fabulous. Rooms were ok. Food was very good. Atmosphere was very casual and relaxing. Playacar (the gated resort community containing the Tucan) was beautiful and safe. The \"Iberostar jungle\" contains lots of wildlife, including a couple families of monkeys. The beaches/sand in and around Playa del Carmen are some of the best in the Caribbean - the Iberostar has lots of chairs and palapa shades, and convenient beach bar and lunch buffet. The pool was incredible - huge and shapely - again, surrounded by plenty of lounge chairs and palapas. The separate swim up pool bar was lots of fun - we'll leave it at that! Stayed in the standard room which \"ok\". Pretty much a normal hotel room. Wife thought the bed was a little too hard, and that the shower drained to slowly. Patio was nice - drank coffee and listened to the monkeys and birds call each morning. The food was very good. The buffets - first of all, ate way too much - but they were very good - breakfasts, lunches, and dinners. Offered plenty of choices, and enough variety from day to day to keep them from being too repetitive. OBVIOUSLY, the buffet is not like 5 star dining - so have fair expectations and you wont be disappointed. The specialty restaurants: Japanese - every one loved - we ate there twice - loved the chicken & shrimp! Mexican - good appetizer/sides, but the Tacos Especiale were too greasy (authentic?) Steakhouse - we did not get to try, but the rest of our group said the steaks were terrific. Italian - skipped - another guest (\"Boston Paul\") we met told us it wasn't good. We enjoy the 5th Avenue area of Playa del Carmen very much also. $5 cab ride to town takes about 10 minutes. 5th Avenue has plenty of restaurants, bars and opportunities to negotiate for the \"best price in town\".

I am so glad we did. It didn't disappoint. We saw some guests who we had seen the previous year, who had also decided to come back and enjoy themselves at this hotel. Once again we were enchanted by the beautiful setting of this hotel and the unbelievably wonderful staff. If you are looking for \"bling glamour\" this is probably not the place for you, but if you appreciate being in a beautiful jungly setting, in a hotel which nestles perfectly within it, then you are in for a treat. The lobby areas are large and elegant and the rooms clean and comfortable. The walk through the jungle to the massive, beautiful pool, was a treat every time. Peacocks, monkeys, capybaras, chickens, iguanas and a host of other wildlife was just waiting to be admired in the lovely jungle setting. The pool area is fantastic. It's huge, clean and comfortable and you don't even have to leave your sunlounger to be supplied with yummy cocktails from the friendly bars. There are poolside massage tables, and the staff are very good. I had what was probably the best back massage ever there. The buffet restaurants are great, with plenty of seating and a variety of quality food that would keep anyone going for weeks without having the same meal twice. The A La Carte restaurants which you book separately (but are part of the all inclusive deal, so cost nothing extra) were great : Mexican, Japanese, Italian, Steakhouse (and a Caribbean one due to open soon) all serve excellent food. The staff were, once again, brilliant. Throughout the day they work tirelessly to provide pool games/dancing lessons/Spanish lessons/various sports and beach entertainment for those who want it as well as just being great fun to be around. At night they really come into their own, taking part in the shows held nightly in the huge theatre area. The shows are highly professional and we enjoyed every single one. The maids, bar staff, gardeners, restaurant staff, reception staff and, pool staff were all delightful and can not do enough for you. I contacted reception about a couple of minor things about our room and they were rectified within minutes - the housekeepting and maintenance service was faultless. Kids Club runs from 10.15am - 4pm and from 8pm - 11pm, so your little ones have plenty to amuse themselves if they want a break from their parents (or you need a break from them!) They do plenty of arts and crafts, watch movies, play pool games, play sport, go on animal spotting treks through the hotel grounds, rehearse and put on shows in the main theatre - the list goes on and on, and every kid there seemed to be having the time of their life. The beach has soft, clean white sand and the sea is as warm as a bath. Perfect. There is a fantastic scuba centre at the hotel for those wishing to learn, or for those who are already qualified and there is a chance to try scuba free in the pool every day if you just want a taster. Of course, Mexico is world famous for its wonderful dive sites and you won't be disappointed by them. My husband was lucky enough to dive with bull sharks and was buzzing about his dives for ages. There are plenty of turtles around, which, in my mind, are essential for a perfect dive! My young daughter and I went on a wonderful horse ride through the jungle and onto the beach, which was a real treat - and only about 20 mins from the hotel, as well as one of the many \"swim with dolphins\" packages available, which was a great experience and worth the money. There are various tour companies to be found within the hotel, and you really can do just about anything there you fancy. I really can't praise this hotel enough.

This was exactly as expected. I am not ultra picky , but I am not easily pleased either !! Its wonderful, we had a really good time. In fact I was left wondering if the people who have written very negative reviews on this site had been to the same place ??? I did email the Hotel about a week before we arrived asking for a sea view (I always ask !! Perhaps one day I will get lucky!!) However the sea view rooms are practically ON the beach and so they do cost extra $50 per night for a Junior Suite and $200 a night for a Presidential Suite. I think this is too much, and since we are out of our room very early, it is not worth the extra cost. If you email and ask for a Tree view you can be sure you will get that !!! The Jungle bit is great and not at all like the normally ultra neat and tidy mannicured gardens of this chain. We had Monkeys in the trees near our room, which was great. The rooms are showing their age a little, but are clean and the walk in shower was really good. The electrical plugs are American flat pin and not round pin caribbean. We found that out when our Mosquito plug ins would not fit !! Which did have me a little worried as I am usually irrestible to them ! However I only had about 10 bites for the 2 weeks we were there and I dont think I got any in the room. The food is really good, although when you eat in the Buffet you get really wierd combinations on your plate and not a whole meal. We ate in all the speciality restaurants. The Italian - Good, The Steakhouse - Good, The Japanese - Good and the Mexicax - Good. The staff are all really friendly and although they dont expect a tip, they really appreciate it when you do. The Ice Cream on the Beach is really really good I am sorry to have to say, so those of you with no willpower keep away. There are 4 flavours a day and sometimes they dont come round ofter enough. The beach buffet is nice and opens at a really good time of 7am, we used to get a mug of Tea and take it on to the Beach with a few pastries or Biscuits (sometimes both!!) Lunch was the usual sort of fare, and I really enjoyed the Fish that was there every day and salads were perfectly ok to eat, and then that left room for an after lunch ice cream !! From 3 - 5pm they also did Coffee and Cakes which were really nice, but I only had that once. I really wish people would cover up when they go in for lunch. The pool is huge and most of the Entertainment is centered around it. There were always plenty of chairs around it and on the beach, but I expect that in the busy months that may not always be so. There is waitress service on the beach, which encouraged us to be even more lazy !! The Beach is lovely, and while I would rather the sand whales were not there, they have to be, but whatever you do DO NOT try and walk on them. They are lethal and because of the alge very very slippery. We saw many people slip and even the ones that dont stick out too much are just as bad (my husband can vouch for that!!)The sand is quite white, but a little bit course. The sea varied from very rough and weedy to quite calm and really clear. When there is weed they rake it up in the mornings. The lobby bar is a little small (sometimes) and when there are several large groups in at the same time chairs tend to be take up. If ours was full , we would wander next door to the Quetzel. The Alcohol is hmmmm ! The wine at dinner I did not like, the Champage (sparkling wine/Cava) varied. The Margarita's were really nice, but I dont think there was much alcohol in them. We only went to watch the Entertainment once, Its exhausting all that doing nothing so we were back in our rooms after dinner.

Check-in was easy, although, as usual, I was not given the building that I requested, even this being my 4th trip, and it was our 41st anniversary. I don't like that policy. They did, however, leave a bottle of wine and a fruit basket in our room, and offered us a romantic dinner on the beach. The offer was appreciated, but we did not take them up on it. As mentioned in other reviews, there does not appear to have been any updating done to the resort, and I agree with that statement. I first started going there in 2004 and nothing has changed, not even the bedspreads. Tucan, it is time to upgrade. I also had my toilet clog, and when I reported it to the front desk, they asked me if I put toilet paper in the commode, and I told them that of course I did. I was told in not uncertain terms, that we were not supposed to put toilet paper in them. A word to the wise, put your T.P. in the waste can. I talked to a couple of others that had also clogged their toilets. After 3 hours I checked, and they had not unclogged the toilet, so I had to back to the front desk, where upon it was taken care of. The food doesn't seem to be quite as good as I remember from previous trips, and there was very little in the way of decorations in the dining areas, ie., no carved watermelons, that type of thing. May have been due to the low occupancy. The Quetzel buffet was not even open. You can always find something to fill you up however. The Japanese restaurant is probably the best of the specialty restaurants. The grounds and the animals roaming about the jungle are still a treat, and the monkeys were in rare form and woke us up at 5:30 each morning which made for a pretty unique alarm clock. The shows were enjoyable, but they start too late for us old folks. Too much time between dinner and the shows. Beach is still extraordinary, even with the unsightly sandbags. The color of the water is unparalleled from anyhwere else. Beautiful turquoise fading into a deep blue. Of all the resorts, the Tucan still has the best beach, and all of the other resorts also have the sandbags, and some of them have basically no beach area at all. At the Tucan, everything you need is within 20 yards of the beach. A bar, 2 restaurants, the pool, rest rooms, ice cream stand, burger stand. You can come to the beach in the morning and stay all day and have everything you need. If you go, do yourself a favor and walk to other resorts up the beach, and you will be happy that you chose the Tucan. For those who have previously complained about the open eating areas, and competing with the birds for food, you will be happy to know that has been taken care of. They have installed a netting around all of the open food areas to keep the birds out. It is some type of white nylon netting, and it is almost invisible, so it doesn't detract from the appearance of the restaurants at all. All in all another relaxing vacation. I will have to say that until they start upgrading I will check out other resorts for future trips, but I'm sure I'll find myself back at the Tucan at some point. Unless you are a real snob, you will have a nice vacation. I talked to people there that can (and have) traveled to wherever they want to go, and they had been to the Tucan 10 times. The employees always have smiles on their face and could not be more helpful, tips or not. Tip them anyway, they deserve it. If you are wavering on whether or not you should choose the Tucan...do it! Don't let some of these wacky reviews scare you away.

We're from Ohio so it was the summer we never had crammed into one week. I'll get quickly to what I didn't like about the Tucan, it was too far from the Airport in Cancun. That's my complaint in total! Oops, the price of the Internet was high and prices in the shops at the Iberostars are over the top. OK that's all my complaints. When we travel we go for relaxation, warm weather, nice surroundings, good food and nice people. We found it all. One complaint that some might find, a couple of the restaurants are not air conditioned and neither is the lobby. Big deal, it's Mexico and it's very warm or hot! That's specifically what I was looking for. The fact is, the week we were there it was 94 degrees and mid-level humidity. I burned my Polish-German-English-Welsh skin like a processed beet! YES! It was great, The Gulf of Mexico, one of my favorite bodies in the world from any coast that joins it was absolutely magnificent, breathtaking as my wife put it. It was her first time seeing the Gulf from Mexico. She loved to just sit anywhere and gaze at it. The sand is nearly snow white. The HUGE!!! Swimming pool was like bathwater and the chemical levels were low enough that you didn't smell, taste or burn your eyes. It was perfect. I think they are using a new filtering system that actually uses salt in the filtering process. No chlorine smell to speak of at all. The food was very good. No not 5-Star, but certainly as good as or better than most typical restaurants in the U.S. Where they excelled is the service. Even in the buffet restaurant was very, very good. Plus, to enhance our service I took along a bunch of 1 dollar bills - King for a week. The service everywhere was impeccable. My sister-in-law and her better half were there at the same time (we were attending her daughter's wedding) and it just happened to be her birthday. We were at one of the restaurants that \"require\" reservations and for a couple of bucks to the head waiter and she was treated like royalty along with Mariachi band that made her the center of attention for a while as well as the wait staff. They sang \"Happy Birthday\" to her and her smiles were from ear to ear. The people that were taking care of us did a very fine job and were very friendly. The cleaning people cleaned our room nicely and efficiently everyday. I don't drink alcohol anymore and a call to the front desk made the changes to the fridge in the room. I had all of the Diet or Regular Coke I wanted along with orange soda and others. Water was stocked really well. Now to make sure I got what I wanted or needed I would place a couple of one-dollar bills with a note saying what I wanted. I also left a couple of dollars on the bed each day. If you want Beer just call guest services and ask them to put beer in. If you leave a couple of bucks you\u2019ll find your beer restocked everyday in your room. I drink hot tea everyday. That's my English heritage. Many people in the US don't know much about serving tea let alone in Mexico. I drink mine \"English Style\" adding milk after brewing. I still don't speak Spanish, my own loss, and getting someone to understand hot tea and milk together in 94 degree weather is even another story. After getting my point across and adding, yes a couple of dollar bills, I had tea everyday and every meal and I didn't even have to ask. We were recognized and in just a short time tea-for-two was delivered to our table. All together we took $100.00 worth of one-dollar bills and used them all for tips and were king and queen for the week. Yes, tips are included in All-Inclusive, but the little extra made a world of difference. The entertainment was great, not Broadway or Off-Broadway, but very entertaining. The recreation staff during the day is also the entertainment company at night. We saw the kids that were there being kept occupied by staff with specific entertainment and play areas. We weren't bothered children at all and hardly knew they were there. They even has tours through the \"jungle\" paths that with through the middle of the Iberostar sister resorts. There were native animals all through the wooded areas with stone and concrete paths all the way through. There is also a Biologist that looks after and keeps an eye on the 24 Howler Monkeys they have on the resort property. Are you handicapped? Not to worry, I either have to get around with my cane or my own portable wheelchair. The resort was very accommodating to my needs. This trip was with Apple Vacation and again they took good care of us from time of arrival until we left. The next question is: Would you recommend this place to a friend, without hesitation. And, if you find something you don't like while there, the staff will fix the problem or situation as quickly as they can. Remember you\u2019re on Mexico time down there - but they get it done. While I wouldn't say this is God's country, I'd say this is where he goes for vacation. For tourist stuff to bring back to the US especially Vanilla! Go to Wal-mart, $5.00 cab ride there. The prices are much better. If you go to Fifth Avenue shopping are for tourists - the farther down you go the cheaper the prices get. You learn to say no a lot. But, when you find something you like dicker for the best price. And, if you need an American Fast Food Fix, you'll find it on Fifth Ave. McDonalds, Subway and Domino's Pizza are just a few. All the drinks are free and as you will find out a bit weak. Check with your bartender on what it would take to make sure your drinks are a bit more potent. A couple of buck should do it. That is a lot to do at the Iberostar Tucan and sister resort even if you do not venture away from the resort. There are lots of things to explore and many activities just for your enjoyment and entertainment.

I would give this hotel a 'good' rating not an ' excellent' as in the past. Security - some sort of incident occured in Sandos next door whilst we were there resulting in the gun toting police chasing a beach trader across the front of the Iberostar complex, which identified to me a lack of visible security on the beach on the Iberostar stretch, the Sandos guard was quite high profile. Safety - vehicles on site ( gardners pick up trucks in particular) seemed to travel a little too fast around the site considering the number of guests ( and children) walking in the vicinity. Staff - always friendly, willing and ready to please Beach - damned great sand bags have been placed in front of the beach to protect it from sea erosion and provide some sheltered bathing- not the most pretty of sights Entertainment - The ' Star Friends' put there heart and soul into the nightly entertainments and are very talented, There is a Disco on site but wasn't to my taste, I saw 3 people on the dance floor and about 15 at the bar at about midnight. Heavy night club dance music, ( Ibiza sounds stuff I would say), I think it would be more popular if ' cheesy' lighter ( Abba?? etc) music were to be played . Clients - lots of americans holiday here, sometimes in quite large groups as this resort is a quick getaway for them. Summary - I personally would not class this hotel as somewhere special as it used to be, but would class it as a good hotel catering more for the mass market.

We had read many reviews prior to choosing this hotel and wasn't disappointed. The hotel is lovely and the quality of the food and drinks were great. Rooms could do with updating slightly but kept very very clean on a daily basis. The swimming pool is the nicest and was warm to get into. Always plenty of sun loungers togther with shade if required. (We reckoned the hotel was at 60% - 70% capacity). The main buffet restaurent had plenty of choice (even for vegetarians like me) and the desserts were especially nice. The Al la carte restuarants (Steakhouse, Mexican, Italian & Japanese) were nice but we've been to better. The 'Show' cooking at the Japanese was different and made for an interesting meal but generally the starters at these restaurants we found to be average (better choice at the buffet). Sea is just lovely, really blue and so appealing to look at it....even better being in it although not much to see so if you're interested in snorkelling a excursion may be required. The waiter service was spot on, served very quickly and drinks all very good quality. Waited on also at the beach and around the pool which was a nice touch. The entertainment team were very good, from their pool and beach games during the day to the nightly shows they took part in each evening. A group of very energetic, friendly people who all tried to make your holiday as good as it could possibly be. Most of the evening shows were good and watchable, however a few were awful and we left early. We thought that a tribute act or two might make a welcomed change throughout the stay. We saw lots of wildlife at the hotel which was really different, the monkeys were my personal favourite and I never got fed up of looking out for them! We had them on our balcony most days and they were so cute but sometimes scary with the noises they made. As the hotels in the jungle, there were lots of mosquitos so take plently of repellant. The weather was great, very hot and humid during our stay but the only parts of the hotel that have air conditioning are the rooms and some of the Al la carte restaurants. Some nights it got very uncomftable just sitting in the bar having a drink because of the humidity. My husband's glasses steamed up when we left our air conditioned room of an evening to go for our meals!!!

In every dealing I had I was always amazed by the quick response and professionalism of the entire staff but one in particular made our stay the best we ever had by going above and beyond. We arrived to the hotel and was immediately checked in and some tasty adult beverages were brought to us. Then, we were transported to our room (a Jr Suite) on the beach. The room was decorated with floral arrangements, robes, towels, a bottle of tequila and a note from the manager of Guest Relations. Then within 2 hours of arrival, we received a phone call to see how we were and if everything was satisfactory. He stated \"to call him if we needed anything\". I can say that we never needed to call him but that might be because he proceeded to call us every day. The first evening we ate at the Italian Restaurant. My companions both had the steak, which must have been good since they polished it off and I had the red snapper.... Ditto to me cleaning the plate. The second evening we ate in the Mexican restaurant. The food was very good also. The third and fourth nights we ate at the Japanese steakhouse which is our favorite!! Sushi appetizer, tempura, steak and octopus the first night and shrimp and octopus the second night. How can a person go wrong?!?! Oh, and since we were sitting at a table celebrating a 50th birthday.......quite a few shots. This was my 4th time at this resort so we decided to bypass the nightly shows but we did hit the disco a few nights.

Enjoyed the ala carte Hibachi, very good shrimp, chicken and fried rice. Beef was bland. Tenderloin at the Steakhouse was excellent. Loved the beautiful clear sea, water temp was perfect, beach clean, no shells. Can't complain about the sandbags as they protect beach erosion. Pool is huge and spotless. Be careful entering the pool, the entry areas appear to have steps, but there is only one, the second step is not there so you will fall in if you are not aware. Ice cream cart by the beach/pool was great. Recommend the Chichen Itza tour and the Cenotes. Coco Bongo was fun. Star friends earn their pay and then some.

The ocean beach was perfect. And since it was low season plenty of chairs. We enjoyed walking a few hundred yards to the right, past Sandos, for a quieter beach area. A+ STAFF: I dont care if they are friendly, as long as they are good. The staff here was both. Exceptional service by good people. A. FOOD: Generally, very good. The buffets for breakfast (great omelets), lunch and dinner were varied and tasty. We tried small portions and went back for larger ones that we liked. The carved meats at the back were always good. A lot of seafood, too. The desserts were excellent. The ala cartes: Japanese was the best; i got shrimp and beef combination twice. The Italian and Steak were just ok..great presentation, average taste. The seafood was closed, more about that later. The best: the ice cream cart by the pool. B. DRINKS: We found that the frozen/ice drinks by the pool were below average. Great bartenders, but not strong or tasty. The third day I bought a bottle of Bacardi in town and added it to drinks. Better. Late in the week, we began ordering regular mixed drinks, g&t, long island ice tea and they were better. We thought the drinks in the adult pool bar were very good. The best drinks -- and they were excellent -- were in the lobby bar. B ROOMS: Good size, functional and clean. The beds are hard, but we got the egg crates and that helped. The views throughout the property are average. B EXCURSIONS: To Xel-ha, Lomas Tours (aqua blue shirts) to the right walking out had a good deal. $150 for all-inclusive plus private van for $20 per person RT. Ask for Omar. A. GUESTS: As in most situations, 95 percent were wonderful. Two stereotypes were perpetuated: the loudest were American and the most aloof, dont-say-hello were European. The American guy on the beach who made 15 bad jokes about wearing a speedo was a joke himself. B NEGATIVES: The Queztal side was closed, so the seafood ala carte wasnt open. Also, we were going to upgrade to ocean front, but Tucan views were not nearly as good as the Queztal. Also, no AC in the lobby bar, buffet and show room made it uncomfortable at times.

Those who may be concerned about the earlier reviewer's comments about birds in the open sided restaurants need worry no more as unobtrusive nets have now been fitted.

Much more likely is that mosquitoes got in their room - my wife and I rarely left the balcony door open and definitely not when the room lights were on. The mosquitoes are most active around dusk so a spray-on repellent is advisable for the evenings. The beach was clean and well stocked with loungers and umbrellas but a general comment about nearly every resort I have visited is that the marker buoys separating the motor craft from swimmers are too far inshore.

The first thing I will mention is the flight out (just for the UK travellers).We booked through first choice and decided to upgrade to premium economy just for the extra legroom (and complementary drinks), well, the flight out was great, just 110 people on the whole plane (Thomson airways) the food was actually nice and the \"trolley dollys\" were really professional and first class, unfortunately this cannot be said for the return flight, it was packed and the food was disgusting, I think they actually scraped roadkill from the runway in Cancun and passed it off as beef, even worse to come was the smell of raw sewerage on the plane from take off to landing, and then came the most vile breakfast imagionable, I actually thought that we had mashed potatoe, no, this was actually egg!!!! it was a mushy yellowy blob of gunk that had the same aroma as the sewerage smell on the plane, as for the complementary drinks, they came round twice in 9 hours, my advice? save your money and stay in economy, trust me the seats are big enough and have plenty legroom. Now for the all important part, the hotel itself, well where do i start, upon arrival we had a smooth and very fast check in, the bell boys were always on hand to convey you and your luggage to your rooms, if you want to upgrade to a ocean view suite as we did, email the hotel first as we paid just $50 (\u00a330) per day for this and the views alone are worth the extra money, in fact use the money you saved on upgrading your flight and upgrade your room instead, a lot of travel companies will do the upgrade for you but at a much higher price than the actual hotel itself, i spoke to one couple who had been charged over \u00a3400 ($620) from their tour company. The hotel itself has all the facilities you will ever need to make a perfect holiday, the only complaint that i can justify was the price of the day excursions they were a blatent rip off and massivly overpriced, again this is not the hotels fault its the tour operators who rip you off. A lot of previous reviews have mentioned how hard the beds are, well, yes they are hard but matteress toppers are always available from the reception free of charge all you need to do is ask and the maid will come to your room and fit one within the hour. Another thing about the resort is the heat, its Mexico, its bound to be hot, and, yes, there are a lack of \"cool spots\" within the bar areas but due to the humidity i doubt that blasting air conditioning would help at most of the areas are in the open, but, the rooms are lovely and cool for the night time, to be honest I cannot complain about the hotel at all, the food is fantastic for an all inclusive and the choice of a la carte restaurants is tremendous BUT you have to try the steakhouse.... I have eaten steak all over the world and the tenderloin steak in the steakhouse i can honestly say was one of the best steaks we have ever had the pleasure to eat, in fact we used all our 3 a la carte reservations in the steakhouse as nothing in my opinion could compare to it, another thing about the food which no one has mentioned before but i am going to, IF YOU HAVE A NUT ALLERGY PLEASE BE CAREFULL, as 75% of the deserts and ice creams contained nuts so obviously the main restauants will be places that nuts have been used and there are no warnings, just thought id let you know. Now to the staff, only one thing i can say about them....Brilliant, every member of staff at this hotel was fantastic and could not do enough for you, you always got a smile and a \"Hola\" no matter what time of day and night it was, they would bend over bacwards to help in anyway they could, the entertainment staff were also great, they must work 20 hours a day 7 days a week as they are around the pool in the morning and afternoon trying to get people to join in their activities, then their shows in the evening and some of them working in the nightclub till 3am. 10 out of 10 for the staff. The hotel does have a great spa but this is not included and can be expensive ($150, \u00a3100 for a 50 min massage is a bit much) The resort is spotless and is in a jungle setting, the bugs can be a bit brutal depending on how hungry they are but if you buy \"deet 55 or 100\" they will stay away. On another note the abundance of wildlife is amazing ranging from howler monkeys, parrots, iguanas and lizards, flamingo's the list just goes on and on.... To sum up all of the above i would say \"JUST GO, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR\", UPGRADE YOUR ROOM AND ENJOY.

This was our first stay at the Iberostar Tucan. Our conclusion is unanimous: this small jewel in the jungle was the best of all. Booking and price: Based on consistently good online reviews, I have considered booking this resort just about every year. This summer the price was the lowest I\u2019ve seen: $800 per person for a 7-day package from Baltimore with Apple Vacations. If cost is an issue, this is an excellent deal. Score: 5 of 5 Location and atmosphere: This resort is located within the Playacar complex just south of Playa Del Carmen. It is not as convenient to the Cancun airport as Porto Morelos, but not so long of a drive as Xpu-ha or Tulum. Although the Iberostar actually sits within a large resort complex, the setting among ponds, waterfalls, and tall trees teeming with wildlife effectively conveys the illusion that you are nestled in the midst of the Mayan jungle. The resort is smaller and much more intimate than other places we\u2019ve stayed. It is just a short walk to the beach, pool, gym, restaurant, or buffet from any room on the site. Should you forget something, you can easily return to your room to get it. Score: 5 of 5 Sand and sea: Soft, sandy, palm-lined shore with gorgeous aquamarine water, gentle waves, and plenty of chairs/palapas. Smiling waitresses take your orders and serve you drinks right on the beach. There are no rocks (good for swimming) and few fish (bad for snorkeling). The beach is not as spectacular as my favorites in Punta Cana, Tulum or Xpu-ha, but still very good. I enjoyed long walks each day, checking out the lively beach scenes along resorts to the north, as well as the restful nature scenes on the deserted beach to the south. Big black tubular sandbags provide a rather unfortunate distraction from the natural beauty along the developed section of the beach. Advice to Iberostar: A pamphlet or bulletin board with pictures showing hurricane damage and diagrams explaining the beach replenishment project would be very informative. A lot of guests have questions and I expect would be more forgiving if they understood how these barriers are working to restore the beach. My family made the best of the situation and used the bags as slides into the sea (a little against the rules, but much fun). Score: 4 of 5 Food and more food: Our whole family agrees that this is the best cuisine we\u2019ve yet experienced at an all-inclusive in Mexico or the Dominican Republic. The service is both friendly and competent. We loved all the Mexican dishes, fish, fresh fruit (smoothies for breakfast), pasta, salads, soups, simple desserts (e.g., mango ice cream), and fancy European desserts at the buffets. We also enjoyed the Mexican, Japanese, and Italian restaurants. Even the house wine at this resort was good. My only complaint is that they need to brew real tea rather than serve instant iced tea with meals. Score: 5 of 5 Rooms and monkeys: Rooms here are basic, clean, and comfortable with very firm mattresses (which I prefer). We shared our third-floor balcony with a family of howler monkeys, one of whom liked to hang from the roof by her tail and tap on our sliding glass door hoping for food (which we did not provide). Fortunately, they didn\u2019t bother our drying bathing suits, although Pedro (the name my son gave the father monkey) looked like he might benefit from a Speedo to hold his low-hanging fruit in place. When not hanging out on our balcony, my son stayed in contact with his new-found friends by howling in a deep bass voice. The monkeys replied in kind! This was a very special part of the experience for us. In my book, living with wild monkeys trumps swimming with captive dolphins. Score: 5 of 5. Activities and fun: The entertainment staff here are great \u2013 not pushy or over-the-top, but normal and friendly. My son and I especially liked playing beach volleyball each day. We made new friends, young and old, from both America and Europe. At some larger resorts, you lie on the beach watching people all day, but never speaking a word to anyone. At this resort, everyone talks and interacts. It is hard to keep silent when you are having such a tremendous time!

We got their extremely early, so we knew we couldn't check in, but the front desk told us there would be no problem to check in at 2:00, so we enjoyed the pool and came back to find out we had to wait until after 3:00 for check in. It was a little annoying, but not ruining anything, since it was our honeymoon Rooms: We had a great 1st room, but wanted to upgrade for $50 a night to be on the beach. Very worth it. We got our 2nd room. It was outstanding, the only problem was we had a little ant problem. I thought it might have been because we had a flavored water open, but doesn't seem to be the way. We cleaned up the room spotless and we still had a little issue. It wasn't a huge deal though. The one downside of this room is it gets real hot, even with the AC on. The cleaning people do an amazing job, but I am used to sleeping in cool rooms, and it was a bit hot. **As an FYI** they only fill your fridge every other day, so if you want to have a few beers, conserve, because when we asked them to refill our fridge they said they wouldn't. Pool: One of the best pools I have been too. Oustanding. I wish the pool bar was part of the main pool. I really want to stress how much better this pool is than the other resorts we have been in. The pool bar was alright, but being disconnected to the main pool was sort of a disappointment Beach; Bar none, best beach in Playacar, beats all RIUs. I would have to say the huts on the beach are the best, no other resort has them. I also think the water was nice, since the protectors weren't all over the place like other resorts. Activities: Great, they keep activities going thru the day Entertainment: This is where they shined. They put on a a great show every night, and they work real hard. I was so happy with their performance, we went all of the 5 nights we were there. They have the best shows of any hotel I have stayed at. Bars: They have two main bars and the show bar. We did the one lobby bar on the tucan side. They had music every night. I would say it is quieter than most resorts tho. Also, the club was fun for a night or two, but on the 3rd night, there were what appeared to be 13 year olds hanging out. Food: I like the food, but hated the variety. One thing I wish is that you could make more than 2 reservations to specialty restaurants. The buffets have the same food every night, so you really have to try new things in order to like the food. I think the quality of food was there however. Service: Outstanding, we got a wine and fruit basket for our honeymoon, which was nice since the riu didn't give us anything. They also did some cool towel art every day. Grounds: The grounds are real cool. It is like you are in a jungle, monkeys and birds everywhere. I would have to say this is one of the only resorts in Playacar like this. Bottom line: I give this resort a 5, but a 4 in our situation. It was flawless except a few things. The ants sort of bothered me, and they weren't taken care of. The $13 a day wi-fi was a bit high, since the RIU has it for free. And the food variety on the buffetts could have been better. For families, this is the place to go! For social people, I would say no. The staff was outstanding, but the people staying at the resort weren't as friendly as at the RIU.

My concerns mainly were regarding quality of food and would we be surrounded by people abusing the 'free' alcohol and being embarrassingly greedy with the amount of food they would pile up and waste (which would have annoyed me I have to say). I needn't have worried on both counts. Thankfully. Some basic info (which may be standard but as I say this was our first All Inc). You do not need to take any towels as they are in plentiful supply, including beach towels - therefore saving a good amount of luggage space/weight. There is a coffee machine in the room so hot water for our early morning cuppa was not a problem. The rooms: Bright and airy, always cleaned to a high standard. Yes the beds are a tad firm but we actually preferred that. We upgraded to a room over looking the beach (block 10). Initially we had a first floor room which I was a little disappointed in (though not enough to make a big criticism of, purely an observation) in that our view was somewhat obstructed by the proliferation of palm trees. We later moved downstairs (for reasons I will explain later) and although the view was better we found we had a bigger problem with mozzies (no pleasing some people eh, lol) Food: Very enjoyable. Always plenty of choice and good quality. The al a carte's made a nice change. We were told we could have 5 meals there over the two week period but on the principle of 'if you don't ask you don't get' we managed a 6th. The Japanese was my personal favourite though others in our party had different preferences so I think they are all down to individual tastes. Staff: Absolutely amazing, all of them, from our first contact at reception to the, well everybody, was so friendly and helpful. Entertainment: We are not big on doing the shows as they're not 'our thing' but the ones we did go to were very impressive in deed. One problem: Going into the theatre (fortunately with only two days to go) because it was so dark my wife fell off the side of the disabled ramp (ironic) which one could not see, and landed on her ankle. Within minutes help was at hand and she was efficiently cared for and transported to the local hospital where again she was efficiently and appropriately cared for. Fortunately not broken, but sprained ligaments. From the hospital I rang the hotel and asked if we could be moved to a ground floor room and luckily one was available. By the time we returned they had prepared it for us. Excellent service. This room had a better view to the sea but as said previously the mozzies also preferred being lower down. We completed the necessary accident form but at the bottom there was a disclaimer asking us to state the hotel was not responsible for the accident. We said we couldn't agree to that as they were somewhat to blame, for the inadequate lighting. Finally: A great holiday.

This last time - August 2009 - we went with our 8 year old son, and friends with their three children. They accepted our recommendation to stay at this resort and, by the third day, our friend took me aside and said that it was so much more beautiful, the staff more friendly and helpful and the food choices more varied than the last place he had stayed (which was within walking distance on the same section of beach). He said how glad he was that they had gone with our suggestion and is now considering taking his extended family there for a future vacation. The staff provided us with first-rate service, as much or as little as we desired. We were cheerfully welcomed each day with a friendly 'Hola' and 'Buenas Dias'; suggestions of things to do or encouragement to join activities that were offered. Perhaps because of the economy or the Swine Flu scare, the resort had relatively few guests - never crowded and there were always chairs available at the pool and/or the beach. Never the less, the staff was unflagging in their enthusiasm and service spirit, despite what had to be a troubling situation (we saw several closed businesses). Needless to say, we saw/heard nothing of any sick people. Stand outs: The scuba dive shop - Charles and Annaleen in particular. Also Mario (manager?) who not only arranged for us to have neighboring rooms with our friends somehow we ended up with partial ocean view rooms. The only disapointment was the person - Michael - who somewhat 'oversold' the package deal at Xcaret. We got what we paid for but he seemed to exaggerate some details that felt unnecessary and unseemly. He also professed to be unaware of a deal on the internet (www.xcaret.com) that saves 10 percent off admission (note, must book at least three days out from when you intend to visit the park...and the admission is good for a year so you're not locked in in case of bad weather).

My boyfriend and I travelled to Playa del Carmen Aug 9 - 15 on a trip simply to get away from our lives at home. We wanted to relax, do some beaching, take in a little tourism and be pampered just a tiny bit. After doing some poking around here and on Apple Vacations, we came to choose the Iberostar Tucan based on being the best price for the highest rated resort in the area. Being that the place was all-inclusive was just an added bonus. The open-air theme of the resort worried me just a tiny bit when we first arrived. Just open everything is out in the air with huge, hut-looking roofs over top. Very few of the resort's eateries or bars are in-doors, per se, or air conditioned, and being that we were there in mid-August, I thought the heat might get unbearable. To be honest, it was hot, BUT under the resort's roofs that were littered with ceiling fans and allowed the ocean breeze to flow up to you, we were comfortable the whole time. By the end of the trip, I came to love that almost everything was open-air, as our summer (or lack thereof) in Chicago has just been miserably chilly and any extra chance to enjoy the warmth and sun was welcomed. The ambiance around the remaining parts of the resort was also very much appreciated. The jungle theme was immaculate, and all the widllife that strolled the paths and trees in the resort added some very cool flavor to our trip. The strolls on the paths at night turned out to be pretty romantic as well. The monkey's growling/roaring at dusk was unsettling at first, but waking up to them playing in the trees outside your room was very cool. The staff were very, very nice. Everyone had a smile on their face and greeted us everywhere we went. There was one particular guy that was not very nice, mainly because he had an obvious issue with a gay couple at his resort, but he worked in the dive center, not the main part of the resort and we only had to interact with him for a moment. Other than him, every employee was great. Service was prompt and genuine at the restaurants as well. Even the over-the-top announcer for the Star Friends (the resorts entertainment team) grew on us because he seemed to generally care if you were having a good time. As for the food, we tried all the buffets, the room service, the Mexican, Japanese and Steak restaurants. I would highly recommend the Mexican restaurant as a must, but the others were simply OK. The Tacos Especiales were just amazing, and if you can snag a couple of the Tres Leches mini-cakes from the desert bar, you'll be an obscene amount of calories heavy, but you won't regret it one bit. The steak house over cooked my steak, and the Japanese place delivered well enough, just not anything that stood out to me as a \"must.\" All of the buffets seemed pretty diverse and very adequate. A little recommendation for those that enjoy drinks: stick to the bar in the lobby or the bar by the stage. Those both stock good liquors and both offer a diverse line up of drinks. You have to try the Michelada from the lobby bar as well! The other bars are just fine, but they are light bars and are limited in their selections. The nightly entertainment was also pretty decent. Don't expect Cirque du Soleil, but do expect to be entertained. The shows were all pretty energetic and fun, and I'd highly recommend the Disco night and the Cultural Night. The Hollywood night was pretty good as well. We did not venture into the night club at the resort, but they did have one there for those that do not want to venture outside the gates of the hotel. For couples, you simply have to stroll the beach at night. The keep the lighting out there at a minimum, so as to increase the romanticism and the perfect view of the stars.

Most times you can get a better feel for what you want to do once you have spoken to the hotel staff. They are most informative. The travel service that you use to get to Mexico does not always have the best deals. Just schedule early enough in your stay so that you dont get shut out or if the weather turns bad.

It was so cool and it added alot to the tropical experience..monkeys, tucans, peacocks etc. etc. Hey-if your thinking where to go..Iberostar Tucan is the winner.

The buffet was better than the Al a carte - apart from the Japanese restaurant I suggest you try. Staff were second to none, so attentive and friendly. I can't praise this place enough.

We spent nearly 2 years saving and were not disappointed in the money spent! We being my husband, myself, 91/2yr old daughter and 22 month old son, have had the most amazing holiday. After booking to go to the dominican republic and changing our minds, after paying for the holiday 4 days after the swine flu outbreak( of which there is more in england then ever has been in mexico!) and reading hundreds of reviews both good and not wonderful we arrived at the hotel. Oh 10 1/2 hrs flight with first choice, what big seats in normal class! 2nd drop off and the only ones off our plane! We checked in dead quickly and had room service(all incl in hotel) in our room for tea. The room was not what i expected at all. It was very very big, 2 double beds, a settee chair and small table and room for a big cot, of which was perfect! the balcony looked out onto the pool and you could see (just) the sea. The bathroom had a walk in shoer toilet and sink etc. Shampoo and shower gel were in full dispensers in the shower and plenty of fresh clean towels. not much room in the wardrobe for a family of fours clothes! full size iron and ironing board and a safe! the mini bar was filled with some regularity, we followed some tips on tipping the minibar and they just took the money, the guest services werent happy with the maid when we phone for the second time to have it filled, no probs after that! The room was airconditioned, the only place that was in the hotel but apparently thats the same as in every hotel! The room we felt just needed updating, when talking to others from other hotels they were the same. However please dont let this put you off there was absolutely nothing wrong with it, 3 stars however for that! The bits which we were worried about before we went are as follows: Putting towels out on beds with shade: As having a young child i was up and out most mornings by 8am however you could get a sun bed and shade anytime of the day ! if you went onto the beach! by the pool you could find sunbeds but hey when its only 10 paces from the pool to the white smooth sandy beach why worry! I have to say that was my main worry, but 8 oclock you could still get a very good spot! Food: wow wow wow wow! how people can say there wasnt a choice i dont know, There was a different main every night, roast lamb, beef, prok chicken salads of every kind, fish of all kinds of scale, pizzas, mexican, all sorts of food, puddings coming out of your ears, fruit of any kind ice cream, lunch had bbqs etc breakfast was everything you can imagine and some! the resteraunts were amazing, the mexican let its self down, we imagined alsorts, big fajitas etc think bland! however the piece of meat i had both times we went to the steak house were phenominal! would heve cost at least \u00a325.00 in a resteraunt here! the italian was amazing too. Drinks: whatever whenever however you wanted them! Micheala the waitress in the lobby was superb and helped to teach us some spanish! Staff: the entertainment staff worked almost 24-7 they were so socilble without being in your face! yes weve done the cheap holidays where you are dragged onto your feet when your sunbathing or forced to take part in some stupid game, not here, the staff were amazing, they stopped if you wanted them they let you join in when you wanted to and did everything they could to help you! Not once did i feel forced to do something i didnt want to do! Hawkers: The beach was patrolled by a bloke in uniform on a quad bike, it was brill, no one came near, those that escaped his wrath only came to you if you showed interest! Shops: Yes Playa del carmen has loads... but all were come and have a look! that wasnt nice! there is a small shopping center to the right of the hotel it has an amazing group of souveneer shops etc, a bit cheaper than the hotel but not much! Trips: Dont believe how long it takes to get to them, our 40 min trip turned into 2 hours there! Pool: How big, how clean how many? took 8 mins to walk around it, seperate pool for ball games, another for tinies and the bar pool(cold) Pool and sea were nice and warm! The hotel is set in the most amazing situation, it has a jungle in the middle, with wildlife my children are going to remember for ever, the beach was so clean it was amazing, no little at all, in fact each morning 2 blokes raked up any seaweed ! The sea, what can i say, i hate the sea, i grew up in morecambe i know what goes into and is already in the sea! this was different you could stand neck deep and still see your feet! Fish not really you knew they were there but hey, no shoes needed! We did email before we went asking for a room near the pool and sea and we couldnt have been any closer to either! Holiday of a lifetime..............Yes. Going back.................... one day recomend to go there...........oh yes!!!!!!!!!!! Tips..............Sun tan lotion and bug spray Safety.......... at no time did we feel our children were in any danger..... not like when weve been in africa or europe Food..........Eat what you want none of us got ill at all! Tips.............Dont give much, we got carried away at first, just remember once youve gone they arent going to remember you after youve got out of the bus or shop.

I wouldn't say it was 4-star quality food, but it was tasty and there was plenty of variety. Our favorite restaurant was the steak place, great taste! I wish we could've gone more than once! The entertainment was AWESOME! They had a \"Cirque du Soleil\" show that was incredible! We were very amazed at the talent that the staff had! Some of the shows were cheesy, but, for the most part, pretty entertaining. The beach was very clean, and the sand whales kept all the shells from coming to shore. Visually, it wasn\u2019t the most appealing, but it sort of looked like giant rocks, so it didn\u2019t take away from the experience. The water was so deliciously warm and perfect! The pools were super jam packed, so we never got chairs there \u2013 it was impossible. But the swim up bar was really cool. They had little cubbies that you can take your drinks over to and sit privately for a while. And the staff was amazing! They really would go out of their way to talk with you and make you feel at home. Oh, and lastly, it was very cool to see the wildlife walking around and the monkeys up on the trees. However, they must have their dwelling places closer to the beach, so if you get a room close by, you will hear them for sure! And it\u2019s not a pleasant sound either! They have a very loud growl and scream, and sound very scary! I\u2019m sure that if we had a room there, we\u2019d be woken up by them.

We were an extended party of 14 family members aged 5-75. We had five rooms and they were able to put us all in the same building that was at the center of everything which made it easier for the grandparents. All the recent reviews here are accurate and properly reflect what it is like to stay here. I will give you some insight into just how nice/accommodating this place is. Booking dinners in the resteraunts were a little bit of a challenge as we wanted all 14 to eat together. The reservation people managed to make it happen without too much fuss but we did have to push a little. Another little tidbit, one morning for breakfast one person in our party, while walking through the buffet line, commented that he was in the mood for smoked salmon and he didn't see it. They had other types of fish in the buffet that day. Within 5 minutes a waiter comes to our table with a very large platter of thinly sliced smoked salmon. That says alot for an all inclusive. I have to say the general theme of the week is if you don't see it ask for it. I am a single malt scotch drinker and didn't see my preferred brand of single malt. I asked the bartender and he says no problem, goes around the corner and comes back with my top shelf single malt just for me. One of our older family members has trouble walking and found the stone paths through the \"jungle\" to be a challange at times especially at night. The staff there were very quick to give golf cart rides. Just make a call and within five minutes they are there with a smile on their face and an Hola! Another little tidbit that I found surprising during the week. I never once, all week, had to wait for anything. No matter what bar, what time of day, or what meal. Every drink I had all week, and there were plenty, I never waited more than 45 seconds, no joke. It is amazing how fast they can make any blender drink on demand. The only line I saw all week was for the mid afternoon ice cream stand at the beach which was always 3-5 people in line. This is a very well rounded resort and you will see many different people and families from all over the western world. Everyone feels comfortable and relaxed and is having fun.

We were allowed two guaranteed reservations in the speciality restaurants for our 6 night stay so we ate in the mexican and japanese restaurants. They were both very good. We were lucky enough to get another reservation for a third night so we ate in the mexican restaurant again. The service was incredible. We did tip extra although tips were included, but I still think the service would have been excellent anyway. The staff seemed surprised when we tipped and were very appreciative.

The resort itself ? Fellow resort vacationers ? I cannot say enough about the Iberstar Tucan...for value, rating, appeal, it is a lot of bang for your buck (or euro). From check-in to check-out, it was all I had hoped for and more. BEAUTIFUL PROPERTY, EXCELLENT service, great buffets (breakfast 5.0, lunch 5.0, dinner could be upgraded a bit so I will say a 4.0). Beautiful landscaping (props to Mother Nature for most of that.) CLEAN CLEAN CLEAN everywhere. You litterally walk through a little \"jungle\" from the main lobby area, past the buffet service areas, down to the vast pool areas (plenty of chairs by the way) and specialty restaurants (four of them on the property -- Italian, Steak, Japanese, Mexican). We stayed 4 nights so you are only allowed to make one \"specialty\" restaurant reservation. Otherwise, it is what is available that day/wait-listed or back to the dinner buffet. Now back to the jungle -- you walk past peacocks, pheasants, ducks, chickens, monkeys swinging in trees, iquanas, tucans, koi, and some little Mexican rodent creature that looks like a rabbit w/o a tail. My onnnnnly complaint would be the annoying black birds that fly through the breakfast/lunch pavilions and go after unclaimed food. The resort really needs to \"resort\" to some type of screens because it is unsanitary. The resort was very family-oriented. My partner and I (we are gay males) felt comfortable each day and everywhere we went on the property. There was a wide range of ethnicities, ages, national backgrounds....everyone is there just to have a good time. (I did not see a lot of \"over drinking\" either) A couple of women did go topless on the beach in front of the resort, so something to think about if that is a concern to you and the kiddies. I saw signs \"topless not allowed\" at the Tucan itself, but I guess it is also a public beach strip, so you do need to realize you are not in Kansas anymore when you are there. The Iberstar Tucan is right next to the Iberstar Quetzal - sister property. You can venture over there too with your wrist band and see their waterfall and flamingos. Lotta stuff to do on the beach...the resort does encourage (put are not \"pushy\" ) guests to join in activities: e.g., horeshoe games, yoga, group stretching, stuff like that, or you can just ignore all that and bask in the sun. There is evening entertainment on the property...I would give it a 3.5. The staff gave it their all in group shows, but I was not there for evening \"entertainment\". Downtown Playa Del Carmen - 7 minutes away by cab (50 pesos each way), safe, fun, typical Caribbean shopping, nice eating places.

Have been to all inclusives in Jamacia and the Dominican Republic. The Iberostar was similar or superior in every way but the beach. Details... Check-in and Check out were not a problem. Our room was not quite ready - waited for about 10 minutes, but that may have been because we requested a certain set of criteria. We stayed in building 13 on the 3rd floor - room 1344. Our room was just steps from the pool, which was steps from the beach and the beach buffets - 3 of them. Very, very convenient. We did a little walking in the evening to get to the specialty restaurants and the main buffet, but spent the rest of the day minutes from our room. Would highly recommend third floor rooms. You do have some steps to climb, but the exercise was well worth it. The room faced away from the pool, which put us on eye level with the monkeys. One morning while reading on our balcony, I looked up to see a large monkey sitting 8 feet away watching me! This experience was repeated often. The bathrooms were the nicest that we've had at any all inclusive. This was also the first resort in the Caribbean that didn't have bugs of some type in the room. This time I came armed with bug spray for the ants that were inevitable in every other room. But we didn't see a one! I did use the bug spray on my feet and lower legs in the evenings when we went out. Got a few mosquito bites on the nights I forgot to spray. The bed was a little hard the first night, but we slept well. The second day we requested a foam mattress and it did help. Mini bar in the room was kept well stocked. (This is the only place you can get bottled water - keep that in mind if you've planned excursions and will need to bake bottled water) The wildlife was amazing. I realized by the third day that if you really want to see the animals, you must walk slowly through the jungle and look for them. One evening on the way to dinner there were 8 monkeys playing together in the treetops - one was a tiny baby who followed his mother everywhere! Very cute. Also saw iguanas, peacocks, toucans, parrots, lots of unique birds and scores of the little rodents that look a little like a squirrel with no tail. We did hear the monkeys a little in the mornings, but it was not too disturbing. Would recommend taking earplugs. If the wildlife noise woke me up before I was ready, I slipped in an earplug and went right back to sleep. The food was the best we've ever had at an all-inclusive. I LOVE Mexican food, and they had the best that I've ever eaten - not too suprising since it's Mexico, after all! The main buffet was excellent every meal. And yes, you can eat Mexican every meal, even for breakfast! If you like the pico de gallo at Chili's, you will LOVE the buffets! Every meal included rice, salsa, pico and toasted tortillas filled with cheese. I could make a meal off of those three times a day! (They also have fried tortilla chips similar to Chili's - just less salty. Yummy! You could even eat them for breakfast!) The Mexican specialty restaurant was great - got full off of the appetizer/dessert bar before the main course arrived. Did not really care for the Italian restaurant - the meat in the dishes both I and my husband had tasted a little \"off\" - almost had a rancid flavor. Did not eat much of that. Breakfast was always my favorite meal of the day. Usually ate at the main buffet, but the beach palapas had good breakfast buffet, too. Great doughnuts, bacon, pastries and hashbrowns. The orange juice was amazing, and so were the fresh fruits. The pineapple was the best. My huband loved the ice cream. The ocean was a little rough, but I liked it that way. The sand bags were a little inconvenience. Ocean felt a little crowded compared to other resorts we've stayed at. There just wasn't a lot of beachside space in the ocean compared to the people staying at the resort. People sort of crowded into the ocean between the sandbags. Well worth the short walk down the beach to the undeveloped section. Very, very peaceful and quiet. Gave you that deserted island feeling! Hotel staff was very friendly, and the nighttime shows were good. Word to the wise: if you plan to see the 9:30 show, better get there early. It was standing room only every night. We did take the taxi to 5th avenue - only cost a few dollars. The shopping there was a unique experience. My husband went scuba diving lots - did 11 dives in 8 days. Did not really enjoy the Cenotes excursion - said it was a little boring. But it was unique to the Mayan Riveria, so at least he knows he didn't miss anything. The reefs at Cozumel were the best dives they had. And he liked diving the wreck \"Mama Vina\".

Do not miss Iberostar Tucan/Quetzal for terrific experience!\u201d", "Author": "thosutt", "ReviewID": "UR36619608", "Content": "Booked this trip last minute (3 weeks out). Researched long and hard for the perfect property in Playacar/Playa del Carmen. Our requirements were excellant beach, rooms with superb accessibility to the beach, pool and food and of course not one of the mega resorts in which you have to hike a mile just to get to the beach every morning. We were not disappointed with a couple of minor exceptions which absolutely did not outweigh the pros. Location: Gated community of Playcar. Very exclusive and unbelieveably convenient. The Iberostar Tucan/Quetzal was the most convenient and accessible location in the area. You can walk 3 blocks from the hotel lobby to the Playacar Plaza and be at a Starbucks, shopping, grocery, convenience and liquor store. Not that we needed anything since Iberostar is all inclusive. We stayed on the Tucan side and preferred that to the Quetzal side but both are the same. You can access all resturants, bars, and amenities back and forth with no problems. We preferred the Tucan because of it's access to a very short beach walk past the last resort on the beach (Sandos) to 2 miles of incorporated, pristine beach. We stayed in building 10 in an OCEANFRONT JR. SUITE. I Highly recommend upgrading for these rooms because of beach, pool and resturant proximity. Bear in mind no matter what rooms you have this is a smaller more guest friendly property than the mega reosorts. Easy short walking no matter where you are on the property. It is beautiful jungle right up to the beach, although more humid on the jungle path than outer perimeter path to resturants and lobbies. We have stayed primarily at the mega resort chains such at the PALACE RESORTS (ie. Moon palace) and done much hopping between properties at the Palace chains between Cancun, Playa del Carmen, and Cozumel). Although somewhat more high end in amenities and rooms, the beach at the Moon Palace is nothing to brag about (due to reef right off of the shore) and if you want a two person jacuzzi in your suite you won't find that at the Tucan. However, if you want a smaller more authentic property with everything a couple, family or group of friends could ask for then try out the Iberostar Tucan, Playacar. The property is a 5 minute/$5USD cab ride to downtown Play del Carmen and boy has it grown-up. It is clean, safe, eclectic, multi-cultural and one heck of a great time for shopping, dining, live music, and anything else you could ask for. The resort location and it's exclusive Playcar location to Playa del Carmen is by far the new Mexican Riviera making Cancun a destination of the past for us. Rooms: Very comfortable, authentic decor but a little older than the newer resorts. However, for ambience and comfort great for us. A couple of light bulbs burned out, and were replaced within 10 minutes by the staff. We had no complaints about the beds as some other reviews. TIP: AC is computer controlled very comfortable, but turns off when you leave the room and turns on immediately when you return. Not a problem for us, but if you find it an issue you can talk to the front desk and they can set it a little lower for you. Iberostar is energy concious and let's face it you wouldn't open you balcony doors and leave the AC full blast with doors open at home either. BEST TIP: Again, upgrade to the OceanFront Jr. Suite. and do it early. Each side only has one oceanfront building with 12 of these suites in each building. Need a big suite oceanfront? Each of these two building has presidential suites on the third floors for bigger families or groups. Request a ground floor or second floor on the end to catch a steady beach breeze on your patio. Middle rooms in the building get a little less breeze but still great! Another TIP: July 1- Aug 15 is European Holiday Time and Mexican Holiday Time. Americans tend to travel during May and June. Most of the hotel guests during the time we were there July 16-21, 2009 were European and Mexican. We loved it. So many interesting people. But, being from the Midwest we always strike up conversations with everyone and if you want to meet people then strike up a conversation first. Most will speak English. Penn State Alumni came in while we were there and so American's did represent, too! Frankly we love the multi-cultural atmosphere. Food: Nice variety and good. Although many of the entree's for lunch were repeated several times, there were always new ones each day too. We did not each lunch at eh bigger buffets because we loved the casual atmosphere of the resturant closer to our room for the convenience. Either sit down and be waited on or more our style help ouselves and feed the peacocks wandering through each morning. Bar in that resturant, beach bar 50 feet, ice cream stand right there, you couldn't ask for more. Note: Bottled water in your room refrigerator all the time. Drink dispenser water (just fine with us) at the restaurants. Need to go off property take bottled water from your room. Leave a note for the housekeeper to leave extra if you need it! No topless sunbathing at pool, but a few Europeans on the beach topless from time to time. Not a problem again, but if you want a resort with no topless you better do your research if this is an issue. Lot's of kids, but pool so huge usually not a problem. No kids? Do your research again. Want a romantic solitude? Then this is probably not your taste, but we like it lively. And, don't forget, walk down the beach past Sandos and you've got essentially magnificant unspoiled beach. Been to a resort on Riviera Maya with rocky beaches? Not this one. Absolutely no rocks under your feet whatsoever. You can walk out 500 Ft. and be in crystal clear waist high water with sand that feels like you walking on cotton. Heard about the \"whales\"? These are permanent sandbags (large black) that look like whales which are there to prevent erosion and create great shallow pools for kids and adults alike. Kids seem to congregate on them, but not an issue for us. I liked pulling my beach chair right down into the water, If you like a submerged lounge chair in the pool you will not find those here like at the Moon Palace. Minor CON: Each person gets towel card and can trade in your towel as many times a day as you want. However, you can only get one towel per card. We always ended the day with a clean towel to take to the room for the next morning. And here's the deal: You will find notices about NOT RESERVING Palapas and chairs at the pool or on the beach in your check in packet. These notices state that reserving these is strictly prohibited, however NO ONE, I REPEAT NO ONE followed this notice. Although there was usually an abundance of chairs and palapas for shade if you were out early in morning we wanted to be assured of a great spot. I recommend taking a beach towel for each person from home if this important to you for reserving your favorite spot. I would get up each morning and reserve a spot on the beach and at the pool. We did morning pool time and after lunch beach time. Everyone did this without hesitation so don't get left out in the sun without a shady spot unless you want to. If you are a raft lounger, take one if your luggage limit can handle the weight. If not the gift shop has them and they are a little pricey, but of great quality. Don't bother to blow them up yourself. Take the raft to the dive hut and they will blow them with no problem. Quick and easy. Water aerobics every morning and afternoon. Pool games every lunch time. Outdoor ping-pong if your inclined. Check out the star friends board daily for activities and nightly entertainment. Note: If you are a swim-up bar person you won't find one in the main pool. You will find a seperate lagoon, grotto pool which is much nicer than being in the large pool. Pool by the way is located close to the jungle paths so you don't get that great breeze you find on the beach. Pool was extremely warm temperature, but okay on a raft during the mornings. There is also a sports pool (older, but nice), noticed some water polo one day. Monkeys are always up in the trees by the sports pool in the morning. Walk the path by the sports pool through the jungle to the Quetzal side for monkey pictures. Animals: Everywhere! You'll be amazed! Birds, tortoises, monkeys, parrots, toucans, flamingos, you name it! Lobbies gorgeous for sitting around, cocktails. Theatre shows much more entertaining than at some bigger properties. Live music for dancing one night. And of course, the DISCO if you're into that scene. We were more into live music in Playa del Carmen at night! And boy, did we find music. Everything from fabulous acoustic, live rock, and some of the best authentic Cuban Salsa live we could imagine. The club scene is Playa is also amazing. We found it to be much more fun, eclectic and diverse than in the states. Must be the European entreprenuer influence and influx into this great area. My husband who is a musician was invited to sit in with a group in a small beach club on Juarez and 5th Avenue and we had a fantastic time. Shopping: Very good! Lot's of touristy stuff, but also lots of high shops and boutiques, too. Found very good deals on jewelry at Quarzo Jewelry in the Playacar Plaza 4 blocks from our hotel. ( See Francisco) Reputable, and great prices if you negotiate in the morning and go back in the afternoon you'll get an even better price. Tell them you'll think about it, have them hold the pieces you like and go back in the afternoon and renegotiate. We bought topaz, opal and diamond pieces. Other TIP: The hotel does not really negotiate on Room Upgrades so don't expect it. The Oceanfront Suites are limited and sought after. If you didn't book one you won't get one without paying full price at the desk IF there's anything availalble. I sent a letter to resort in advance requesting which floor I wanted to be one in our suite and got exactly what I wanted. I did however translate the letter to spanish before I emailed it and did it well in advance. If you book through Apple Vacations they run a a non-stop flight daily from St. Louis and a return flight daily to St. Louis. It is only two hours and 42 minutes such a deal. If your schedule permits try and arrive mid week instead of Friday, Sat or Sun. You'll get better rooms, have a no hassle check-in and check out. No video check out! Are you a Golfer? Playacar (you are in it) has a Robert Trent Jones course ( 2 minutes wasy) which is great! Book a round in advance through Apple for $99 . Wait til you are there and it will be $180. Why book through Apple? 1. The non-stop flights. 2. Flight convenience. (every day) 3. Package includes flight, tranfers to and from airport, and right now MEXICO is unbelieveably cheap for what you get! TIP: Pay extra $30/per person for a non-stop transfer and you'll get to your hotel quicker. The airport is only 30 miles from Playacar, so go non-stop and you will be taken straight to your resort without stopping to drop off other people at other resorts. It's worth it! Wow, this has been a diatribe but I hope very helpful. I am a planner and it helps to know the nuances. You'll spend more quality vacation time and end up in the best place in Mexico. Check out my property map and some pics. You'll get an idea of the property lay out and where the Oceanfront Suites are. Enjoy your trip!

While we have traveled a lot, this is the fist time we've done an all-inclusive. We loved it. I do think it's a better hotel if this is more of a family trip and isn't where I'd pick for a honeymoon -- I think it's great for families / groups. Here are some specifics: Hotel property: It is a beautiful resort, particularly with the rainforest / jungle that runs through the middle of it. It was a welcome break to walk through that cool area in the middle of the day and it provided endless entertainment for our son to look for animals. The pool was huge, clean and very nice. It had 2 zero entry sides which was great for our son and a shallow kids pool -- although it felt more like a hot tub. The pool did not have any particular 'play' areas for little kids (i.e. fountains, slides, etc.) but was fun. It is clear that this isn't the newest resort and hasn't been remodeled but it's only in certain areas -- i.e. the bathrooms by the pool are in major need of a renovation but in general that is the exception. Rooms: I highly recommend spending the extra couple hundred dollars and upgrading to the ocean-front room. It is a bit roomier than the standard rooms, even though the room is still pretty small. But the key is that it is pretty much on the beach. This is particular important to us since the incredibly hot sun wore our son out heavily and he needed long naps inside the A/C-- and we could sit on the patio and were basically on the beach. I could hop over the railing, walk over 6 feet of grass, and were on the sand. My biggest criticism is that the beds are very uncomfortable because they are mattresses laid on top of concrete -- so they are incredibly hard. The overall condition of the rooms are good -- I do think they need some basic upgrading on things like worn our door frames, some bathroom fixtures, etc. Just a little bit of aging showing. Service: We ran into nothing but great employees there. Everyone was helpful and did whatever we asked to make our stay enjoyable. All employees except house-keeping spoke English and most seemed to know several other languages. We met some exceptional people such as Francisco, a server in the buffet, who went out of their way to help us and is the thing that my son says he misses the most about Mexico-- on the last day he asked if Francisco could come home with us!! Our son is an extremely outgoing and talkative kid and he would strike up strange 3-year old conversations with staff and they would always talk with him, give him high fives, and laugh right along with him. Related to tipping, it is technically included but I recommend brining a bunch of $5 bills and giving some to those people who go out of there way during your stay. It meant a lot when we did that for a few people on our last day. Food / drink: The buffets were very good and more than met our needs for breakfast and lunch. Huge selections and good quality. For dinner, we only had one guaranteed sit down reservation due to being there 4 nights. But, even though the resort was pretty full, we were able to do a sit down every night be doing reservations that day. We ate the first two nights at the steak place (it was average and would be my last choice), the Mexican place (fantastic, our best dining experience due to good food, great people, and it was air conditioned!!) and the Japanese steak house (also very good and a lot of fun, although not any different than a similar place you'd find in the US). On the drinks side, there were plenty of bars with whatever you wanted. I'd agree with all the reviews that you need to expect pretty poor quality alcohol at most of the bars. But in the better restaurants, for example, the drinks taste a bit higher quality again. Beach: This was the only slight disappointment. The area was very clean, the sand clear, lots of chairs and shade. The downside was that the water was pretty rough. We've been to Aruba and St. Maarten and those beaches were much better. We could play around a bit in the water with our son but not as much as we would've liked because the water was rough. Red flags up for much of the day, occasionally switched to yellow. If you are looking for a perfect and calm beach, I would not come here. But if you are OK with a bit rougher but beautiful and well maintained, this is fine. Location: Be prepared to sweat constantly if you go in the summer, it is hot and humid. (Particularly if you are coming from Denver with 30% humidity). But that was not a surprise. Although we didn't venture of the property much, we felt incredibly safe in Playa -- it is a gated town with very controlled access. So I had absolutely no security concerns and wouldn't have thought twice about walking down the street there. We booked through Apple and the experience was good -- transfers were good (although the return was poorly scheduled). Overall, a great experience that I would recommend. The only real downsides are the beds and beach to my earlier points.", "Date": "July 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canterbury, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cIncredible!\u201d", "Author": "TractorBoy101", "ReviewID": "UR36183325", "Content": "This is the best hotel I have stayed in.

My husband and I have stayed at two all-inclusive adult resorts before (both being more expensive than the Tucan and one also located in PDC) and had regrettable experiences at both. Naturally we were a little apprehensive about another all-inclusive resort but thought we would take a shot since the price was so good. I can honestly say that the Tucan exceeded our expectations and was a MUCH better than the other two resorts. Here is my review: Service \u2013 Fantastic! All employees were so friendly and helpful which in turn made our trip more enjoyable. Tipping isn\u2019t expected, however, we found ourselves tipping quite often because we were so pleased with the service. Food \u2013 Dinner: We were able to make five dinner reservations at the a la carte restaurants for our one week stay. We ate at both the Japanese and Steak twice which were both delicious and the Italian once which was only OK. We decided against the Mexican restaurant based on what we heard from others. The remaining two nights we ate at the dinner buffet which unfortunately wasn\u2019t impressing. The selection was large however the food didn\u2019t seem to taste good. Breakfast: We ate every morning at the breakfast buffet. The selection was large and the food was good. Lunch: We were off the property during the day three days of our trip and ate lunch at local restaurants which were fantastic. The remaining four days we ate lunch at the grill out by the pool. The selection wasn\u2019t bad and the food was good. No complaints. I loved that ice cream was offered most of the day everyday by the pool. I made numerous visits to the ice cream man each day! Pool and Beach \u2013 The pool is very large and beautiful. The water is a little warmer than I expected but no big deal. The beach is great despite the \u201cwhales\u201d. The sandbags really didn\u2019t bother me much but I could see how they could be an eyesore. There is only one resort to the south of the Tucan so if you walk past it (only takes minutes), you will get to a part of the beach that is quiet and has no sandbags. We walked down there one day and got some wonderful photos. There are plenty of chairs at the pool and beach and we never had trouble finding one. We didn\u2019t even have to get up early to get them. I know the hotel wasn\u2019t at 100% occupancy so maybe that is why. Room and Resort \u2013 We were in building 13 with a jungle/pool view. Our room was perfect because our building was almost in the middle of the resort which was convenient because we never had long walks to get anywhere. The rooms look like they could use some updating but were clean and sufficient so it wasn\u2019t a big deal. As everyone else has mentioned, the resort is beautiful, the grounds are lush, and the animals are quite a treat to see. Alcohol \u2013 We found that the lobby bar was better than the outside bars. You do have to ask for their better liquor in your drinks as they automatically go for the cheapest stuff. We noticed they offer certain liquor in the drink menus but when you ask for it they say they don\u2019t have it (ex. Don Julio tequila). Entertainment \u2013 The Star Friends amaze me. They work 15 hour days and always have a smile on their face. They have many fun activities planned during the day and have shows every night. We made it to a few of the shows but always late because we usually had dinner reservations at 9 and the shows start at 9:30. The shows may be a little cheesy but entertaining nonetheless. We made it to the disco on the last night and I liked it. I kind of wish we went sooner so we could enjoy it more. All in all, each of us had a fantastic time and very pleased we chose the Tucan.

There were a total of eight in our family, ages ranging from 5 months old to 54 years old. We booked through our travel agency at Iberostar Quetzal, but requested the Tucan side and a higher and closer to the beach room if available. Upon checking in at the reception desk, we were greeted appropriately. Checking in was fairly easy, as there were no lines. The clerk advised us that we were book on the Tucan side, two buildings from the beach. That was a definite plus. While we were being checked in, another member of the staff brought orange drinks to us, and served us all. From the reception desk, a bell boy put all off our luggage in a golf cart, and transported us to our room. Our room was nice, the beds very hard, but ended up sleeping very well. We requested a crib prior to check in, and we had to call twice in order to get the crib to our room. When the staff member brought the crib, he set it up for us, along with lining the crib with the sheets. The pools were very nice, not too crowded. Watch your kids during the water sports as at times, our kids were dunked by older kids and adults trying to play. The beach was nice as well, however several women topless sunbathing. The water at the beach was great. however there were several whales (sand bags) approximately 20 -30 feet out if not closer. There were always activities going on, and the staff was very friendly. It's amazing the amout of time that staff puts in a day to make sure you have an enjoyable and memorable stay. The food was good, there were a total of three buffets. Two larges ones (cozumel and tulum), and one smaller one (la palapa). About day three the food started getting old, but by then it was time for the A la carte restaurants. We had two A la carte restaurants, La Gondola, and La Marimba. Both were good, but not great. I would have almost rather ate at the buffets. The drinks at the resorts were o.k., nothing spectacular. Our young children liked the non-alcoholic drinks (pina colada), however make sure you try them before they drink them. On more than one occasion, my children ending up having alcohol in their drink. The nightly entertainment was very good, and very enjoyable. Like I said earlier, the staff does the best, to make sure you have an enjoyable experience. We rented a cab a couple times to go to Playa Del Carmen, 5 bucks each ways, cheap enough. This resort has privileges with Iberostar Del Mar, and Iberostar Cozumel. We took the boat to Cozumel, transportation extra, and stayed at Iberostar Cozumel for the day. By far Iberostar Tucan/Quetzal is better than Cozumel, and cheaper. The landscape, nature, and wildlife at Tucan/Quetzal was also a treat and an experience. Many iguanas, tailless squirrel types animals, monkeys, birds, and more at the resort, a definite treat. Watch out for the mosquitos as they bit my wife up pretty good, and still has the marks to show for it. Make sure to take bug spray. Some of the amenities at the resort include snorkeling, kayaking, sailing. We took out the kayaks a couple of times, and had a good time. You can rent them for free an hour a day. Our room was cleaned and stocked daily. Houskeeping was very friendly, and very attentive. They definitely deserve a tip. Towel art was left daily for us.

The pool water is very warm but that makes it nice if you travel with smaller children. Please make sure you get a towel card as well for your children at time of check in because we had a small issue with that and they almost made us pay for a new towel card.

We have traveled to Mexico six times, the last three years in June to Sandos Playacar(right next to the Tucan), Grand Rivera Princess and now the Iberostar Tucan. I will not spend the review comparing all the resorts, but it did give us some perspective on what to expect. We chose the Tucan because of its high rating on Trip Advisor, its reputation for good service and especially the wildlife. We also received a very good price on a resort of this quality. It appears this is a very popular resort and since there have been so many reviews, I will try to highlight our experience. We were unsure until a week before that the Tucan would reopen. - it did on June 1 and its sister resort, the Quetzal, opened on June 8. We were told that the resorts were about 60% full when we were there. We had e-mailed the resort ahead of time to request our dinner reservations and a specific room location.(We were celebrating a special occasion). The person who responded to our e-mails was very friendly and courteous. However, they do not seem to do anything special for birthdays and anniversaries. Room: Unfortunately, we were not able to get the room we requested. Considering the resort was only 60% full , I was very surprised that they could not accommodate us. We wanted to be in building 14 with a view of the inside of the resort, which is closest to the wildlife. We ended up in building 12, top floor on the corner, with a view of Sandos Playacar (and a very limited ocean view from the balcony). The room turned out to be very quiet and a convenient location. We probably could have moved, but once you are in the room with a child, it seems less taxing to move. We were also told that Buildings 15, 16 and 17 were non-smoking buildings, which we prefer. However, they are closest to the main area and tend to be noisier. We met another couple that was in Building 14 and did not even request it - seems odd! We did not drink much from the mini-bar; but except for the bottled water (which the maid put in), it was not replenished unless we asked. We gave a tip to the maid everyday, thought the room was cleaned very well and had a new towel animal each day! Restaurants: The resort was able to give us the reservations to the alacarte restaurants we requested: Japanese, Italian and Steakhouse : thought the food was good at all the restaurants, but the chef we had at the Japanese did not put on any \"show\": it appeared at other tables they may have. My daughter found something to eat at all the alacartes .You are allowed 3 alacartes for a seven night stay and could get more if available. We did not eat at the Mexican restaurant and the Caribbean restaurant was closed all week. We were a little disappointed in the buffets. I realize food is very subjective, and even though the buffet food was good, it was very repetitive. The Quetzal buffet did not open until June 13 - the day before we left. We were wondering if the selection was limited due to the limited capacity. They did however have great ice cream in the restaurants and by the pool. Drinks: Our family drinks very little alcohol, so i cannot comment too much on their drinks. However, we like to have non-alcoholic drinks like strawberry daiquiris, etc. The mix for this particular drink was not very good and we could not get a lime daiquiri - which we could at other resorts. We thought the selection was a little limited. Activities: We were very pleased with the activities and the activities staff. The Star Friends do a great job and are very friendly and hard working( they told me the had about 20-25 staff when we were there compared to normal of 50-55 : seemed to be no problem). They have a list of daily activities near the pool and the front of the resort. Archery, bike tours, air rifle, horseshoes, bocce ball, etc. We only watched a few nightly shows, but the ones we chose were fun. Beach: The beach has been talked about a lot, sand whales, etc. We thought the beach was very good, with the sand whales making some quiet inlets( we met someone that had just spent 4 days at the Iberostar Maya/Lindo and said the beach complex was better at the Tucan). The beach had a yellow flag all week we were there and did not try the water sports (except walking past the Sandos to an open beach to snorkel - did not see much, however). Kids Club: My daughter loved the kid's club. Maricella, the lady in charge was great. They had many fun activities. They had a kids \"show\" - games, dancing, etc. - every night at 8:00 pm. It also helped that there were kids my daughter's age in the club : Wendy says high to Mckayla and her family from Utah! Excursions: We did not go on any this time - my wife and daughter got a little too much sun early in the week! Recommend that you go to the small shopping center (Playacar Plaza) which is a five minute walk from the resort. Hair braiding is half the price of the resort and you can pick up some souvenirs. Vendors came in to the resort on three different nights. Wildlife: This is an area we were not disappointed! The best viewing time was near dusk, when we walked to the restaurants from our room. We really wanted to see the monkeys and we saw them on 5 different nights - the last night we were there we saw a family of monkeys in a tree howling at other monkeys on the buildings : FASCINATING. There were peacocks, chickens, agoutis, pheasant, flamingos, tortoises,possums, toucans etc. - a few were in cages around the resort. This is where the Tucan stands alone! Overall, based on the Trip Advisor ranking, maybe our expectations were a little high. This resort seems to have a very high amount of repeat business (met a man who had been there nine times!). We enjoyed the lower capacity, but are not sure if we would return when running at full capacity. Certain areas (especially the bars) maybe would be stretched.

(The birds were pretty funny too!) We went to the Italian, Mexican and Japanese all were great and catered well for vegetarians. The buffet was also good... especially the ice cream! Loved the beach and pool, there were always heaps of sun beds available. Some people do go down at 6am to reserve places which was funny! It was good that it was nearly the last hotel as it was the best part of the beach. Plaza playacar was a 5 min walk away with minimart, shops, pharmacy, bank and starbucks! There were also people doing tours/day trips quite a bit cheaper than the hotel/holiday reps. We did go into playa del carmen which was a bit full on...everyone trying to get you into their shops/resturants etc. There was also a small department store there called 'Liverpool'!

A+ resort\u201d", "Author": "jessiparrett", "ReviewID": "UR34402180", "Content": "We booked with beachdestinations hotel/air/transfers for $1600. This trip was so worth the money. The Room - We arrived late and were put into a room in Tucan. Very clean, and accomodating. After walking around the property we decided to upgrade 6 nights to Ocean front suite. (50% off deal =$200). We loved our new room. It was directly off the ocean and had beautiful views. The rooms are very spacious and clean. Bathroom has a big shower with double shower heads, fun to shower with your other after swimming all day. We left a small tip for housekeeping everyday, and our room was always taken care of. mini bar filled. towels/etc stocked. No complaints! The pool - was huge, and warm. we are beach people, so we never understand the \"pool\". But it was always crowded more then the beach. We would swim in the ocean till 6. then relax for an hour in pool, shower and head off to dinner. The Beach - is amazing. we loved the beach here. At first we thought the big sandbags in the pictures would be awful, but they ended up being some of our funniest moments. They are there to protect the beach from rough currents and beach erosion...well they have a algea covering which makes the big bag like a slip and slide, we loved playing on this in the waves. We are big beach people. There were always chairs and palapas available. There is a lovely girl that comes around to serve you drinks. Give her a small tip and she will take care of you all day. The water is warm. We walked down the entire hotel coast line, and in our opinion Iberostar had one of the nicest and fun beaches. There is beach volleyball. We tried to kayak everyday, but they kept putting a red flag up, due to clouds....this was annoying but i guess one drunk in the ocean can mess it up for everyone. We rented jetskis and had a blast. The grounds - Iberostar has done an amazing job with the design of this resort. It is encompassed by natural jungle surroundings. You walk down little paths surrounded with nature to get everywhere. This also keeps your journeys a lil more private. The resort has a gang of howler monkey's, which are so much fun to watch.., iguanas, these wierd rodent things, tucans, peacocks, etc...just stunning. There are beautiful lush trees, a waterfall. Both sides of the resort are different, make sure you venture all around. You never know where the animals are hanging out. Decorations were very nice. very asian teak, meets caribbean modern.. As a designer i loved it! They are always cleaning everywhere. Iberostar has doe=ne a great job with the staff they hired and maintaining their lovely resort. The food- ok the buffets were average. We were not thrilled at all. But my boyfriend and i didnt really care. We ate enough to be healthy and thats it. There is a snack buffet by the beach, that we would snack off of all day. fresh veggies and fruits..etc. The room service has GREAT nuggets de pollo:) i ordered chicken nuggets for breakfast a couple time. As for dinner, this is where we put all of our excitement into...The reservations. You only get 2 with a 6 night stay, but just keep asking for more they will work with you. I actually made 2 reservations in the Quetzal reception, and 2 in the Tucan reception. Dont know where the disconnect for them was, but we got 4 reservations this way:) The Italian was our favorite! and not the noodles....order LOCAL fare, this is the best way to eat great. The red snapper, the grouper, the shrimp, all amazing. Everything about the restaraunt, the appitizers the desserts, the service, was top notch. we ate here twice!. The japanese was great. We tried octopus and the teppinyaki tables are really fun with other people. The mexican was great too. very gourmet style. We didnt eat at the steakhouse. You will be pleased. The drinks - the alcohol varies from bar to bar. The top shelf brands are in the two lobby bars. we would go here for a drink b4 dinner. The wines in the restaraunts are very nice, and im a wine snob. The beach bar is not great. but they are funny and quick. but their tequila sucks. We drank a lot of beer from them tho. If you are at the beach, walk into the Buffet palapa, which is very close to beach too, and have them make you margaritas. Jesus makes the best on the whole resort. And this bar has top shelf also. We like to drink all day, so you need the better alcohols for that! ahhah The entertainment - they do a great job putting stuff together. the shows were lame for me, but i live in LA. ive seen this all b4. but the beach activities are where its at. They actually made paella on the beach, and it was so good. i helped them cook it too. very fun to watch! The club was a bit young, im 28...but i still danced all night and the drinks are good in here too. The staff - the are there to cater and please and they do. they are just so happy to have you there esp. after the swine flu scare.... anything and everything i asked for was taken care of and promptly, no matter what it was. Overall we had a great trip! My boyfriend broke his foot on the first day there, so we really had to take it slow...whch in turn was spending a lot of time on the resort. We were very happy with our experience. And honestly I still cant believe how cheap it was. Some advice: tip! a dollar here and there, goes a long way in service. Use the safe in your room...we locked up everything valuable everyday. no excuses for anything happening then. Buy a cheap raft to use at the beach, we did this and were so happy. otherwise they sell them there for $15. Quetzal and Tucan are the same resort. there are two sides of rooms/buildings, with 2 seperate lobby's, but the middle is cut through by all the restaurants, nature, entertainment, and meets together again at the beach. Book whichever is cheaper. Upgrade to ocean view. We chose this instead of an excursion and we were so happy to have a suite. The quetzal ocean suits were better becaus ethere was nothing obstructing our view. Tucan has a lot of palm trees on their ocean suits view. I say this because we had 2 days of rain and storms, and it was so nice, oredreing room service and sitting on the balcony watching the storm move over the ocean from cozumel in. We had a great experience. If you are not looking \"hoity toity\" luxury, youll love this place. It nice, chill ,clean, the best i have ever gotten for my money in mexico!", "Date": "July 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chilton", "Title": "\u201cAlas, the birds in the eating areas let down Iberostar's normal high standards\u201d", "Author": "SilverSChilton", "ReviewID": "UR34240335", "Content": "We were a family of 8 aged 11 to 80 and returned at the end of June after a 15 night stay.The hotel and it's sister hotel the Iberostar Quetzal are spacious with a number of very pleasent bars , restaurants and lounge areas. The hotels are located on the beach front and have very nice themed grounds/gardens with a variety of wildlife including wild monkeys, flamingos, swans, peacocks and other exotic birds. There are numerous ponds with fountains that are stocked with large carp. The food quality and variety stocked in the buffet and speciality Italian and Steak restaurants was very good whilst the the food and experience in the Japanese restaurant was excellent and not to be missed. The Mexican restaurant experience was ok. The quality of the all-inclusive drinks served in the bars and restaurant was ok to good. The beach with it's white sand was very nice despite the 'sand whales' constructed to prevent sand erosion. It was kept very clean and was complemented by the warm turquoise blue sea. However, as reported by others , there is no inshore reef and snorkelling is a waste of time. Even so, good snorkelling nearby can be reached by boat from the Dressel Dive Centre located at the hotel. The hotel staff were great. They were friendly and worked hard to provide an excellent service. Special recognition to Elsie in the Tucan Lobby Bar who was so attentive and soon knew what everyone was drinking. The star Friends worked hard day and night and two of the shows we watched (Boogy Nights & Iberogrammy) were very good. The supporting six piece band and singers were also good. Special mention also of the young man providing the towel service by the pool. He was so friendly and polite and always enthusiastically promoting the evenings entertainment. He was so pleased to be selected to take part in a show. As reported previously on Tripadvisor, the beds are hard. However, mattress toppers can be reqested at Reception and result in softer bed. The only criticism we have is the blackbirds/crows in all the open restaurants. These birds were continuously flying overhead during daylight hours and feeding at food stations and tables if left unattended. This is an unacceptable health hazard as there were bird droppings on tables, food stations and the back of chairs. I understand that the Iberostar Cozumel recently overcame the same problem by installing netting around restaurants to keep the birds out. Finally, there are many attractions in the area and I recommend a visit to Xel-Ha (the included buffet was good) and the Maya ruins at Chichen Itza which are spectacular. However, it is a long journey to Chichen Itza through uninteresting terrain and the excursion we went on stopped on the way at a small Cenote for snorkelling. We were not impressed by this experience. One other thing, Swine flu! We heard of no cases in the area. However, spare a thought for the Hotel staff as the they received no wages when the hotel closed for a month due to the Swine Flu outbreak.", "Date": "July 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lux", "Title": "\u201cWonderful hotel\u201d", "Author": "FlyingErwann", "ReviewID": "UR34057735", "Content": "We arrived after an ectic journey from Europe ( flight delayed, connection missed in Mexico city , kids exhausted !!! ) at 1am at the hotel .

The staff were fanastic - special mention goes to the towel boy Maurcio who was brilliant and always smiling and happy. But all the entertainment team worked really hard to get you to join in with activiites and then they put a show on in the evening - not quite sure where they get the energy from! The beach was really nice and clean with the most brilliant blue sea. The jungle down to the beach was great and the animals really interesting. The nightclub was good and also airconditioned which was nice - we only discovered it on the last night which was a shame. There isn't any snorkelling there which was a shame as that was something that we wanted to do but we did a trip with the dive school which was quite good. We used the dive school there and although they were good they were expensive US$74 per dive. Some people we talked to went to Player Del Carmen for thier diving and got 2 dives for $60US. We did a trip to Xia Ha and swam with the dolphins which was a fantastic day out - highly recommended. Trip the the Mayan ruins at Chichen itza which was not good - we stopped on route (its about a 3hour drive to the ruin) a couple of times for things like shopping which wasn't worth it. I recommend you hire a car and drive yourself there. Once there its quite impressive - remember lots of water as its really really hot there over 40degrees. Remember mossie spray and take it to Xia Ha as I got bitten dreadfully there.

We had wanted to stay at this resort all along for two reasons, firstly we had stayed at Iberostar resorts in both Cuba and Brazil so knew the concept and were previously very impressed with everything about the chain. Second reason was the nature and animals within the hotel grounds. On arrival there were only about 100 guests in the whole resort. The resort had been open 2 days and was operating a skeleton staff. Although this meant that the initial few days had limited offerings at the buffet and only one al a carte open at a time, as the days progressed the hotel began to see more guests arrive and more normal services resumed. The Quetzal side opened at the beginning of the second week but to be fair we were not missing out on anything as the buffet and lobby bar at the quetzal are a complete mirror of the tucan side with the same food and drink offerings, no better or worse. We did speak to guests who had been to the toucan on previous trips and they confirmed that the lack of choice and entertainment was down to the hotel operating at low occupancy. There was a band in the main entertainment venue the last couple of days but apparently on a normal run they are there every night. The fact that this hotel does have a lot of repeat visitors is testament to its quality and that people want to return. Room Our room was in block 15 and was a jungle facing room. The animals on some mornings will kick off at 6 am and really do make the loudest noises. Although this was quite annoying I had to remind myself that I chose this hotel for the animals and that was part of it. Not sure if the jungle room location was a factor but we got savaged by mosquito bites every night. We asked reception to spray our room a couple of times but this didn't really do anything so would recommend getting the strongest repellent available and literally bathing in it at night. Having stayed at previous newer Iberostars it was clear that this one is older and in need of a refurb. Don't get me wrong, its perfectly adequate and comfortable ( we had no complaints about the hardness of the bed but would agree its quite firm ) but I think they need to think about a lick of paint and new door frames in the near future. Food Food in the buffets very good with something for every one. Only grumble here is that they offer something being available at all hours and this comes in handy if you decide to have a late night and go to the club and get 2am munchies on the way home. Previous Iberostars we stayed at had a member of staff in the buffet cooking burgers and hot dogs fresh for the late nighters. Here they just had left overs from the buffet. As drunk and hungry as I was I didn't fancy eating food that had clearly been out for over 4 hours. They still had a member of staff in there so why not have someone cooking burgers to order. Maybe this was another downside to the lack of guests. The al a cartes were all very good. We ate at Japanese twice, Italian twice, steakhouse once and Mexican twice. No problem getting bookings but I guess this was a plus side to it not being busy. The girls on the customer services desk were very good and happy to accommodate. I would say particularly Wendy Martinez who was very helpful. We ventured out to eat at El Fogins as recommended on trip advisor and it was great and definetly worth it to experience proper local cuisine. Check out the reviews here on TA under the restaurants in Playa del carmen. Hotel grounds Amazing. Beautifully kept gardens and what really makes this hotel special is the monkeys, peacocks, iguanas, agouti's, flamingos and dozens of other birds and animals roaming around. If you do get woke up at 6 am then this is a great time to get up and go for a walk as you see so much more early mornings. The pool is a great size. There is a swim up bar pool but didn't go in this. It does irritate me the people who cant seem to spend 3 minutes without a drink in there hand and walk around the pool with a margarita in there mitts. I wouldn't have a problem if it wasn't for the fact that these people are clearly idiots who slosh and spill strawberry daiquiris in the water. I don't want to swim around in dregs thanks, if you want to do that go to the pool bar. I even saw some idiot smoking in the pool and flicking his ash in the water. Beach Sand whales, anyone who has researched this area and this hotel will know that they are there and why they are there. They are not pretty but don't spoil the beach as some have suggested. Despite the huge signs of the dangers of playing on these things expect to see parents let there little angels jump up and down on them all day long until they fall and crack there heads open. These are generally the same ones who are smoking in the pool. The lack of rational thought astonishes me at times. Sea can be very dangerous here with strong under currents that leave you fighting to get back in even if you are a strong swimmer. They operate the flag system, green flag is good conditions, yellow is exercise caution where as red is not recommended to go in the water. A short walk right takes you past the last hotel and there are some small rocks, just past these you will see some fish if you take a snorkel. Take some bread from the buffet to feed the fish if you go. Be very careful of when you swim here as the sea is very rough and the coral is in the shallow so if a wave crashes in it can throw you up against sharp rocks. This happened to me on a yellow flag day and luckily I got off lightly with a cut foot but could have been worse, very sharp coral so just be careful please if you do go. Trips Shop around. Your tour operator will have them and the Iberotour shop in the lobby is a good one too but an example of shopping around is we did Xel Ha for $95 per person where the thomas cook wanted $119 for the same trip so we saved $50 but also as we were the only people booked that day the Iberotour didn't let us down and cancel but instead we still went but had a mini van and driver all to ourselves. We did book another tour with TC which worked out cheaper but we were the first pick up of 5 hotels and the last drop which added two hours traveling to the day and more time for us sat on a bus. There were only two of us but if you are in a group of four then a taxi may be an option. Ask at guest services and they will give you a list of taxi prices but be aware that this list is slightly out of date so check with the driver before you depart on the price. You can also use the collectivo service and ado buses, check out the forum for details and advice on these methods of transport. Playa Del carmen Turn right out the front hotel and 10 minutes walk is a small shopping plaza with a bank that has two ATMs and a pharmacy and few other stores. Playa del carmen main town is a 40 minute walk in the same direction past the plaza but there are some ruins on the way to stop and enjoy. If you enjoy a nice walk in the sun then do it and remember to take some water with you, if not $5 or 50 pesos in a cab will get you there in 5 minutes. Plenty of taxis to flag down on the way too if you start the walk and then think twice half way there. Its basically 2 long main roads of souvenir shops and tourist traps restaurants and bars. Worth going there but you do get pestered a lot so depends on your tolerance for the hard sell. Xcaret We went to Xcaret which is a good day out but we were disappointed with the snorkeling as there were hardly any fish until right at the end of the caves just as you are about to get out of the water. Lots of other things to see and do though and make sure you watch the flying man ritual if you can and listening to the talk about the traditions. you can get entrance for $65 or $95 dollars will include buffet lunch of traditional Mexican cuisine and two soft drinks plus towels, lockers and snorkel equipment. If you don't plan on eating or snorkeling then the cheaper option would do you but I suspect most people will go for the $95 package as we did. You can book this tour within the lobby or with your tour operator or alternatively as we did you can get a taxi and pay on the gate. Doing it alone actually works out more expensive as you pay the same gate price as the organised trip price plus taxi fair but the park is only 4km away from the hotel and 140 pesos in a taxi and by doing it this way you can go when you want and leave when you want. Coba and Tulum Great day. This was with TC for $65 pp we went to chichen itza 5 years ago and really enjoyed it but never got around to Tulum so were keen to do this and also see Coba. Great day out. Only downside was the 5 pick up journey that led to a longer day on the bus and also no lunch included. Make sure you have money for food and change for the tuk tuk bike back as its a long walk. I think it was 80 pesos. Ask the tour guide to stop at the croc jetty opposite the car park too. I had to make a special request for this but was well worth it. Two young lads charge 10 pesos to go out on there jetty over the lagoon and the crocs all swim over as the lads put chicken scraps on a stick. Great to see these animals in the wild. Make sure you take a swim suit as the TC rep didn't tell us and there was an opportunity to swim on the beach at the end of the day. In honesty I would rather had used this free time to carry on exploring the ruins but the day we went was so hot a dip would have been great. You take a small train to and from the site entrance to the ruins at Tulum and were the shops and restaurants are there is a shower block were for 20 pesos you can take a shower and get a towel. This was great after a really humid day and even if you do take a dip it will get all the salt water and sand off you for the journey back on the bus. Xel Ha We went here 5 years ago when visiting Cancun and very little has changed. Its beautiful and nice place to relax. Unlike Xcaret its all inclusive all day and the snorkeling is much better. I liked Xcaret for different reasons but I have to say that not people are disappointed with Xel ha. The food is excellent and the service was great. Take a little money to tip if you can. Akumel and Yal ku lagoon Did this one off our own back. Taxi was 300 pesos to Akumel beach. Get there early as you can as the boat trips turn up at about 9 and the turtles all swim off. Saw lots of turtles and were swimming with them in the wild. Fantastic day. Please make sure you buy the bio sun cream that doesn't harm the wildlife or coral. You can buy this at the dive shop at the beach for about 150 pesos. Take plenty of money as you will need to leave about 500 pesos deposit for the locker and snorkel gear. Once you have swam with the turtles take your gear and go to the main entrance for a taxi ride to Yal ku lagoon ( 80 pesos ) for more snorkeling then get a taxi back to return your kit and get your deposit. I was worried about the going it alone trips thinking what if theres no taxis there to come back, dont worry, plenty of taxis everywhere. Hotel staff and service Cant knock it. As mentioned, guest services staff particullar Wendy were excellent. Reception excelllent too. Bar staff and waiting staff all fantastic. You dont have to tip to get great service but if you can afford to please do especially the buffet staff as I think they get lefy out of the tip circles and some nights we just sat in the buffet enjoying drinks for a couple of hours while they were very attentive. Maids, gardeners, maintenence staff, all smiling and freindly and offering up an hola whenever they passed. Iberostar either employ great people or know how to train their staff or maybe both, either way all adds up to a great holiday environment. Star friends, loads of activitys to get involved with if you like, pool games, football ( soccer if you are Canadian or American ) vollyball , archery, air rifle shooting etc. They would come and ask you if you wanted to join in but were not pushy and didnt bother people if it was clear they just wanted to relax. The shows at night were not our cup of tea but I would say that they made a lot of people happy and the star friends put in lots of hard work. Luigi, Jonathan Raphael just some of the ones I had dealings with and were great as were all the other Star team. Ive gone on a bit but in summary it was a great part of Mexico and a great location and hotel with great service and great food and drinks. Couple of improvments could be made but I would recomend this hotel to anyone.

Wish only our flights got us there earlier & we left later. Had a blast in all aspects of our visit. Last year we were up in Cancun & decided to go South on Riviera Maya this time around. Neat to be closer to some of our purposefully self-guided tours of Tulum & Akumal. Amenities & service lived up to all expectations. Our week's weather was reportedly closer to August temp/humidity, rendering real-feel temps of 110F-119F. Made quick friends with Cesar & Diego at the swim-up bar. As reported in other reviews, the resort does stretch liquor in the remote bars. It's a good thing, since they are so efficient - uncut booze would have the guests in a stupor. We recommend only changing part of your currency to pesos if you plan to shop in Playa del Carmen. You get a much better exchange rate on merchandise. Additionally, if you negotiate fares with the taxis - they discount best on US$. When day-tripping, our decision to self-guide made a positive difference. By going very early in the AM to Tulum & Akumal, we beat the group tours & had both places to ourselves. Be assured that by 11AM, the heat in Summer rates high in taking the steam out of your motivation. Cab to PDC was $5, Collectivo for 4 to Tulum (135p)/Akumal (100p). We only did the Yal-Ku lagoon (100p/person entry + 100p/person gear). If you have scuba gear bring it, or rent from the dive shop at the hotel since it's better stuff than they have there. Two of our crew badly blistered from the swim fins & the mask hurt my head. In the town, there's a nice Artisan's shop where we got some neat stuff. I previously visited Zapotec ruins in Monte-Alban & Mitla (Oaxaca), so Tulum underwhelmed save the coastal setting's beauty. A rough surf put our beach plans to bed. They boast a mildly cheesy mercaso, my daughter got a good deal on a ring there. Back to the resort, no complaints on the food. With occupancy low, we dined ala cart on 4/5 nights at each of the 4 restaurants. Everyone had a different favorite, with no-one disappointed at any. The whales at the resort beach disrupt the scenery. We generally reside pool-side anyway, however it's well-worth a short walk South to check-out the undeveloped beach front past the Sand's resort. Teenage daughters 17 & 19 really enjoyed our trip. Playacar's gated seclusion makes for a safe/secure sense of the entrie area. The monkeys, iguanas, agouti, peacocks roam freely, while a couple tucans, turtles, flamingos & ducks spend their day's in zoo-like settings. My youngest really loved the wildlife.

Our daughters were both able to find foods they liked and tried new foods.

Take a taxi into Playa del Carmen and visit fifth avenue for shopping and local culture. My daughter broke her collarbone the day before we left for our trip and they were quite acommodating to her needs. They had a room service menu which she took advantage of when she was tired.

After it rains, there were masses of mosquitoes or moths that bit us-bring bug spray and bug bite medicine. There was one topless sun-bather on the beach but she was easy to avoid. The remote for the TV didn't work well but they quickly bought us another one. We were not disappointed in this hotel and would definitely return if given the opportunity!! If you are a person with a physical disability, this resort might be a challenge to navigate. The path to the pool and beach area is rocky and sloping and gets slippery when wet.

We chose this hotel for the jungle setting and the grounds do not disappoint but other things did. Rooms: we were given a room in block 16 facing the tennis court of the next door hotel, for the first few days we didn't care to much as we were concerned with the beach but after walking around we felt a bit cheated as other rooms faced the jungle and over looked the flammingos and monkeys so we asked to move. To our surprise they were happy to do this and we got moved for the last 3 nights to block 25 and on the first morning we sat there and watched the monkeys play meters away from us. The beds were fine, possibly americans sleep on softer beds (5/5 for jungle view room, 2/5 for other room). Food: buffets will always get boring but it was still fine. The setting of the Tucan restaurant was great and we always asked for a seat on the sides near a fountain and made it very pleasant. The steak restaurant wasn't great as the setting was poor and vegetables undercooked, the steak was thin but nicely cooked. The japanese was an ok change but average food. Another table was full of an extremely loud drunk group so it could have been worse if were put with them. We missed our last reservation but again the buffet setting made up for it with a cool breeze. (3/5) Entertainment: They put on this really lame interactive show everynight which feels more at home on a horrible caravan holiday park but it was always full and people were loving it. We did manage to sit through it one night and after the show at 1130 a quality salsa band come on and play 3-4 songs but no one stays!! my wife and I got up and danced by our selves and wanted them to play all night but absolutely no one else was interested. This says a lot about the people who stayed there. We did go up to playa del carmen and one night to a big beach concert at marmitas which was good. We should have gone to town everynight but we were on a budget. The disco was an average disco and not enjoyable especially after the salsa band . Next door on the south side there was a covers band rocking out everyday which sounding like a lot of fun (1/5 for main show, 5/5 for salsa band) Beach: The beach is the same at every resort and ok for a swim but if you walk south there is a constantly empty beach just because you don't get a lounge chair and drinks, definitely a nicer setting. My biggest gripe is that the dive center only lets you take the snorkling gear for an hour!!!! This isn't mentioned anywhere but the quite rude people there made sure they spelled it out. They expect you to stay in front of the hotel where you will see nothing but we walked along the empty beach and went around some rocks and found some small tropical beach. I was going to take our snorkel gear but didn't as the hotel said it was free so for this it gets (2/5) Pool: only used it once at 7am to do some laps, it was never very inviting and the pool side bar is seperate and full of large groups which made it feel unwelcoming. (2/5) General: I've realized our biggest problem is that coming from the UK we had to spend nearly 3-4 times that of the americans and expected a better class of resort/people there which you don't get. Think of it like an upmarket caravan/holiday park and you should be happy.

I thought the breakfast was great but the lunch and dinner buffet had too much of the same thing everyday. We always found something to eat but it became a bit repetitive. The beds were horribly hard and we requested egg crates on the beds which did help some but they were still very hard. The japanese restaurant was good but took way to long to eat, we had reservations at 9pm and were starving and we didn't eat till after 10pm. The mexican was ok but we are from Texas and the Mexican food wasn't as good as we have. It just ok! The desserts were good but seemed too bland. The beach was great and had plenty of chairs and cabanas everyday. We did encounter some people swimming in the water after dark and way too far out in the water to be safe. Too risky if you ask me its the ocean after all. When we arrived on June 3 the resort only had 150 people but by the time we left it was full.

Fourty five minutes were were in the lobby and checked in within a few minutes. The first room was in a great location but we requested 2 doubles and it was a king. No worries, a call to the front desk and the keys for the new room were up in under five minutes- fantastic service. which was repeated through out the trip. Food: Good to great most times for a family friendly AI. Reservations were easy to get as long as you had some flexiblitly. My wife was horrified when some less than \\haapy guest were so rude to the woman taking the reservations to the point that it was almost abusive. We ate at the Mexica, Japanese, and Italian. All were very good with no complaints. We at at the beach side buffet for some lunches, and all breakfasts andmost lunches at the main buffet. The kids loved the selection, especially the bearns every morning lol. The selection of fresh fruit juices was nice. I miss my fresh watermelon juice. Oh and the icecream man was a realy treat every afternoon. Drinks were good as well. Overall the food was more than we expected at an AI. Not quite up to the Royal but they are catering to people of all ages at the Tucan. Service: Great from waitstaff, housekeeping, and front desk. Room: Clean, spacious. Wished there were more places to unpack clothes into so we didnt have to live out of bags. Star Friends: All were amazing and really made the trip for us. Jose Gabriel, Sayid, Angel, Michael, Salvatore, and a few whos name escape me. Jose invited out daughters for lunch and they talked about that for weeks. The main reason that we will be returning next year. Can still here \"Hey baby.... and Dale Pa'lla...\" . Beach: Clean, big and more thn enough chairs. Most days red or yellow flags but always able to enjoy the sea. Pool: Huge, clean and never over crowded. Some fun games with the Star friends. Towel game in effect but not a problem for us early risers. Entertainment: Very nice for the whole family. Even had a night to enjoy in the disco with the girls who enjoyed it. Hit the late night snack bar afterwards to end that day. Volleyball twice a day, my wife took the morning bike ride and really enjoyed it. Grounds: Meticulously taken care of. Great for watching the animals. We were luck enough to see groups of monkeys on 3 separated occaisions (hope to get the videos up as well). The peacocks were hams and were showing off true to their nature. A few days the staff had monkey, a tucan and iguana and took pics with them which you could buy later. Overall: The resort was on par with most TA reviews. Its a matter of your expectations. Its a great family friendly AI with very good food and great food choices.

We had the better side of the 2 hotels (Quetzal) as on the Tucan side you get to have a walk through the jungle every day on your way to the pool/beach.

The beach was stunning, although we found it was a little too windy and rough for our liking. The best part of our holiday was the food. I am a very very fussy eater but I have never eaten so much on a holiday. You couldn\u2019t have had more selection. The breakfast was so yummy, everything single thing you could think of. Lunch was great too with the best burgers I have ever had and then dinner was even better with so much to choose from.

The Tucan and it's sister property the Quetzal, are on the southern end of the Playcar complex just south of the city (approximately 2-3 miles). The properties have a more natural feel to them with a small walk through the jungle between the lobby and pool/beach areas. Quick review: Pool/Beach: Very Good Three pools - a small kid pool, a small adult pool with walk up bar and a large winding pool. Nice beach but has large sand bags to prevent beach erosion. Food & Liquor: Good-Very good Each hotel has a main buffet for breakfast, lunch and dinner. A smaller buffet in the restaurants by the pool is also provided at each hotel for lunch. Good selections in the main buffets. Overall food quality is good, but not great. Five specialty restaurants are available. You have to make a reservation in the morning or later in the afternoon. We tried three of the specialty restaurants (steakhouse, tropical and italian). Overall quality of food is better than the buffets, but not gourmet by any means. We had a good filet in the steakhouse. Premium brand liquor is very limited at the pool bars and you have to ask for it. They hid it out of site, except in the lobby bars. The lobby bar has a beverage menu that lists what they carry and has a decent selection, some of which is not displayed. They will give you the good stuff, or make your drink stronger, but you have to ask for it. Facilities/Rooms: Good While the facilities show their age a bit, the staff does a good job of maintenance and cleaning. Nice lobby and lobby bar. Rooms are in separate three story buildings running the length of the complex. No elevators if that is an issue. Internet is available only in the lobby ($13/day for wireless) or their computer room at $3/15 minutes. Rooms were just average with basic amenities. Beds are very firm. Entertainment: Good Not a big selling point for us. They certainly make an effort and have plenty of activities. They have one main theatre in the center of the complex where they have a two nightly shows (one for kids and one for adults). Staff: Very good-excellent All the staff we encountered were pleasant and made every effort to make our stay enjoyable. We have found the Mexican people to be a warm and friendly people on all our trips to this region. This is our third trip to the Riviera Maya region. Our two previous trips we stayed at Secrets Capri and the Royal in Playa del Carmen. Both of these hotels were 5-star selections that we highly recommend.

While we have been to many Carribean all-inclusives, neither of us had been to Mexico. We did a lot of research and read a lot of reviews before picking Iberostar Tucan. I have to preface this review by specifying that we were there during Spring break week, so that may have contributed to some of the negative issues. When i was doing my research and looking at the location of the resort, most of the pictures made it look secluded, and when i read reviews that mentioned some of the animals on the resort, i envisioned a resort surrounded by nature. I did not expect that the resort was so close to other resorts, and that the wildlife was actually in a large courtyard in the center of the resort. At first i was disappointed by this, but quickly got over it. I found the monkeys, peacocks and big rodent creatures to be a lot of fun to watch. In addition, i loved how open and airy the resort is. It really is beautiful. The service was great - our check-in was wonderful. The service at the restraunts was pretty good and our room was kept very clean. No complaints regarding service. The beach was kind of annoying. If you did an excursion in the morning, or had a lazy breakfast, there was no way you were getting a spot on the beach. Especially one in the shade. I definitely saw many people leaving their stuff on their chairs all day. The water was pretty rough - you can't snorkle or anything like that. There was even a pretty strong undertoe. We saw a couple of lifeguard rescues of people who ventured out past the \"sandbags\". I overheard a lifeguard say that he had 5 rescues that day. I thought the food was fine. My husband and i are both vegetarians, and we were both able to find enough to eat every single day. The japanese restaraunt was fun and the food was good, and the italian was pretty good too. They had a huge selection on the buffet. When all else failed, we could get pasta, pizza, cheese quesadillas or french fries. There was always a great selection of fresh fruit as well. We booked three excursions through Olympus Tours - Chichen Itza, Tulum and swim with dolphins. Later, I noticed that the prices were cheaper if you book through the hotel. I would definitely recommend Tulum - it was the most beautiful place i have ever been to. Swim with dolphins was an excellent time as well. I would not recommend walking to 5th avenue without a good pair of shoes. It was a longer walk than we expected. I think my main complaint was that there were kids everywhere (again, it was spring break). Even when my husband and i were in our room, we could hear kids in other rooms screaming and crying - it really ruined the mood. Had i known that it was SO \"family friendly\", i think i would have paid the extra money for an adults only resort.

The property is very attractive and beautifully groomed. We found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. The buffet meals offer plenty of variety, and the food is tasty, but nothing special. We had several meals at the a la carte restaurants. I enjoyed the steak house best - the service and meal were excellent. My second favorite was the Italian-themed room. The kids enjoyed the cooking \"show\" at the Japanese restaurant, but the food was so-so. Several reviewers have commented on the quality of the beach. My brothers have visited this resort in years past, and remembered that the beach was much larger previously. There's been a lot of erosion, but the sand is excellent with virtually no rocks. On a few days, the waves were big enough for body-surfing, but this also meant that there were no water-sports available because of the surf. We enjoyed the wildlife on the resort, including howler monkeys, cranes, flamingos, tucans, agoutis. The evening shows were a hit with everyone in our group.

We considered the other hotels in the area, ie the RUI chain, but decided we would give the Iberostar Tucan another shot. Thank God we did, the standard had not dropped in any way.In other reviews they have listed all the things to do,my oberservations are of the little details that show the standards set, bed linen changed every day, towels changed everyday, table linen in good order, the ground staff continually cleaning the property. The food , which has been commented on, was again first class, the al'acartes were diverse eniugh for even the most picky of eaters.The entertainment was good, a little cheesy, but what do you want West End production numbers, the Star Friends performed well in my opinion, smiles on their faces, if you did not want to participate fine they left you alone.

Flight For Thomas Cook long haul airline - think Ryan Air. The space and service was okay but the in flight entertainment was the worst I have experienced since they introduced screens on the back of seats in the early 90s \u2013 Thomas Cook need a complete overhaul and re-think as even if all of the limited programme had been working it would have it poor as it was it was pathetic and really there is no excuse these days to not have a lot of choice and good quality sound and picture. Like Ryan Air everything on board is an extra including having seats together, meals and although the food in terms of quality was okay at \u00a317 for two light meals with no alcohol it was not what I would call value for money. My point here is not so much that things are chargeable but that they represent poor value \u2013 I felt that I was being taken for a ride in more ways than one. In every other respect Thomas Cook were good. We did arrive at the airport early which probably helprf but nevertheless the flight check-in was quick and efficient. The flight departed more or less on time and the arrival in Mexico was well organised, Thomas Cook reps throughout the stay were all very helpful and informative. Hotel The Tucan and Quetzal are two separate hotels with shared facilities but really it is one big one as you can use either of the hotel\u2019s facilities. There were no catches with the all inclusive as far as food and drink went and it even included room service and fully stocked mini-bar. A room safe is provided and each day the rooms were cleaned and new towels provided. Eating Every day the buffet food breakfast and evening was excellent quality with loads of choice. The beach food was also pretty good and again had loads of choice and from top to bottom the staff were very pleasant throughout the resort. As for the a la cart restaurants - we tried the Italian, which was good, the Japanese also good and entertaining and the Grill which was not so good in terms of the quality of the food. Entertainment The daily shows were okay if you like that sort of thing - although they seem to have been doing the same shows for several years so look on Youtube and what you see there is probably what you will get even if you visit next year. I would recommend that they employ a new show director each year so that the talent of the performers is not entirely wasted. Drinks Drinks were always available, the alcoholic drinks must be watered down because you don't see that many people that are doing nothing but drinking all day drunk - which has to be a good thing I guess \u2013 no one should be standing after seven 'double' Margaritas - but they were. White wine was okay, the red wine I tried was warm and undrinkable \u2013 the draught beer was okay. They could do with a few more bars full stop. A few bars and/or restaurants that looked out over the sea in the evening under the night sky would be nice and perfectly possible. Being two hotels that are mirror images of one another the bars and restaurants were just not different enough - in the evening if you didn't want to go to the show - your choice was either of the two identical lobby bars or to go back to the room and spend the evening on the balcony - in the evening no real use was made of the swimming pool area or the beach - not even just to have then as a view. Throughout We stayed at the Tucan side and the second floor accommodation we had was excellent. Internet access was available as an extra - if you had your own laptop you could only access it from the lobby area at $18 for a total of 24 hours - more than enough for most people staying up to 14 days. The 'problem' with \u2018all inclusive\u2019 is that if you are going to go out of the resort on an excursion to see 'Mexico' for real then you are not only going to be paying for the excursion and the days food and drink but also lose out for the days food and drink that you would have consumed had you stayed in the resort - i.e. to get the full value of a fully inclusive you are going to need to stay in the resort. There was a tennis court, spa and gym - but I wouldn't say they were the hotels strong points - if they are your thing then you may want another resort that has more facilities. Unless you carry money around - which you don\u2019t need - you will end up not tipping, you don't need to tip - it was appreciated when we did but there was no lack of service when we didn't. The local town is about a 25 minute walk or a five minute 5$ taxi ride, it is a new town so no real authentic atmosphere. The Pool/Beach The majority of the sun loungers were \u2018reserved\u2019 by 9.30am but even arriving at 11.00am there was always somewhere free \u2013 it really depends how fussy you are on where you sit, if you are fussy you have to get up early and play the \u2018reserve\u2019 game. We were staying over Easter and the beach was busy but nevertheless pleasant, apart from the unsightly sandbags that have been put there in an effort to stop the beach from being washed away. The sandbags look like beached whales, people like to play on them but they can be dangerous so it is not encouraged. The bottom line though is that they look ugly and it is a shame they can't come up with a better solution. They play a couple of songs everyday both on the beach/pool and in the evening shows - they can get on your nerves but just feel sorry for those who work there and do it everyday year on year. Elsewhere The disco was a disco so if you like that sort of things it is a good venue with a good sound system and it stays open until the early hours. The 'jungle' in the middle of the resort was very well done and there were a couple of pool tables and table tennis table with an open table tennis tournament most days. In summary The children loved it and want to go back. For ten days it was brilliant, much longer and despite the good service and excellent food I think it would all get a bit repetitive. To go to Mexico and not visit the many historical Mayan sights and experience an authentic Mexican town would I feel be a shame, but if you have children and/or the local culture is not really your thing \u2013 or you have experienced that side - then I would definitely recommend the Tucan for anyone who understands that an all inclusive holiday means that unless you are going to go on the excursions then you are going to be tied to the resort and therefore not really see Mexico - only experience a resort in Mexico. If you do go on the excursions then it will work out as a much more expensive way of doing things. The Tucan does what it does very well.", "Date": "April 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cSuperb hotel and here's some info not in the other reviews....\u201d", "Author": "lizzis", "ReviewID": "UR28033423", "Content": "All the reviews sum up this hotel pretty well so just a couple of comments about things I couldn't find in any of the reviews! BIKE HIRE - despite the bikes out the front of the hotel these are not available for guests during the day as they are used for the bike tour run twice a day which is not worth bothering with. Much better is to walk the 8 minutes to the Playacar shopping complex (turn right out of the hotel entrance gate) where you can hire bikes for free (need to leave a 200 peso deposit). No brakes (you back pedal which takes a bit of getting used to) but very useful for getting into Playa Del Carmen. Takes 10 minutes by bikes instead of a 40 min walk. INTERNET - available in the hotel lobby at 20 pesos for 15 minutes. Useful for emergencies but better to head into Playa Del Carmen (on the free bikes!) and use an Internet cafe which will cost around 30 pesos for an hour. DIVING - The company based at the hotel is called Dressel Divers and operates in a number of Iberostar hotels. We did the PADI Open Water diver course which costs USD515. You can do it cheaper in Playa Del Carmen but there's the obvious hassle of getting to Playa Del Carmen. The intructors at Dressel are excellent and having heard about a few cowboy places we were happy to pay a little more for such high quality training. After we qualified we did a number of dives and can recomend Cenotes and Cozumel - superb diving and again the Dressl Team were all highly professional and friendly which was great for us first time divers!", "Date": "April 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charlotte, NC", "Title": "\u201cThe Tropical Resort I Thought Could Only Be In My Imagination\u201d", "Author": "gijanemichele", "ReviewID": "UR27970321", "Content": "I have just returned from my family vacation that was incredible due to the location and where we chose to stay...the Iberostar Tucan Hotel. My husband and I travel extensively and primarily on cruise ships, so I was concerned to book our first resort vacation. I am not at all disappointed! This was the amazing tropical get away that I was searching and hoping for. The drive took about one hour from Cancun, so be prepared for that added time especially when departing to catch an aircraft. I was elated as soon as I stepped into the lobby. The lobby provided a great welcome into this tropical Mexican environment with its gorgeous statues, lamps, pottery and furniture. We then took a walk along a winding path through a \u201crain forest\u201d to get to our room. This is also the area where you see the greatest number of animals, birds and reptiles. All of the different sets of buildings were painted in tropical colors, had thatch covered roofs and lush flowers flowing off of each room balcony. The rooms had a very large bed, a great shower, wonderful Mexican d\u00e9cor and were very clean our entire stay. We chose to tip our housekeeper even though it was not necessary because she did an amazing job. One negative (and I hate to use that word for this place) is all of the marble, concrete and rocks on the premises. The rooms all have marble floors and concrete around the bed and night stands. The main lobby and buffet area are all marble and the pathway to and from are uneven stones. It looked so nice and really added to the Yucatan feel, but not good when you have small children who will fall and bump their head. Again, it was gorgeous and I would not want to see it changed, but it is a trip hazard and scary when you have a toddler just learning to walk and just something to be aware of. There are two paths to walk from most locations. There is a more level walk along the exterior of the rooms or an inner more scenic walk. The inner path is where you are able to see monkeys, various types of birds and iguanas. They generally do not approach you and remain in the wooded areas. It is incredible to see the variety of animals and my 1 year old son loved and looked forward to the walk each day. However, by the end of the two weeks I was a little tired of the Peacock\u2019s call. They are very loud and seemed to end up in front of our room every morning around 4-5am. The kiddy pool is perfect for newborns and toddlers other than the parents who do not supervise their misbehaving children. I found it odd how many small children were unsupervised and moving about the pool area. The main pool is very large and had wonderful thatched roof umbrellas all along the exterior. Again, very tropical lush greenery and flowers were everywhere in the pool area. There was also a bar pool that was very nice, but I did not ever go in that one. You could sit on a stool in the water while at the bar. The beach is nice and probably as best as it can be for this area. Hurricanes have taken a toll on most of the Mexican coast and the Caribbean and many resorts are left without beaches. The beach has been built up and is very nice for lounging since the pool area can be crowded. If you walk out to the beach and take a right, you will find a large vacant beach with no resorts in a 5-10 minute walk. They also have large sandbags in the water to assist in stopping beach erosion. The ocean was rough most days, so not the best for playing in the water with such large waves just breaking 10 feet out. My son was more interested in playing on the beach anyway, but it was a challenge to get cooled off and not get pummeled by such tumultuous waves. The alcoholic drinks would make some people happy because they are strong and they do not hesitate to fill them up with as much alcohol as they can, but I felt they were too strong. I would recommend the virgin Coco Loco. My family loved them and it became our treat daily as well has the ice cream served poolside. We ate at the main Buffet for most meals and actually preferred it over the restaurants even though they had many redundant items. The Japanese restaurant had a great show like many Japanese restaurants, but it lacked flavor. The Italian restaurant had limited choices and was somewhat bland as well. The main buffet has an incredible breakfast and it was our favorite meal of the day. We had lunch at the poolside restaurant which had pretty much the same things daily, but was convenient since it was right by the pool. The dinner at the buffet was tasty most nights, but breakfast is by far the best meal. The only real negative about food is that there is little overlap in the eating establishments and there are long periods in between meals. For small children who have snacks and do not always have the schedule of an adult, it is hard to make them wait until the next meal time. You were not supposed to take anything out of the eating areas, which is understandable except we would have a starving baby who couldn\u2019t hold out until lunch most days. The staff had many activities planned, but we just enjoyed our family and didn\u2019t participate in any. There were free scuba diving lessons, dance competitions, dance lessons, pottery painting, cook outs on the beach, vendors present on site, shows in the evening, etc. I heard many positive comments on the events. They also have a Kiddies Club on the premises and I saw several children smiling and having lots of fun. I feel this is an incredible resort and I would love to go back one day and I would recommend this place to anyone especially for honeymoons, weddings, and anniversaries. It is also a great place for families with small children to go and relax.

We chose the Toucan because we stayed at an Iberostar resort in Punta Cana and were impressed so we figured we would go with a known entity - the Toucan exceeded our expectations. All the staff were extremely friendly and helpful, even when I felt as though I had a silly question. Staff were attentive and correctly anticipated when I was lost or confused and jumped ion to help out. The grounds and all facilities were immaculate in terms of cleanliness and aesthetics. Not once did I notice a dirty, stained, broken, crooked, worn, torn, or shoddy nook or cranny. The Kids Club was fantastic! We took our younger children to the Kids Club for part of each day and were really impressed with the enthusiasm, expertise, and creativity of the staff. Our kids really looked forward to going to Kids Club every day and even got to help create and participate in a special kids show that they presented for the parents on the entertainment stage at night. The evening entertainment was excellent and much better than a lot of live entertainment I have seen at other (non-Iberostar) resorts. Not only were the cast members/dancers/singers talented, but they also worked a lot of humor into the shows. BEWARE - if you manage to get pulled onstage by any of the staff, you will be in store to be made a fool of, but all in good fun - nothing totally humiliating. I recommend the dance lessons even if you have 2 left feet. I am by no means graceful but I figured that no one knows me so why not try it. I had a blast, no one laughed at me, there were other participants equally as untalented as myself, and the dance instructors catered to vacationers who just wanted to have fun rather than perfect their moves. The food was fantastic! I realize there have been unfavorable reviews about this aspect of the resort, but I was quite happy with everything offered. I am a vegetarian but had no problems whatsoever finding adequate (and delicious) fare at each meal. (I highly recommend the mango yogurt with granola and raisins for breakfast.) The food was always hot, fresh, and flavorful. The fruits were sweet, juicy, and plentiful. Our rooms were perfect - we requested that they be centrally located between the pool/beach and the lobby/restaurant areas. I initially wished that the Toucan offered free wi-fi, but it turned out I was glad they didn't because it gave me a nice break from the \"real world\" and gave me the chance to truly relax and leave my worries behind.

In week 2 we were joined by our 2 daughters ( early 20's) for a week. All four of us were so totally satisfied with our vacation and there are not enough adjectives to describe all the good things at the Iberostar. PROPERTY The property is so beautiful with a strong emphasis on flora and fauna. If you're a nature lover, you will adore it there. There are many small animals living on the resort and they add so much charm to the place. The rooms are good with sufficient space, and always very clean. Our only problem was room location. Our first 2 nights we were in building 28 facing the outside of the property. The view was of the loading dock of the hotel next door. Our Signature rep was able to have our room changed to building 24 facing inside ( the jungle view) and we had a charming view of a small waterfall/pond. It was wonderful. BEACH For beach lovers, there are the usual sandbags found throughout the Mayan area now, but one of the best things at the Iberostar is that it is next to last in the line of hotels in Playacar so there is only a short walk to undeveloped, pristine beach with no sandbags or hotels to mar the view. Those who love early morning walks on the beach will be in heaven. POOL The pool is large and very clean with a variety of depths. We spent most of our time there ( and I'm usually a beach person). Judging from how many pool pictures we all took, we all found it a highlight. As at most resorts, the best chairs go to the early birds. FOOD The food in the buffets was fantastic and actually excelled that offered at a few of the speciality restaurants. (exception was the steakhouse-La Marimba which should not be missed) The variety was exceptional as was the quality. Best of all, there were always many Mexican specialties on offer each night. We highly recommend this hotel and would certainly go again.

The hotel was immaculate with huge displays of fresh flowers everywhere, well tended gardens and ultra-clean everywhere. We were all inclusive, and I'm not sure if other options are available, but the all inclusive was amazing - it included room service, mini bar, all food and drink 24/7 and access to the a la carte restaurants. The a la carte restaurants were limited depending on the number of nights you stayed, but the buffet food was also pretty good. The location is very good with the Cozumel ferry nearby and other local attractions like Xel Ha, Delphinus (swim with dolphins) and Xcaret within an hour. The airport was also only an hour away by coach. Diving with Dressel divers was great, relaxed and well organised and they had everything on offer from trips to Cozumel, diving the amazing Cenotes and even diving with sharks.

Overall, we really enjoyed it, although there were a few things that could be improved. Postives: * Great beach. Very fine, white, rock-free sand. Can walk for long distance in either direction on the beach. Very deep beach in front of the resort with lots of palapas and chairs. * Room was nice. Large shower, good size room (2 double beds and a sofa--they brought us extra sheets and our daughter loved sleeping on the sofa) and nice, private balcony. * Room was kept very clean. Our kids loved the \"towel animals\" that the maid left every day. * Air conditioning system was great--thermostat worked well and the A/C was quiet and effective. * Grounds are beautiful. Very lush landscaping with the \"jungle\" between Tucan and Quetzel. Lots of animals roaming around (peacocks, roosters, igauanas, assorted birds, etc.). * Resort feels big enough without being too big. Easy access to the restaurants and lobby area. * Very easy access to drinks from the pool and beach. * Employees were almost without exception friendly and helpful. * Playacar community is very nice and within walking distance of PDC (maybe 30 minute walk) Negatives: * Really could use a decent concierge service at this price point. The \"guest services\" desk was not helpful with our questions about getting to an offsite destination (\"The Jungle Place\"). * The process for making reservations for the ala carte restaurants is poor. This can not be done over the phone at any time but requires the guest to come to the guest services desk during 2 windows of time during the day. * Food quality was just OK at the buffets and was not much better at the ala cartes. We really enjoyed the Japanese restaurant but were not fans of the Italian or Mexican ones. * \"Negative\" is probably not the right term but we were surprised at how few times we saw monkeys on the property. We had the impression from reading other reviews that we would be seeing monkeys all the time but we only saw 1 on the property all week. We did see a couple others twice in the trees just across the property line with the resort to the South. * There is no hot tub. The main pool does have a \"jacuzzi\" tub but the water is not heated and it was actually colder than the pool (which was also fairly cold). * Room service menu is very limited and food is poor quality.", "Date": "March 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cSandos was best value...Iberostar is best hotel!!!!\u201d", "Author": "whodeytoronto", "ReviewID": "UR26603865", "Content": "Overview This was our second trip to Riviera Maya. Last year we stayed at Sandos Playacar, which is right next to Tucan, and we loved the Sandos for the value that it provided. The Iberostar Tucan completed destroyed the experience we had at Sandos. The Tucan exceeded in all areas, customer service, Food, drink, entertainment, rooms and activities. Travellers, there is a reason why this resort is currently 12 out of 190 resorts in Playa del Carmen....You cannot go wrong with the tucan....Please read on for a detailed review. Travel to and from Toronto We stayed at the Tucan from March 13 to March 20, 2009. We upgraded to Star Class (first class) and it made all the difference. Large leg room, seperate check-in line at the airport (no-lineups) unlimited alcohol on the plane, priority baggage claim. All this amounted to less stress and more time to enjoy your vacation. If you have never been to this part of Mexico, you will land in Cancun, and after customs, you will proceed to your bus. You will immediately be greeted by personnel that work for Tourism Mexico. These people are nice but they want to sell you exursions to various sites. YOU DO NOT NEED TO STOP if you do not want to. Just proceed right through with a polite no. If you are planning to go outside the resort, you may want to stop and listen (prices may be better than resort) but just keep in mind that your bus is waiting for you and so are 5, 10 0r 20 travellers. The ride to the resort is approx.1 hour depending on how many other stops are made. Bring some snacks for the kids as they may get hungry. Check-IN We arrived at 9:30 at night so the check-in was a total of 10 min. The lobby is spacious and cool and the people working there are very friendly. There are maps everywhere, so getting accustomed to where everything is located (buffets, beach, pool rooms) is a snap. It is well laid out and you should quickly get oriented. Rooms Our rooms were in block 17. Now here is the run-down on where the blocks are: 11-13 close to beach 14-15 close to pool 16-17 close to buffet 18-19 close to lobby The buildings are close to each other so the walk is very short to each area, so don't sweat where you are (unless you really want a really short walk to the beach) then e-mail the hotel before hand to request a building) The room was clean and spacious with balcony. Bathroom were big enough. The beds are harder than what we have at home but after 1 or 2 nights, they were fine. Beach The beach is amazing, always clean, soft sand and awesome water. This is a huge beach with lots of room for everyone to play and relax. I was up early every morning, not to reserve a hut but to enjoy every second of my vacation. If you do not want to wake up, DON\"T SWEAT IT. Here is the run-down of what you can expect: 6:30am -7:00am you will get a front row hut with chairs 7:00 am -7:30am you will get second or third row huts 7:30 am - 8:00am you will get a hut somewhere after 8:00am you will find no shade but will find a chair. Don't sweat it because you can sign out a beach umbrella at any time so there should be no stress with respect to this... Food Food was great to excellent. The buffets are always hot and delicious. Never had one item that I didn't like. The steakhouse, tropical and the italian restaurants are all great (there is a Japanese that we didn't get to) You should make reservations for these restaurants at the beginning of the week to ensure you get the times you want. Activities/Entertainment The Star Friends team are a group of talented individuals that run the activities and the entertainment at the end of the night. These guys are amazing. The shows are very good, and are worth watching. My son and I tried Archery (every day at 3:00pm), air rifle and volleyball on the beach. get involved early and don't be afraid to ask where and when these activities take place. Internet The interenet access is expensive ($20 US Dollars for 30 mins) It is located in the lobby. There is Wi-Fi access in the lobby so bring your lap-top if you need to Drinks There is a wonderful lobby bar that you are going to love...They had nightly entertainment that was a perfect pre/post dinner drink location. This bar is open all day so you can grab a coffee, cappuccino or a beer at any time. Customer Service I wanted to end the review on this point. The Iberostar chain and in particular the staff at Tucan can teach us in Canada and US alot about customer service. They truly and genuinley care about making your vacation the best. They go out of there way for you if you ask.

The first two times we had gone with our family, both times before the beach whales/bags were there. I am not going to write an indepth review as others have done a very good job and I dont wish to be too repetative. I write this mainly to show our experiance of the beach. Briefly the hotel remains as wonderful as ever. The staff are super efficient and friendly. The grounds are wonderfully looked after, with a mix of wonderfully maintained exotic gardens and a large area of wild looking jungle, with winding paths leading through it to the beach. You can take a a flatter easier route if the jungle is not your thing or you have mobility problems. There are lots of birds and other wildlife to enjoy looking at. We have stayed in other hotels with more luxurious bedrooms, but that said the bedrooms are clean and fine. As a female who always over packs, oops, I find the storage space a bit stingy, so I lay some clothes out on the sofa which we dont use. We dont find the beds too hard and sleep just fine. The showers were always delivering hot water. We had unusually cool weather for the time of year, the first 2 weeks of Feb. The pilot announced as we landed that it was only 22 degrees, and that was at 3pm. It remained like that for most of our first week. Coupled with the fierce wind it was quite chilly when the sun popped behind a cloud. It meant the beach was quietter as many people gave up and went shopping or around the pool. We did chat with locals and some of them were even wearing gloves in the evening! Of course it was much colder at home, sub-zero, so we were just glad we could sit on the beach (sometimes with a towel around us) and at least it wasnt raining like some folk had in Mid Jan. The red flag flew for 12 of our 14 days. The sea was so rough that first week that it frequently came right over the sand bags. I'm guessing that was what affected the sand? As the beach at the Quetzal side began to serious erode leaving only space for one row of beach beds and then a large drop of about 4 to 5ft. The Sandos next to the Tucan faired badly too. They had a larger drop of sand and we saw a few large palapas topple into the sea. The Tucan stretch of beach remained unaffected. Personally we found the sand bags ugly. I know lots of folk enjoyed slipping and slidding on them, but a few ended up with plaster casts on broken limbs as a consequence. Yes they have helped restored the beach, but the price is a heavy one. Of course that is our opinion and Im sure others would say Im being a fuss pot, but to us they really were obtrusive. The fact that we saw the beach starting to vanish again despite their presence, suggests that perhaps they are not a long term solution. We did know the bags were there, but having enjoyed the previous idylic beach view, we were still taken aback by just how ugly they were. Ultimately we had first checked out the Ibero Hacienda Dominicus at Bayahibe in Dr, but it was over \u00a3600 more. Did we regret not spending the extra \u00a3600.......... Not once !!!!! The Tucan remains our favourite and the hotel is a dream! Go and enjoy, I wish I was back there right now, beach whales or no beach whales!

Decent food at buffets, cheap $5 cab rides into \"town\", GREAT plantings & on-site menagerie (exotic birds, a family of monkeys, iguanas). As many other all-inclusive hotels, a strange false-capacity reservation system for the nicer restaurants makes dinner at the resort frustrating (unless you eat at the buffet which is good but not great). There is a lot of walking at this attractive resort, some on un-even stone paths. The beach is lovely, but the ocean view is marred by these gigantic sandbag \"whales\" they use to \"hold\" the sand. Drinks are good (quite weak, which we liked--try the Mohito) and staff is friendly. The Oylmpus \"event\" crew in the lobby was great to work with, they organized a terrific catamaran trip & Tulum excursion for us.

A very well maintained - high quality facility with excellent employees! When you add in the fantastic beach - great location (within easy walking distance to Playa del Carmen), it is pretty hard to beat. The resort is located within the \"Playacar\" subdivision. This appears to be almost the equivalent of a gated community - with only high end homes and condos, along with and a few resorts and a golf course. In other words, it is in about the safest location you could ask for. There were people walking back and forth to town all day long - even during the early evening. (I suspect that those who venture out late at night would still be advised to use a taxi). I am not going to go over every aspect of the resort, as I would only be repeating what has already been said by many others. Those that are finding fault would most likely also find fault in resorts that charge much more than what you will pay at the Tucan.

This hotel is no exception. Hubby and I just got back from a week at the Tucan and I have nothing but wonderful things to say about it. From check in to check out a week later the experience was nothing but exceptional. Approximately 3 weeks before check in I emailed the hotel and asked to be near the ocean. My response was quick and very friendly. They accomodated by giving me a room in the 1200 block. I was very close to both beach and pool complex. The room.... spotless spick and span clean. It was plenty big enough and the bathroom was nice size. The shower was big and water pressure great. The bed was large and a little firm for my taste but I simply asked for a foam mattress and within minutes it was on the bed and it made a good difference. The hotel itself was clean and well layed out. The staff were so friendly and accomodating. I loved the bartenders at the beach bar..Humberto and Jesus. They fixed my drink exactly as I liked it each day and always did it with friendly conversation and a smile. I wanted more booze in my drink....more booze I got. It was so cool walking thru the \"jungle\" everyday. We saw all kinds of different animals. My favorite wwas the iguana that had his home under the walkway to the pool. Sorry Iberostar but I am a sucker for a handsome face and I left my igumana friend a little fruit every morning. I named him Humberto after my favorite bartender!!. The monkeys set up housekeeping in the tress across from my balcony everymorning at 5a.m.. This was very charming for the first couple of mornings as it was nice to see the monkeys but it lost a little luster after the 3rd day in a row....and so on. but it really was neat to watch them. The pool complex was large, clean and well layed out. A nice pool bar tucked away in the corner away from the general public and children was different than any other pool complex I have seen. Nice idea. The beach is beautiful. The \"whales\" are layed out along the beach but it really is a neccessity becaue if the hurricanes. Iberostar has the nicest beach along the stretch of hotels. There is a problem with people that reserve chairs then leave for the day. Upon check in you are given a notice not to reserve chairs but it is still done. I actually got up every morning at 6am and claimed my spot on the beach. Hubby and I satyed out and had coffee and read for a couple hours then went for breakfast and back to our spot on the beach. But alot of people get up, lay their towel down , then leave until several hours later. One couple claimed their spot, left the beach and didnt show up until after lunch. This is just not nice. One time I pulled my chair that I had since 6am down to the water becasue it was cooler. I got up to go make a call leaving my things on my chair . 10minutes later I came back to find my things on the sand and my chair pulled back and occupied.ARRRRRRRR... that ticked me off and...sorry I follwed the tracks to my chair and asked for it back. Oh well... I was more upset that my things were thrown in the sand. But this was the ONLY negative experience I had on my entire trip!! I will go back to te Iberostar again and again becasue this was the best hotel experience I have had in the 8 years I have traveled to the Carribbean. We went into town and did some shopping. It was a $5 cab ride and we walked back. Long walk but nice. The streets are clean ans landscaped. Oh it was just a pretty little town. I felt very safe!! There is a smaller shopping area about 10minutes walk away. It was clean and nice and had pretty much the same stuff as in town. My advice is to change your money to pesos and buy using pesos. Dolloar for dollar you save money changing it to pesos. We did the math several times and always made out better when we paid with pesos. The food is kind of repetative. Breakfast was best. Lunch and dinner had the same things day after day and it got a little tiring. Dont get me wrong...it tasted good it was just the same thing over and over. And lets just say...I was true to gaining my usual vacation 5 pounds. So nothing to be concerned about or change your plans for. The food tasted good.

My husband and I travelled with our two children (11 months and 3 years), as well as our nanny. We were extremely satisfied with the quality of the hotel. The resort is a strong four star by any standards. We were most impressed by how impeccably clean and well maintained the hotel is, from our rooms to the lush naturalistic grounds to the dining and pool areas. Marble is used liberally in the public spaces and in the rooms. It is obvious that management is acutely attuned to the infamous squeamishness of westerners in matters of hygiene and cleanliness. In that respect, the resort rivalled western standards. Bathrooms are the ultimately litmus test and they were gleaming and spotless. Much has been written here about the grounds and \"wild life\" so I will not dwell on that if only to say that these far exceeded our expectations. Our three year old marvelled at the peacocks, monkeys and iguanas that we would often encounter on the pathways throughout the resort. It may be worth requesting a room near the lobby when booking in order to avoid the possibility of disturbances from the animal noises. I believe this is far worse on the Quetzal side of the resort. Our rooms were located in the 1700s near the lobby and this was not an issue for us. There was some confusion when booking about whether we had booked the Tucan or Quetzal. They are mirror hotels that share a reception area, grounds and restaurants. It is possible that the Quetzal is older. Since it is located closer to the wildlife and mini bird sanctuary, there are more frequent noise complaints, which might explain the discrepancy between the TripAdvisor rankings of the Tucan (13 out of 185 hotels) versus the Quetzal (a bit lower). The staff is incredibly well trained, professional and friendly. The resort employs hundreds of employees, each (shockingly) with his or her own personality and disposition. Someone might be in a sour mood somewhere at some point. Frankly, who cares, unless the behaviour is in the realm of the abusive. However, rudeness and poor service are the exception at this resort. We met several families who have made multiple trips to the resort over the years because of the consistently outstanding the quality and service of the Iberostar and how comfortable it is for families. We booked the Iberostar Tucan because of the overwhelmingly good reviews and we will be back. FOR FAMILIES: This is a FAMILY resort that has gone to great lengths to accommodate the needs of families with young children. There were clowns who made balloon animals, a very adequate nightly children's show (Rafa is great) and a children's pool near the playground and kid's club (from age 4). My daughter tore herself away from the pool to do crafts and watch the daily kids TV sessions in the early afternoon (hopefully, she will survive the overdose of Sponge Bog and Power Puff Girls). I wasn't crazy about the current mini-club monitor (Joy, I think). She came off as bored and not terribly affectionate. But this may be entirely a matter of personal preference. Most parents seemed quite happy with her. In any event, the club is not intended for kids under 3 and my daughter was able to participate in some activities because I was there to supervise. The mini-club is literally right next to the kid's pool. Children and doted upon by the staff and made to feel very welcome. Although the resort is clearly child-friendly, we would have been equally happy travelling here a couple. The resort has sprawling grounds and many adult amenities that are relatively segregated from the children's section. I would not describe the Iberostar Tucan-Quetzal as party central, however. I was concerned about the availability of a crib and high chairs for meals. My worries were misplaced. The crib was in the room by the time we returned from a late night dinner on the night we checked in. High chairs were always available and quickly provided on demand (albeit without safety belts and somewhat wobbly so exercise caution when using them). WEATHER? WHO KNOWS... I don't know why people comment about the weather as if the resorts have some control over that. The expectation, of course, is that it will be balmy and spectacular (and it was beautiful and consistently breezy during our stay). But nothing I tell you about the weather conditions last week will be of any assistance to you when you visit. I suggest that you hope for the best but plan for the possibility of rain and cool weather in the early morning and evenings: bring long pants and a sweater! ROOM: Absolutely no complaints. Again, we were in the 1700s section near the lobby and buffet restaurant. The room was cleaned daily. No idea what was on TV, we never opened it. Why would we? FYI, there was no tub in the room, only showers. Bathtime without a bath was a little tricky with the kids but we managed. This is actually the first time we go to a beach resort where there was no odd smell or mouldiness. It is possible that the further away you are from the beach (we were closer to the reception area), the less this is an issue. In any event, we did not come to Mexico to spend the day in our rooms. We didn't care that the bathroom fan sounded like an airplane engine before it warmed up. Petty detail. We used the laundry service: excellent and cheap. I think it deserves to be repeated: the bathrooms were spotless. I think this is a big one for many gringos. In my opinion the standards of cleanliness at the Iberostar Tucan equalled those of four or five star hotels in Canada. And worth noting: it is actually possible to enter the beach/pool restrooms without shoes and not suffer any lasting trauma from unspeakable things lurking on the floors or under the toilet seats. This is unheard of even in Canada (my husband barely recovered from a trip to a public bathroom at a Toronto beach last summer). I believe they are genuinely committed to high standards of sanitation because they understand that this can make or break a resort. After a couple of days, any worries about the kids getting sick were completely evaporated. Exercise judgment and common sense as you would anywhere else. Nuff said. LOCATION: The hotel is a 50 pesos (roughly USD $5) cab ride away from Calle 5, the central shopping/club/resto hub in Playa Del Carmen. The Iberostar Tucan-Quetzal appeared to have the longest stretch of beach in that particular hotel zone. ALL of the resorts along the this stretch have hideous sand bags marring the beautiful view of the ocean. These were put there to deal with sand erosion. Hopefully, they are a temporary measure until they come up with something more aesthetic and equally effective. The sand bags are quickly forgotten once you're in the water. If you really don't like them, walk a couple of minutes past the Sandos and you can swim without that eyesore spoiling the ocean view. Although chairs fill up quickly, we were always able to secure three or four with a little resourcefulness and scavenging around the pool or beach. Hotel staff can assist if you are too lazy or weak to do this yourself. With a little self-help, you should never be a day without a chair and palapas even if you don't get up at the crack of down to secure your territory. FOOD: I'm amazed that people quibble about food in their reviews of the Iberostar Tucan-Quetzal. While I agree that the dinner buffet includes some rather bizarre and unsavoury options (and the a la carte are mostly best avoided), there is enough selection to satisfy even the most discriminating foodie. I like to think that we are pretty discerning people and yet we were able to find adequate to very good options at the buffet. We even met a vegetarian couple from Minnesota that was pretty satisfied with the selection even if a little heavy on the carbs. Bottom line, if you are unable to find several items to your liking in the various daily buffets, then you are quite simply impossible to please. I don't know why most resorts bother with a la carte restaurants (although a la carte Mexican is usually passable). Is it any wonder that Mexicans can't do sushi, or Italian for that matter? Perhaps they add the a la carte restaurants to give guests the illusion of getting something extra for the money. The problem is that the same kitchen, ingredients and recipes are used for a la carte and buffet. And often the uneaten a la carte menu items appear in the buffet. The main reason to go a la carte is for a change of scenery. We didn't feel cheated by the mediocre a la carte meals but would have been pleasantly surprised if they had been any good. Considering that our three year old and 11 month old ate well and no one got sick, how bad could the buffet be? That's not luck; no one is fussier than a three year old. ENTERTAINMENT, DRINKS: The shows were surprisingly good. A significant amount of money and preparation is clearly invested in these. The best were the \"native\" shows: the Mexican Ballet Folklorico (excellent) and equally impressive Mayan show. A warning that the show proper actually only starts at 10pm after the kids show, audience participation segment and guest award show. The mariachis (who typically play at the Mexican a la carte resto) are top notch, as are the band for the nightly show, especially the horn section. The singing was largely tacky and saccharine with some notable exceptions. But hey, it's a vacation and you have to appreciate the effort. With a few drinks in your system, the shows are usually quite enjoyable on the whole. I agree that the drinks were generally quite weak. I'm not one of those seasoned veterans who walks around the resort with an insulated mega mug. Weak drinks are the bane of most all inclusives. But here is a little secret: it's an all inclusive. Drinks are free and plentiful. If your pina colada is too weak, order it with a side shot of rum and pour said shot into mega mug: now enjoy. The beer was very good, actually. Our mini bar was frequently and generously restocked. A bottle of tequila was even provided. The daily tip probably helped. Speaking of which... TO TIP OR NOT TO TIP: Save your tips for staff that you develop a meaningful rapport with and for the room cleaners (lots of men do this now). I found tipping rather pointless at this hotel because it did not change the level of service generally. We were utterly charmed by a couple of waitresses/cleaners around the pool (Sandy) and at the beach resto (Elsy) and gave them something more meaningful as a token of our gratitude. These are very young women, as they typically are, who make laughable wages by our standards. CONSIDER BOOKING A PRIVATE TRANSFER: A final word: I would strongly recommend arranging a private transfer to the hotel and airport, particularly if you are travelling with small children (reputable private transportation services will provide car seats, subject to availability). Another advantage: we arrived at the hotel well ahead of the bus and checked in quickly without line-ups. Do yourself a favour and avoid the delays, multiple stops at other resorts and needlessly early departure from the resort! When leaving, we opted to pay the 10 pesos hourly extra charge and kept one of the rooms until just before we left in order to facilitate showering and changing into our travel clothes before departure. What an amazing resort and what a great vacation. I was worried about travelling with two very young children but I believe the Iberostar Tucan made all the difference!", "Date": "March 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Warrington, Pa", "Title": "\u201cGreat Vacation\u201d", "Author": "GeriWarrington", "ReviewID": "UR25860388", "Content": "We stayed at the Iberostar Tucan from 2/28-3/7/09...we loved every minute. I read reviews everyday and had some qualms about the hotel. They were all gone by the first few hours. Check-In...I read some reviews where they said the front desk was much to be desired, well I can tell you Jesus check us in and he was great. We passed by the front desk on numerous occasions and there was always a smile on his face. Rooms.....Spotless and large...we had an Ocean Front Jr. Suite and it was really quite comfortable....I found the bed to be fine and that was one of the major complaints that I read about....the shower was plenty big enough. Food....We loved the buffet, always something different....my favorite was breakfast, but lunch and dinner were also great....food could have been hotter....my suggestion maybe have a few micro waves so guest can heat their food a little.... Beach......that is what we live for.....we enjoyed the beach, sandbags were entertainment watching the kids (and adults) play on them....plenty of chairs, true people save their chairs early in the morning. We ate our breakfast then put our towels down on a chair, got changed then came down to the beach....so we did not put towels down and not come down for hours. Entertainment......We only went to one show (because we were exhausted) people that wrote that the entertainment was lame, to them I say go somewhere and pay top dollar to see a Vegas show or a broadway show....These Star Friends work during the day and put a show on at night....they have such nice personalities and are so energetic and are just so happy. Tipping: I was told by our travel agent that tips were not expected. I felt I had to leave a few dollars for the maid, I left a dollar at the buffet table everytime.....I did this because these people work soooo hard and they are so nice. Grounds: Absolutely beautiful...you really have to see it Overview: Everyone that worked at this hotel did not pass you without a hello or a smile. I would stay again in a heartbeat.

The service, cleanliness, food, beach, activities were all amazing. The part we all liked the best was the jungle, located in the middle of the complex. Every morning my wife and I would have a coffee on the balcony and enjoy watching the peacocks, flamingos and a whole array of other birds. A family of howler monkeys was a little more difficult to spot but would sometimes turn up around 4pm for a show. The beach had sandbags which my 12 year old son loved to play on; timing the ocean waves to carry you over the sandbags was a fun game we would play for hours. Wrestling on them was also fun. There was always a lounge chair available and if shade was needed a beach umbrella was available at the towel hut for no charge. Beach volleyball and horseshoes were some activities we enjoyed while on the beach. The food was really good, the buffet always had new selections but sometimes it wasn\u2019t hot enough. The A La Cart restaurants were very good; the Japanese had a great show to go with the good food. The Steak House was also very good. Those were the only 2 we made it to but with the good buffet it was all we needed. The hotel is located in Playacar but is a 30 minute walk to Playa Del Carmen. We loved the walk there and would go there pretty well every day. The walk was beautiful and we would check out all the other resorts as we walked. Playa Del Carmen\u2019s 5th Avenue had tons of shopping and other stores. The pier was interesting as well.

Awesome trip!\u201d", "Author": "DMBreen", "ReviewID": "UR25765921", "Content": "We went February 23rd - 28th for our honeymoon. The trip was booked through AAA. No complaints except for connecting through Atlanta both coming and going. We would never fly through Atlanta again! The time waiting to get through customs in Mexico was expected and actually not that big of a deal. We found the American Express booth on the left just before you walk out the airport doors (do not talk to anyone in the airport offering free rides to the resort as they are trying to sell time shares). American Express was waiting for us. We had to wait for one other family which was no big deal. You can request a private van when booking through AAA at a higher cost. It was no issue having to drop off the other family as we got a chance to see the Iberostar Paraiso complex (HUGE!). Check in went smoothly. I had sent an email the week before requesting a jungle view room second or third floor. We received a very friendly response within 4 hours telling me that my request was noted and all attempts would be made to accommodate us. We were on the second floor of building 14 facing the jungle, probably halfway between the lobby bar and the beach. The room was very clean. The shower was quite large. There was plenty of water, soda and beer in the mini fridge. We left $3 a day and requested more water and soda even though the welcome letter states the fridge is filled every other day. The fridge was filled every day which was nice. Coffee in the room was good as well. We did notice the air goes off when you open the balcony and leave the room. It comes back on when you enter the room or shut the slider. The howler monkeys, peacocks and roosters were our morning wake up call.... they start around 5:30 am. Previous reviews had us concerned about the bed as we were expecting to feel like we were sleeping on a floor. Not the case at all. There was some cushion - I would call it a firm mattress and we slept very well. I know you can request a foam pad if you find the bed too hard - we had seen the pads being brought from a room when some people were checking out and I had also checked at the front desk just in case we needed one. The size of the resort was perfect - not too big as the the Paraiso Resort (del Mar, Beach, Lido, Maya, Grand) and definitely not too small. The pool was kept very clean. It was nice to see a child's pool as well plus a small playground area for the younger ones. There was also a game pool for water basketball and volley ball. The aqua bar was apparently cold and tended to be filled with loud young adults. The noise from that bar does not travel far at all as it is sunken into the grounds. We were always able to find chairs by the pool however we would be there no later than 9 am. Sometimes you would find two single chairs not together but there was always room to move them around. The same goes for the beach as far as seating. The beach was beautiful. The sand berms looked like large rocks and did not detract from the over appeal. Maybe it's because we are from New England and are used to the rocks...... It also reminded me of some of the beaches in Kauai. There are plenty of water sports to get involved in if you desire. The Star Friends will strike up a conversation to see if you are interested in a game of volley ball, tug of war or even yoga on the beach. They don't press you, though, if you say you are enjoying just sitting and relaxing. The setting of having a jungle between the Tucan and the Quetzel was one of the biggest reasons for us choosing this resort. Yes, the pathways are slightly uneven and not brightly lit at night but this is in order to blend into the jungle. You can certainly walk around the perimeter of the resort if you find the jungle walk an issue. Be prepared to see all sorts of wildlife on your walks.... howler monkeys, agouti (small rodents that are more like a large guinea pig), peacocks, iguanas, roosters and so much more. We had another group of monkeys playing in the trees between buildings 13 and 14 as well as in the trees along the perimeter walk outside building 13. A mama with a baby on her back and papa walked across our balcony the day before we left while I was sitting on the balcony just listening to the jungle sounds! We loved the food! You have to be hard pressed to not find something you like!!! We took advantage of the breakfast, lunch and dinner buffets in both the Tulum and Cozumel restaurants - the omelete station was my favorite while my husband seemed to enjoy the freshly made fried eggs. Fresh juices were also always being made. We found the food to be hot when it should be hot, and cold when it should be cold. I would watch when a new platter was brought out ..... the best way to know you are getting fresh food. FYI, the Cozumel buffettis open pretty much 24 hours if you need to eat at odd hours. The palapa grills down at the beach were also very good and served a lighter breakfast starting around 10 am. The hamburgers being grilled in the early afternoon always made me hungry. Have some ice cream when the cart comes out..... very good. We ate at the Tropical restaurant (appetizer was fried grouper...yummy) and truly enjoyed our meals. I ordered shrimp while my husband ordered a flank steak... we shared and had surf and turf. The Mexican restaurant was the only other a la carte available to us unless we wanted to eat at 9pm..... it was ok, to me nothing different from any Mexican restaurant back home. It was nice, though, to sit down and have a little fancier dinner - dress up, a waiter, not having to get all your food from a buffet. Henry and Nelson, two of the bartenders in the Tucan lobby bar, were extremely nice. They used \"the good stuff\" when asked and introduced us to a few new drinks. The buffet restaurants do have a hostess and waiters... David at the Cozumel buffet at the Quetzel was our favorite. Very nice and very attentive. We asked to be seated in his area when he was working. He has been their for 8 years. The Tucan and the Quetzel resort is the oldest of the Iberostars in Mexico - in talking with people that have gone to other Iberostars in Mexico and elsewhere, I found that many people said that this was their 3rd, 4th, or more time coming back to this particular resort. They state it seems the employees have been here longer and have \"their act together\" in every way. The size of the resort makes it possible for employees to recognize you and you to recognize them. We would tip our waiters and bartenders even though it was not expected. I can't say it caused us to get any better service but we felt good giving it to them as they worked very hard to make sure we had a pleasant stay. One last quick note. If you want to have a private photograph sitting, where a photographer takes photos of you maybe down at the beach or pool or wherever you want, just go to the photo shop in the Quetzel lobby and make an appointment. There is no sitting fee. We had about 30 pictures of us taken at the beach - bought 2 for $16.

We had a double on the ground floor in building 18 of the Tucan. No problems. No noise. No monkeys, nothing to complain about. Very clean and good beds. Great tv - but barely stayed awake long enough in the evenings to watch. Bathrooms very new, good shower pressure, hot water and really appreciated the hair dryer in the bathroom. Nice touch. Food- buffet food was very good. If you want good Mexican guacamole and fresh corn tortillas this is the place. We tended to eat more \"local\" foods at the buffet and didn't go for the more \"northern\" traditional foods like carvery meats or breads. I think that made a difference in that we think the food was excellent and ate accordingly. Drinks/bar - Very nice drinks, especially when we requested our own version of the standard gimlet. Both the wait staff and bar tenders were very accomodating and offered good brands of gin as opposed to the house brand. This is where the Spanish really helped put that extra sparkle in our drinks. Beach- the only slight slight disappointment was the fact that it is clear the resorts are all battling the seas to keep their beached intact. That said, the property has the best beach and deck chair/palapa situation in the entire cluster of resorts in the area. Definitely book here is you want the best beach.

We had never been to the Riviera Maya, however, so we decided to try the Iberostar Tucan with our 3 children because they love the all-inclusive type vacations. It generally also works well for us, but the Iberostar Tucan was a nightmare. We booked 2 rooms. Although both rooms were supposed to be non-smoking, one smelled like a stale ashtray. We requested to be moved, but management told us they could not accomodate us if we wanted two rooms near each other, which we did since we have small kids. So, we were stuck with a smelly room. That was not the worst problem, however, because our videocamera was stolen from our room while we were out for the day. Not only did we lose our camcorder, but we also lost the CD's that were in the camera bag and those contained videos of our kids' activites over the past 6-9 months. those memories obviously cannot be replaced. To make matters even worse, hotel management was totally unsympathetic and uncaring. They told us that since the camera was not locked in the safe, it was not their responsibility. This is a ridiculous policy, especially since the safe is only about 8\"x10\" in size and we already had our passports, wallets, jewelry and cell phones in there. How could we possibly fit all our other things, including our Nikon SLR camera and othe things we consider valuable (clothes,etc.), in such a small safe. More importantly, however, why shouldn't we be able to rest assured that our belongings are safe and secure in a locked room in a hotel that promotes itself as \"five star\"? Since the only people who had access to our room were hotel employees, it is unbelievable that the Iberostar Hotel should be able disclaim all responsibility for the negligent hiring and supervision of its own employees? In other words, what the hotel is saying is that even if you lock your room when you leave, nothing is safe in there, and hotel employees are free to steal whatever is in your room, including your clothes, luggage, shoes, toiletries, etc. and, on top of it all, the hotel claims that it has absolutely no liability. This is absurd. So if you go to the Iberostar Tucan, beware of the thieves. You should also also be prepared for unhelpful and uncaring hotel management, non-existent security and unreasonable security policies!!

Both resorts are fine, yet different: the Tucan is larger, busier, and slightly more upscale. There hardly seems to be any reason to venture off site insofar as the amenities can keep most people entertained for a week or perhaps more: restaurants, bars, evening stage productions, swimming and lounging around the pool, playing in the ocean, sunning or walking on the beach beach, kayaks, catamarans, scuba, various organized activities, walking through tamed jungle in center of resort observing various birds and animals: examples include peacock and hens, monkeys, flamingos, etc. and, of course, a pair of caged Tucans, and much more. A mall across the street and a short walk to the north can be a destination for an evening walk (it has a Starbucks). The staff are great and it's good vibes all around. We recommend taking a meal at the adjoining resort, Quetzel, for a slight change of pace, e.g. the grotto with waterfall and swans. The Tucan is fine both for families with children and for couples. Despite advice from the front desk to the contrary, we recommend that you go with the flow, i.e. get up at dawn to find a place you like either at the pool or on the beach - provided that you genuinely intend to spend your day there. Otherwise, good luck. The same advice could apply to getting good seating for the evening shows, i.e. get there early; but, if not, there are many tables/seats, and the ones further away from the stage have big-screen TVs. Another tip: for a nice cocktail only the lobby bar and, in the evening, the theater bar, have the top-shelf liquor (you may have to ask for it). A gratuity is not necessary every time, but seems appropriate - especially when a server takes your drink order and brings it to you. The beach and lunch bars are adequate to quench the thirst; also, there is a pool bar ,which is segregated from the large main pool. If I had to look for a fault, it might be visual effect of the huge sandbags on the beach, but I understand that these are necessary in order to restore the beach from, and to buffer the hurricanes that occur from time to time. On the other hand, the tourists (mostly kids and young dads) sure like to catch a wave and then try to stay on top of a sandbag - it's all good. Travel arrangements, with Signature Vacations (via CAA), as well as the check-in and check out were trouble-free. The resort is busy, so the room assignment may not be the one you had hoped for; and, if so, it should not be a problem, because so little time should be spent in the room.

But, if you only want the nuts and bolts: Iberostar Tucan is a fabulously beautiful place with clean, bright, quiet rooms and a sensational staff. Beautiful beach and pool with loads of activities and nearby excursions. Hard to top it as an all-inclusive for families or couples EXCEPT the food is below average and this can be a downer on an otherwise fantastic resort. Now for the details: Getting there. We flew Denver to Cancun direct and then figured out our own ground transportation to the hotel. You have various options available that range from a cheap bus to Playa del Carmen to an expensive taxi directly to your hotel. A shared shuttle is a reasonable compromise but still pricey if your more than three people. If you are on a budget, the bus is a great option as it is cheap and combined with a $5USD taxi ride gets you there in a reasonable time frame. The shuttle in my mind was an overpriced bus. We were lucky to be the first off but those that rode further were on for a long time. The taxis are exorbitantly expensive ($150) given that the ride back to the airport is literally one third of the fare. THE RESORT. Grounds. Iberostar has a spectacularly beautiful place in Playa. Tucan and Quetzal are mirro image resorts that share all of the same facilities and are priced identically. Apparently the reason for the dual resort thing has to do with marketing and contracts with tour operators. The two resorts form a rectangle with the entrance at the top and the beach at the boittom. Quetzal forms the right side of the rectangle while Tucan forms the left and the common facilities are down the middle. Both Tucan and Quetzal have their own large entrance/lobby area with the check-in counter, guest services desk, a bar and some shops. Multiple three level units of guest rooms stretch along the long sides of the rectangle from the lobby to the beach. Down the middle can be found the buffet restaurants, a large show bar, several a la carte restaurants, the pool, two pool-side buffet restaurants, a pool bar, a beach bar, showers and some small activity areas. In the midst of the rectangle though is a jungle that really is one of the highlights of the place. During the day, the jungle is alive with all manner of birdsong. Strolling along the meandering pathways within the jungle (there are outside paths that are more direct and quicker that are accessed easily from anywhere) you will encounter a veritable menagerie of animal life including peacocks, peahens, chickens, howler monkeys, toucans, agoutis (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_agouti) and a mammal that we have yet to identify. There are also koi ponds with resident freshwater turtles and egrets, a flamingo pond and a duck and swan pond near the Quetzal restaurant. The jungle provided no end of entertainment for our three year old daughter and made the resort really magical especially while walking the well lit paths at night. Mosquitoes were a minor issue but we used no repellent and sustained only a few bites each during the week we were there. The beach. Very wide with loads of chairs, sun umbrellas to borrow and talcum powder sand. About twenty feet out there are artificial wave breaks that serve to protect the shallower areas for younger kids and provide no end of fun for adventuresome adults. When the surf is high waves crash over these wavebreaks. The water is only about 4.5 feet deep in front of them and the breaks are about 6 feet high. Standing in front of the breaks as the waves roll in is akin to being in a washing machine and when the waves break just right, people are hurled over the smooth and slippery surface to be unceremoniously dumped on the other side with a soft landing. It sounds violent and it kind of is but it is quite safe and as much fun as an adult as you ever had as a kid playing in the waves. The sheltered areas made for excellent wading and playing opportunities for our daughter and she played in the sand as long as we would let her. A constant breeze blows either from the east or the north keeping things cool. Dressel Divers offer many options for watersports and do several dives a day (see later). The pool. Gorgeous, huge, refreshing are all words that accurately describe the pool. Unfortunately, annoying could also be added. When you first arrive at the resort, you are given a package that includes a notice that states the hotel policy forbidding the reserving of chairs by the pool. Despite this people begin arriving at 5 in the morning (I'm not kidding) to toss their towels on ten chairs before going back to bed, having breakfast and eventually showing up around noon when they actually take possession. For those of us who follow the rules this meant never getting a chair by the pool unless you were out by 6:30 or so to reserve your own. The beach had the same problem but we were always able to secure something there. The one exception to this was weekends when most people are turning over and so chairs are available pretty much anytime anywhere. The rooms. The rooms were bright, well appointed and clean. A safe is provided as is a mini bar that is restocked every second day. Room service is also available for all meals. Beds were on the firm side and a tad small for a couple but still comfortable. There is no option of closing off part of the room so kiddos will be in with you. All rooms had nice balconies though almost none face the ocean. Most face either outwards or inwards on the resort center. Maid service was excellent and like on all Holland America Ships, towel animals were made everyday providing yet another source of joy for our 3 year old. One minor negative related to the lack of outlets to use for recharging. Another minor issue for some, but not us, was the lack of a tub. There may be tubs in other rooms but ours only had a shower with a removable handheld spray on a hose. The food. We realize that being an all-inclusive means food that is all-inclusive. i.e.; food that will appeal to all tastes. However, having been to other all-inclusives with far better offerings than Iberostar, we definitely felt this was a pretty big problem. In fact, this resort would be a sure 5 star deal with guaranteed return business from us if not for the food. A colleague of mine warned me of this before I left stating that the food was 'terrible'. While I wouldn't go quite that far, I will say that it was pretty bad. The buffet offerings were varied but all shared the same bland taste or lack there of. Fruits and vegetables were stellar as were the chips and guacamole and salsa but nearly everything else was poor. Several a la carte restaurants are available and you are guaranteed three reservations per week and can be wait-listed for other days if no availability exists. Of these we tried the Caribbean (plain) Japanese (good) and the steakhouse (poor). I won't belabor the point any further except to say that if food is important to you, you may wish to look elsewhere despite the excellence of everything else at this resort. ACTIVITIES Entertainment Because of our kiddo we didn't get to see any of the nightly shows but from what we heard and saw in rehearsals, they seemed to be actually pretty darned good. Certainly far better than the silliness that passes as shows on the cruise ships that we have been on. Sports All manner of stuff was on offer and though we didn't make use of any, archery, ping pong, beach volleyball, aerobics, yoga and a fully equipped gym were all available. Diving Dressel Divers is the on site dive shop and runs a very good operation. I brought my own gear so I can't attest to the quality of their equipment. They offer open water and advanced PADI courses as well as try SCUBA in the pool and numerous dives for divers of all levels each day. They also offer snorkeling trips and dive excursions to nearby Cenotes (freshwater caves) and Cozumel. As an advanced diver with dives logged around the world, I don't hesitate to say that the Dressel guides are great but the local dive sites are nothing special. I do highly recommend Cenotes and Cozumel though as these are both world class dive sites although the former will take up two thirds of a day and the latter and entire day. N.B.: I highly recommend booking your dives in advance. A 15% discount is given when you do things this way. (www.dresseldivers.com) Away from the resort Tucan is conveniently located for trips to many nearby sites including the town of Playa del Carmen and many tourist attractions. Taxis are hailed and prices given prior to leaving. The hotle also offers excursions with transport included. I hope that this was a helpful if lengthy review. I have added some photos to help give a sense of some of what I have described.

We researched for months before choosing this resort and it was everything we wanted. The grounds were beautiful and the wildlife made every walk an adventure. We saw monkeys, peacocks, flamingos, turtles, various species of birds, etc. The beach was beautiful and the waves were great fun to play in. Even on the days the red flags were up, we could play in the waves although on the windiest days poor swimmers or children would have found the waves too much. You could walk for a long way in both directions along the beautiful, powdery, white sand beaches. The first week we were there, there were numerous beach chairs available until at least mid-morning. The second week we were there, the hotel was busier and most of the chairs were taken or held by 8:00 or 9:00 a.m. The service was exceptional. Check-in, food and drink servers, maid service and check-out were all efficient and friendly. Our requests were answered immediately and with a smile. The rooms were kept clean and the fridge re-stocked every other day. We had e-mailed ahead requesting a non-smoking room, not on the first floor. We were given exactly what we requested. The food in all the restaurants was good. Lots of choices. There were numerous places to enjoy breakfast (two buffet restaurants, continental breakfast in the beach bar and buffet in steak house restaurant). Lunch was also served in two different places and supper was available in two buffet restaurants and your choice of five a la carte restaurants. There was also an ice cream bar near the beach and pool. This is the third all inclusive we have stayed at and the shows at this hotel were by far the best we've seen. The star friends are talented, enthusiastic and hard working. We did miss a few shows as they don't start until 9:45 p.m. and if we had tours booked the next day we found the shows were too late. This was our 25th wedding anniversary, this trip was everything we were looking for in a great vacation. We also spent considerable time away from the hotel and we enjoyed these tours as well. We went to the Tulum and Coba ruins; the Xel-ha and Xcaret eco-parks; and a sunset dinner cruise near Cancun. All were great but be sure to ask distances from the hotel because sometimes you spent more time travelling to the site than expected. The hotel itself is in the gated resort community of Playacar and it is 1/3 of a mile walk from the hotel to the Playacar plaza and a 1.6 mile walk to Playa Del Carmen.

Checkin was a breeze , a cold drink, and the myan people are wonderful.The room was clean, bright and roomy. The kingsize bed was fairly hard but we adjusted fine. The maids always left some sort of towel art every day. The grounds were imaculately kept with the grounds keepers out every morning by 6:00 am. The buildings themselves are three stories high and are quite colorful. The resort is riddled with pathways that wander through a natural jungle setting, providing opportunities to view the wild life. The monkeys were something to see.The food at the resort was varied everyday and you can always find something to please your palate at the buffets. We attended the steak house(alacarte) and were quite happy. We were not as happy with the Italian resturaunt, that being the food was somewhat tasteless. These were the only two we attended as the buffets were as good or better.The beach was amazing, white powderlike sand and blue-green water beyond. Unlike some of the resorts you do not need\u00a0 water socks. There was no coral to worry about, only sand bottom. The whales as they are referred to were alot of fun in the waves.The service was excellent in all areas. The people, always freindly and ready to help. If you plan on visiting the beachside bar look up our favourite two bartenders, Ceaser And Halario (I niknamed him Hillarious).

I normally do not eat ice cream, but I had at least 1 ice cream cone a day... When the ice cream cart is rolled out at the pool and the line is long, you know why.. it is a must try... Secondly, someone had written that the coffee was horrible... not so much. The coffee was also incredible... When it was made correctly from the coffee maker it was delicious.. During our trip we met friends that we hung out with during the week and I commented about how delicious the coffee was and everyone agreed.. another must try... We ate at some of the A la carte restaurants, they were all good. Although there was one that was not mentioned at all which was the Caribbean restaurant, it was very good and probably our favorite out of all the A la carte's.. We had nice weather everyday, only 1 night of rain.. However, it was WINDY!!! which sometimes made it chilly on the beach and at the pool... So, if you are going, you may want to pack some warm clothes to wear at night, it was sometimes downright chilly.. There were a lot of comments about the smoking at the resort and I would have to agree. It was especially noticeable in the lobby bar in the evening...

Second time at Iberostar resort. Traveled from 1/29/09 - 2/2/09 with my wife and 2 of 3 kids. Son 8, daughter 5. Left our 2 year old home as we thought she was still a little young. Overall mexico and the area we stayed in (Playacar) is beautiful. We were extremely happy with the resort and the location. There are a ton of offsite activities within 20-30 minutes of the resort. I'll try to break it down by catagory. Travel: Flew from Philadelphia direct to Cancun Intenational about 4 hour flight. The resort and Playacar is about 40 miles south of the airport and 50 miles south of Cancun. I takes about on hour to get from the airport the the resort. We rented a car and driving was very easy. The reason we rented a car is we are very spontaneous and don't have the patience to wait for scheduled buses and tours. Although we would have probably been ok without the car for this trip. Area - We stayed in Iberostar Tucan located in Playacar which is a cute residental and resort section just south of Playa Delcarmen. There is a sister resort at this location Iberostar Quetzel. We felt very safe on anf offsite in this area as well as downtown Playa Delcarmen. Here's a cool map of the location: http://locogringo.com/maps/tour/140a-t.html Resort: Iberostar Tucan/Quetel is an incredible resort. We stayed the Tucan side. The Quetzel side is a mirror of Tucan. The complex is designed around a natural terrain of jungle, waterfalls, and slopes. Yes there are monkeys. We stayed for 5 days and saw several monkeys at least 3 days. There about 15 monkeys roaming around the resort. You'll hear them shaking around the trees as you walk alng the trails. There were 2 baby monkeys clinging on to mom. The building design and rooms are gorgeous. We stayed in an oceanfront suite (buildng 10) which had 2 sleeper couches and one king size bed. this worked out perfect for the kids. We we on the 2nd floor and the views were beautiful although slightly blocked by coconut trees. I would recommend the 3rd of first floors. The oceanfront rooms on the Quetzel side seems a little closer to the sea and had unobstructed views. The area around the cafe and paths from the lobby to the rooms and pool were a little nicer on the Quetzel side too. Although it was nice to discover new things when walking from the Tucan side to the Queztel side. There was a beautiful waterfall with all kinds of ducks and birds, tortuises, a group of flamingos and misc. birds and rodents. Food & Service: Perfect. Great food at the night buffet and lunch areas arond the pool. They changed the selections around enough that you could eat something different every day ad night. We ate at te La Hacenta mexican restaraunt which was very good. They have a kids menu too. All of the service staff was very friendly and responsive. Although your not supposed/required to tip we took $75 in one dollar bills and tried to spead it to all the staff thoughout the resort. They are not expecting or looking for it but I know these people make very little money and really appreciated it. We received 5 star service with or without tipping. Activities: We really did our own thing while onsite. Between eating, the going the beach, then to the pool ad back to the beach and the pool.. oh and then stop for the 3rd time for ice cream (and cervesa for dad).. well you get it. They always had activities going on that you were welcome to join in but not forced to participate. Volleyball, boca ball, sumo wrestling, pingpong, water aerobics. My son and I tried scuba diving in the pool which was really cool, He's only 8 and you have to be 10 o if your kids are close and want to try it, make sure you (and your child) tell the scuba instructor your 10. At 8 my son was fine and loved it. In fact he did it last year when he was 7 at Iberostar Punta Cana (great trip too). There are nightly interactive shows fo the kids and a really good magician on Sat night. Weather: Beutiful. Was 87F when arrived. 82 the next day. 78 the next. 82 the next. 86 the day we left. We did get rain for about 2 hours one afternoon and very windy and cooler (78F) one day. There is humidity so add 5 degreesF to the actual temps. Beaches: Nice. Yes there are these huge 40 ft \"sand whales along the water. Thought this we detract from the beauty but didn't bother us. They are covered with algea so they just kinda blend in now. In fact they have become an amenity for kids and adults. #1 the seas were pretty rough for 3 of 5 days and the bag helped buffer the surf and created these lagoons the kids could safely swim in. #2 they were fun th play on. Be careful though some spots are slippery. One day the sea was calm enough to really enjoy just floating around and looking at your toes 6 feet down. That's what the caribean is supposed to be about. All in all the water was beautiul although we would have liked fo it to be a little calmer the whole trip. The sand on the bach was white and fine. The beaches are pretty big and fully restored from the hurricans years before. Offsite Activities: - Xcaret is a must. Plan on a full day trip as the park is huge. We swam with the dolphins in the park. The 30 minute experience was plenty for our kids. They have 45 minute one where the dolphins push you though the water but that was too time for our kids. Believe it or not the 30 minutes swimming around with them was plenty. Your trending water just about the whole time so it can be tiring with 2 children grapping onto you for 30 minutes. Either way.do the dolphins. the kids loved it and us parents did too. The park is mainly water oriented so bring you bathing suite and towel cuase you'll be in the water alot. There is a underground cave river swim that was really cool. You swim through this river and cave system across the entire park. The whole swim takes about 30-45 minutes in total. You can exit at different points if you don't want to do the whole thing at once or just are ready to stop (like our kids were after about 20 mins). Be sure to have your kids wear t-shirts/surf shirts under their life vest. By the end our kids underarms were raw and they where really uncomfortable and cranky. We should have stopped about 3/4 of the way though looking back at it now. Theres a ton of other stuff in the park like beaches, tubes, seawater pools on the caribean, a sightseeing tower that rotates thats about 300ft in the air. aquirium, bat cave, mayan ruins, restaruants..... As you can see theres alot to do and well worth the $79/person. Dolphins were another $109/person. Seems expensive at first but it is a full day of fun. ATV & Zip Iine adventure: Sheeeeeww. Our activies coordinator tried to book us on an ATV tour that was full but was reluctantly sent us to another that also had zip lines and a cenote hoe to swim. Here's a link to the place: http://cozumelcruiseexcursions.com/ZipLineJungleAdventure.htm For us it was one of the greatest experiences ever. It is not for the risk adverse or faint hearted though. The place was called Jungle Adventures. It right across the highway in Playa Delcarmen about 15 minutes from the resort. This place was run by the \"seat of their pants\". We show up on this corner street in town see some very muddy ATVS outside of this shack and we were like \"I hope this is not the tour\". Sure enough were here. They people running it seemed a little \"seedy\". Let me stop here by saying this sound horrific but for us this is what we love about these trips. Experencing a total different culture and attidude and sense of uncertainy. Our kids are just \"go with the flow\" and taking it all in. Well we and a group of about 15 ATVS hop on and get ready for our adventure. My 5 year old rode with me. I sat her in front of me. My 8 year old son rode on the back with my wife. The tour guide says \"ok we are going to ride for 10 miles, then do the zip lines, and finish with swimming in an underground cenote (water hole) and come back. OK. Off we go out of town and down long road that went from blacktop to dirt. to trail, to bumpy trail, to bumpier trail and we arrive at this shack in the middle of the jungle. 2 people did veer off the trail on the way and had to be rescued by the one of the guides (including my wife and son). No one hurt though. The guide yells \"OK. time for the zip line. Get our harnesses on\". We did not think they would let the kids go (nor did e know if we should let them). Well they did and our kids were ready and raring. On with the harness and walk the zip line. OK its 3 sections of an aluminum ladder tied together to get to the top of s 40 foot tree stand. Hmmm. Are we crazy. Yep. I was going to go with my daughter but she refused and only wanted to go by herself. So I only helped her up the ladder and off she goes by herself about 200 yards across the jungle. To top it off the guides were constantly teasing us about the equipment be faulty and harnesses not attached to the line correctly. Off went my son and wife. Everyone made it with big smiles. OK that was cool now it time to go right. NOPE 2 more zip lines. Both setup about the same as the first with slighlty differing degrees of difficulty. Believe it or not we all made it and and kids were absolutely amazed. WOW! Was that COOL. Off the the cenote now. This was about a 5 ft diamer hole in the ground in which you climbed down a 30ft ladder to get to th bottom. WOW this was cool. An undground swim hole with stalagtiets surrounding you. Water was cool but refreshing being it was 83 degrees that day. Downtown Playa delcarmen. Very cool downtown strip with a ton of local shops and restaurants.

However, by boyfriend and I went in January of 2008. I was SOOOOO disappointed that the beach had eroded to the point on non-existence (it just happened a week earlier and nobody told us from the travel company, etc.) So, we make do and still manage to swim and have fun (argghh). I found it to still be nice, but with some tired aspects; the shows had gotten really poor and low quality productions from the first time I went in 1999. Also the 2nd to last night, by boyfriend got really, really sick and it was definitely from the steak house that is at the beach lunch place, which turns into the steak house at night . His dinner was not hot at all so we sent it back. I saw the cook just take the steak off the plate and put on the grille again and leaving the reast of the dish cold. My boyfriend ate it anyway even though I suggest he do not and we just go to the nice buffet. Well sure enough, in the middle of the night sick as a dog. At about 3 a.m. he had to to to the medic, which they say they have 24 hours on call. That was useless. They do not have any immodium or anitbiotics or anything to stop \"you know what\" and vomitting. They said they can send him into town by cab to go to the pharmacy with a prescription for $80 or something like that. In any event, my boyfriend was sick all night and we barely made it to transfer ride to Cancun to go home. Once in Cancun airport, we got the appropriate Immodium and Pedialyte type meds. If they have a medic on staff, they should supply them with the appropriate over the counter meds for us to buy. Hindsight, the only time I ever got sick in Mexico was my first time in Playa, but I chalked it up to eating off the resort in Chicken Itza, but now thinking about it, that was the first time I stayed at the Iberostar Quetzal.......although in all honesty, I could have had heat stroke maybe because it was really hot in Chichen Itza. So, based on that, we will never go to the Iberostar unfortunately again. I hope they see this review and work on it. Otherwise, it's a nice place because of the uniqueness of the jungle look and all the monkeys and animals (also, they had an abundance of cereques creatures running around, which I didn't remember from the last time - they are rodent-type creatures, but really cute). So, I loved the jungle theme and monkeys are my favorite! This stretch of beach is generally the best stretch of beach in Playa, but with the erosion...... I stayed at the Riu Palace Riviera Maya the year it opened in 2007 I think it was and that is by far, better food, rooms, drinks, shows and is a little more pristine, however, you don't get the look of the jungle and the animals (but, I would go with that higher end resort in the future - in my opinion). My girlfriend did cut her foot and again, we went to their on-call doctor - 3 times as he was not there when he was supposed to be. The guy didn't even have band aids or antiseptic for her foot. They just try to get you to pay lots of money for a prescription. So, be aware, when traveling bring your own first aid kit with Bacitracin, band aids, Immodium and definitely get a prescription for your MD for an antibiotic and you will be all set.

We arrived at the hotel approx 1700 hrs and were most impressed by the lush reception. We were greeted with a non alcoholic cocktail, very refreshing after a long trip from the uk. Within about ten minutes we had filled in the relevant forms and taken to our room by the bell boy. The Room The room was perfect, spacious, two double beds, safe (free of charge) mini bar restocked every other day without fail, hairdryer, very powerful shower and clean towels everyday if u wanted them. Air conditioning excellent. The only thing i would say was the balcony was a bit uninviting as it was a bit shady but hardly spent much time in the room anyway. The Food The food is amazing, out of this world could not believe the variety, breakfast consisted of everything u could imagine, an omlette chef, smoothie maker, pancakes, breads, cereal, hash browns, sausages, toast the list is endless. Lunch This was great right at the pool side, again so much to choose from, meats veg, fresh salad, hot dogs burgers, wedges and unlimited nachos and cheese sauce yum! Dinner Again excellent A la Cart Steak house was the best excellent Japanese fun, foods ok but nothing special Italian excellent would recommend Mexican wouldn't recommend The pool The pool was massive whereever you went u were not in sight of anybody. Entertainment around the pool throughout the day, is slightly noisey though but fun if u want to join in. Wasn't a problem getting a lounger. The beach Lovely maids bring u drinks and u can take food from the beach bar down with u. water turquoise and sand so white. There are sandbags in the sea to protect from hurricanes but didn't spoil it. Entertainment team Worked exceptionally hard and were good fun. however they do try and get u to join in but u can say no if u want to. Shows in the evening a bit repetitive but after a few amazing cocktails its ok. Table service all night in the entertainment theatre so u were never without a drink. My fave cocktail was the coco loco. Location The hotel is well located, a short taxi ride from Playa del carmen 50 peso or 5 dollers, agree price before u leave. local buses very accessible from playa which will take u to most places for very cheap including cancun which is 45 mins away. Lastly the hotel is very very humid so u only need to wear minimal.

This was our first stay at an Iberostar but not the first at an all-inclusive. Iberostar was recommended by friends and this particular one by our travel agent. This was just a quick getaway to cure the winter blues. It worked. This AI is not for people who enjoy fine dining or lavish settings. It is three story buildings located throughout a well-kept jungle setting. We woke up to monkeys howling and playing outside our balcony, flamingos squawking, and constant jungle bird sounds. The hotel is actually two separate hotels distinguished only by the lobby and check-in areas. Facilities are utilized by both. The staff was one of the most accommodating we've experienced. Everyone working there definitely enjoys their work and it shows through their actions. The lobby bar was our favorite to hang out in and people watch when we weren't enjoying the pool and beach facilities. The drinks throughout the hotel varied in their strength and flavor depending on the bartender. The lunch buffets by the beach were not very good as they didn't keep the food hot enough, but the make your own nachos were enough to keep us happy until we went in for the main buffet. We enjoyed the views from the Quetzal-side buffet better, but the food is the same in both. The buffets are not spectacular, but there is enough variety to find something you'll like and you eventually end up eating too much. You have to make reservations for the ala carte restaurants and I advise you do that immediately as one we were interested in was not available our entire trip. You can dress appropriately and stop in to see if they have availability without a reservation, which we did once successfully. We tried the Mexican, the Japanese Grill, and the Italian. The Italian has a delicious appetizer bar and the Mexican has delicious kabob tacos. Don't laugh about the tacos, just try them. We took their bike tour into Playa del Carmen our first full day to see how easy it would be to walk into town and the following day walked the approximate 1.5 miles io the main area of Playa. We also tried their complimentary scuba lesson in the pool and were sorry we didn't try it earlier in our visit as we would have booked a scuba lesson/ocean dive trip if we had more time. This is a great hotel to vacation.

My fiance and I stayed here from 1/19/09-1/26/09 so 7 nights 8 days and we were far from the cold snowy weather in Chicago so we were happy to be far away from there. We will admit after reading the reviews and reading everything about the monkeys & even having my travel agent tell me last minute \"oh btw make sure to hide anything that's shiney or jewlery as the monkeys sometimes get into the rooms and take shiney things\" had us looking for a last minute change of resorts. In the end we are happy we did not change but we went in with little expectations and were a bit surprised that it really wasn't that bad for us. We booked this via Liberty Travel for the hotel only as Liberty will meet or beat any other price you find and we found they had some great prices. If you would like contact info for my agent please let me know as they can assist anyone from any location. Email me at [-] I redeemed my AA Miles for the air portion of this trip and we did this back in September when we booked the entire trip. So here we go: I put my personal rating next to each topic Weather 9/10 stars- it was perfect. We heard the week prior it was rainy and a bit colder. It was a bit colder 1 day during the day and a couple of nights so if you do go this time of the year bring warmer clothes for the evening. The sun did shine everyday and thank GOD no rain. It was amazing weather. Arrival at airport rating is 8/10-It took awhile to get to this resort as the Olympus Tour bus had to drop off 2 other couples at 2 other locations. Otherwise it is what it is. We knew it was out there. Interesting ride there thats for sure. Also it took us awhile to leave the airport as we were waiting for our van. Check In Rating is 1/10-The blonde lady at the front desk wasn't that friendly and didn't provide any additional customer service. She stated our room was ready and quickly showed us where it was on the map. That was the extent of it. Now I work for a hotel here in the states and IF I am ever at the front desk I personally take time to make sure all guests know about everything we have and where everything is. I wish they provided a tour of the resort as it wasn't until the 2nd to 3rd morning we learned where the real big breakfast buffet was(On Tucan side in Tulum area) and it wasn't until the last day we learned where the bigger better lunch buffet was. (On Quetzal side in Cozumel room) Trust me this lunch buffet was better then the pool side buffets. Well just our opinion. So we were disappointed with the lack thereof for customer service. I was just so happy our room was ready as we arrived around 2:30 pm ish and others had to wait for there room. Also we didn't even know our resort had a disco until about the 4th night into our trip. This is on the Quetzal side. We did head there 1 night and had a good time. It was actually pretty busy the night we were there. Room rating is 8/10-We loved our room and location. I did email the resort prior to arriving to try to request a room without a ton of monkeys as I was worried and we did leave my jewelry behind. My request was met and we were in building 12 room 1230 on the 2nd floor. Granted I did email the resort to have choc covered strawberries in our room to surprise my fiance and this request was met too. There wasn't any smell at all in our room. We had 1 problem with the toilet being clogged 1 day and it did take 3 phone calls to the front desk to finally have someone come and use the plunger. Shame on me for not knowing they didn't have many ocean view rooms. Thats probably the only disappointment we had because we do like to sit on the balcony and listen to our portable IPOD player that we bring and drink some wine and take in the sights and ocean. Oh well next time might have to stay at the Iberostar Grand Paraiso which I hear is amazing, We were close to the pool and ocean so not a far walk at all. A bit further from the lobby area but we didn't mind getting that exercise. Again anything is better then the awful weather here in Chicago. We were happy to get away. Also we did tip housekeeping and they did re-stock our refridge everyday if we did need anything. I know some spanish so I would leave them some notes from time to time. Bad thing about the marble floors is YES you do hear everything when people leave there room and sometimes the ice machine that was near our room. Oh well. Yes beds are hard but what I found worked for me was I took a towel and rolled it and put it in my pillow since I have neck problems. Then I kept a pillow under my legs when I slept at night and I had no problems. Yes you do hear the monkeys howling or whatever they do around 5-6 am but thank GOD it didn't happen every morning. We did bring ear plugs but they bothered my ears. I am used to my cats waking us up so it is what it is. I didn't come there to sleep a ton but sure it would have been nice to sleep in a bit but no biggie. Sleep is for when you are dead. Sorry just being honest. The weather was way too nice to be sleeping. Only other complaint I had about the room is the way the bathroom door is configured so close to the toliet just odd. We did enjoy the balcony. I brought my own hair dryer so no issues there. No they do not provide conditioner for your hair. Safe was nice and worked fine for us. Our room was very clean kudos to housekeeping as I truly know how hard of a job that is and probably even harder with the marble floors and stairs too. No elevators. Location rating is 10/10-perfect for us as we wanted something that wouldn't cost a ton to get to Playa Del Carmen 5th Ave. You could walk there from this resort which it's about a 30-40 min walk depending how fast you walk. Cab ride only $5 each way. Food rating is 8/10-Well we went in with very little expectations after reading all the reviews. Now I am a bit picky about having good food but I have been to Mexico before and I know you do NOT go there for the food well this part of Mexico. Puerto Vallarta had some amazing authetic food. Again the lunch buffet that is NOT pool side is better then the pool side buffet. We lucked out and were able to eat in 5 restaurants for dinner, just had to ask and our request was met. We loved the Japanese place, and went to the Mexican place twice as we loved the appetizers and tacos there, and the steak place was ok not my personal favorite and then tried some newer 1 they re-opened but we didn't care for it at all. I should also mention that we made our reservations when we arrived on 1/19. Our first reservation was for 1/20 and thank GOD we went to the booth to see if we could get another reservation as they had some wrong info and didn't have all of our other reservations. I had to get a Manager in charge but she took care of all of this for us and then we had no problems. However this entire process took 1 hour of our time from the time we made our first reservation to the time we spent on figuring this all out the next day. They seem really laid back in Mexico unlike Chicago or the US so they are just at a slower pace out there. Again I really didn't go there for gourmet food as I have been to Cancun before so I knew it wasn't going to be perfect but we did find alot we liked and some we didn't. We didn't get sick so thank GOD for that. 1 night felt a little sick but it didn't last into the rest of the trip. Drinks rating is 10/10-from our pictures you can probably see we didn't have any complaints about the drinks. We asked the bartendars for the better alcohol and they always granted our request. We tipped them a little too. 1 thing that was different for me is I am used to being on beaches and pools where staff comes and ask you what you want and brings it to you. This does not happen there. So if you are looking for that this is not for you. We loved the DIRTY MONKEY drink which is made with vodka, bannanna and there version of chocolate which is like a kahula I think, drink made in the blender. Great stuff! Loved the COSMO martini's too and coco loco! Yummy!!!! everyone else loved the mojitos. Beach rating is 10/10-Perfect location-yes there are these sandbags but they didn't bother us. After seeing some of the other resorts beaches we learned we loved our beach there was just a ton of people Other notes comments-the grounds are beautiful and seeing all the animals was amazing and makes this resort so different. I was dissapointed that the hotel did NOT have a first aid kit as I ended up breaking my toe by stubbing it on a beach chair. Long story but they suggested I go to the Pharmacia which was at Riu Yucatan but I couldnt walk there to get the tape I needed to get. And no staff member offered to go get it for me. Sorry I am spoiled with good service and working in the hotel industry I too would like to receive amazing service so I have high expectations. We didn't see any shows but others suggested they look into having the shows earlier in the evening not so late or do different times. If you are looking to not be around a ton of people then this resort is NOT for you. I believe occupancy was at 90% when we were there and the beach was packed. Lots of people, it made it a little harder to try to get some zzz's or relax as you tend to just want to people watch all day long. There were also more kids then I thought there would be so more family oriented of a resort. Yes smoking is allowed there and at times on the beach we found it annoying but overall it was fine it wasn't a major issue. We are spoiled here with no smoking now. The pool we didn't go in as we heard how cold it was. However I really went there to enjoy the beach too. I do love swim up pool bars but didn't go to this 1 as I also heard how cold it was. However we did take a ferry 1 day with a group of 4 others and went to the Iberostar in Cozumel and they had an amazing pool with a swim up pool bar that we loved and the service there was amazing as this is a smaller resort. It's out in the middle of nowhere and the beach there isn't as nice as ours. It's more calmer there but rocks there and you have to get in the ocean off of a pier. Star friends there were so friendly to us. Take the ferry and head there or to another Iberostar to compare stuff and for a change of scenary too. We also met some wonderful people-Amanda, Greg, Suzanne & Scott, April and Clay, England crew from Manchester there for a wedding, Martin and Stacey from MN. Thanks to everyone for the great times and wonderful memories. CONGRATS to the honeymoon couples too. (Greg and Amanda and Clay and April) Also per Martin and Stacey they did not care for there oceanview room they said it had a musky smell so probably a good thing we didn't get an oceanview room. If you are looking for a 5-6 star resort and amazing gourmet food, great pool, this is NOT the resort for you. If you are looking for something totally different, great location, great beach area, great weather, decent rooms, and probably a 3-4 star resort then check this out. We would go back but we do want to check out other Iberostar resorts too for something different and to compare. Hope you find this helpful Overall rating we would give this resort is probably a 6-7 out of 10 stars.

Although I've done all inclusives twice previously in Mexico, I just don't remember the food being this bad. Other reviewers mentioned it was sort of \"par for the course \"at these resorts. The Japanese steak house was good. The only thing I can say about the other three \"reservations only \" restaurants is that they were better than the buffet. Yes, all the food was cold at the open air snack bars and buffets, but the food just didn't have ANY flavor. Everything was either bland - especially the desserts (although they look wonderful), very dry, over cooked or was an \"assortment\" dish with sauces and other additives creating unusual tastes. When do you go to an all inclusive resort for 8 days and lose weight? I was thrilled when I saw the snack bar by the beach with hamburgers and hotdogs at the ready. They were so cold - right off the grill (even when I kindly asked it to be returned to the grill, he put it back on for maybe 20 seconds) and the buns were stale and the watered down ketchup had an unusual taste. The worst thing for me was that there was no butter to be found anywhere. I hope you enjoy margerine. They even put it on your plate in the little plastic container with tongs. Sorry, I was just so disappointed! I thought it would be great to use the room service, but what's available is very disapointing and once again - cold! And don't try to take anything out of the restaurants to take to the bar or back to your room. It's a real \"No, no - even a donut! Do use the Quetzel side for the extended breakfast hours if you want eggs, bacon or sausage. (I must admit the scrambled eggs were pretty good.) Xcaret is a great attraction if you like birds, animals, and nature, and the two day ticket is a good investment if you have time. We were there during the unexpectedly cold and rainy weather the week of January 10th, but there are board games to borrow, ping pong and pool under cover. If you want to join in on the activities, the \"star preformers\" are very friendly and there are lots of things to do. The hotel just doesn't have a very good system for letting you know about them and where they will occur. Most happen on the Quetzel side of the pool and beach. The staff isn't very knowledgeable about the way the hotel operates, because I was twice sent to the front desk for information it turns out that only the \"guest services\" kiosk can take care of - not open in the afternoon. Took me two day to get a TV channel guide and another 2 days to reclaim a misplaced pair of shoes. They've made a lot of simple things more complicated than they have to be, and quite a bit of the staff only speaks Spanish. We didn't have problems getting lounges or finding a spot on the beach or around the pool (even though they were full), but both are very croweded, and the loud talkers (no particular nationality at fault) don't allow for a restful nap on the beach. Why do people have to yell when they are 3 feet away from their companions?? Although we had a lovely ocean side junior suite that was close to the beach, I don't think it was worth the extra money, but it was all that was available. The beds were very hard, but not a big deal, and the tiny ants (in our bed) were a bit distasteful. Also, we were there celebrating our 10th anniversary and were told they would do something special on our day - both before we went, and the day of our anniversary at the hotel, but nothing ever came of it. Lots of language difficulty with the front desk when calling from our room. Due to their incompetency at giving me an open line it took me 30 minutes to get an operator so I could make a credit card call to the U. S. I don't think I'd stay here again.

Our party consisted of myself, my husband, my 15 year old daughter and my mom. It was our first trip to Mexico and we were so pleased. The hotel was everything that it promised and more. I have never seen such a beautiful place. The grounds were amazing...like being in the middle of a jungle paradise. There were wonderful natural yet groomed gardens filled with beautiful wildlife and gorgeous scenery...yet at the same time, the resort was small enough to have a very cosy and safe feel. The staff was wonderful. They were cheerful, friendly and very helpful. The entire resort was immaculate. I can't believe how hard the staff must work to keep everything so perfectly maintained. The entertainment was wonderful...from dancers to singers...to magic acts. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. I was especially touched by the way the \"star friends\" took special care to make the children and teens feel so welcomed. They recognized them, called them by name and encouraged them to join in all the great activities they had. The resort was filled with families...children speaking all different languages but all having fun. What a great sight. The food was excellent The pools and beach beautiful.The location is wonderful. We went to X-Caret and Tulum for short day trips and they were very close and convenient to arrange tours from. We booked through Signature Vacations. They took excellent care of us.

Unfortunately the weather was terrible. It rained every day we were there. Nonetheless, the resort itself is gorgeous and well worth visiting. Food My wife and I are foodies (her more than me) and we were content with the food. The buffets were satisfactory as there was always enough choice to find something pleasing. There are 4 a la cart restaurants. The Japanese restaurant was the best as they cook in front of you and have very tasty selections of seafood, chicken or beef. The steakhouse was good. Nothing to write home about but definitely good. The Italian restaurant was just ok and the Mexican restaurant we did not try as we heard it was poor. All in all I give the food a 7 out of 10. Rooms The rooms were pretty nice. Given that we were stuck in our room for most of the week I can say that the showers were hot, the beds firm, cable TV was good and the rooms were clean and attractive. Again, nothing to write home about but definitely very satisfactory. Rating: 7/10 Service The service was quite good. Everyone was ready to serve happily and with a smile. We asked to change rooms twice and were greeted with accommodation. Ultimately we got a room nearer to the beach and the pool which we wanted. Rating 8/10 * Please be kind and tip the staff at all levels. I was advised that the average salary for a teacher or a nurse is the equivalent of about $600 USD a month. I kept a wad of $1 USD bills on me and tipped between 1 and $10 for drinks food, cleaning and assistance making dinner reservations. It is well appreciated and appropriate (although not expected or necessary). Grounds Simply Gorgeous and well maintained. The grounds are an animal sanctuary mostly for the benefit of families and children, however they are very attractive. I might note that anyone with frail walking abilities may not appreciate the uneven, winding,poorly lit, concrete path through the \"jungle\". However, there is a well lit even walkway on the sides of the hotel that enable you to walk the entire length of the resort. Pool and all areas were immaculate. Rating: 9/10 Beach Was very nice. Soft white sand and lots of seating. In a more popular time of year, I could see that good seats might be scarce but you should have little difficulty finding something. There are no bad spots at this beach. Lots of sunny and shady seating and a nice beach all around. They do have some slightly annoying sand savers (large sand filled balloons to protect the sand from being washed away and to provide safe ocean wading for youngsters). It looks a bit odd but does not detract from the beautiful beach. Rating: 9/10 Location Excellent. You can literally walk to a nearby plaza and also Playa Del Carmen. Tulum is only 1 hour away and well worth a visit. If you are bored of the nightlife at the hotel, there is lots to do in Playa Del Carmen. This hotel is also not too far from Cancun. For the Mayan Riviera, this is the best location to be at. Rating 10/10 Nightlife at Iberostar very mediocre at best. The skits are moderately enjoyable but frankly not that great. One night the entertainment was Karaoke. Enough said! Who wants to listen to drunk tone-deaf guests? not me. There is a disco on the grounds but it is mostly patronized by ex-80's revelers, only one mullet away from being back in high school. Playa didnt have that much more to offer at this time of year but I have been to Playa before and it can have a good night life. I suggest drinking at Tucan and then take the $5 cab ride to Playa and enjoy watching people worth looking at. Rating 4/10 My wife and I had a good time but I would only go back if we brought our son (when he's old enough). This is really a family resort. It offers excellent value and an enjoyable holiday.

We have never been to this area before, and chose the hotel after reading reviews of many hotels in Playa del Carmen. Room: GREAT! Stayed in building 12, 3rd floor, balcony faced the back of the property, which was quiet most nights. One night, the band from the neighboring property night club was loud, but we just closed the sliding doors and the AC kicked on to deaden the noise. It was very clean, the king bed was firm, the mini fridge was stocked daily with beer/water/soda. Tipped housekeeping on last day for a job well done. A safe was provided in the closet, with digital code lock which was very useful. Monkeys in the tree right outside of our room were a blast to watch. The morning howling monkey was usually our wake up call! Could hear occassional water running from neighboring room, but nothing offensive. Property: GREAT! Lush, tropical landscape with wildlife abound. It is a nice walk from the beach to the front desk/lobby area, but nothing extensive. A little exercise is what most of us need on vacation anyway! Our builiding was close to the beach, which we preferred. The pool looked lovely, but we did not partake. Beach: Good. The waves were a bit rough the first few days, which was fun. The giant sandbags on the beach were an eyesore for photo ops, but overall did not affect our enjoyment of the surf. They are an erosion control measure that is much needed to preserve the beach. Kids and adults seemed to enjoy playing on them, waves would wash people over and others jumped off of them into the waves. The last day there was a lot of seaweed in the water, probably stirred up by the rough waves. We went to the beach daily around 10 am and were able to find lounge chairs every day. Food: Not so good. We are not picky eaters, yet we found it difficult to find tasty food at the buffets. Breakfast was fine, fresh fruit juice made on site was delicious. The eggs were cooked fresh and made to order were available. Any potato dish (and we tried them all), was terrible. Lunch (at the near beach buffet) and dinner at the main buffet were below average. Reservations were a pain, but the meals far exceeded the quality of the buffets. We ate at the Tropical - which also had steak on the menu. I had the flank steak/rare and it was very good. The ribeye/medium was tasty, but the cut of meat was different than what we are used to in the US. The apps buffet was very good. The Japanese was hibachi table group seating, choice of steak/chicken/shrimp/octopus/veggies. We tried it all, and it was good! Beverage: The red wine served at the dinner buffet was terrible. It was better at the reservation restaurants. Bar at beach was convenient, and served premium liquor upon request. Beer on tap only (except in room fridge) Coffee and soft drinks were also available. Overall: We took this vacation to relax, and relax is what we did! We only left the property once to walk to town to see what it was about. It was a thirty minute brisk walk one way. Shops are typical of tourist areas, yet prices are higher than I've seen in other parts of Mexico. It was worth the walk to see the other resorts in the area, and the town itself.", "Date": "January 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ohio", "Title": "\u201cTucan and Quetzal - NO A/C for indoor dining, outdoor buffet is for the birds!\u201d", "Author": "RKOhio", "ReviewID": "UR23273874", "Content": "My wife, sister, mother and I spent a week here and overall we all found it to be just, ok, with some problems.

So much to look at, birds, turtles, peacocks, weird furry guinea pig-like creatures... MONKEYS! But lots of walking! So be prepared to walk! The pools were beautiful and huge. Always lots of room to play around in the pool. However - it's really deep! At 5'5\", I couldn't touch and had to cling on to the boyfriend for dear life as I floated around. There is a small kids pool if you have kids. I would have liked to spend a little more time around the pool, but not once in our week there could we find 2 spare chairs. The swim-up bar is in it's own little pool.... really neat bar.. Lots of tables and chairs in the pool. The beach is gorgeous! We had more luck finding chairs on the beach so spent a lot of our time there. There's a bar close to the beach, too. You can walk relatively far in either direction on the beach, and there's lots to do. You can rent seadoos or go parasailing pretty much right in front of the Iberostar. We didn't have any problems with locals trying to sell us stuff on the beach, either. Buffet was good, pretty typical for an all inclusive.. We also tried the Asian, Italian, Mexican and Tropical restaurants. All were really good. Asian was kinda cool - they cook everything right in front of you and give you a bit of a show, throw stuff into their hats, weird stuff like that. Drinks were also pretty typical... They have a drink menu and your regular frozen/mixed drinks. All the staff members we dealt with were really friendly and helpful... Except that one day we had a \"Star friend\" come sit with us silently while we ate breakfast... it was a little strange and uncomfortable. haha. All of the shows we went to were great!

The fan for the A/C in our room was ridiculously loud and kept me up the whole first night.. so we slept without that on for the rest of the week.

I agree with nearly all the previous reviews (especially punkycanuck) so I won't re-hash all the details except for a few tips & suggestions. The buffet had a good selection but we did find the food not warm enough. Other resorts place the food over heat in hot water, or in covered trays which really helps. The buffet at Xel Ha did this and the food was good and hot. Best bet is to get what's being cooked-up at the grills. Also, if you like french toast or waffles, just put them through the toaster to heat them up. We spent a few days by the pool and were disappointed that there are no waiters to bring drinks. The pool bar and snack bars were not far, but still it's nice not to have to get up and line-up for a drink. The Barcelo in Ixtapa has excellent pool AND BEACH service. The Tucan has one of the best beach's in Playacar so we spent more time at the beach than the pool (more fun & more to see) and so long as you \"reserved\" your lounger by around 9:00 or so there were still a few to be found. Go to the towel hut and sign-out a beach umbrella if you want some shade, as the palapas are always taken early.

The weather was great in the 80's only one evening of rain. I had to get up at 6 o/clock every day to get the sun beds as we wanted 5 together. The second week the hotel put more beds round the pool so you could still get beds at 11 o/clock. We found the Americans OK it was the Eastern Europeans that were up at 5 o/clock getting the best beds. The Star Friends do a great job but if you are there for 2 weeks the entertainment in the evenings get a bit boring. The rooms are clean but the beds are really hard (2 weeks was enough of the Beds).

There were also issues with the manners and the loudness of a number of american parties including those in the room next door. We like to have a siesta when on holiday and this was curtailed by the shouting from the next door room until we complained. the swim up bar is also monpolised by loud americans despite being advertised as the quiet adult bar. in contrast the fabulous lagoon style pool is quiet and there is lots of room to swim. two of our party did get a tummy upset although i would say that the standard of food is generally very good. The star friends work hard to put on a show each night and sometimes they are good and sometimes they are awful, give the tuti fruti show a miss and make sure you catch the hollywood and vegas shows. We found that the Mascara disco is generally empty and lacking in atmosphere. There are plenty of activities on offer during the day to keep adults and children occupied should they wish. we found these useful when it was cloudy. the maid service was excellent and our room was cleaned daily and the fridge well stocked. the coffee machine in the room was an unexpected bonus. make sure that you catch the sunrise and watch the pelicans have breakfast. the monkeys tend to hang out in the trees over the adult bar and are worth a look in the early morning, they do tend to use the adult bar as a toilet and whilst we were there a customer was pooped on and another just avoided being urinated on. it entertained us as both were loud americans. you will find that despite the hotel asking all customers not to reserve sunbeds that the americans get up at the crack of dawn and put towels on the sunbeds and then some go back to bed until lunch. not sure what the hotel can do about this sort of bad manners and lack of consideration. As a family we thought that the hotel was better than the iberostar daiquiri in cuba but felt that the holiday experience was marred by the lack of thought for other guests which was regularly demonstrated by large groups of americans.

Let me start by saying most all of the previous reviews are very accurate - believe the hype because this is a great place! Prior to leaving I emailed the hotel with a room request - and got exactly what we wanted - a 3rd floor room by the beach (it actually had a view of the ocean and pool area) despite full occupancy. Front desk people were very helpful and service-oriented, even towards rude Eastern Europeans. I will run down our highlights of the resort: Service: Probably the best and most efficient we have ever experienced in travelling to all-inclusives for over 20 years. Although they weren't overly \"buddy-buddy\" friendly, service was very prompt, professional and courteous. We tipped a fair bit, but it did not seem to matter. No matter where you sit, someone will come buy and ask you if you need a drink - awesome! Rooms: decent size and condition. Minibar stocked every day (Hint: tip chambermaid a couple dollars each day - you will have plenty of towels, bottled water, beer etc). Room blocks in the low 10's and 20's are closer to the beach - we find this reduces the amount of walking even though the resort is not that big. Beach: Awesome!!! Clean and clear turquoise water, fine beige sand with no rocks. Sandbags were a PLUS actually - it provided for hours of kid-entertainment, especially when the water was red-flagged. Both young and old \"body-surfed\" with the waves up and over the sandbags - lots of fun! Pool: Large fresh water - yes it is deep and cool - we found it refreshing. There was a separate pee.....errrrr swim-up bar and sport pool which I thought was a good idea. Early towel \"reservations\" were a must if you wanted a lounger during the day. Lots of shady spots by the pool if you are not a sun-person. Food: Buffets were pretty good - not outstanding. We are not too fussy and always found something good to eat. A la cartes were not as good as we had hoped. We did Japanese (good food- we had a cook-in-training, but other tables had a good show), Mexican (just OK), Steakhouse (excellent beef, not much else) amd Italian (surprisingly good). The Ice Cream cart by the beach and Beach Grill were definite hits with us during the day due to convenience and kid-friendliness. Activities: We did Catamaran sailing, Scuba in the pool, Basketball, Archery, Ping Pong, Pool etc. All the Star Friends were very friendly and helpful in each regard. You have to sign paperwork for the sailboats and can opt for damage insurance ($10/week), which at first was odd, but in hindsight is not that big of a deal. Night Entertainment: Only saw the Movie Show and Magic Show, both of which we thought were good. They dont start the main shows until around 10pm, so this is usually late for families to watch the entire thing. I would strongly recommend the Magic Show - it was unbelievable (either that or we are just gullible). General Atmosphere/Grounds: FANTASIC - very well kept and very scenic. If you love animals, this is the place for you. Monkeys, Turtles, Peacocks, Flamingo's, Iguana's, ROUS's (rodents of unusual size) - you name it. The pathways through the jungle are an attraction themselves. The people here do a fantastic job keeping the place in tip top shape. Excursions: We did the Tulum Extreme trip ($96/adult), which included Zip-lining, Rapelling, and Cenote (fresh-water cave) snorkeling as well as a visit to the Tulum ruins. It was a great day, combining some fun with some history. I would recommend this to anyone. All in all we a great time at this resort and would definitely go back anytime. We had great weather which always helps- warm (30deg C), sunny, nice breeze during the day, comfortable at night with very few insects!!

This was our fifth all inclusive trip and our third in the Mayan Riviera. We did a private transfer from the airport and it was an hour to the Tucan. A $5 taxi ride to Playa was nice as it was close and convenient and we enjoyed a few dinners and walks around. There is also plaza about a 10 min. walk from the hotel with shopping, a pharmacy and even a Starbucks. Hotel: Smaller than the last few we stayed at with 700 rooms. I actually picked this resort based on the great reviews and the size. Everything from the lobby to the beach seemed just a few minutes away from our room in building 14. Our room was pretty standard and our fridge was filled everyday. Our third floor balcony was amazing and private until people next door started to feed the monkeys. The grounds were gorgeous and it was nice to see all the wildlife. Beach: Excellent, and likely the best beach we have seen so far. The water was very clear and calm for most of our stay. Yes, there are sand bags, and although I thought they did detract from the beauty of the ocean, they are definitely serving their purpose as at least a couple of feet filled in while we were there. We walked as far as the Royal Hideaway (which has a terrible beach) and every beach up to that point has sand bags. It would appear to me that the Iberostar started much earlier as their beach was likely another 50ft longer than neighboring resorts. You can also walk a long time in the direction of the Sandos next door. People were having a blast playing on the sand bags and we did go out one day when it was wavy and had a great time ourselves. Pools: The activity pool, kid\u2019s pool and swim-up bar are all separate. The main pool is very large, cold and deep @ 5\u2019-5.5\u2019. Needless to say it was too deep to walk around in so we didn\u2019t spend any time in it. The swim-up bar was down a flight of stairs and was freezing cold with a couple people drinking and smoking. We didn\u2019t see many pool activities going on except in the very shallow end for the kids so I missed getting involved in the odd game of water volleyball or water polo as they were happening at the main pools at other resorts. Food: Buffet was quite typical of previous AI resorts, the variety was fine although I found the food not as hot as it should be. Breakfast was available from 7am to 10am at the buffet. A huge bonus was the snack bars, one by the beach and also La Marimba which doubles as the steakhouse at night. Both have continental breakfast from 10am until 12pm, then lunch and snacks until 5pm. The beach bar was packed so we always ate at La Marimba where it was never more than 40% full (and no birds). Both had cold cereals and yogurt and toast as well La Marimba had bacon and eggs. Only the Cozumel buffet was open for lunch from 1pm to 3pm and both buffets from 6:30pm to 10:30pm. The Cozumel buffet also has a late night hours from 11pm to 4am so we walked through to check it out and it appeared to be leftover dinner buffet with not a single person eating there. A late night grill would likely be tastier and more popular. In our 14 day stay we got 5 a la cartes which we booked all at once. We tried the Italian, the steakhouse and the Japanese. The Japanese was pretty good and had a good show to watch as they prepared the food. The sushi was nice but the other appetizers not great. Both the steakhouse and the Italian had tons of seafood appetizers which is not up my alley but people seemed to enjoy it. The Italian was passable, but the steakhouse was pretty good. We passed on the steak but had pork back ribs with a nice BBQ sauce. A nice treat was the ice cream station set up by the beach bar. Entertainment: Caught a couple shows and they were okay, obviously the pre-show geared at kids. We have seen some very good shows at previous resorts so found these to be lacking, although they do work hard. The lobby bar had live entertainment which was nice since that is where we spent most nights after dinner. Service: Overall very good. Internet was 15 minutes for 20 pesos available in the Tucan lobby. Probably the best bar, lobby and buffet service we have experienced. The staff went out of their way to make us happy. The resort was also at capacity for our entire stay although it didn\u2019t feel crowded (except for towel games). Even at the snack bars we were offered drinks at our table and I definitely didn\u2019t expect that. Also, as a side note, the first night we were there the beach bar was open for a private party. There was music and drinks and tiki lamps lit up. Not sure how to arrange it, but that might be a good idea for a reception having seen a few weddings during our stay. Excursions: Having done tons of tours during previous stays in the Mayan Riviera we only did one this time. We decided to head down to Hidden Worlds for the day. We have previously stayed close to the highway so it was very easy to catch the Collectivo ($3.50US) and go wherever you like. This time it was a 25 minute walk to the highway, alternatively you could cab to Playa and then catch it from there. In that respect we missed the convenience of the highway and being able to do tours on our own with ease. Overall the Tucan was very good. I would not have picked it knowing that the pool would be so deep, but would not hesitate to stay at another Iberostar hotel since our service was just fantastic.", "Date": "December 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyed the Tucan\u201d", "Author": "chicagoTRVLR", "ReviewID": "UR22803782", "Content": "My friends and I have just returned from a 4 night stay at the Iberostar Tucan.

The service and food was excellent. The 24 hour buffet was nice to visit after dancing at Mascara (\u201cnight club\u201d). Buffets always were refilled promptly. Room service was timely as well. We visited the Japanese restaurant which was subpar compared to Japanese steakhouses in the US. The pool was very cold and no one was enjoying it.

We had a great time and I cannot understand some of the complaints other people had as our experience was fabulous. This was our second time at an all inclusive resort and our experience here was much much better than the all inclusive hotel we stayed at in Jamaica. Here's a rundown of the trip. The hotel is a good hour from the airport. We went with Apple vacations and so we had a group transport. We had to drop off four other groups before arriving at the Tucan. I really did not mind this as it gave me an opportunity to look and see what some of the other resorts looked like. When we arrived, we were promptly greeted by a bellboy and directed to the check in. This was a fairly quick process. The woman was polite and professional. We walked to our room (1501 - great location) and someone soon brought our luggage. The room was spacious and very clean. Our only dissappointment was that we wanted a king bed and got two doubles instead. This really was not that big of a deal. Yes, the beds are hard, but we slept fine. This building was in a great location in my opinion. Our room faced the jungle and we had a good view of some of the wildlife. I did not notice that the walls were thin as we did not hear anything from next to us or above us. I however, was woken up the first morning by monkeys howling. I thought this was kind of cool. We were within easy walking distance to the buffet and main entertainment room. The beach was a bit further, but really no big hike. I thought the food was good overall. I could always find something that satisfied me. As we only stayed 4 nights, we were only guaranteed one reservation at one of the speciality restaurants. We emailed the week prior to our arrival and requested the Japanese restaruant. This food was by far the best we had at the resort. The fried rice was the most fantastic fried rice I have ever eaten. We asked to be put on the waiting list for the Mexican restaurant and while we did not get in here, the hotel gave us a reservation at the Italian restaurant. We DID NOT have to tip to get the extra reservation as some other reviewer commented on. The food here was ok. The mint chocolate dessert was to die for. On a side note - make sure to try the magnum and the coconut icecream at the icecream bar by the beach. The beach was great. We did not mind the big sandbags as we knew they were trying to preserve the beach from erosion. Unfortunately it was generally cloudy during our visit so we never got a really sunny day to enjoy the ocean. We didn't let the clouds stop us from swimming. We also used the canoe one day to paddle out and around. Activities were varied and we tried to become involved. I highly recommend the bike tour into town (kids 12 and under might have some trouble). It lasts a litlle over an hour and was a great way to see playa del carmen. We also tried the archery one day and had a friendly competion with some other guests. My boyfriend participated in Karoke one night and got a good response from the crowd. I did utilize the gym one day in the early morning. It wasn't fancy, but was fine for my purpose. I thought the evening entertainment was good overall. We went every night, we saw miss iberostar (funny but a little long), the ballet folklore, broadway night, and the prehispanic show. I particularly enjoyed broadway night, but i'm sort of a dork that way. There was just something great about seeing the Time Warp song sung with an accent. The prehispanic show was also really good. The entertainment staff (the star friends) really work hard to see that the guests enjoy themself. We did get away from the hotel and did a day tour with Edventrues, which I highly recommend. We also walked to playa del carmen one day. Yes, you can take a cab, but we decided to try to walk off some of the buffet food. It probably a little over a mile each way. If you walk wear good shoes. I had flip flops on and was wishing for tennis shoes on the way back. Overall it was a great time and I would not hesitate to go back.", "Date": "December 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cWould not come back to Tucan\u201d", "Author": "Kate31", "ReviewID": "UR22753912", "Content": "We happened to spend 3 days in Iberostar Del Mar and then moved to Tucan for 5 days (were originally supposed to stay at Tucan the whole week, but bad travel agent made a mistake) I just posted review for Del Mar, and I must say that Tucan was not much different, maybe its the Iberostar in general. They make you feel unwelcome, quality is low, feels like they trying to \"save\" on everything. We were in building 12, 2nd floor. The walls are paper thin, you hear every sound outside (door opens/closes/steps/voices, toilet flashes) I am a very light sleeper, and I was up from every sound. The pool is cold and smells bad. In general, it smells bad everywhere in Tucan. My room was smelly, like some animal died in there. Having a small child made me reluctant to move with all out stuff (and where is guarantee that another room will not smell?), so we had to stay. Hotel doesn't feel very new, feels worn down and not very clean. Rooms are smaller than usual, and beds are too hard and small (we had two full beds) Ocean was not great, those sand bags don't do much for the waves, they just ruin the look of the beach. It was still very wavy on windy days (5 out of 7) and calm on quiet days (but then who needs those sand bags???) Overall, the beach looks ugly with those, like giant bags of garbage blocking the entrance to the ocean (I don't understand how can someone say \"those are nice\", you must be in love and blind or something...) Food was average, same thing every day for lunch and dinner (there was some good stuff, but always the same) Restaurants were mostly bad. They only give you 2 per room for 5 days and there is no way you can get reservations without giving some extra tip for the girl that books it. Japanese restaurant was not too bad actually, but nothing great for the spoiled foodie like me. Steak house was not good, worse than buffet. Steak house was empty by the way, and its hard to get reservations! They just don't want to serve you... After having bad experience with Mexican and Tropical restaurants in Del Mar, we stayed away from those in Tucan. Jungle is ok, but nothing amazing. We barely saw any monkey; they hide during the day I guess. Thankfully, I didn't see a single cat on the property (in Del Mar, skinny and hungry cats walk in buffet all the time) Don't get me wrong, I love cats (I own one) but I don\u2019t' want them in hotel buffet bagging for food. As you can tell, I was not impressed with Tucan, and would probably not move from Del Mar if I knew that its very similar, just smaller and older (feels older) We were also not very lucky with the weather which contributed to the disappointment. However, I think I don't want to come back to Iberostar resorts anymore and maybe no more Mexico, cause the beaches are consistently bad.", "Date": "December 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Exeter, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cOne of the best!\u201d", "Author": "twadders", "ReviewID": "UR22723398", "Content": "This is my first review, but after looking at other peoples reviews thought that i would add my \"Two penneth worth\" Location; Approx 45 minute from Cancun airport and a 5 minute taxi ride from Playa del Carmen. Right on the seafront and second to last hotel before the Jungle. Arrival at the hotel; First impressions were ok and the lobby opens right out and is open plan greeted with a drink and directed to our rooms where the bags were brought to the room within 10 minutes. Room; We were in room 1142 which was close to the pool and the beach and there was a sea view from the balcony. The room was large, kept clean and very adequate. Yes, the beds were hard, but i wasn't here to sleep and that\u2019s how I like my bed anyway. We did get bit on the ankles at night by something but being so close to the jungle you have to expect some invasions by the creatures we have invaded! The room was cleaned and the beds made daily with a new animal made out of the towels every day. The fridge got refilled most days, but with the hotel being all inclusive we never managed to empty the fridge anyway. Complex; When you first get to look around it feels a very large place, but once you start to find your way around the complex it starts to feel a bit smaller. The pool is very large, although the water was colder than the sea, and lots of activities with the \"Star friends\" take place in and around the pools. Plenty of bars around the pool and near the beach to sample any drinks, ice cream trolley at the end of the pool to try. Great to walk through the Jungle to get to and from the main buffet hall and the reception, with lots of animals to see. The adult only pool is a good place to see the monkeys, although to start with the water is freezing, I would suggest get in the main pool first then into the bar pool....acclimatise yourself!! Facilities used; Bike ride at 10 am and 3pm, free and takes you for a cycle into the town. Dressel divers....fantastic group of people, I hadn\u2019t dived for about 4 years, but did 2 of the best dives ever at Moc-che (with my 12 year old daughter doing a Discover scuba) 12meters and Tortugas 18 meters where we saw Turtles and a shark. Food; The main buffet(Cozumel or Tulum depends which side you are staying) has loads of choices and the quality of food I would give and 8/9 out of 10, the only downside, well two downsides, one was the food wasn't always piping hot and the other downside was I ate too much!!! So much choice! We tried the specialist restaurants as well, we were there for 14 days so were allowed 6 bookings book in the lobby at guest services, it gets booked up quick so do it when you arrive. We tried the Mexican, the Japanese x2, the Caribbean/Tropical and the steakhouse x2. In order of preference, 1/ Steakhouse......fantastic Rib eye steak. 2/ Japanese ........great entertainment and good food. 3/ Tropical...Nice food 4/ Mexican.....Nothing wrong with the food, just not our taste. Out and about; The beach; Like some others have said there is a problem with people reserving the beds on the beach and around the pools, i went for a walk at 6am and they had already started! The sandbags are good fun, but can be slippery...be careful!! Take a snorkel and look on the seaward side of the bags, you will be surprised at the amount of fish by your feet. Walk along the beach to the right past the next hotel and the beach is really nice, walk to the rock and there is a small reef just off the beach, loads more fish and if you walk to the point there is another reef with an even larger reef and more fish. Playa Del Carmen and 5th avenue is 5 minutes away in a taxi $5 or 50 Pesos (Pay in pesos it's cheaper). 5th avenue is ok if you like the tourist\u2019s shops and bars. Cozumel Is a short ferry trip from 5th avenue and is a fantastic place to explore, I knew someone on the island who took us around but without that we would have missed the best side of the island, hire a car.... get to the other side of the island, there are some great views and places to see and bars to drink and eat at. We went to Coconuts bar and restaurant. We also visited Ichel ruins on the island. Xel-ha Booked through our holiday rep in the hotel (Bit expensive) but well worth the day spent there if you like snorkelling.(About an hour travel) You can swim with dolphins here as well. We chose Xel-ha over Xcaret because Xel-Ha is a naturally formed lagoon. I think a full day is needed here as there is a lot to do but you can split it with a trip to Tulum. Coba/Myan experience Again booked through the rep, and a long day, but Coba was chosen because we could climb the tallest ruin in Mexico which you can't do at the other places as they have stopped you climbing, to preserve them. Very good guide visited real Mayan households and cenote for a swim. Finally the staff and team; We found ALL the staff very helpful and were always polite. I was dismayed at the lack of manners used towards the staff by some of the guests from another country....manners cost nothing people!! They all worked hard and would do all they could to ensure our stay was a pleasant one. The \"star friends\" were great although it took us a bit of time to get involved, but once we did........what a laugh....if you see a green table near the bar by the beach you have to go and watch!!! Thanks to all the staff they were great! The only thing that I would say that would put me off coming to this resort again is we felt quite restricted in where we could go, however we did not hire a car on this occasion so that added to this restriction. Hotel itself we would have no reason not to recommend it.

The Tucan is a great hotel (almost NO different than the Quetzal) and there was never a shortage of things to do. My dad is an action junkie and he was constantly amused (sailing, scubadiving, snorkeling etc.). He was able to do all of these things for free. The food and drinks were good. I'm a very picky eater and managed to find food I liked at all times. Compared to other all inclusives I've stayed at, the drinks here were a step up. Drinks at the beach bar were fairly gross, but if you ordered them from the lobby bar you were in for a pleasant surprise! Try the Planters Punch! Our room was spacious and clean, decorated with the requisite towel animal, flower petals, and complimentary bottle of tequila upon arrival. The hotel is located in the best part of Playacar. Playacar is a gated community just outside of Playa del Carmen. You can easily walk into town from the Tucan, however the best part is the proximity to the natural beaches! Most hotels in Playacar are lined up like sardines. However, if you walk about ten minutes South along the beach infront of the hotel you reach a long stretch of white sand beach ... with no hotels and very few people! Each day we packed a picnic lunch, grabbed our towels, and set off for the secret beach. Tip: wear bug spray! I didn't even think about this for some reaon, and I'm now paying the price with hundreds of bites on my legs. Overall if the price was right I would return to the Tucan.

First off, I am comparing this one mainly on other resorts I have stayed at. Resort layout and first coming: The resort is rather large. It has a string of buildings with multiple floors of rooms. There is a large buffet restaurant and I believe five different a la carte restaurants (Italian, Mexican, Japanese, Steak, and Caribbean). There is one large pool then a small kiddie pool and an adult only pool (with a swim up bar). The beach seems to be back to \"normal\" from when the hurricane came, but it is obvious that the beach that is not behind a sand bag is eroding. The path to the beach is stone and through a jungle. The staff was very friendly and even brough us drinks when we first arrived. Room: The room was average in my opinion. We had two double beds and a decent size bathroom (very large shower). The beds were very hard, but I prefer a hard bed so I slept perfectly fine. I loved the animals the maids created out of towels. Every day there was a different animal. We were at the farthest building from the beach, but it still was not too far of a walk. Food: The food was great. I am a very picky eater, but I found something to eat every night and usually ate too much! We ate at the Japanese place and the food was good there too. They put on a good show. We had reservations to eat at the Mexican place, but moved to a different hotel that night (more on that later). Bar sand entertainment: The lobby bar was very chill and had live music. The beach bar was right at the entrance of the beach. The club (Mascara) was pretty dead on a Friday night, but we met some of the entertainers and we went with them to Playa del Carmen. The nightlife there was really good and highly suggest a day or night trip there. There was also a large bar in the theater. The shows were amazing and very well put together. They started around 9:30 or so, but they had music and other entertainment before that. Beach: The beach was very crowded. The first full day we got to the beach by 10 and there were no chairs left. It did clear out a bit by 2 or so and was nice by the time the sun was setting. There are massive sand bags just off shore to help prevent erosion. At first I thought they were an eyesore, but I actually loved them. It was nice sitting on them and jumping off of them. On the one bag, people were letting the waves hit them and carry them onto the top of the bag. Final thoughts: We did a side trip to Tulum and Xel-ha which was amazing, although I am sure we way overpaid going through the hotel. On Sunday we received a letter saying we could move to the Iberostar Parasio Maya as an upgrade for Monday night. Apparently Tucan had overbooked and we were fine with moving so we left Tucan for Maya. Overall I really enjoyed the Tucan. We saw lots of wildlife walking to and from the beach. My only complaint is how crowded the beach was.", "Date": "December 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Wedding\u201d", "Author": "mojitomargarita", "ReviewID": "UR22615160", "Content": "We had our wedding at the Iberostar Tucan, and both the wedding and the accommodations were wonderful from start to finish. We had done our homework once we decided to have our wedding in Playa, and visited a number of resorts and wedding coordinators before we settled on the Tucan. We picked it for two reasons: (1) among our 22 guests were five children, ranging from 6 mos. to 10 yrs. in age, and it seemed like the place that would be most fun for them (and therefore for the rest of us); and (2) the wedding coordinator and her staff seemed to have the entire wedding process down to a science, and we felt comfortable putting ourselves in their hands. We could not have been more right on both counts. WEDDING: The wedding was lovely and absolutely stress-free. We absolutely felt that the wedding coordinator had everything under control at every moment. The officiant was terffic, and happy to work with us to make the ceremony exactly as we wanted it. The cocktail party on the beach was great. The rehearsal dinner at the Italian restaurant was unbelievably tasty and elegant, as was the wedding banquet at the Mexican restaurant. The photographers made me the most nervous -- they're the same photographers who go around putting a monkey or parrot on someone's shoulder and then snapping a picture, and (as you cannot help but notice when you go to their shop in the lobby) everyone always looks ugly in those pictures, but the photos are gorgeous and they gave them to us the morning after the wedding. I'm leaving out the details (flowers, hair, etc.), but all of those really were perfect, too -- and so competently handled that we had plenty of time to enjoy time with our families in the days before the wedding, which of course was the whole point. ACCOMMODATIONS: The unique jungle setting of the resort is a lot more interesting that the standard cleared-out courtyard set-up of most of the hotels in the area. There's just a lot more to look at, and that's fun -- the kids absolutely loved the birds, fish, monkeys, and other creatures. It also makes the place literally cooler -- all those open spaces at the other resorts seem to mean that for most of the day, you can't escape the sun if you want to, and it was nice to have green paths to walk down. Since we were dragging our entire families, and most of them had never stayed at an all-incusive place before and some of them had never traveled out of the US before, we were really holding our breath that everyone would enjoy it -- and we couldn't have asked for it to go better. Everyone was raving about everything the entire time. The rooms are not as super-fancy as at some of the other all-inclusive resorts, but they're comfortable and clean, have nice showers, and have nice little patios or balconies. The beach and the pools are terrific, as are the amenities and activities for kids. We went down to Tulum after the wedding for our honeymoon, and the Tucan wouldn't be my first choice for a romatic getaway for two -- there really are kids running around everywhere having a great time, and other people's kids are not my idea of romance -- but for the sort of family adventure that we were on, it was terrific. FOOD: All of us were extremely impressed by how terrific the food was. As a rule, I hate buffets, but these were an exception -- perhaps because they weren't trying to be particularly elegant or sophisticated, everything was just generally tasty. The two meals we had at the a la carte restaurants were terrific (and plenty fancy). They do require men to wear long pants at the a la carte restaurants. The buffets also have a sign requesting that men not wear shorts (\"except for classic Bermudas,\" which confused us), but they don't seem to actually enforce that. STAFF: I menioned that the wedding staff was excellent, but they were no exception to the rest of the staff, who somehow managed to simultaneously bend over backward to do whatever they could to make your happier and give the impression that they are enjoying themselves. All in all, we couldn't have made a better choice.", "Date": "December 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Mateo, CA", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Vacation!\u201d", "Author": "LongtimeinSF", "ReviewID": "UR22547972", "Content": "This was our second trip to the area (stayed at RioPalace the first time) and I must say that not only did I love this resort but we're also definitely coming back.

I also discovered, there's a step class on the beach every day, which was great. Things to do: my son loved the nightly shows, music and dancers. we didn't use the kids club, as he we spend most of the day on the beach, but we peaked in and met all the councelors (very nice and friendly, kiddie pool, playground, etc); my son loved the playground, which was located in the pool area, and especially appreciated the kiddie pool, although we tried to spend the bulk of our time on the beach (which was fantastic, did i mention that?). there're shops in the area and you can venture out to downtown.

Everything far exceeded my expectations. The wedding planner was amazing, the resort spectacular, and everyone in my party didn't have one complaint the entire time we were there. I had planned to get married on the beach, but of course with my luck it rained the day of the wedding. This resort has the best \"plan B\" spot around, it's under a tiki roof and very romantic. It was amazing, and the hotel staff only started setting it up about 15 minutes before we got married (they had already set up the beach area when it started to rain). The buffet got a little old for some, but I thought it was great. The specialty restaurants were very good, especially Japanese. I had the wedding meal at the Steakhouse and a reception at the disco which was lots of fun. I highly recommend the Tucan for a wedding or a vacation. You will not be disappointed.

I travelled with my husband and 2 kids, ages 4 and 1 and stayed at Iberostar Tucan for 4 nights between Nov and Dec 2008. Firstly, I read a few message strings on the Iberostar-board.com website, and after figuring out how to navigate the site, discovered a few helpful things, primarily the hotel\u2019s e-mail to request a room, room recommendations, and found out that the standard room\u2019s pull-out sofa was just a daybed and the bathroom only had a stand-up shower. So I requested a third floor, non-smoking room with a king size bed that faced the jungle in Bldg 13. I also brought along an inflatable bath for my 1 year old. I was told once I got to the hotel that only Bldgs 15,16 and 17 were non-smoking and that Bldgs 14, 13 12 were smoking. I got a second floor room facing the jungle in Bldg 15 which worked out fine. It was closer to the breakfast restaurant and we only had 2 flights of stairs to climb. I was able to see lots of monkeys up close at around 7AM from the roof of bldg 13. It was a wonderful experience to see the monkeys, including a cute baby, dining on leaves at the top of the tree. I found the bed too hard, but I was the only one complaining. The room was very nice, modernly designed and clean. The shower had enough room for the 4 of us. I thought though an extra shower head would have been perfect. The floor was hard (maybe travertine tiles) so we made sure the kids were dry before leaving the bathroom and placed towels from the towel art on the floor as makeshift rugs. I booked through unitedvacations.com which seemed just like funjet.com (and cost the same) but it allowed me to book at Tucan instead of Quetzal. One side note, the Lomas Travel van was a luxury van so it was quite comfortable. My only beef was that they played the same DVDs over and over again, one describing the attractions in the Playa/Cancun area and the other was of oldies-but-goodies with the Bee-Gees, Roy Orbison, Elvis etc. Despite the cervezas offered, the DVDs just spoiled the energy and vibe. I am from Jamaica originally and visit often, and there is a wonderful vibe and energy I feel once I arrive. In case you\u2019re wondering, there is no difference between the Tucan and Quetzal hotels (room-wise and facility-access-wise). I didn't have too much time to walk on the Quetzal side due to the kids, but I found their jungle path a little more interesting and they had tortoises, swans, ducks and, it appeared that day, more monkeys to see. The hotel grounds were like a zoo or jungle, which helped escape any form of boredom during the entire 4 days we were there. My family and I had a great time, especially my 4 year old. She just loved one of the kids club coordinators, the nightly kids' entertainment and interacting withl the other kids from all over the world. I found though the adult show following the kid\u2019s entertainment time (8-9:45) filled with some inappropriate material for kids (I would say PG rated), so I wished there was an alternative entertainment for kids who wanted to stay up late. I found the kids club very nice, the coordinators were loving and friendly. My only recommendation is that they provide training to the kids club coordinators and the nightly entertainment hosts to set up games to avoid conflicts and use games that foster cooperation/teamwork rather than individual competitiveness. I thought they needed more varied activities to accommodate diverse personalities and interests. Nonetheless my 4 year old had a good time, mostly as a spectator though. The kiddy pool was small, big enough for all the kids. I wished they had a better playground for the kids and another kid-friendly pool with a water slide or two. The adult pool was too cold by the way, but the beach was great: warmer than any pool, spots with calm waters to relax in and rough waters to have fun riding the waves over the man-made mounds. Room service was great, but the menu limited and the service hours were from 11am to 11pm. My family and I always found something to eat at the Tulum, Uxmal and Palapas grill buffets (we were going to eat at Bonsai one night but my 1 year old was too active for me to handle in the confining space around the teppanyaki table). My 1 year old obviously missed his rice dishes which was quite evident once at home and eating. My 4 year old surprisingly got used to the anchovy pizza and chips dipped in guacamole. Besides room-service we could not find a restaurant open between 11 and noon and between 5 and 6:30pm, which meant we adjusted our eating habits, ate breakfast later starting on the third day and ordered pizza to the room once so my kids had something to eat before dinner time.

Spider monkey a regular visitor to our balcony - room 1351, also a little owl one evening. Food - I am not a fan of the AI buffet idea, however food for 1 week was ok, mostly missed having a strong flavours as the hotel is catering for many different tastes and therefore nothing is too extreme (missed garlic, chili, black pepper etc); this would not have been an issue, however found the a la carte restaurants to be similar - with exception of the Japanese which I loved. The wedding was amazing, ran smoothly and beautiful location & photos; perfect beach wedding. We ate in the steak restaurant for wedding reception, amazing onion rings, buffet starter & then menu choice - our steak came cold but was warmed on request. Used the dive centre, very good staff, although had trouble getting to/from boat one of the days due to swell, the team were very efficient & reassuring. Tortuga reef saw several turtles, also saw turtles at Jardins. Took the excursion to the Cenotes, very exciting experience, however much darker than we had expected, the dive team were very relaxed about it, however we felt very novice when there, with only 10 dives each under our belts I am not sure it was ideal - def not suitable for anyone nervous of diving, darkness or tight spaces! As many have mentioned the minibar was hit and miss, we did not get re-filled every other day, despite a first day $10US tip and daily Peso tips - this was common throughout our group of 8 rooms - however a call to guests services daily sorted that out!

Our friends and family loved it as well. I was especially wonderful for my family who have never traveled to Mexico. I was very suprised how nice the resort was. I love the open-air concept for the buffets, lobbys and bars. Our rooms were nice, very clean and the air conditioner worked. The walk from our ocean-front room the the restaurants and bars was an adventure. All sorts of wildlife. I didn't think I would like the animals roaming around but I didn't mind at all. Restaurants We ate at the Japanese restaurant and the Steakhouse. Both were excellent! Some members of our family at at the Mexican restaurant and they didn't like it very well. The buffets were good. I always found something I liked. Although toward the end of our six days, the food was getting a little old. The drinks at the lobby bars were great!. Beach & Pool The chairs by the pool and beach go quickly in the morning. There was a lot of towel saving. That didn't bother us though. We just picked a spot in the sand and around lunch/early afternoon the chairs began to free up. The sand bags weren't that great to look at but they were a lot of fun to play on. The wedding Any brides out there having apprehensions about their wedding at the Tucan. No worries. They know their stuff. We met with the coordinator a few days before the wedding to finalize everything. 30 min and we were done. The photo company the resort uses made me a little nervous because their website was awful. But no worries. The photographer, Cruise, really knew what to do and where to take pictures. They turned out great. I was very happy with the pictures. I had my hair done at the spa. The lady did a great job. I was worried, considering the language barrier but she did a wonderful job. Our wedding location was on the beach. Beautiful! It's not as private as the jungle but I didn't even notice that some guests watched the whole thing! Rain wasn't an issue but even if it had rained, the alternite site was very nice too. The flowers were beautiful. The person performing the ceremony was excellent. He gave a great service. We had drinks after pictures by the beach bar.

This is our third time staying at Iberostar ( 2 times at Iberostar Cozumel - see excellent review) and our family of 2 adults and 5 year old son really like the product this company offers. Consistent, friendly, service oriented and all about the customer having an enjoyable vacation. I had emailed them 2 weeks in advance requesting a room in buildings 11,12 or 13 on the ground floor with a king bed and we got exactly that. Very pleasant and respectful email communication! The smallish rodents (like big guinea pigs) running around the grounds are called agoutis. (The whole time we were busily calling them capybaras!) My young son and I awoke early every morning to go \"monkey hunting\" and were never disappointed. We could access the roof in our building (13) and we would go there first thing, look for movement in the trees from above then head over to that area. We saw as many as six monkeys at one time! The sand barriers on the beach were loads of fun. With the right surf, \"riding the whales\" was how we spent most mornings (after made to order omeletes for breakfast). You could body surf right up onto the barrier, and sometimes end up getting tossed all the way to the other side. One full moon evening, while walking the beach, we encountered some workers whose job was to pump sand from the ocean and back onto the beach. A thankless and laborious task but we could certainly see the results. They are working hard to recover and maintain their beaches and we certainly appreciated the efforts. Food. They offer a huge variety and one has to keep in mind the worldwide palates they are trying to please. Americans don't usually have luncheon meat for breakfast but I saw plenty of other folks who did! So much to choose from and well prepared and presented. Always a Mexican food table as well. We ate at the steakhouse and Italian. Both good but we cancelled our Mexican the last night as we just really liked the regular buffet. Public Relations and Bellmen VERY helpful when my husband left his cellphone in a cab. Thankfully recovered! Every weekday in the mornings, near the pool, they had animals that could be pet and have your photo taken with (iguana, Spider Monkey, Tucan, Scarlet Macaw). The \"handlers\" were very knowledgable, answered questions and weren't pushy about the photos. You could view and purchase your photos in the Questzal lobby for $8USD. They were of good quality and the one of the Spider Monkey on our son's head is priceless! Several evenings there were vendors along the walkway to the theatre. Spray paint art and jewelry. I bought a very nice silver bracelet for half the original price. Respectful and inobtrusive vendors. Great vacation, great location.

I'd highly recommend it to others. Location and grounds The resort is in a great location on the beach in a community of all-inclusive hotels and homes just south of Playa del Carmen. It's only a $5 cab ride into Playa del Carmen itself and there is a shopping area (Plaza Playacar) only a 10-minute walk away. The resort grounds are beautiful. Everything except the actual rooms, restrooms, and some of the specialty restaurants is open-air. The jungle theme is wonderful and the animals are a pleasure to see. We even had monkeys on our balcony several mornings. There are 3-story buildings on both the Tucan and Quetzal side from the beach back to the road. We stayed in building 11 on the Tucan side, which was by the pool one building back from the beach. Rooms The room was clean and spacious. As there were three of us, we were unsure what type of triple room we'd receive but it turned out to be two double beds and a day bed. The mattresses were a bit hard but we were so tired by the end of each day, we did not mind it. Each room has a tile floor, TV, safe, large closet with shelves, balcony or terrace, iron and hair dryer. The large shower with double showerhead and good water pressure was a nice touch. The mini-bar is free and stocked every other day with beer, water, and soft drinks. Beach and pool The beach and pool area were large and pleasing. Both the pool and beach had plenty of chairs, some shaded by palapas. The pool also featured several large shaded beds, but you must be up and at the pool area before 7 am for these. There are signs all over that the beds and chairs can not be reserved, but many are anyway. The water was refreshing, but not too cool, in both the pool and the ocean. It would have been nice if the Jacuzzi in the middle of the pool was filled with hot water, but it was surprisingly cold. The beach features soft yellow sand and clear turquoise waters. There are large sandbags in the water in an attempt to preserve the beach, but they did not hamper the experience and were fun to climb up and lay on. The main pool was quite large and there is also a kiddie pool and an adults-only pool with swim-up bar. The swim-up bar was lots of fun and the bartender, Jesus, can be counted on for strong, tasty drinks. The pool area bathroom needs to be cleaned much more often; it was quite wet and foul-smelling by the end of the day. Another disappointment was that no one swam after dark. The pool is officially closed from 8 pm-8 am, but the pool area was clear by about 5 pm each night. Food/drinks The resort featured a wide variety of food and drinks available almost 24 hours a day. Each side of the resort has its own large buffet open for breakfast and dinner (the Quetzal side is also open for early-morning Continental breakfast, lunch and late-night snacks until 4 am). There are two buffet/grills by the pool open for breakfast and lunch, each of which has a bar. There's also a separate bar and an ice cream stand at the edge of the beach, in addition to the pool bar. Dinner is available at 5 specialty restaurants (Japanese, Italian, Mexican, steakhouse and Caribbean); reservations are guaranteed for a certain number of nights depending how long you stay at the resort. There are also bars in each lobby, at the show and in the disco. Name-brand liquor is available and most of the drinks we ordered were excellent. In my opinion, breakfast was the best meal of the day; the omelets and juice bar were great. The ice cream at the beach is also excellent. You may get tired of the buffet food overall by the end of the week, as most of the items on them are repeated day after day. In terms of specialty restaurants, we ate at the Japanese, Italian, and steakhouse restaurants. The Japanese was good food and a good show, while the other two were not our favorites. In fact, we were disappointed in having to go to the steakhouse at all, as we had requested Mexican when making reservations and only found that we were booked at the steakhouse at the appointed dinnertime. Take this as a lesson and check your ticket when you receive it! We had heard that the Mexican restaurant was good. Activities and nightlife The resort had activities scheduled for much of the day and there was plenty to do during the day, from beach volleyball to bingo to dance lessons. The Star Friends that put on the activities and shows were friendly, but it was sometimes unclear where the activities would take place or did not take place when scheduled. Each night, there was a show beginning around 9:15 pm. Some of these shows were better than others; I would highly recommend Boogie Nights, which was great fun. The lobby bars were open until midnight (ask for Juanita on the Tucan side - she is a very friendly, excellent waitress) and the disco gets going soon after and stays open until 3 am. Reception and service Check-in and check-out were very easy and reception was friendly. There are computers with Internet access in the lobby that accept 10 peso coins; two provide 15 minutes of access. We did have to call maintenance and have the bellhop bring bags to us when they arrived from the airline late at night; both of these took several calls and some time to make happen, but the service was fine once received. Maid service was good and we were treated with a towel animal each day. Overall, we loved the Iberostar Tucan/Quetzal and wanted to stay even longer.

Lots of flora and fauna very well manicured and home to a large variety of wildlife. We loved the decor of the resort and the natural aspect of the flowing walkways throughout. Room We stayed in building 13 on the second floor and had a balcony which overlooked the jungle. The room itself was a little dated and yes, the beds were very hard. A call to the front desk and a mattress pad was provided and improved the comfort level somewhat. The room was always cleaned in a timely manner by housekeeping staff and our mini fridge filled every second day. There were a few chipped and broken floor tiles in the room near the balcony. Beach The beach has greatly improved since our last visit to Playa just 3 months ago. The sand bags in the water seem to be doing their job and there is significantly more sandy beach to enjoy all along the Playacar area. Word of caution concerning the playaing on the sandbags-be careful! We had 2 days of very stong surf and witnessed many people injuring themselves on the whales while standing up. The remaining beach days were great-nice and calm. Pools Large pool area was really beautiful. The water depth varies about 4.5 to about 5.5 feet and the kids loved floating on their rafts. Bar is located in a seperate pool. Drinks We were really disappointed in the taste of the cocktails. Each time they tasted \"off\", kind of a weird plastic and metal combination flavor in your mouth. I think this was due to the mixers they use and the lack of fresh fruit used in preparation of the cocktails. After a day the adults just stuck to beer ( Dos XX). Food The food was a little disappointing, and we were surprised. I read many reviews saying it was great, and a few saying it was terrible, and we expected it it would be average.Breakfast was the best meal of the day-lots of selection of fresh omelettes, baked goods, friuts yougurts and cerals. For lunch we generally ate at the buffet by the pool and had burgers. However the dinner buffet did not vary and was not very appetizing. The temperature of the food was just warm, not hot, and the selections all tasted very much the same. The a la carte restaurants were a step up, but not great. The japanese was the exception, good food and nice presentation. The mexican restaurant was a definate letdown, except for the great appetizers.

They are wild but friendly if they think you will feed them, they will visit you every chance they get. (see pictures). Every room has a refrigerator and coffee pot inside which makes it nice for people that like to wake up with coffee. BEACH: The beach had sand dunes that were my husband's favorite. He and other men would stand on them to see how long they could last before the waves would knock them off. We went in May and the water's were very gentle, but in October they are rough but fun.

It was like a little family who just met. We met at the pool, and a few times thereafter and each time it was great. OVERALL IMPRESSION: We liked the IB Tucan. It is a good value for the money you will pay. The food was good and plenty of it, but not superb. However, you are sure to find something you like at the buffet. 5TH AVE: Don't expect to get cheap Souvenirs at Fifth Ave. They are as expensive if not more than in the USA. Water cameras for 27 pictures are between $16 and $22 American dollars so make sure you take a water camera or two. Fifth Ave is a $5.00 cab ride from the Tucan or a 30 Minute walk but once you get there, you willl walk and walk for about 20 blocks so it's wiser to take the cab and then just walk downtown. Please feel free to contact me with any questions about the Tucan/Quetzel. What W didn't like: Beds are a little hard and seem to get harder as the week progresses. The food and service was good but not as great as at Iberostar Bavara in Punta Cana. We didn't get into the restaurants we wanted but in all fairness to them, some people do get into all of them. Our drink glasses kept being picked up full on the beach so we had to make trips back and forth to get our drinks again.

Room- We stayed in room 1243 which is a perfect location in the middle of the resort, very close to the pool. The room had 2 double beds which was good for us. It was cleaned everyday and never had any major problems, we did find a cockroach in our room on the 1st morning and the shower wasn't working properly, we had to ask a few times for these problems to be solved but they were fixed on the 1st day so didnt have to wait to long. We had towel art on the bed everyday which was nice. We were also close to the jungle and had 2 monkeys on our balcony 1 evening which was very exciting. We tipped the maid 150 pesos throughout the 2 weeks. Food- I had read many reviews on the food and was worried about the buffet before i went, i can agree with the majority of people, the evening buffet wasnt that great and found the food luke warm alot of the time. The a la carte restaurants were fine, my favourite was the Japanese, my least was the Mexican. Breakfast and Lunch were fine although the same i always had a full plate. Pool- The pool was lovely, nice a big. It did get warm from the sun but what can you do! We always got a sunbed but did get up early. You would struggle to get them after about 10am. The pool bar always seemed to be full of loud people so only went in once. Beach- We stayed at a hotel opposite last year and the beach was tiny, i was shocked this year to find how much work they have put into restoring it, it is so much bigger, there are no more drops and plenty of space for sunbeds. Entertainment- The entertainment staff are great and do so much, on my last day 1 of the star friends had breakfast with us and he told us that he works about 60-70 hours a week with 1 day off! They work really heard. Evening entertainment was excellent some nights and not great others but watch it and you can decide for yourself. Magic show was the best. Jungle- The jungle walk is great at night, its lit with nice white lights. We walked this way back to the room every night and even wearing \"off\" (Mosquito spray) we realised on the last day this was were we were getting the majority of our bites, but still a great place to see. Trips- We did 3 trips all booked through First Choice. We swam with dolphins at Dolphin Discovery was a great experience. Would recommened it to anyone. The organiasation isnt good when your waiting to go home though, as theres about 100 other people waiting in the heat to hear the hotel be called out to find out what bus to get on, but dont let that put you off, its a great day. Xel-ha- We went to Xcaret last year and if im honest i think i prefer that. Xel-ha could be done in half a day and didnt see many fish. Food is great there though. Remember your mosquito spray, they have a serious issue with mosquitos and will be fighting with them al day if you dont. Tulum- Great half day, our guide knew so much and spoke good english, lovely beach to go to as well. We went on friday and was very busy, im not sure if they have quiet days or not. Well worth the money, also good if you dont fancy a long trip to the other historical sites. I really enjoyed my holiday, i love Mexico and would def go back for the 3rd time in a row next year but if im honest i wouldnt re-visit the Iberostar Tucan even though we had a great time, the evening buffet was a let down to the hotel.", "Date": "November 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "farnham, surrey", "Title": "\u201cAbsolute paradise\u201d", "Author": "martyn_singleton", "ReviewID": "UR21514793", "Content": "Just returned from Tucan after a 8 night stay, what can i say ! this place is paradise and the food is wonderfull, beleive none of the fussy people who call the food mediocre, god only knows what planet they are on.. to start, the flights where good, we flew premier class on First choice, it was fantastic, extra leg room, menu choice for dinner, 8 movies to choose from, games to play etc, all on a 8\" personal tv screen located in the headrest in front of you, on landing we where met and greeted by First choice rep whom led us to our coach, ignore the many people asking whom you flew with pretending to be part of your travel company these only want to carry your bags the very short distance and await a tip.. a con in my eyes, if i want a porter id find one ! never the less, boarded the coach, we where 2nd drop off, so within 1 hr we where at our paradise location, a absolutely huge lobby/reception, words cant describe the size, with a pair of parrots un tethered on trees in the entrance.. we were booked in very swiftly and led to our room, which was immaculate and large, with a double bed to die for, not king, super super king ! and a mini bar re stocked daily.. tea and cofffee making facilitys and a nice large bathroom/shower room...

This is our first time at this resort and our second time to the area. I paid a little extra to have a private transport from the airport to the resort. Well worth it. As soon as we got our luggage we were in the van within 15 minutes. No stopping at other resorts to drop other passengers off. We also traveled on a Friday instead of Saturday which made going through customs a breeze. We arrived at the resort about 1 30 pm and our room was ready. That was nice because we prepared ourselves to have to wait and packed clothing in our carry on bag to change into. I booked this trip in March of '08 and requested a room on the beach and a king bed. We got neither. My husband didnt want to go through the process of trying to change it. The resort itself was very nice. We also saw housekeeping working to keep everything clean and it was. I had to call the desk once because the coffee wasnt restocked for 2 mornings in our room, but otherwise it was fine. The beach was nice and we could always find chairs either on the beach or at the pool. We didnt find the sandbags in the water ugly, in fact they were fun to play on. Walking the beach further down was even more lovely and secluded. The pool was pretty cold and the hot tub was not heated. The adult pool bar is separate from the main pool which was fun but the water was so cold that it really needed to be pretty hot weather in order to tolerate it. Also there was no music at the adult pool which really would have given it a festive atmosphere. The jungle walkways were really nice with birds, monkeys, iguanas, etc. Be careful not to walk it at night as the lighting was poor. In fact the lighting was very dim all around the resort at night which made it difficult. The staff were all so very nice and very hardworking. Always a smile etc. I've read in other reviews that the Star Friends were too persistent however, we found them very sweet, they'd ask us to participate and when we said no, they thanked us and went on. No problem. Here is the problem, the food was less than mediocre. I'm not at all a fussy eater and will usually try many new things. After 2 nights of eating at the buffet I got to where I was dreading dinner. We also ate at the Japanese and Italian restaurants. The Italian food was bland but not terrible. I recommend the lamb chops. The Japanese was fun but again no great shakes. Breakfast was better at the buffet. We took a cab ($5) to town and had Mexican food which was absolutely wonderful. Overall we had a good time and met great people and it was a good value for the money we paid however, next time I'll pay a little more and choose a different resort.", "Date": "November 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Colorado", "Title": "\u201cGreat place for a vacation even if you're not in the best of shape\u201d", "Author": "NanaColorado", "ReviewID": "UR21453444", "Content": "We booked through Apple Vacations using a travel agent, and I think that's why we got a fantastic junior suite right on the beach (there aren't many rooms that actually face the beach, but the jungle views are excellent, too). She pre-arranged an eggshell mattress cover, so that helped a little with the hard mattresses, and we slept fine after every busy day. Was sorry that there wasn't a tub, but the shower was huge and had a nice hand-spray. We went during the last week of October, and the resort wasn't too crowded, and it wasn't too hot to be able to sleep...it got downright cool most of the nights we were there. We went to several of the nightime shows, and they were enjoyable. They usually have some sort of audiance participation to start off with, and that ranged from very funny to very uncomfortable and embarrassing, but was always followed by some very good entertainment. Don't bother taking your laptop, since internet access is a problem. They only have wi-fi in the reception lobby, and think it was something like $20 a day to log on. They do have four computers you can use to log on (20 pesos for 10 minutes), but they malfunction frequently and you have to ask the busy desk staff to re-boot. The food was okay, and you can always find some interesting dishes to try, although I agree that the menu was pretty boring after a week. You will have an interesting experience at the Japanese Restaurant, since this is one where the chef prepares the meal in a very entertaining manner at a grill in the middle of a large communal table. The food he prepared was very good. We also really enjoyed the Italian Restaurant. The Steak House had a few problems....I think we had a new waiter who wasn't very attentive, and the meat was all really fatty...maybe stick with chicken or shrimp instead. The resort staff are all very sweet people, and usually speak very good English. Even though you don't have to tip the waiters, please do -- a dollar or two goes a long way in that country, and most of them provided very, very good service. We went on the Tulum and Xel-Ha excursion. I have a bad back, so this ruin was not too difficult to get to, and very beautiful. The water park at Xel-Ha has a lazy river, and you take a shuttle to get to the top, then ride down the river in innertubes. The first part is magical, quiet, and beautiful.....but it ends in a large lake, and you have to paddle like mad to get to the other side where your things are stored. Good thing I had my strong husband to paddle us both back, or I would still be floating in the middle of the lake! One of the scariest parts about excursions is the traffic and crazy drivers -- be sure to buckle yourself (and your children) in, because they don't require it....and we had several sudden, scary stops. Went on the snorkeling adventure to silversands beach, which is close to Cancun. Another scary ride through flooded, washed out roads and lots of construction traffic. We gave our driver a $20 tip a the end, because he was able to accomplish this nearly impossible feat. You take boats out to get to the reef. I'm not a snorkeler, but gave it a try and had a horrible panic attack when I hit the water. Do tell your guide that you are an afraid beginner, and he will take you around on a floation device so you don't swallow so much water. My husband loved it....went back in again after we moved to a different location, but I stayed in the boat the second time. DO remember to bring a towel...they only provide life jackets, flippers and snorkels, and it gets really, really chilly on the boat when you get out of the water. They take you back to the beach around 2 p.m. for lunch, and it was delicious. You can then stay on the beach while the more adventurous types go back to a deeper reef.", "Date": "November 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NJ", "Title": "\u201cTwo Thumbs Up for the Tucan\u201d", "Author": "Tralynn", "ReviewID": "UR21339512", "Content": "This was our second time to Mexico, first time to Playa Del Carmen and Iberostar Tucan.

We ziplined, snorkeled with sea turtles and went to the Jungle Place where you can play with monkeys...that was the absolute highlight of my day. Edventure tours are great they allow you to customize your day to do only what you want to do. I would definitly tour with them again. The only disappointments were the weather, which no one can control...and the fact that the jacuzzi's in the pool are not heated. They have jacuzzi's in the spa that you can use free of charge but there is a separate one for women and men, so could not hot tub with my husband.

On checking in we were given a refreshing non alcoholic cocktail. Check in was speedy with the receptionist trying to deal with a number of parties from our coach all at once which she did very successfully. We asked for a first floor room and after some searching by the duty manager we were given a room in block 18 in The Quetzal (although we booked the Tucan) Apparently they use each others rooms occasionally to fulfil guest requests which was fine with us. The room was clean and we found the bed to be comfortable. Yes it was hard but that was fine for us. The Bars. We mostly used the Quetzal reception bar which was nearer to our room. The staff were great and knew what drinks we liked and how we liked them. They were very attentive and the service extremely good. It was a shame that there were not sections of the bars for non smokers like the restaurants. We didn't use the swim up bar as it always seem to be crowded with loud people. Not the place to go for a relaxing, quiet drink! Restaurants We enjoyed the buffet meals. We have read lots of reviews about the Tucan/Quetzal and think the catering staff have been unjustly criticised considering that they have to deal with so many visitors from so many Countries and Cultures throughout the world. We never had a problem finding something to eat and the food was varied daily. We felt the catering staff did a great job in trying to please everyone in the buffet restaurants. The A la Carte restaurants were a bit disappointing and did not live up to our expectations especially the Italian as we found the food to be very bland. The staff in all the restaurants were brilliant, in fact all the staff we encountered in the Tucan and Quetzal were excellent. Its just a shame that some visitors couldn't be as polite as the staff. We witnessed several occasions whereby the staff were not shown any courtesy by a simple please or thank you. It costs nothing to be polite. One night an American guy was trying to tell the bar tender how to make a Marguerita! How rude! The Beach It was good and generally well maintained. The sandbanks made it even more fun. The sand had cigarette ends in it which was a shame when there were plenty of bins to deposit them. Some people think they are the only ones on holiday and forget about others. A little consideration goes a long way. The Pool With so many trees around the place it was difficult to keep leaves out of the pool but it was generally very clean. Maybe the spa could have been separate to the pool. The walkways around the restaurants and gardens were dimly lit at night which looked pretty and romantic but not very safe. On the Quetzal side the boardwalk was uneven so I was constantly looking down to avoid tripping up. When walking in the gardens area the ground was very uneven and really unsuitable for anyone with walking difficulties.

In terms of mosquitos, there were a lot and I was surprised. I have visited PDC in January, April, May, June, September and October and never experienced the mosquitos before. Even friends who live in PDC had commented on them. Personally, I like the fact that the swim up bar is in a separate pool...the adult pool. People have a tendancy to sit and drink all day long and I like the fact that it is separated from the regular pool. I found the week we were there to be mostly Americans and over the years the Yucatan has become a very popular spot for Americans. I personally miss the days when the crowd was more diversified in terms of being more international. I also find that the amount of development in the area has changed the area and wish they would stop building. I still love the Quetzal/Tucan property.

I've stayed in the Riviera Maya three times now: the Riu Yucatan in 1998, the Riu Tequila in 2006 and now the Iberostar Tucan. I know it has nothing to do with the resort but as a side note I booked through Signature Vacations out of Toronto, Ontario and have no complaints about their service. Check in/Check out: No complaints, no line up when we arrived, was at the desk for about 5 minutes, we arrived at 12:00pm, was told that our room wouldn't be ready until 1:30pm or so. Returned to the desk at 1:30 and the room was ready. Room: Real nice. Clean (which is the most important thing as far as I'm concerned), comfortable and well air conditioned (though I really don't think it got down to the 70 degrees that I set the thermostat to). At night time between the air conditioning and the large fan over the beds I would usually find myself under the covers within a few minutes of going to bed. I actually found the beds very comfortable though they were hard, which I like. The mini fridge was stocked with beer, coke, fanta and water. There was a good selection of coffee with the coffee pot. Unfortunately we were on the ground floor, went to the front desk to see if they had something higher, which they did, but would have to change buildings. Being in building 11 (closest to the beach besides the suites) I decided to stay in our room, actually had a bit of an ocean view! Never had a problem with any bugs. Room was also very quiet, never had a problem with noise from the neighbors. Lobby/Grounds: We booked and stayed at the Tucan though you have access to all the Iberostar Quetzel amenities as well. The Quetzel is bassicaly the same resort with a seperate lobby and buffet area. This is where the resort really shone. The grounds were incredible. I loved the jungle walk from the lobby area to the beach, especially at night time when the lights were on. I actually liked the Quetzel lobby better then the Tucan as it seemed less busy and the chairs were more comfortable. Everything was very clean! Internet was available in both lobbies, 20 peso's for 15 minutes. Staff: Very friendly and helpful, no complaints. If you had an empty drink whether at a bar, the pool or in the lobby you couldn't sit for more then a few minutes before someone was asking you if you would like another. Never met our maid but she did nice job. I found that the servers treated you the same whether you tipped them or not. Bars: I counted 8 bars throughout the resort. Favourite was the lobby bar at the Quetzel, then the bar at the show area. These two bars had top shelf liquors and a very capable bar tenders. Drinks were as strong as you asked for them to be and very consistent. They used the local liquor unless you asked for the top shelf stuff. Favourite drink was the \"Planters Punch\". No matter where you were sitting in the lobby you wouldn't have an empty glass for more then a few minutes until a server brought you a new drink. Nice atmosphere at the lobby bars sometimes with live music. The beach and pool bars were okay, big difference in the cocktails, pool bars seemed slushy with little alcohol where as the lobby and show area bar were very good. One complaint is the swimup bar which is in it's own little adult only pool. Didn't like not having a swimup bar in the main pool area, plus the smaller adult only swimup bar pool seemed to be always full with loud obnoxious people. Restaurants/Food: The buffets were the only area where I was a little disappointed. Don't get me wrong, the food was good but I found that it wasn't as good as the Riu Tequila two years ago. The buffets were nice, well laid out with a nice atmosphere but the food just didn't seem as tasty. I remember at the Tequila I looked forward to dinner every night more then anything else, not so at the Tucan. Probably just a personal preference; the Tucan had a lot of seafood which I'm not a big fan of. We usually ate at the Quetzel buffet as the scenery was better. Breakfast was probably the best meal of the day. Also the desert was delicious, better then the Tequila. The a la carte restaurants were better then the Tucan as well with my favorite being the Steakhouse. Neither the buffets nor the steakhouse were air conditioned, seemed to be a problem to some but I never found the heat to be a problem, your in Mexico for Pete's sake, I travelled down there for the heat. Pool: What can you say, it's a pool? Always seemed pretty clean, never crowded, a good size. Never had problem finding a lounger in the shade. Beach/Ocean: Beach was nice, you would never know that it was non-existent 8 months ago. Again never had problems finding a shaded lounger. Wasn't a big fan of the sandbags, I realize that they served a purpose but I found that they kind of congregated everyone into a small area. I usually moved south down the beach in front of the Sandos which didn't have any sandbags. Shows: Typical resort style show. The staff worked hard at it, which is all you can really ask for. Found the pre show stuff usually was better and funnier then the show itself. Area: I really like the Playacar/Playa Del Carmen area. Took a cab into Playa del Carmen 3 times, good way to spend the evening after supper waiting for the show to start. Felt safe the whole trip whether in town or at the resort. Well I guess that about wraps it up, sorry for the length. I would have no problems recommending this resort to anyone. I definitely will be re-visiting the Iberostar resort chain.", "Date": "October 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sheffield", "Title": "\u201cGreat holiday\u201d", "Author": "SandJD", "ReviewID": "UR20805842", "Content": "This is the first review we have ever carried out after many years of travelling abroad for our holidays but after reading trip adviser which helped greatly in choosing our holiday at the Tucan we feel compelled to offer some help to anyone thinking of visiting this hotel.

We were scheduled to check into the hotel on 9/6 thru 9/16. We were flying out of Charlotte, NC and on 9/3 Hurricane Hanna was a threat for us leaving out on the 6th. US Air placed our flight under weather advisory and offered to change our flight out to 9/4 to beat the storm out. We called the hotel before we left and were told they had the availability so we booked our flight at midnight on 9/4 and left our home at 2am to be at the airport at 4am to catch the only flight out at 6am! We arrive in Cancun airport very excited to be back at our \u201chome away from home!\u201d We get transported to the Tucan resort only to find the staff not willing to provide us with a room. We explained that we had called ahead and the entire story but Karina at the front desk didn\u2019t want to hear it! She was so rude and wanted to charge us $600 for 2 nights stay! NO WAY!! I told my husband that we would just take a taxi to down town and stay in a boutique for that cost! She was still unwilling to listen to what we were trying to tell her. My husband walked next door to the Sando\u2019s who were more than happy to help! They booked us in a JR STE that was lovely. I can\u2019t say enough about the Sando\u2019s for the 2 days we stayed there! BIG mistake on Karina\u2019s part because we are now Sando\u2019s lovers and will NEVER return to the Tucan. We did check into the Tucan on the 6th as originally planned. I noticed right away that the hotel HAD to have new mgmt because the changes from October 2007 from September 2008 were HUGE. They closed the other 2 lunch buffet choices and only left 1 option for lunch. EVERYDAY the food choices were the same. Last year the food was terrific and had a large variety of great foods. This year we were disappointed that not once did they have Mexican food!! I don\u2019t travel to Mexico to eat Hamburgers, Fried Chicken and white rice! Also the staff was not on top of their game like in the years past. It was so obvious that they have a new weak leader! With only 1 buffet open for lunch you have to have people busting tables so people can find a place to eat. More times than I can count the staff were goofing off and the guest where cleaning the tables. One night at the dinner buffet our waiter was no where to be found so we got up and fixed our own glass of water. Our waiter got in trouble and then gave us the evil eye for getting our own water!! I asked a great bar tender if they had a new manager and he confirmed that I was correct. The new mgr began in February 2008 and the bar tender asked how I knew and I told him that it was THAT OBVIOUS all the changes that had been made to cut corners. The star friends do work their rears off and I appreciate the effort they make to ensure everyone has a great time. However all 5 times they have had the same exact shows. If you know that people are returning guest or stay for more than one week than change up the shows for the love of God. We had another problem during our stay. On Monday the 8th after returning from an all day trip to the beach we came back to our room at 530pm to get ready to meet our new friends from England to go down town. They were staying at the Sando\u2019s and we were to meet them at 730pm at the street outside the hotel. I was blow drying my hair and the power went out. My husband called the front desk since we couldn\u2019t find a breaker. They sent up the maintenance man who didn\u2019t speak any English so we had a hard time explaining the breaker was tripped. Then he pulled back the top of our closet which exposed this crazy wire system. He called up another worker and they both worked until 7:10pm. It was getting dark and they couldn\u2019t see what they were doing. Our room was getting hot and we had to meet our friend. My husband still hadn\u2019t had a shower and my hair was still wet! They rigged up our power and told us it was a temporary fix for us to get ready but told me not to dry my hair because it would be dangerous. They waited outside our door and we left him in our room and went down town. When we returned we had a note on the front door to call the front desk. The front desk told us that they didn\u2019t fix it but had the air working on the temporary fix so our TV didn\u2019t work along with outlets. I was just happy the air was working! The next morning at 730am we had a knock at the door. A new maint. man that came in our room and saw we had lights so he was confused. He also didn\u2019t understand any English and kept trying to tell us that it was just our TV!! We kept trying to explain to him what had happened but he didn\u2019t understand. HE called the front desk and again Karina (the girl that gave us a hard time on the 4th) refused to listen to what we were telling her and kept telling my husband it was the TV. Finally the maintenance man realized that the other outlets didn\u2019t work either. He stayed in our room for around an hour and finally said we would need to move rooms. The bellboy bought up a key for our new room and it was not a room with a king bed. All week the hotel told us that they had the buffet\u2019s closed because it was a slow week so we had a hard time understanding why they tried to tell us they didn\u2019t have another room with a king bed! We had to pack up our entire entire luggage (again since we had stayed at the Sando\u2019s before) and move to the Quetzal side for a room!

HOTEL The hotel was outstanding, much better than we had imagined and we quickly found our way around the paths through the jungle separating the tucan from the neighbouring iberostar quetzal. I had emailed the hotel a week prior to leaving the UK to request a top floor balcony room in block 14 (central to the resort) and was pleased to have my request granted. It was always immaculately clean and the staff always said hello if you passed them. ROOM The room turned out to be a hidden gem, several times we had howler monkeys inches from our balcony and it became a regular event to watch them come by at around 1800pm. We had no problems with the hardness of the bed and actually slept very well contrary to what other people have experienced. The mini bar was stocked every other day (nice beer!), and the shower was big. The maid left us a different towel sculture every day so it was always interesting to know what we had each day! FOOD We loved the food, the buffet had so much to offer, there was always something we liked, tho our favourite has to be the seafood. Crab claws, shrimps, mussles and smoked salmon were always highly rated! The service was always excellent and the wine wasn't bad either! If you are a couple you almost always get a table by the water to watch all the wildlife and the fountains, as the buffet is open aired. I recommed to try some authentic mexican dishes and sauces, some are quite hot but the tacos are good. Our favourite restaurant for entertainment value had to be the japanese. The chef was very skillful with his chopping and spinning of eggs and we had a great time. The italian, brazilian and mexican are all very good, the service is excellent and the food was delicious. the tropical one was shut at night while we were there but to be honest there was more than enough choice of where to go eat. At breakfast and lunch you could also eat at the tropical restaurant by the beach which was handy from time to time. BEACH/POOL The beach is in quite good conditon at the moment. There is a slight slope in places but the huge sand bags (or whales) in the water do a good job of protecting the beach and are very good fun to sit on as the waves wash over! The sea was pretty rough some days but considering hurricane ike had just passed nearby, we think that was why. The pool was amazing, huge and pretty deep. always warm with a bubble pool in the middle. We spent a lot of time chilling out there! The bar at the beach was good and you could get an ice cream anytime during the day. We had no trouble getting a sunbed on the beach or by the pool before 10ish but after that it seemed pretty busy but it was a mexican holiday during the second week of our stay! ENTERTAINMENT The star friends are always very energetic and do all of the daily activities aswell as the nightly shows. Our favorite shows of the ones we saw were the magic show and hollywood show where professional singers sing. The lobby bars were a good place to have a few cocktails before or after dinner and we often got some popcorn to go with our drinks! ANIMALS I couldn't belive the diversity of wildlife we saw in and around the jungle. If you are a wildlife fan then this is the place for you. Throughout the stay we saw: Agoutis everywhere, very cute brown animals like large guineapigs. Peacocks and a whole array of other birds, howler monkeys (often near our balcony). Tons of iguanas, flamingos in their own pool they have there, toucans in the enclosure by the pool, a snake, terrapins in the water and tortoises (in an enclosure). A strange looking nocturnal animal like a cross between a racoon and a shrew with a long tail. The macaw parrots in the lobby, there are green parrots in the quetzal lobby. Just before we left one of the red macaws said 'OLA' several times over which amused me no end! EXCURSIONS We did the full day excursions to the ecological parks of Xcaret (mainly land based with the big mexican show) and Xel Ha (mainly water based) and the Tulum extreme day (half day zip lining, half day visiting tulum ruins). There's loads more to do but the one we did we thoroughly enjoyed the experiences we had and the rep was very informative. FLIGHT The flight with first choice went fairly smoothly, a slight delay leaving manchester but we only arrived 15 mins late into cancun. Left a little late on the way back but only took 8 and a half hours to return. The plane had loads of leg room and the inflight meals were pretty decent. All in all, we had an excellent holiday and i would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to have some fun and relaxation in the sun.

The Iberostar name is synonymous with class and service, and this was impeccable. We discovered many people go back year after year and the Americans we met had a very high opinion of it. It seems to come out well in all the reviews as well. The Mayan people are very industrious and everything there was spotless and well cared for, and the staff were wonderful friendly people. The Tucan (and it's parallel Hotel, the Quetzal) were excellently situated with jungle in between all the way from behind Reception along to the pool/beach. We saw the resident spider monkeys almost every afternoon at teatime, with baby monkeys in tow. After about ten days we became aware of all the areas to look out for different animals - iguanas, coypu (loads of them), even a pig with a very long tail about 18 inches in length which it held outstretched all the time, until we discovered it could also curl it up and used it to carry leaves for a nest!! A snake crossed my path at one stage, and we even saw something resembling a racoon; and there were white herons everywhere at breakfast and wild birds, tiny hermit crabs at the beach, and even an iguana which crept out from underneath one of the sunbeds one day (yikes!). The pool areas were beautiful, the whole area being hosed down every evening and all the pools cleaned. The water warmed with the amount of sun, and was like a bath in the late afternoons! The spot by the sea was also excellent, although we were told by another holidaymaker that the tidal currents are extremely dangerous - he just escaped drowning by a fraction on a particularly windy day (tail end of Hurricane Gustave). There was a great choice of places to sit/lie, although the cabanas were usually occupied (though this didn't greatly concern us). Our only minor complaint was the sunbeds, which collapsed variously around the pool with people on them all day, every day; there's only so much you can bite your lip and smile back at the knowing smiles of other collapsees about that when you're risking a back injury day in, day out! The beds WERE hard, as we'd been warned, which made us wake up with backache to various degrees every day. But the rooms were spotlessly cleaned and every day there were fresh towel-art arrangements. The maids did such a good job and the fridge was filled daily with fresh drinks, a large water bottle provided for the coffee-maker (which doubled as a kettle). NB: Milk is of the creamer variety. The cocktails at the beach were prepared rather wildly and had various intoxicating effects depending on what you ordered, but the ones in the bar were excellent; the cocktail waitresses were extremely attentive, happy and friendly, and wanted to make sure you enjoyed as many drinks as possible, hence they worked very hard to ensure you enjoyed the experience and were well tended to. We loved the very sweet Juanita. I had read a bit about the \"Star Friends\" on this site. The entertainment wasn't bad, the magic show probably the best, and the whole team worked tirelessly to ensure holidaymakers had opportunities for sport, games and - more importantly - fun. They were lovely people, and the guys were extremely good-looking!! They seemed to work from dawn until midnight, giving round-the-pool entertainment (but you didn't have to be near it and couldn't hear it some areas, at all) to archery and air rifle shooting, to games, to children's entertainment in the early evening, to different entertainments for the adults in the evenings. Look out for Max, his inherent dancing ability should be a show in itself! On the less positive side, we found the \"Theatre\" extremely smoky and very hot, but you could place yourself at the edge if you wanted to and still see and enjoy the show whilst also being able to breath fresher cooler air. One of the best things was the easy, relaxed way the Diving Team introduced you to the idea of scuba diving; they were all so lovely that my two teens really want to go back there next year and my husband to learn. There was never a hard sell involved. My teenage son, 17, and daughter, 14, took the complete PADI-approved course because they enjoyed it so much and we have a DVD made up by the team incorporating footage of their very first dive and the fish they saw - a brilliant bonus. The idea of everything being all-inclusive is just perfection itself! For my husband particularly it was so easy and released any cares or worries about budgeting or running out of money. The quality of the food at the Buffet was OUTSTANDING (don't take any notice of anyone who writes otherwise!!). There were about five long wide marble tables on which were presented immaculate food choices - from starters to desserts - and an area of three similar tables from which you could obtain freshly cooked eggs to order in the mornings, and see various meats and hot meals being prepared and/or served at night. The meals available by the pool during the day were absolutely fine, a pretty good variety and the burgers are amazing (and this is from someone who doesn't normally choose a burger to eat but knows a good one!). There is ice-cream available all day and drinks available all day - including cocktails...and all within easy reach of the pools and the beach. The specialised restaurants varied, with the Japanese being top for a fun experience and reasonably good food. The tropical restaurant was a bit strange with not great choices on the menu, but the Mexican was the worst, which was a pity, as the staff and the experience were really good; the beef choices - if you didn't order steak, which my husband felt was good - tasted like offal and everything looked the same - served on a flat burrito in tiny dices and very unappetising-looking. The steak restaurant served good food but it was a very long walk and didn't have any atmosphere at all. We found we much preferred the evening Buffet restaurant, and would gladly have gone there every night if we were thinking of going back, such was the variety of dishes, and there was a huge range of choices every day (and not a bowl of chilli con carne in sight!!). We can't recommend the Hotel highly enough. We booked with First Choice, coming from the UK, and although we have a few gripes about the (sour-faced) flight crews (both ways), long delays (2 and 4 hours respectively, with little information given) and the First Choice-recommended Chichen Itza Tour - more in next para - we would say that First Choice are VERY LUCKY to have the Tucan on their books. The Chichen Itza Tour which First Choice recommend takes 3 hours. If you drove, we reckon you could do it in less than half that time. What they fail to tell you in advance is that you drive around in around a 15-km vicinity collecting and dropping off people - rather like a bus service!! - and all at your expense (time-wise). The \"breakfast\" is one tiny (standard Mexican-sized - i.e. doll-sized) croissant; there's no fruit, as promised. The drink distribution and supply was OK. There was an early attempt to hard-sell jewellery. Not sure whether this was good value, but we objected to a hard sell which interrupted a film we'd all been enjoying and were never shown the end of. Our main complaint - which we're taking up with First Choice - was the supposed Tour Guide who didn't give us a tour. He opted out and left us all on our own, so we didn't get a guided tour of the place I'd saved to see for eight years!! I feel that this was a bit of a con; not sure if anyone else has found this - be interested to hear from you if you do; others on our tour felt similarly. The coach toilet didn't flush properly and is not intended for No.2s, although I'm afraid that is not the main concern - there was no running water available for the washing of hands, although strangely there was a bottle of hand washing liquid! We would far rather have hired a car - it's all really well sign-posted so I would recommend this to you if you're up for it; otherwise the flight, although expensive, sounded good; there are other people on the beach who run trips out there and take two hours. We would advise anything but the First Choice-nominated \"Tour Guide\". Hopefully this won't put you off what has to be one of the most beautiful spots in the area. We realised once we were driving back on the coach what a good choice we had made in this hotel, which is in it's own community of Playacar, and would definitely consider going back there if we plan to stay in the area again. Playa del Carmen was OK but we found that we were glad to be staying on the site we were on, and had access to so much that felt it would be easy never to venture away. This really is one of the most relaxing holidays ever, and the place, people and environment (particularly the jungle) are the best!", "Date": "September 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow, Scotland", "Title": "\u201cBrilliant Holiday!\u201d", "Author": "Purplelenni", "ReviewID": "UR19988287", "Content": "I would recommend this hotel to anyone, I am 29 and went with my boyfriend in August. There was a good mix of ages and plenty to keep you occupied. The hotel was very clean and the staff couldn't do enough for you, even without a tip, but in my opinion they deserve every single penny. The beach was right on the doorstep and had beautiful white sand with turquiose warm sea! Always plenty sunbeds available. The pool was shared between Tucan and Quetzal but again always plenty sunloungers available. There is also an adult pool with a swim up bar which is lovely and cool in the humidity. To get to the pool you walk through the original jungle parts were you can sometimes see the monkeys, Iguanas, peacocks etc. There is plenty food too, 5 a la carte restaurants which you get guaranteed bookings in, then after your five if they have availability you can request more. There is a Japanese, Mexican, Steakhouse, Italian and Seafood. I recommend the mexican and Japanese if even for the show! There is also the buffet which had a wide selection of eveything, even carvery (turkey, lamb, fish, beef). I cant complain about the food at all. Entertainment: The hotel has an entertainment team called \"STAR friends\", might not be everyones cup of tea however they work extremely hard day and night to keep people entertained, they have ping pong, beach volleyball, archery etc during the day and in the evening put on different shows in the theatre between the hotels. The effort put in is unreal and If you dont want to take part you dont have to, they put no pressure on you. If you get itchy feet its only $5 in a taxi to Playa del Carmen, which is a really nice little town with loads of restaurants and shops. Trips: We went to Xcerat an eco park with animals, little rivers to snorkel through, lovely inlets to sunbathe at, and other extra's like dolphin swimming. We doen the Sea Trek where you put on a big fishtank like helmut on and walk along the bottom of the sea among the tropical fish...cool. We also swan with dolphins at Delphinus, you get 40 mins to swim, get foot push, kiss etc...its great fun! My boyfriend went deep sea fishing which he loved for half a day. We went on the Cancun shopping trip, this is the only thing I'd say dont do it. All the shops you visit are in Playa del Carmen anyway! Hope this helps...all I can say is we had a wonderful time and i would def go back!", "Date": "September 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nuneaton", "Title": "\u201cA dream of a hotel...............................\u201d", "Author": "OwlsS6", "ReviewID": "UR19956200", "Content": "FANTASTIC, AWESOME, WOW what a hotel. Our family had the pleasure of stopping at this hotel for a fortnight from Aug 26 2008 with Thomas Cook and what can we say that hasn\u2019t already been said about this special hotel in all the previous reviews? From the moment we arrived we were bowled over by everything the Tucan offered. All the hotel staff are friendly and they couldn\u2019t do enough to help or assist. They were always immaculately dressed from the girls collecting the glasses on the beach to the cleaners in the hotel and attentive to your every needs. Our room was always exceptional cleaned like the rest of the hotel, with fresh towels and bed linen everyday. I think the maid must of gone to the Japanese Origami Towel Folding School as everyday we had a different creation on our beds. The restaurants we could not fault the food was always of an exceptional high standard and never boring. We had 5 bookings for the speciality restaurants, a camera for the Japanese is a must and the Italian was fantastic, my only fault with these would be some guests think that the mandatory wearing of trousers didn\u2019t include them. In your welcome pack, on your reservation ticket and then guest services do tell you when you book that long trousers are mandatory in 3 of the restaurants but the odd few ignored this. Which was a real shame as some people had gone to a real effort to dress for the occasion and the odd few would walk in shorts! If you did fancy a change 50 peso taxi ride into Playa Del Carmen Senor Frogs (located by the ferry) and Karens are fantastic for food and entertainment. We must say a special thank you to Juanita in the Tucan Lobby Bar who was FANTASTIC our glasses were never empty, we had the pleasure of meeting another English couple who we would spend many a night in the bar with and Juanita would look after us all even bringing popcorn for our daughter calling her a big little sister. There was tear shed the night we left as she really did make our nights special. The pool and beach area were exceptional clean, the pool though was like a hot bath so we tended to stay on the beach, the sandbags were not what I imagined but did not detracted from the gorgeous beach and ocean, if anything they proved a great source of fun. The beach does have a lifeguard who was kept very busy thanks to the huge surf Gustav provided, so just be aware of an under current and it can pull you out if you are not careful. The girls on the beach were fantastic and would bring you a drink if you asked nothing was too much trouble for them. The only point I would say is although it says the reserving of sun loungers is not allowed it still happens it was more apparent while there were a lot of families at the hotel and when we came down to the pool area at 9.30ish all the beds had been reserved with towels and no one on them. The same with the beach all the permanent sunshades had been taken but still plenty of beds on the beach but you can collect an umbrella when you get your towels that provide excellent shade. For those travelling with TC, Rosa the Rep in resort is Fantastic the best TC /My Travel Rep we have ever had the privilege of meeting, and she couldn\u2019t do enough to help, I arrived having had a serious knee operation 12 weeks previous and she ensured the hotel had rugs placed on the floor in our room. She always made sure we had everything we needed, so if you are reading this Rosa as I know you said you do thank you again. I would highly recommend the hotel diving school Dressel Divers and for excursions Dolphin Discovery and the Fat Cat Catamarans at Puerto Aventuras. I have written a separate review for these.

We wanted good beach, nice water, family friendly, fun stuff to do, nice room and good food. We got it and more. Based on the reviews here, we decided to go with this AI and I don't regret it. When we arrived, we had that \"wow\" factor and it kept getting better. It's not a 5* hotel, but we didn't expect that. From the nice welcome drink in a large open lobby with parrots and the walk through the jungle area, we were excited from the get go. Check-in and out was the only tiny annoyance we had, but get over it as we are on vacation. Got there early, told to wait a few minutes for room, wait at bar etc. Glad we didn't cos the room wasn't ready until 2 hrs later. We checked in and went to the buffet and pool instead. Better use of our time. At check out getting the bell hop was a bit of a pain. We liked our room in Building #12 on the 2nd floor which overlooked the children's playground and pool area. We saw part of the jungle too. Every evening around 5:30 p.m. the monkeys were around bldg 12 and 11. Rooms were well serviced and mini-bar kept full. Note, air conditioning goes off when the balcony door is open. There's a good ceiling fan. Room was decent size with nice bathroom, shower only. The beds were hard but we slept well. There's a sitting bench which can be converted to another bed area for a smaller person. My 11 year old used this. Easy walk every where in the complex. Do walk around, there was so much to see. The jungle area was a huge attraction for the girls. Monkeys, chickens, iguanas, peacocks, flamingos and tailess \"rats\", toucans. Beautiful koi filled ponds. Food was totally fine. Buffets were great as far as we were concerned, so much choice, couldn't possibly try or eat everything each night. There were changes, so didn't get bored. We ate at the a la carte 4x. We only had 3 with our package, but if you check guest relations at 4:00 p.m if there's space, you can get another one. We ate at the Japanese 2x, Italian and Steakhouse. Loved all 3. It was my little one's birthday and we ordered a cake. They made a big \"to do\" for her and she loved it. Food at the buffet/restaurants were available from 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. There's room service from 11:00 to 11:00 but we never had a need to take advantage of it. We tried all the buffets, all good. The Quetzel buffet at the pool is quieter and less variety for lunch. We hung out at the beach the whole time. Went to the pool only for some of the activities. My teen loved playing water polo, and taking the afternoon dance lessons. The pool was so large, never looked crowded. Yes, we reserved a beach palapa every day at around 8:00-8:30 a.m. cos everyone else was doing it. At 10:30 there were plenty of chairs still available and you can get an umbrella at the towel stand. Loved the beach area. The sand bags were definitely a hit with the kids, didn't detract from the beautiful view imo. Great service from all the staff, lots of friendly faces. The Star Friends were amazing, don't know where they get their energy from. We saw several shows and enjoyed. Yeah, they were a little cheesy, but who cares, we had good laughs and lots of fun. There's a spa, massages by the pool and fitness centre, but we didn't use these. We went on one excursion outside the resort. We booked in advance with Edventure which is highly recommended in tripadvisor. We concur. It was an amazing day of Tulum, cliff-diving, snorkelling in Cenote, Akumal (with turtles), zip line, and a gorgeous lagoon. Very nice small group atmosphere, not the big bus load. Approx $100 per person. Went to Playa de Carmen one evening, short cab ride away and did our souvenir shopping there. All in all a great time, highly recommend this place.

(Very Good)\u201d", "Author": "rosiebmontreal", "ReviewID": "UR19549301", "Content": "My husband & I stayed at the Tucan from Aug. 19th-28th. This was my 3rd time in riviera maya. The last time i was there was in 2001. Previous stays were at Viva Azteca & the Copacabana. I chose the Iberostar Tucan based on Trip Advisor & also wanted to stay in Playacar ( cobblestone streets, very nice) because it is close to Playa del Carmen & you can actually walk around at night to go to the Plaza where there are stores all around just a 5 minute walk away. Playa del Carmen is about a 30 minute walk or taxi ride for about 5$. Rooms: a bit outdated but normal considering the hotel was built in 1997, you can see that things are not as shiny anymore or as plush. My first night there i noticed all along the mirror and marble table where you can put your luggage there was a whole bunch of tiny sugar ants going all over our stuff. I took the initiative to spray all around that area with a can of Off that i had brought along & i never saw any ants again in my room. Note: there is space between the doors & the floor which allowed on three different occasions for tiny lizards to enter our room. Therefore, try putting a towel underneath the door if you can. We found the beds to be very comfortable & we both have back problems. Other than that rooms were clean but a bit stuffy. Also, when you leave the room the air conditioning stops working so that may be why the room doesn't feel as cool. There are no screen doors to air out the rooms, which i did not appreciate. Beach: I've been to Cuba, Punta Cana, La Romana, Cancun & i must say that the nicest beaches are definitely in Cuba. We only had a few days where the water was crystal clear & calm. Other days there was lots of seaweed. A few times we actually went snorkelling. Along the the right side of the Iberostar Tucan after the last sandbags( 3 minute walk) there is a much nicer beach which is just in front of the SANDOS Hotel ( the last hotel in Playacar). It has no sandbags & you can actually walk all the way in the water & the water does not get too deep as it does in front the Tucan Hotel. Food: Pretty good, one of the reasons I chose the Iberostar chain. Previously stayed at Iberostar Hacienda in La Romana and also Iberostar Varadero so I was able to compare. I must say there was not much variety especially at dinner but my husband & I are not too picky so we usually made out pretty well. I must admit by the 7th night i was starting to get bored with the food which did not happen on my 2 weeks stay at both Iberostar Varadero & Iberostar La Romana. We ate at the Tropical (Seafood), Japanese & the Steakhouse and all were pretty good. Service: Excellent, better than all other hotels we had been at for the most part. We heard through other couples that they had over 2000 employees serving our needs and it showed. From the first night we got there they would seat us right away & never leave you waiting long for anything. Only towards the end of our stay did we notice a bit of a slowdown in service & i personally think it was because the hotel was fully booked. Employees genuinely happy to serve you & it was a good feeling. Good Points: A big plus for this hotel was the umbrellas which they lent to their guests each day as long as you brought them back before 5:30pm each day. This helped us tremendously avoid the stress of waking up early each moring to get a hut. I think the latest we got to the beach was around 11:15am & still no problem getting an umbrella....Excellent! Other neighboring hotels did not have this option & we were extremely happy. Also the beach bar had the self serve machines so if you did not want alcohol you did not have to wait for any bartender to make you a drink. Ice Cream stand by the beach everyday-great idea! Pool was big & clean. Weak Points: Pool was very warm like a sauna...not very refreshing, ocean water was more refreshing. No mosquitos at night, we were very lucky. We got good weather all the way through. Disco very nice, music gets good around midnight, if not , make a few requests, DJ is listening to your requests.

Be warned that the hotel management are very sensitive to any suggestion that any illness is caused by their food services. They suggested that I had over indulged in the free food and booze and the illness was not food poisoning. They even had the nerve to say that they had read the Doctors report that stated it wasn't food poisoning...this was a blatant lie as the hotel Doctor had not even completed his report or spoken with the manager at that time.

We had to wait an hour which wasn't so bad so we grabbed a bite to eat at the buffet. BUFFETS: I was not thrilled with the buffets. I am a person that eats basically everything. The quality of the food was not the best. All of the meats tasted very odd to me. I even met a friend that said the steak reminded her of venison. I filled up on the breakfast buffet because they had all of your typical breakfast food which was excellent. The lunch buffet was also not bad. It was just the dinner buffets that were just ok. I did eat a lot of salad most of the nights. I was worried about getting sick from the vegetables being washed in their water. I did not get sick from their water at all. They use bottled water for everything. SPECIALTY RESTAURANTS: The specialty restaurants were wonderful. We did not know until we arrived that you can only eat at 2 if you are staying 5 days. I believe it is 3 if you are staying more days. We went to the Japanese and the Steakhouse. Both of those restaurants were refreshing! The Japanese restaurant puts on a show for you and the cook actually makes fried rice (YUM!) from scratch in front of you. He was very talented! The shrimp (only shrimp I had all week b/c the buffet shrimp still had the eyes attached) and the meat there were actually very good. The Steakhouse was also good. You only get to choose one entree from the menu. My husband and I wanted to order the ribs to split as an appetizer but told we couldn't because everyone gets only one choice. Oh well! You do get a great fried onion blossom on your table to start. You also get to get up and go to the salad bar. We were a little grossed out after we saw a cockroach crawling up someone\u2019s shirt. It fell off and crawled under the salad bar. Our steak was great (we ordered the top sirloin). Don't get me wrong this was not NYC quality steak, but for there it was very good (very different than the steak on the buffet). It came with corn on the cob, a potato, grilled tomato, and broccoli. AIR CONDITIONING: If you are a person that needs to be cool at some point of your day this is not the place for you. When you arrive at the hotel you arrive to the lobby which is open air. You go to your room which is air conditioned but not the air conditioning most are used to. It was fine for me, but at times we had to sit still to cool down for awhile. None of the restaurants are air conditioned (they say the Japanese is but hardly). Yes, you basically sit eating dripping sweat the whole time. The theater where you watch the shows is also not air conditioned. We just basically had the attitude that we didn't care and we were not going to let it bother us. We were in our bathing suits and in the water most of the day so it didn't really matter. BEACH: One of the prettiest beaches I've ever seen. I've been to many islands in the Caribbean and different spots in Mexico and this was picture perfect. I would stare at the ocean water in disbelief. The color and cleanliness of it was amazing. There didn't seem to be any beach erosion. There was plenty of sand and space to enjoy yourself. Rooms: Our room was very clean and well kept. We were in building 14 which wasn't that far of a walk to the beach. We did make the mistake of taking a bottom floor. We had bugs and lizards (tiny ones) in our room every night. We tried to put a towel under the door to try to keep them out but that didn't seem to work so well. My husband even saw a bug that he swears was a roach. I left my suitcases outside when I got home because I wanted to do a creature inspection before I bring something in my house that I cannot get rid of. SHOPPING: The only store in the hotel that belongs to Iberostar is the little convenient store. THE JEWELRY (in the lobby by the reservations kiosk) STORE DOES NOT BELONG TO IBEROSTAR. They rent that space so be very careful. I say this because I had a problem with them. I hired them to fix a piece of jewelry for me and they were unwilling to fix the problem when they messed it up and did it incorrectly. They basically said they could do nothing about it. Their prices were much higher than the little shopping village up the street. When you go to the little shopping village (safe 5 minute walk up the street) get ready to ask for a lower price on everything. It is amazing how they jack up the prices! POOL: I LOVED the pool. It was huge and very clean. I never had anyone on top of me because there was enough space to spread out. I liked that the temperature of the water was pretty warm. My husband thought it was too warm at times, but I thought it was relaxing and perfect. WORKERS: All of the workers were great. They were so attentive and so nice all of the time. We had a few that really went out of their way to help. One I have to mention was Wendy who is part of guest relations. If you have any questions or problems during your stay she really goes out of her way to help. It was so nice to see that. DRESS ATTIRE: All day all you need is a bathing suit! It is great! We would eat lunch at the outside buffet in our bathing suits. We were told men had to wear long pants to dinner. My husband was basically the only one wearing long pants sweating the whole time (even in the specialty restaurants). Everything is so casual. A nice shirt and shorts are totally fine. Do not bring anything heavy. Just remember- you are literally sweating the whole time! JUNGLE: It was a very cool experience. I never stayed at a place like this where you were in the middle of a jungle. They had all sorts of animals. The monkeys are out in the open. You don't always see them. We saw them 3-4 days out of the six we were there. They seem to come out around 5PM at night and like to hang out in the trees above the towel window. It was amazing to see the baby on the mom's back. Of course I never had my camera at the right time! CHECK OUT: Check out is at noon. If you stay even a few minutes after that they charge you $10 an hour. Our van didn't pick us up until 4PM on the day of departure so we checked out, kept our luggage in the lobby (except our carry-ons which we kept with us at all times), and stayed by the pool for the rest of the day. They offer you a shower room and towels to freshen up before heading to the airport. They allow you to enjoy the grounds until you pull away in your van which is very nice. OVERALL: We wanted a perfect, peaceful beach getaway and this was it. There were things about the resort, as you have read, that could have been better, but I am totally judging the beach/pool area. It could not have been better. It was the perfect place to sit back, relax, and unwind.

After trying to pick a place on our own, we finally gave in and decided to work with a true destination wedding planner. We chose DestinationWeddings.com and our rep worked with us for a few months before we finally chose the Iberostar Tucan. We chose it b/c it was reasonably priced and we really liked how they only do one wedding per day. We wanted to be sure that our friends and family would be able to afford to go and there are a lot of hotels now that do several weddings each day. We just really wanted it to be our day surrounded by the people we love. We worked with Veronica and Mayra (the Iberostar Tucan Wedding Coorinators) to plan our dream wedding and they were AWESOME!!! I took a lot of \"stuff\" with us, but the property and their service was perfect for what we envisioned. Rooms - We were pleasantly surprised at check-in when they upgraded us to an ocean front room on the Quetzal side. Although we weren't on the Tucan side with the rest of our friends and family, it was a beautiful site and totally worth the few minute walk to their rooms. The beds were hard, but we didn't lose sleep over it. Food - Overall, the food was pretty good. The buffets were nothing to write home about, but we always found something to eat. I was getting pretty sick of them after being there 9 days. My husband and I, my family and a few of our guests have been in the hospitality industry for years, so I knew the food was especially going to be critiqued. If you're expecting 4 or 5 star restaurants, you'll be disappointed. We ate at 4 of the 5 specialty restaurants. LaHacienda (the Mexican Restaurant) was good. They didn't have chicken tacos on the menu, but when I asked if they could make them for me, they were happy to do so. The Tropical restaurant was also good. We had the weddng dinner at LaMariba (The Steak Restaurant) which was very good, but our favorite specialty restaurant was the Japanese/Hibachi restaurant. Drinks - We were really excited that we would have access to an \"internation bar.\" However, to our dismay...they didn't have Grey Goose or Pitron (which are ours and our guests favorites). If you enjoy vodka, ask for the Smirnoff Black. They won't just pour it for you, but you can request it. We were also disappointed with the pina coladas - they weren't as sweet as we like. Beer, bloody marys, vodka & club soda and mojitos were our groups favorite. Beach - The beach was amazing. The water was crystal clear!!! Enough said!!! Property - The property wasn't what we expected when we arrived, but once we took a step back and realized how unique it truly was, we appreciated it much more. There are all sorts of animals on the property, so it was fun feeling like you were in the jungle. We saw tucans, parrots, monkeys, flamingos, chickens, iguanas, turtles fish and a lot of rat looking things. Staff - The staff was excellent. We had great service throughout our whole trip. We had a lot of valuables in our room and our safe (welcome bags, money, jewelry, etc.) and not a thing turned up missing. Our only complaint is that a few people had a hard time at check-out with their bills. Wedding - The wedding went off perfectly. We had a meeting with Veronica the day of our arrival for 1 hour. We confirmed all the details we had discussed in emails: music, flowers, food, etc. Mayra did our rehearsal dinner and it was so easy. Mayra and Veronica really have this down to a science. I emailed them daily and they were always quick to respond (99% of the time within 24 hours). They were both super organized and had everything set up just as I had envisioned. When I got dropped off at the wedding location, it took my breath away. It was everything I dreamed of and more. We had the wedding reception at the disco and it was so much fun. It was private just for our guests, so the DJ played whatever music we wanted and we could enjoy our time and just drink and dance for a few hours. Also, we went into Guest Services by the Wedding Coordinators office a couple of times when we needed to check a few emails and print a few things out for the wedding and the Manager was incredibly helpful. He gave up his desk and told us to take our time. The wedding photographer was great! The pictures turned out amazing!!! Our only complaint is that the pictures only come in 6*8 so we basically had to order the largest package so that we could get the disc with the pictures on it. The good part about that was that we've been able to take the disc to Target and get pics developed and upload to shutterfly and order whatever we want. Since my husband and I were both raised in different religions, we opted for a pastor from Mexico. Enrique Monroy was our pastor and he was great. He spoke really good English and was easy to contact before our arrival. We also emailed back and forth a few times and he was very responsive. Other Notes - Make sure you take Visa or Mastercard since AmX is not accepted at a lot of the vendors.

The shuttle was prompt and check in was smooth. Our room was not ready but we were expecting that due to our arrivel time and packed a swimsuit in our carry on. We were in building 19 close to the lobby on the second floor. We were very happy with our room. The beach is where we spent most of our time. The sand is white and the water was so blue, some of the most beautiful we have seen. We loved the pool bar. The drinks were great and the water was cool. Henry was our bartender and he was fantastic. We did not spend a lot of time at the pool. It was beautiful and clean but a bit warm and it was hard to find a chair. The food was great as always. I will say the food at the buffet was always the same but there was plenty of variety. We ate at two specialty resteraunts and were happy with both. We ate at the Steak house and the Tropical. This is our third time to this part of Mexico. We felt comfortable to do our excursions on our own. We rented a car right on the resort and drove to Tulum. We had wonderful time exploring the ruins. Be sure to change into your swimsuit before you go in the ruins. There is a beautiful beach you can walk down to and take a dip but no place to change once you get in. This took us half a day. We also took a cab to the ferry dock in Playa del Carmen and took the ferry to Cozumel for the day. We rented a scooter when we got to the island and drove to the sister Iberostar resort which you have full exchange with. They gave us towels and bracelets at the front desk and off we went. We ate lunch did some swimming and exploring. Another beautiful resort which we would love to stay. We had a wonderful day and were back at our resort for dinner.

The white sand beach on the turqoise sea is hard to leave at the end of the day...but the pool bar is the perfect place to meet other guests from around the world. I wish I had known about this place when our children were young because we would have been there every year. The Kid's Club is quite impressive! In addition to activities, many of the children participate in the evening pre-show on the entertainment stage. (That's my favorite part...they have so much fun and are so cute!)

Overall, our trip was wonderful. Flight/Airport/Transfers We flew from NY JFK direct to Cancun on Jet Blue. The flight was great; bring headphones and sweater. Neither headphones nor blankets are free any longer. Once through customs and baggage pick-up we were completely bombarded by timeshare sharks. Having never been to Mexico before, I only knew what I read about and to \u201clook for the man with the orange shirt only,\u201d (our Olympus tour guide). Well, I thought we would be arrested because all of the sharks are wearing official-looking clothing and telling you that you MUST comply with them and follow them. I nervously told them no and kept walking through the terminal. Finally, we found Olympus after paying a porter $3 to take our bags all of 100 feet. If you need Olympus, they are RIGHT outside the door. We had private transfers to the Tucan, which was good, although our driver broke all known speed limits down the Federal to get to the hotel. Check-in Our rooms (we had two) were not ready upon arrival (1 p.m.), but we were served cold drinks and headed for the beach. Beach The Quetzal and Tucan beach is being restored and looks very good. Erosion is not a problem. The sand bars that they have installed in the water do a great job of breaking the waves to the shoreline. The first three days of our stay were too windy to do any non-motorized water activities (the red flag was out). Tropical storm Edouard was forming in the Gulf, I think, although I don\u2019t know if that had anything to do with it since it was a lot further north. Every single chair at the beach was taken when we got there. Every table at the beachside restaurant was taken (remember, this was at about 1:30 p.m.) The remaining days at the beach were a lot calmer, and they started dredging the sand from out in the ocean floor and brought it in to the beach one day we were there. The dive shop was very helpful and arranged for our kayaks and catamaran (all free) with no hassles at all. Water was calmer by then and we had our fill or beach activities. Our kids, as strange as they are, would have rather stayed at the pool, so that\u2019s what we did. Pool The pool is huge \u2026 and deep, although there are sero-entry areas where it is more shallow. Being all of 5\u2019 tall and having a teen and two younger children, I am so glad we brought rafts, inflatable noodles, and a tube with us. Bring it from home instead of buying \u2026 I think the lobby gift shop charges 150 pesos for a cheap raft. I got inflatable noodles (doodles) at an online store (search for \u201cinflatable doodles.\u201d) Water was very, very warm, and not nearly as crowded as the beach. Although, my kids loved the cabanas over the palapas and chairs, so my 5-year-old and I trekked down to the pool most mornings at 5:50 a.m. (yup) to get a cabana. We were mostly successful. There is a TON or reserving of chairs, but those that wanted to cabana-thing stayed in them (I think mainly for fear of losing them). Keep your towels close at hand, as one of our five was stolen and it costs you $10. Rooms Although our travel agent (and us personally) requested connecting rooms in building 10, we were given side-by-side rooms in building 13 (next to the playground/pool). I do not know if they have actual \u201cconnecting\u201d rooms that hold 5 people, but side-by-side rooms did not work for us. Our kids are 13, 9 and 5, and were afraid to sleep alone next door. I have a sleepwalker, too, so my husband and I slept in separate rooms for our vacation. The rooms were well-maintained, clean, and the beds were comfortable \u2026 not hard for us. We left pesos in each room for housekeeping services each day. As soon as we left in the morning, we saw housekeeping and always left the \"please make up room\" card on the door handle. By 11 a.m. each day, our rooms were made up. We also were greeted by towel creations on a daily basis. Grounds The grounds were beautiful. We saw plenty of monkeys, peacocks, cereques (tail-less rat-looking things), tucans, flamingos, etc. Monkeys make really loud grunting noises at sunrise. It was pretty cool. Everything was nicely kept, although the containers that they have on the sides of the pathways for cups could have been emptied more often. The open-air lobby was very nice and kept cool by overhead fans. Dining/Drinking No one got ill from the water. Very good filtration system in place. For an eight-day, seven-night stay, we arranged three reserved dinners. The Mexican restaurant was very good, and our daughters enjoyed the mariachi band. The Japanese was also good, but really no different than our local Benihana. The only difference was oddly saying \u201cgracias\u201d for Japanese food. The steak house had good cuts of meat, but they really could give you better knives. We all found the buffets to be satisfying and they did have enough of a choice to change your lunch/dinner daily. The kids stuck with what they knew. We tried different local cuisine that was rather good and were able to find selections at every buffet that were different each day. We could not believe the waste of some people. Honestly, it\u2019s a buffet. You can go for more. I can\u2019t tell you how many people we saw who piled their plates high and never finished HALF of what they took. It was a shame. We picked a sample of things and went back for more. Yes, I know, it\u2019s an all-inclusive, but the waste was appalling. The Tucan lobby bar, I found, served the most watered-down drinks, and the beach bar and aqua bar served drinks with a better blend of alcohol to ice. Atmosphere The IB Tucan had a lot of Europeans. Being of European descent (we live in the U.S.) this was not as \u201cshocking\u201d as some that have posted. We met many people from Germany, Poland, England, Greece, Serbia, Russia, Holland \u2026 overall, very nice. Many families, although there were more young couples in groups than I thought there would be. Topless on the beach, but we knew about it and travel to Europe often, so no big deal. The STAR friends were exceptional. We didn\u2019t participate in a ton of the activities, but I gotta tell ya, they keep on going. The beach volleyball, water polo, darts, table tennis, dancing, and nightly shows \u2026 they are truly earning whatever it is they make. And now I have a really catchy song, in my head! ;-) Other We took the $5 taxi ride into PDC town and went shopping. Note: haggle for hair braiding services \u2013 much cheaper in town than at the hotel, although the women expect big tips from you! The vast majority of the money they make is profit, yet they were not pleased with the tip we left and got very angry! Go to Se\u00f1or Frogs. Cheap gifts for home in town. Make sure you bring Band Aids because we ran out and the IB Tucan lobby said we had to walk to the Quetzal to BUY one. They sell them individually. As another mentioned, bring sunscreen and bug repellent. One of my daughters got eaten alive from the knees down, EVEN with bug repellent.

Seriously, you are in the middle of a jungle FULL of wildlife, such as, monkeys, iguanas, something (?) that looks like an oversized rat without a tail....They kind of freaked me out a bit, but I got used to them. Birds, etc. The service was good, the food was really good, and the rooms were very comfortable. Our room had no tub, but we did not miss it b/c the shower was really nice. The beach is nice, a little small, but don't let that scare you b/c there was plenty of room for you to sit and enjoy. There are huge sandbags in the water and if you have kids, all the better, b/c these sandbags acted as a \"playground\" for them. The adults also enjoyed playing on the sandbags as well. The water was a bit rough during our stay, but it did not deter us from enjoying the water. The pools are great, but very very warm. The best place to \"cool\" off in the pool is the swim up bar. That is by far the coolest pool at the resort. So go there and get a drink; cool off and head back to the beach where there is a good breeze, b/c at the big pool, there is NO breeze. Monkeys are great. Just listen above your head for the \"rustle.\" If there is a rustle, there is a monkey. Be sure to have your camera ready! DON'T feed the monkeys b/c they WILL jump on you. We saw it happen to a guy next to us. He was dumb enough to try and feed the monkey and it, being a wild animal and all, jumped right on him. The guy did not get hurt, but boy, was he rattled. That made our night b/c it was quite a show. Drinks are good; a little light, so if you want a strong drink, just tell them to add more alcohol; they are more than accommodating. If you want a hut with sun beds, be sure to get up at 4 am hahaha, to reserve one, b/c they go quick....They say you are \"not allowed\" to reserve a sun bed, but EVERYONE does it. We preferred to get an umbrella and made our own shade near the water; That was actually nicer than the huts which are up near the hotel more. Star friends are nice and friendly; they try and get you involved and if you don't want to be involved and just want to lay on the beach, they will leave you alone. Try the para sailing; it was really neat. Also, don't hesitate to buy silver from the guy walking the beach b/c it is worth it; just haggle a bit and they will work with you. Best restaurant was the Japanese Rest. and the Italian Rest. was also just as good. THE ONLY THING I CAN SAY THAT WAS NOT GOOD WAS THE DARN BED.....FRIENDS, IT IS HARD AS A ROCK! Take Alleve before bed each night and you'll be ok. I hope this was helpful, b/c I know this is the kind of review I was looking for when I was searching for hours and hours on this site.....

It cost us an extra \u00a3700.00 through our travel agent which was expensive, but I think that you could get it cheaper at the resort. The wildlife... If you don\u2019t like animals then I suggest that you go to another hotel. This hotel is full of wildlife from monkey's to peacocks to strange things I don\u2019t even know what they were haha!! But it was really nice. The food.. Was really good at the hotel, probably the best we have had at an all inclusive, the buffet was good and changed the food on different nights. The alacarte were great (apart from the Mexican) Italian, Japanese, Caribbean & steakhouse were all beautiful. Also the drinks were good (had to ask for the premium brands). The pool. Reading reviews we were a bit concerned that we would have to get up a 6am to get a bed, but it wasn\u2019t a problem, we were up about 9am and had no problem getting beds. The beach.. All I can say is that the beach must have been something before the hurricane, as it is beautiful at the moment. The sea was crystal clear and beach was great. The wedding.. We were supposed to get married at this hotel, but they had double booked, which I am now glad about. As we had an ocean view room we watched the weddings every day from our balcony as they were directly below us. I would have been disappointed if we had been married there as it was not private at all, you were directly next to all the sunbathers on the beach and as I said right next to our accommodation block. After the weddings were finished which was normally about 4.30-5pm the party would normally go to the lobby bar and hang about waiting on the restaurant opening at 6.30, then after the meal they came back to the lobby bar and just sat about (no party no music) which to me was not a very good reception. We got married through a company called Caribbean blue weddings which we found on the internet. All I can say is fabulous!!!!!! The ceremony was on a private beach, and we had our reception at the maramao beach restaurant in playa carmen which was the best ever, great food, beautiful location and dancing all night, well worth considering if you are thinking of getting married.

I can tell you it did not disappoint and it was everything and more than we had hoped for. The setting was amazing. We would walk through the jungle path each day to the pool/beach and there would always be something we would have to take a picture of. The first time we heard the monkeys we thought they must have been quite large but when you see them they're not. The pool was large and remained a nice temperature. I would say that even though there are signs to say no reserving of sun loungers lots of people did. We would get down there before 8am and already most of the best spots were reserved. We saw ones that were reserved with towels before we got there however the people did not turn up til the late afternoon. It was so annoying as so many beds sat empty for most of the day. The beach was not as bad as we feared. The sand bags were a bit ugly looking but these were great for use as slides into the water at the other side. Again you had to get down resonably early to get a bed but the beach didn't fill up as early as the pool spots. Umberellas were available from the towel hut if you are too late to get one of the permanent umberellas. There was plenty of choice for food. At the buffet restaurants there were things that were on each day but there was always something different as well. We didn't find it repetative and enjoyed all our meals there. The deserts were lovely and it would be so rude not to sample quite a few at the one time! Lunch was down at the restaurants at the pool and again the selection was good. We tried the Japanese restaurant which was excellent. They cook the food infront of you and the chefs are so entertaining. We liked it so much we went back again. The mexican restaurant we weren't too fond of. The mexican food served in the buffet was better. The italian again was a bit of a let down, The steakhouse however was good. The staff are very friendly and very hard working. We always made sure we had plenty of dollar bills to tip these guys and they really did appreciate it. The Starfreinds were amazing. I do not know how they keep going. There was never a dull moment around the pool and they would stop and chat to you. Plenty of entertainment going on throughout the day with most of it centered around the shallow end of the pool and the beach. I must admit that I didn't take part in a lot of games but I did volunteer my husband for quite a few!!! The \"crazy games\" at midday were fun to watch. You are subjected everyday to a form of mental torture when they do the club dance. The song is still playing in my head. If you have been you will know what I'm talking about. The kids club was fantastic. Our boys attended from 10.15am to 4.30pm everyday. They even take them for lunch so you pretty much have the time to yourself. We would only see them to top the sunscreen up if they were doing outdoor activities. There was also a mini disco everynight at 8pm followed by the evening entertainment. The rooms were nice and were cleaned everyday. We never had any problem with our mini bar not being restocked and the towel animals were fun. Again we tipped the maids as they too work very hard long hours. The rooms are well airconditioned and it was so nice to return there at the end of the day. We went into Playa del Carmen a few times which was $5 in a taxi. Here you'll find 5th Avenue with lots of shops. We do like to shop but didn't find the shopping great. We also took the ferry over to Cozumel which was $24 return per adult and $14 for kids under 12. We went to the worlds smallest Hard Rock Cafe over there but other than that we weren't too impressed. If you do buy anything then haggle. Even if the shop is a posh one they will still do a deal on the price. We did 2 excursions. The pirate ship which is a must for anyone with small boys into pirates of the caribbean. They have 3 ships one of which is the Black Pearl and is captained by Captain Jack Sparrow himself. Not the real Johnny Depp unfortunately but a look alike. The entertainment onboard was excellent and my boys loved it. We also swam with dolphins which was awesome. If you do the dolphins experience I would recommend the full swim as you are in the water with them for about 45 mins. Its amazing what they do and you can buy a dvd of the swim for $50. You can also buy photos but these are $25 each. My husband did a scuba diving course at the school at the beach. He really enjoyed it. Seemed like too much hard work for me so I stayed by the pool. We did do a double parasail. This was $50 each. Don't believe some of the things mentioned on here. The europeans are not the rude arrogant ones. I think you will find those people have not had as far to travel. I didn't let them spoil my holiday and would politely but firmly stand in their way as they tried to jump queues. Thankfully they didn't spend long at the pool as they would be the ones to come down late having reserved a spot early in the morning. If you are reading this having booked up then I am sure you will have a lovely time. I think we will return at some point but there are other places for us to see aswell.", "Date": "July 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newport, South Wales, UK", "Title": "\u201cPerfect in Every Way\u201d", "Author": "CMW111", "ReviewID": "UR17867296", "Content": "We planned this holiday for a year and like others I kept an eye on the reviews and had been concerned about some negatives in them - please don't take any notice - the Iberostar Tucan is an amazing place the staff are all friendly and the most helpful people I have ever met - everyone is geared to help you have the best holiday possible. Everywhere from the rooms to the beach is kept clean and tidy and is constantly being maintained. We had a Junior Suite which overlooked the sea - it was amazing but you don\u2019t really have to upgrade as all the rooms were just as nice - I thought on photographs that the buildings looked a little tired - however in reality they are truly beautiful the colours are stunning - the jungle pathways and all the animals are spectacular - not to be missed - true birds do fly through the restaurants - we found this entertaining - however I can understand those who would think it a little off putting - you just have to take it for what it is. The ponds are full of fish and it was wonderful at breakfast to sit and watch them swimming around. Food is excellent - no problems finding something different to eat any time of the day (remember that you can eat chicken, pork, lamb, beef, vegetables pasta and rice and salad) I don\u2019t know what people expect but to me that is food \u2013 if I am eating from a buffet its up to me to pick and chose \u2013 the choice was definitely there) water, drinks and wine were served at the table by extremely attentive waiters and plates were cleared in a flash. Freshly made omelettes for breakfast at the buffet were fantastic too! The speciality restaurants are a must - again the staff treated us like royalty. Don\u2019t miss Afternoon tea by the pool - the cakes were freshly baked and a different selection was served every day \u2013 just like an old fashioned Grandma would make, light and fluffy and truly delicious. The pool was never crowded - we managed to get a cabana on 2 days but only because my husband could not sleep and was up and about at 6.00 and found one free - one guy he spoke to got up at 4.30a.m. to sit in one but some people just put towels on them and don't show until after 11.00!!!! The pool bar could get a little raucous but it is separate from the main pool. The Beach is beautiful and the problems they had after the hurricane are now minimal no big drop from the hotel to the beach now \u2013 the sandbagsin the sea are great fun to climb on and jump off (or be washed off!). The evening entertainment was amazing - don\u2019t miss the Mayan dancers the costumes etc were superb and the Star Friends do entertain what seems like 24/7 \u2013 you can join in or watch \u2013 the only criteria is that you have the sort of holiday you want! We had treatments in the Spa which were excellent \u2013 a plus is that you can use the steam room and the hot cool pools at the Spa at any time for no extra charge \u2013 it has a wonderful quiet and calm atmosphere and was really relaxing at the end of the busy day lying on the beach sunbathing \u2013 it was also nearly always empty. We travelled with Thomas Cook and although we had a few blips with the booking before we left the service all told was really good \u2013 not excellent but good \u2013 premier was definitely worth the extra money \u2013 our flight was cancelled for 24 hours on our return leg \u2013 please remember people that this is never the reps fault \u2013 we were taken to stay at the Moon Palace Resort in Cancun \u2013 and the whole organisation there was excellent \u2013 they even gave us phone cards to call home \u2013 we were again all inclusive and although I would not have wanted to spend my whole holiday at the Moon Palace as for me it was a little too big and impersonal and the food was not up to the standard of the Iberostar (although the Jacuzzi bath in the room was to die for) it was fine for one night whilst we waited for our plane.", "Date": "July 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Lori19", "ReviewID": "UR17781433", "Content": "We stayed at the Tucan from 3 June to 17 June 2008. This hotel is fantastic. The grounds are beautiful. The hotel is very clean and well kept. The walkways through the jungle are novel, passing many creatures, the highlight being the monkeys. I was impressed with the beach as I have been watching its\u2019 progress since the beach erosion happened. I must say that having walked up past most of the hotels in Playacar, the Iberostar is the only hotel that has seemed to make any effort with the replacement of the beach. There are sandbags in front of the hotel in the sea, but they aren\u2019t really too bad and people were having great fun on them, although they seemed to stop this towards the end of our holiday. The only other hotel that has a good beach is the Sandos next door. If you go beyond that then the beach is brilliant. It is deserted, we took a parasol from the hotel and spent an afternoon there and we hardly saw a soul. The sea all along this coast is the most amazing turquoise, and out to sea the deepest dark blue. The swimming pool is very large and there is entertainment at the beach end everyday, but as the pool is so big you can avoid it. The rooms are nice and cool and clean. The maids (men?) kept the rooms clean and changed the towels every day and left towel art and petals on the bed. The only downside is that the mattresses are hard and the rooms are dark, but I suppose if you have a jungle outside it can\u2019t be helped, and it probably helps to keep it cool. The food in the hotel was very good. There is a very large choice and I think you must be very fussy if you can\u2019t find anything you like. The bread and rolls are made fresh and are delicious. The specialty restaurants made a nice change. They were generous with the food and drinks. I became partial to Kir Royal, a champagne cocktail. Just so you are aware, there is no service at the pool, beach bar or beach. The burgers at the beach bar are delicious. The staff is very friendly and attentive.

I can absolutely say I could not have picked a better resort! The ages of our group ranged from 4 years old to 87 years old and everyone had a fabulous time and there was something for everyone! ROOMS: We booked an ocean view suite, and that's excactly what we got! It was right on the beach (building 10) and the ocean was about 30 feet away from us! The room was very well kept and decorated nicely. I have read numerous reviews about the beds being hard, but they didn't bother us. We were all comfortable in them. We left a few dollars tip each day for the cleaning staff and our min-refrigerator was stocked everyday! Most our guests were in buildings 12 and 13 and they were close to us and in a fantastic spot! Close to the pool and beach buffet! Anywhere you go on the resort is amazing! There is wild-life EVERYWHERE and the grounds are absolutely gorgeous! It was like being in a jungle! STAFF: The ladies at the front desk are extremely friendly and helpful! We had some check-in problems with a few guests that were handled quickly and efficiently. The bartenders and servers were wonderful as well! ENTERTAINMENT: There was always something to do! I've been to resorts where you get bored, but not here! They had different shows every night (for all ages) that all of our group really enjoyed! The younger adults spent most nights at the disco...so much fun! The Lobby Bar was a hang out of ours too! FOOD: Hmmm...well, I am not the greatest fan of food in Mexico and this was no exception. However, the beach buffet and main buffet have a HUGE selection of food! Most of my group was extremely happy with the choices, especially breakfast! The specialty restaurants were wonderful! During our stay we ate at La Hacienda (Mexican), El Bonsai (Japanese), and La Marimba (Steakhouse) and they were all GREAT! La Hacienda was so much fun with the Margaritas and Mariachis! El Bonsai was my personal favorite...the food was so good and the entertainment of it all was fantastic! The steakhouse was best located and most everyone's favorite. POOL: AWESOME! I had seen pictures of it, but it is even bigger and more beautiful in person. It was great for the kids on the trip and all the adults had so much fun there too! I had read reviews where people said they could never get chairs but we never had this problem! BEACH: Again, the reviews had me scared to death! Honestly, it's not that bad. I have not been there before so I have nothing to compare it too, but we enjoyed it! Our group had lots and lots of fun playing on the sand bags! Again, we never had problems finding somewhere to sit! The ocean was still beautiful and so blue! WEDDING =): Like I said before, I could not have chosen a better resort for my wedding! Mayra and her staff were perfect! You are in good hands and they take care of every detail! The wedding ceremony set up was beautiful and the flowers are GORGEOUS! The reception was decorated nicely and our cake was fantastic! I HIGHLY recommend having your wedding here! If you are thinking about or are having your wedding here, please e-mail me and I will give you details and pictures!

We were two families (8 persons total) with kids in their teens/early 20\u2019s. Everyone had an excellent time and thought it was one of the best trips they had ever been on. Here are some observations\u2026\u2026. Overall: Fantastic and unique vacation. The grounds are absolutely beautiful\u2026true paradise. The animals really make this resort different from other places we have been to. We all especially enjoyed watching the monkeys jumping from tree to tree, the peacocks walking around, the funny looking squirrel like creatures, and all the tropical birds. Room: Very comfortable and we slept well each night. Between the overhead fan and the A.C. it was cool enough. If you find the beds too hard, ask the front desk for a foam egg crate to go over the mattress. In-room safes are provided. Room size is standard, but nicely done with marble floors, stucco walls, and stone/tile bathrooms. Hair driers, ironing boards provided. Electric voltage same as in the US. They provide a small refrigerator stocked with beer/water/soda for use at no extra charge. Drinks: Bars everywhere. Strongest drinks at the pool bar. Weakest at the beach. Every other bar was in between. Each lobby has its own bar that was very nice and relaxing. When ordering your drinks, if you want the better liquor you need to ask for it!! Walls: They don\u2019t have them. The entire resort is open air with no walls, except for your room, the bathrooms, and the specialty restaurants. What that means is you must dress for hot & humid weather, and look out for the birds! Dining: The two buffet restaurants served excellent food with a lot of variety. Much better than cruise ship buffets. We did see the birds occasionally help themselves to food at the buffet, so eat from the center buffet tables and avoid the buffet tables closest to the sides. The specialty restaurants were just OK. They were very hot despite having air conditioning. We ate at the Italian, Mexican, and Steak House. Service was very slow at the steak house and the chicken undercooked. At the beach/pool they have two additional restaurants and a grill. Food was good and convienant. However, the burgers didn\u2019t taste anything like beef and the hot dog were under done (tasted like eating a big fat bologna stick). Don\u2019t miss the coffee/tea/cake hour outside the pool restaurant at 4 pm, and the excellent ice cream at the buffets and at the beach bar!! Beach: There is plenty of sand and chairs to sit. The sand bags that were placed to help re-built the beach now have graffiti on them and take away from the natural beauty of the shoreline. Water was that great tropical color, but a little cool, cloudy with some seaweed. Pool: Really big, warm, clean and not at all crowded. This is where we spent much of our day. The poolside cabanas were great, but you need to get down to the pool by 8 am to get one. If you get down by at least 10 am you can still get pool chairs. The pool bar is separate from the main pool and is located closest to the jungle. Star Friends: Special hotel staff that make the day and night fun! They run games during the day around the pool and beach, and run the shows at night. We really enjoyed having them around. Money/tips: We used US dollars everywhere, including in town. The only time we had to change to pesos was when buying a calling card from the machine in the lobby gift shop. You can exchange your money at the front desk. We brought $150 in singles and used them for tips. We left $2 each day on our pillow for the maid, occasionally gave $1-2 dollars at the bar, and left $5-10 at the specialty restaurants. However, tipping does not seem expected, but was very appreciated. Tucan/ Quetzal: There are two lobbies, but it\u2019s really all one hotel. Every though we booked the Tucan, our room was on the Quetzal side. During the stay it didn\u2019t matter since everything is shared. Staff: Very friendly, competent, and a pleasure to be around. Only problem was that the front desk programmed our room keys incorrectly and they stop working on the second day. Medical/Illness: They have a medical office open in the Quetzal lobby 24 hours each day. The cost is $99.00 USD and a little more at night. Fortunately, none of us had to use it, but 5 of 8 of us did get severe diarrhea and stomach cramps by the 5-6th day. One had a fever of 102.8 F with vomiting and diarrhea. This seems to be expected with any trip to Mexico unfortunately! Getting around/trips: Easy! Just take the $5.00 cab ride from the hotel into Playa del Carmen. Worth the trip. Good shopping. Remember to not accept the first or even the second price you are offered. Silver is big in Mexico and they have a lot of nice bracelets. For site seeing, you don\u2019t have to go on the all day trips they seem to offer. Talk with the Iberostar and the Olympus people in the lobby and tell them exactly what you want to do. For example, we only wanted to do a morning in Tulum and then return to the hotel. We asked and set it up for $40/person, including transportation, admission, and guide. (you could do it for less if you take the city transportation, the collectivo, but that is not as convenient) Calling: If you think you will need to call back home the easiest is to set it up with your cell phone company before you leave, or you can buy a phone card at the hotel. Credit cards: Visa/mastercard accepted, but you should call your credit card company before you leave to give them a heads up that charges may be coming from Mexico. Otherwise they may freeze the account thinking it\u2019s a fraudulent charge. Weather: It was great. Despite the fact that June to November is considered the \"Rainy Season\" we only had rain for one hour the entire week. (last week of June). Hot and sunny each day!! Hope this information helps!

I've been to Mexico before (stayed at a time share and thought nothing could come close to the hospitatilaty, beauty relaxation) but the Iberostar Tucan did! From the minute we entered the beautiful lobby and were welcomed with drinks and native decor I knew we hit the jackpot choosing to stay here! For the weeks prior to arriving I had been reading all the reviews left from other guests and overall got a good feeling about the resort, but still had suspicion that it can't be as good as it sounds, but it was everything and more! The rooms were clean and spacious, yes the mattress is sitting on a cement slab, but to me it made no difference, the sheets were soft and smooth and felt like silk on my sun soaked skin. While I was a little intimidated about being near the jungle, it was an adventure everytime we walked along it - peacocks, iguanas, chickens or roosters, i don't know what they were, these animals that resembled a tailless rat / dog and yes of course the monkeys! I was concerned with walking through the jungle on account of the unevenness of the walkway, all I kept thinking was, please be careful, twisting an ankle WILL ruin the vacation, but I soon came to realize that there was more than one way to the pool/beach which offered a much more suitable walkway. The food was very good. We enjoyed the buffets and frankly, didn't care all that much for the reservation only restaurants. We went to the Italian restaurant, the steakhouse and the Japanese. We can't understand the men dresscode of long pants because it it so hot inside that you can't enjoy the meal, especially the Italian. I will rate the Japanese as the best of the 3 we went to. The next time we go here I don't think booking will even be an issue, we will be content with the buffets. I indulged myself with a visit to the spa. I had an awesome body massage on the beach followed by a deep cleansing facial in the spa. It was an excellent experience and I highly recommend it if you enjoy that sort of thing. The STAR friends were very entertaining during the day at poolside and the beach. The shows they put on at night are fun too! My sister was the belly dancing champion on night and she and my other friend tied in a dance contest one night, their performance was a \"10\"! There are some things that did go wrong, minor but nonetheless bear mentioning. Check in is 3:00pm. We did not get into our room until 4, after a long day of traveling, this is an issue and not a good way to get started with impressing customers. Mosquitos and their friends - what can I say except \"mosquito repellant \"and \"bug spray \"for your room. they get in while the maid is there cleaning your room(she leaves the door wide open) The restaurants are air conditioned, however, its nothing like and air conditioned restaurant in the US. Pack clothes that are light weight as the humidity is extremely high, when the natives are beading up, you know its HOT!

All in all it was a great and wonderful place..The staff are awesome and not the kiss a$$ wonderful, but truly genuine. They enjoy meeting crazy,fun people and get right in there with you and your family/friends. Ok now to business: We arrived at the Cancun Airport from JFK in New York...Olympic which is part of our GoGo Travel were waiting for us at the curb, they greeted us whisked us as quickly as taking 27 plus people could be rounded up could be possible to Iberostar Tucan for 7 nights/8days where we were greeted by a welcome sign for all of us. We were celebrating my parents 50th anniversary and it was an assorted group of family and friends which ranged in ages from 18-76 years old. The hotel quickly checked us in and had welcome cocktails waiting which all indulged in. Went up to our rooms,dropped the suitcases and headed to the grounds and beach. The grounds are so beautifully maintained, the animals and birds that roam around are amazing, especially Senor peacock who stood as a greeter every morning we went to breakfast. The room we had ,#1350,3rd floor, faced the jungle..it had a king sized bed,couch and rockin shower in the bathroom, can fit two people comfortably.. ;^) It was meticulously clean and our housekeeper Alejandro keep it beautifully and stocked and catered to our every request, we tipped him $2.00 american money every morning. I would recommend a room more next to 1347 (which has 2 dbl beds) for a better view of the pool and beach..but it still was nice and private on our balcony and we totally enjoyed it each and every day.. The pool was also very clean and the staff were always constantly cleaning the areas surrounding us. Only complaint is that one morning around 10am the staff where cleaning the pool and at another guests expense inadvertantly wound the pool hose around them while they were swimming..they were not happy but have to say ..made for a good laugh for us.. The beach is also clean and soooo beautiful...never had any problems finding spots under pulpas at the beach or pool. The towel card thing is such a pain..my man forgot to take a towel so we had to search and seize another one so we didnt have to pay for a towel we didnt even bring home..there were signs posted about reserving chairs at the pool and at the beach..we didnt play this game and had a woman in her 50's from Germany argue with my 23 year old daughter that \"those are my chairs and towels\"..we told her no reserving since we were sitting there for 2 hours or so at this point and told her her towels were on the last two lounges... She said they went to breakfast and proceeded to have a tug of war with my daughter much to our amusement..then she finally gave up ! The pool/beach buffet was fine..it is nice that it is covered and when it rained they had rain shades pulled down..the food was good most all of the time..the outside grill(?) had some kind of burgers..beef?? And hotdogs that were not cooked like a hotdog should and my man grilled it over again on his own..it worked.. They beach/pool bar had Raul who befriended all of us immediately and we tipped him well for filling our \"Bubba Kegs\" so that we had less trips back and forth..they were powerful enough but it is true that the lobby bar makes the best kickin' drinks in the place!! They have parasailing and jet ski rentals on the beach, just make sure to bargain with them..for 2 people they wanted $100 american dollars..we talked them down to $80..Also people selling jewelery..got nice sterling bracelets 2 for $20..There was NO BANANA BOAT rental...dont know why but was a bit disappointed. The main buffett on Tucan side was good...same stuff every nite for the unadventerous..and different stuff mixed in for people not afraid to try new things..Breakfast was good..you could get stuff made and put under hot lights or fresh to order..didnt make lunch in main buffet so no comments for that. Restaurants..Japanese was fun and delicious..as I said before we came for a 50th Anniversary celebration and we are on vacation so I would assume that it and we would be having FUN!!! You know what that means ..dont we people?? I dont think the people who were forced to sit with us since they split our group up thought so!! They were so quiet and all had poker faces throught the whole fun presentation by our cook except for one guy with the bald head who kept laughing over at us(Kuddo's to you man!) The cook basically kept the entertainment towards us because we so much enjoyed it... I'm kinda thinking it was the people that Girl_2004 from Amsterdam were with..lol.! The Steakhouse was next..We never got to celebrate my other daughters 21st birthday so we ordered a cake for her and had fun here too..Steaks were awesome..side salad,etc bar was so/ so.could use some more diversive food here. The cake was awsome and pricey..$35.00 but worth it..they sang,blew whistles,gave her a shot,wrapped a serape around her and gave her a hat..FUN!! Remember that word..it's what you are SUPPOSE to do on your vacation/holiday... We wanted to have the Tropical resturant as our last pick but they werent open(?) So we went with the Mexican because we werent too sure about Italian food in Mexico..should have tried it..heard it was good from others in the group.,.if your not into mexican food like my Mom is not, dont go here!..It was tasty and good but like I said..you should really like it if you do go! Ahhhh..the swimup bar..great times...one time a little too much..It could be better..it's not as clean as all of the rest of the place..it is offsides to the main pool which is good to keep kids away..but there was monkey feces on the last bar table and the bartender had no idea till we asked him if it was a happy hour special over there?? Kinda gross..drinks were fine though. The \"Star Friends\" are great talented people...fun in the show's and at Mascara (the disco) later on when we hung out with them..Mascara's played stuff from my timeframe..lol..70's 80's 90's...to current hip hop etc...so we went with the 20 year olds (we are 48 and 49 by the way) etc...had a blast!! Especially taking numerous photos with the unknown drunk customer..LMAO..he never knew or moved...we even had the waiters and people from the other side of the bar join in...lol..we are thinking of sending his photo to Iberostar to pin up as customer of the month..hahahahaha.. We booked an ATV tour online and got a great discount,plus they picked us up and dropped off at the hotel..fun time was a 2hour gig but should have been a little longer...drove mad fast through jungle paths to a dry cave and a cenote...great time. definately take cabs to town in Playa del Carmen..$5.00 worth every cent..there's a great store that is like a dollar store with sooooo much for souvenirs...so search and ignore the hawkers..they ALL have something special for you senor/senora...lol. Went to Senor Frogs..nothing like seeing my Mom and Dad (both 72 yrs old) doing shots,having there head,breasts,butts etc jiggled and joggled..lol..also went to Carlos and Charlies..and a cool beach bar called Capt Daves...was supposed to be a band..but they weren't there but good music anyways..had fun dancin and such.. We met a bunch of great people from Europe..and had a great time with them..they were having FUN!!!..lol All in all I would go back tomorrow if i could..we will go back hopefully within a year...I would recommend it 4-5 stars for all types of people to go here..any questions i can help with fire away..and have a WONDERFUL vacation/holiday!!", "Date": "June 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBest holiday ever A*******\u201d", "Author": "Miss-Adviser", "ReviewID": "UR16896314", "Content": "My first trip to Mexico and I will definitely be going back at some stage - it was fantastic! The hotel was 5* all the way!!.......rooms were clean & spacious and my hair straighteners worked!! the layout of the hotel was beautiful, the quetzel side had much better scenery but the whole hotel is joint so it didn't really matter as you could go where you liked. wildlife is in abundance and the animals are all very well looked after, we were starting to think that the monkey's were a myth until the last day when we were walking back to our room and heard what sounded like a group of gorilla's - very loud! and we eventually located about 5 of them at the top of some trees - managed to get some great shots of them which I will attach to this review shortly! The main pool was a nice size and well maintained, there was also a kids pool (which was generally empty and was lovely to sit in as the sun was setting as it was very warm from the sun!) also a swim up bar area for adults only, many a cocktail was enjoyed there! also there was a water basketball pool which I never saw anyone use. The food in the main restaurant was fairly basic but there was something for everyone - there are now 4 additional restaurants as the seafood one has closed, these consist of Mexican, Japanese, Steak House and Italian.....we only went for a week so were allowed to go to the additional restaurants 3 times however we managed to go to them all. Just a tip if you make your reservations on your first day to avoid dissapointment as they do fill up quick having said that if you have used all your reservations up don't be afraid to approach them to see if they have spare seats on the night as if they do they will generally accommodate you! All the restaurants were good quality food, however the Japenese is a must, they cook all of the food in front of you and put on a very good show! the food was also excellent and I'm not a fish fan! Staff were all extremely friendly and were happy to assist us with anything, the cleaners were great - we left a fairly large tip halfway through and at the end of our holiday but whether we tipped or not the room was still spotless and the towel models were always superb :-) although I did notice that for the last half of our stay our mini bar was re-stocked every day rather than every other day as stated - just another little tip. Beach - Iberostar is one of the only hotels in the Playacar area that still has a good sized beach due to the latest Hurricane towards the end of last year which destroyed most of the beach areas. They have also set up sand banks to build the beach back up to what it was over time - someone commented that they were an eyesore but I didn't think so at all and the kids all looked like they were having a great time waiting for the waves to hoist them on top! Tours - we went to Xel Ha, Coco Bongo, Deep Sea Fishing and were lucky enough to snorkel with Whale Sharks. We booked all of our tours with our rep and they were very overpriced and I would suggest maybe booking with a local company as it will be much cheaper. Xel Ha was ok but was very American Summer Camp!! plus the effect of the Carribean Sea meeting fresh water is not something that can be viewed unless you are diving (despite what your rep tells you) and there is no diving there! Coco Bongo was the worst night ever, we arrived at Midnight after being picked up at 9.30 due to traffic, we were informed that we could queue jump however this was not the case and we didn't get in until 1.00am, the free alcohol was all so watered down that I would rather have paid for my drinks, the place was so jam packed that if you were lucky to get in you couldn't move, despite being an adults nightclub the average age was around 13! the shows were alright if you could see them! and we ended up leaving at 2.30am and waiting outside for an hour for the cab home! Deep sea fishing was good, there was a big thunderstorm that day but managed to catch some very big fish. By far the best on our last day we snorkelled with Whale Sharks which are currently migrating through the Gulf of Mexico until the end of July so if you are going during this time, do not miss this opportunity! incredible! On a good day you get to do around 4/5 'snorkels' with them as it's only ever 2 at a time (which is a very good idea for the Whale Shark's protection) luckily we went on a good day and got some great pictures....

Diving was OK, not great, but not the fault of the hotel, thats just diving in Playa. Really enjoyed the italian restaurant. Japanese was entertaining, but did not like steakhouse at all. What we loved so much about this resort were the grounds. They were immaculate, and we truly got a kick out of all the little creatures, especially the cerequies (sp?) and the monkeys. The staff was wonderful. In fact, my son lost $100 somewhere in the room, and the housekeeper found it and came running down the hall after me to tell me he found $. What honesty! I did reward him of course. We went on Discovery Jungle zip line and it was a blast-highlight of the trip. also went to Xel Ha and had a great day there.

We loved it just as much this time as the frist. YES, the beds are hard as you are sleeping on a mattress on top of a concrete slab, but you are on vacation and should not be spending a whole lot of time in there anyway. The grounds were beautiful and the staff there were WONDERFUL. The beach shows SOME erosion but they were working on reclaiming it everyday. I have a video showing the workers as they are pumping sand back on the beach. We were right by the people working and didn't hear any machines or pumps running, which was good. The food at the buffets got old, but there is enough variety that there was always something that was a little diff. The beach buffet was the same everyday, but all you have to do is go into one of the buffets after 1:00 and you can have your variety there. We didn't realize that until the last day of our stay, Our bad. We did have visitors show up on our balcony one morning, monkeys, and that was cool as we had a room facing the jungle. We went into town one of our days and enjoyed it very much. My wife and I went to Victoria's Massage and they were very professional as we both felt like jelly when we left. We ate at this little taco place, forgot the name, but didn't forget the experience. The food was very good, and cheap. The cab ride only cost $5.00 to get to Playa, and the same to get back. The \"SHARKS\" are just as bad in town as they are at the airport, so if you had the will to ignore them there, you won't have any problems in town. Oh, guess I should explain about the \"SHARKS\". By that, as most of you know I am refering to \"TIMESHARE\" sellers. We did have this one gentlemen come up to us on the Tucan beach asking if we wanted to go tour the Sandal's, which is next door. We kept telling him that we wern't interested and he kept asking. I finally told him that we would and we never showed up at that part of the beach again. The next issue, the TOWEL GAME, We didn't have any problems getting one of those big umbrella things, sorry forgot the name. We didn't get to the beach until about 10:00 a.m. and there were plenty of them empty. There were also plenty of chairs that didn't have any sun cover around them so there wasn't any issues with not finding a chair to soak up the sun. Now, the Last issue, the bar drinks are watered down. NOT SO. They may be out at the beach bar, but the lobby bar didn't hold anything back when they poured you a drink. I tried to drink them out of Don Julio, but it didn't work. All the other drinks that we had tasted stronger than we get in the states. Anyway, we will be making arrangments to visit there again next year and can't wait to see the progress they complete by then.

This makes our 5th stay @ IB and we'll continue to return. BEACH - Initially we were concerned due to the beach erosion discussions, but I must say this made no difference to our stay or the love of this resort. Our favorite thing to do is walk along the beach and we did this and saw how the whole area has been hit w/the erosion problem. All others along the strip definitely have lost most of their beach. But Iberostar has done the MOST work to restore its beach as much as it can. There were work crews who focused on this all day. We had no problems getting a chair close to the water and were so happy w/our decision to stay. SERVICE - This absolutely remains superb; staff is always so accomodating, friendly and ready to appease you. This is the 1st year we extended our travel group to include my Mom and cousin. My cousin had just returned from a RIU property in Puerto Vallarta and she commented how the service at IB was above and beyond what'd she's ever experienced. She continued to comment that at IB she felt always taken care of and that the staff was so on top of their game to ensure you stay was good. It is recognized how Excellent Customer Service is instilled in every staff member - from the front desk, to the wait staff, to the lawn care teams - all ensure they say hello and/or ask if you need anything. FOOD - can't say enough about the quality of food. For those who've ever complained about food, I'm not sure what the issue is - selection is always fresh, varied and clean. It was amazing to us that with so many people to feed, you'd think that as the breakfast, lunch or dinner hour was closing, most places just let that supply of food run out and not refresh. Not here - despite only minutes before closing, the chefs were putting out huge supplies of fresh food to ensure any last minute guests had nothing but a fresh selection of food. STAR FRIENDS - we were pleasantly suprised to see repeat Star Friends from our 2007 trip. My 4 year old son had a huge crush on one of the dancers and she remembered him right away which made his day of course . This is a great team of talented young people who add so much to the property. If you want to participate in activities, great. If not, that's ok too and you're never pressured to do what you don't want.

And I based our choice off of the reviews I read here on TA. We stayed May 21-28, 2008. Before we left I emailed and requested a room close to the pool. We arrived around noon- 12:30 and our room was ready for us. The friendly bellman zipped us right to it in the golf cart. We were in Bldg. 12 on the second floor. And the rooms looked exactly like other pictures I had seen posted. Very clean, great AC, and ceiling fan (in fact, some nights I turned the fan off). We did not get the view I requested but it wasn't that big of a deal. They give you a big gallon of water right next to the minibar that we used for brushing teeth. They also provide shampoo and body wash dispensers in the shower, but you need to bring your own conditioner. The pool/beach. I was very nervous about finding chairs after reading some reviews. We were out to the pool by 1-1:30 our first day and immediately found great spots. There was plenty of room for everyone. And we're not early risers, so on average we didn't get to the pool til b/w 10-12 everyday and never really had problems. On the beach we never had any problems at all finding spots. And I thought it was plenty big enough. There were huge sandbags to prevent more erosion. Towards the last couple days of our stay I started to notice people trying to reserve chairs at the pool, I guess the new group of people coming in. To me, the pool/beach were my favorite part of the hotel. The pool was beautifully landscaped and huge w/ lots of nooks to hang out in. And the beach had such soft white sand w/ a great breeze! I loved them both! My boyfriend was nervous about lots of kids running around, because we're in our late 20's early 30's and do not have kids yet. But you don't really notice them, they had activities of their own. The food/drinks. I'm not going to lie, the food is not that great but you can always find something to eat. Literally every day for lunch I had guac., chips, french fries/potato wedges & nacho cheese, sometimes pasta. We never made it to breakfast which I hear is better. The Japanese steakhouse was average (they do put on a great show), the Steakhouse was actually pretty good (we had Filet) and I'm from KC. Italian not so good. At the buffets, just get little samples of what you think you might like and go from there, you're bound to find something. Anyways, who wants to gain a bunch of weight when you're in a swimsuit all day? The drinks were good, I recommend the Miami Vice at the beach bar w/ extra Bacardi. And you have to ask for premium and extra alcohol or else they won't give it to you. Just like a normal bar. I had wine quite a bit at dinner which was fine too. All the servers & bus boys/girls work very hard and are so friendly. The Entertainment, talk about the hardest working people at the hotel! The Star Friends are so wonderful. I was very surprised at how good and fun the shows are :) They work like 14 hour days and are always so happy and energetic. Hello, to my favorite Adrian! He's the cutest happiest person. I wish I was doing Aqua Fitness right now. The jungle....it just made the experience more like a vacation with the way the two resorts are positioned around the vegetation. It really was so amazing to be walking to dinner and seeing monkeys or peacocks. We had the same Iguana outside of our room everyday that we looked forward to seeing. The nightclub, Mascara, is not a booming club but for free drinks, some good people watching, and some dancing it was a fun time. And I recommend going into downtown at least one day/night. There are so many great places to eat and have cocktails! We absolutely fell in love with the whole area. I went to the Spa for an afternoon of Mud massage and Reflexology. Super relaxing, it was such a nice experience. All of the Resort employees were friendly and hard working so they definitely deserve tips when you can. There is no ATM at the hotel, which we did not know. And if you don't like to travel w/ lots of cash, that was the only real inconvenience. Although, they do make change at the front desk if you have larger bills. There's about a 5-10 minute walk to the ATM nearby and they charge you a $7-14 convenience fee. One other small thing. I brought w/ me my own microfiber hair towel and on the first day the maid mistakenly took it w/ the other towels and I never got it back. Everyday I had to go to the front desk and we were always talking to different people who had no idea what we were talking about. So finally, our last night they said they would give us credit for the cost. But they wouldn't credit the spa treatment I had yet to pay for. It was only for the shops in the Lobby. I would have just preferred the $ or it going to something I had actually wanted to buy. Not a huge deal but just a little disappointed way to end the trip. Overall, we had a great vacation and did not want it to end! We wished we were European w/ longer vacation time.

First and foremost, we had a GREAT time!!! ARRIVAL Our family traveled with 6 adults and 3 children under the age of 4. Once we got through the 2 hour wait customs line at the Cancun airport, we were greeted by Cancun Valet that we had previously set up transportation with through Cancunvalet.com. Because we had a large group and we did not want to be split up we were very pleased with this transportation service. Plus they provide up to 2 carseats for the kids. CHECK IN Once we arrived at the hotel, check in was a breeze. They were very polite and accomodating. 2 weeks prior to our trip we had emailed a request to stay in building 11on the third floor pool side and we got what we had requested. ROOMS Yes, the beds are hard but we all slept great! The rooms were clean and cool. The mini bar has beer, bottled water and sodas. There is a coffee maker in the room and I personally liked that coffee better than the coffee in buffet. The mini bar is restocked every other day. My husband had left a tip upon arrival and a note for extra beers however the maid took the tip and did not fill the fridge. It would be easier to call room service and request extra beer or beverages. The birds and monkeys are loud and will wake you up in the morning. Our 2 year old daughter loved this and woke up each morning excited to go look for monkeys. POOL We had read plenty of reviews that stated you had to get to the pool by 6 am to get a chair. We did not have this problem. You can get a group of chairs together if you get to the pool by 9 am. Our group would go to the pool and place towels on chairs on our way to the breakfast buffet. Because we had a 3,2 and 1 year old with us, we chose to get chairs by the kiddie pool each day. In the morning the kiddie pool is cool and relaxing but by the end of the day it feels like a warm bath. We found that the bar pool was by far the coolest and most refreshing pool, unfortunately kids are not allowed in this pool. The largest pool is just that, LARGE. If you are like me, SHORT ( I am 5ft) , the main pool is difficult to walk in. It is on the deeper side. The kids had fun with all the pool toys we had brought from home ie...water guns, sand toys, rafts, and bubbles. Our only real complaint about the pool, is that if you sit around the kiddie pool, dont count on any servers from the bar to come and take your order. We had to walk to one of the pool bars to get our drinks. BEACH The beach has come back dramatically from previous reviewers photos. There are still sand bags in the ocean but there is no longer a cliff from the hotel to the beach... just a minor slope. The sand bags definately calm the waves on red flag days. We have no complaints about the beach. There are plenty of chairs and room to play in the sand. The sand is soft and we did not notice any painful rocky areas. JUNGLE I would have to say this is the best feature of this hotel! The hotel grounds are set among a large jungle that has sooo many different kinds of wildlife. Since we had our kids with us, they were very excited to see all the different animals. We saw monkeys, peacocks, lizards, snakes, bats, possums, tucans in cages, parrots, and these large guinnie pig/rat lookin things (and they were all over the place). It was definately an adventure every day walking through the jungle! FOOD Well, what can I say about the food. Not the best and not the worst. The breakfast and dinner buffet are the same every day but there is a wide variety of food to choose from. For an all inclusive resort it's not bad. During lunch we ate at the pool side lunch buffet that was not too bad either. We ate at 3 of their specialty restraunts that we had reserved immediately after checking in to the hotel. We ate at the Japanese, Italian, and Steak restraunts. If you have small children, I do not recommend the Japanese place. The restraunt is small and is not air conditioned. The food is prepared Hibache style which is cooked in front of you. The whole meal from start to finish seemed to take at least an hour and a half which was too long for our little ones to sit through and too long for us because it was so darn hot in there!!! But the food was good. The Italian restraunt was not that good in my opinion. The Steak restraunt was our favorite. The restraunt itself is open and airy. The steak was cooked to our liking and was very tender and flavorful. There is a kids menu at all the specialty restraunts. ENTERTAINMENT Every night they have a different show that they put on near the buffet. I definately recommend going to watch. They first put a show on for the kids that starts at 8pm and the kids can be part of the show. Our daughter loved dancing to the music and watching the shows. After the kids show the entertainment continues for hours! Definately a plus! SHOPPING/THINGS TO DO I definately recommend taking a $5 cab ride into Playa to 5th Ave to go shopping. It's the traditional Mexican flee market atmosphere once you get past the nice shops. At night the atmosphere comes alive and the weather isn't as hot. You can also take the ferry to Cozumel for $25/person (small kids free). All in all, we had a great time and I would definately recommend the Tucan! Especially if you are bringing kids!

The buffets are wonderful - every food from salads to desserts are available all day! We ate at the Mexican restaurant which we did not care for, but also ate at the Japanese and Steakhouse restaurants and they were absolutely wonderful!! The beach has some erosion but it is still the most beautiful beach with gorgeous blue water and white sand throughout. We were in Maui a couple of years ago and the beach at Iberostar was better since it contained no rocks at all. The sandbags are an eyesore but everyone plays on them and has fun. The swimming pool is huge and great! There are nightly activities which are a lot of fun. We were in Building 15 which is very close to the building that the nightly activities are held in so the noise until around midnight was a negative. But if you don't go to bed until after midnight, then Building 15 should be no problem. I would say Building 15 is situated at around the center of the resort so you have a few minute walk to the beach/pool as well as the front desk and buffets. The grounds are luscious with birds, peacocks and other critters roaming around. We had the monkeys play in our balcony one evening -- that was a nice bit of entertainment! Playa is just a short cab ride away and fun to visit and shop but beware of all the merchants trying to get your attention - that became very annoying after a while. We visited the Mayan ruins at Chichen Itza and spent a day at Xcaret. It was extremely hot in Chichen Itza but I'm glad we made the trip because the ruins were great to see and the history was so interesting. I would suggest you have a tour guide at the ruins and I'm glad we did. Xcaret wasn't as great as I thought it would be. We \"swam\" with dolphins but in reality, it's just mainly petting and watching them do tricks for you. I don't think that the extra expense to \"swim\" with dolphins was worth it.

Reality far exceeded those expectations. My wife and I enjoy taking cruises and have been to the caribbean a dozen times. We have had great experiences in Aruba, Bermuda, and Barbados......but this was one of the best vacations we've experienced in a long time. Very relaxing, all the staff were great and friendly, the grounds were meticulously kept, the rooms were large and comfortable and the food far exceeded what I was led to expect from the reviews. I am a big time foodie....I am not picky, I like to try different food items and also enjoy a gourmet meal from time to time. The food overall I would rate as very good to excellent. Yes, there were some not so good items, but those were in the minority and you move on and try something else. The buffets had an extraordinarly large selection every evening and by no means should anyone say that they become repetitive, unless their food tastes are limited. We tried the Steak, Mexican and Japanese restaurants. The latter was just okay, but the others were outstanding. I thing we learned from these reports to ask for coconut ice cream with a shot of kahlua (??sp) at the beach bar. Very refreshing during the heat of the day. Great drinks can be had at the lobby bar....at the beach they were weak, but with the heat that is a good thing....water or soda was much more refreshing. Yes the beds were hard, but did not loose any sleep over it. The beach was in much better shape than we anticipated. They continue to pump sand into the low ares each day to rebuild and expand the beach. The pools were great and large. The water temperature at the main pool was quit warm but the pool with the swim up bar was very comfortable as it is in a shaded area. Outside day trips were taken to Xel-ha (full day) and separately to Tulum. Both were fantastic for first timers to the area. I recommend that you visit both independent of each other. A half day at Xel-ha is not enough....you would feel rushed. A taxi to Tulum is a bit less expensive than a tour and you can spend more time at the beach which is a MUST visit...quit outstanding.

The pool area was lovely, 2 bars right near the pool which served cocktails and ice creams and there was a little beach hut where you got your new towels every day! Only piece of advise is although you have access to both the Tucan and Quetzal hotels, i would definately stay on the Tucan side as it is newer and has marble floors unlike the Quetzal that had wooden floor and would not be good for disabled people to get around as were quite uneven!

It is not the pristine wide beach of a year ago. Narrower, two levels, and more crowded. And there is a bit of construction on the quetzal side to restore the area just infront of the ocean view units. Because of this, those rooms were empty during our stay. We paid for an ocean view jr suite on the Tucan side and just loved it. Close to everything, which matters with children. Also, the upside to the beach erosion is that the ocean is much closer and our balcony was a front row seat! It was lovely to sit out there in the evenings and have a Margarita, listening to the ocean and enjoying the breeze. I think everyone has done an adequate job of covering the food.

This hotel and grounds are magnificent, with the accommodation set out in three storey blocks spread throughout the fabulous gardens and jungle with the most amazing variety of animals and birds roaming freely around the grounds. Our room was a good size with A/C, mini-bar that was restocked every two days and a free safe. Instead of a bath/shower combo, we had a large walk in shower area which we found ideal. The room was kept spotless each day by the maid who also did a different towel display which my son loved, an elephant one day, followed by a dinosaur the next and so on. The main pool is large and the water was lovely and warm with one end graded slowly to the depth of the rest of the pool which was a good place for kids to play who felt they were too big for the childrens pool, but not confident enough for the main part of the pool. There is also an adults only pool with swim up bar and a separate activities pool for water volleyball etc. We never had a problem getting sunbeds, even late morning or early afternoon as previous reviewers had, whether the hotels rules about reserving sunbeds is starting to work or not, I couldn't say. We were quite happy having our breakfast and evening meals in the Buffet restaurant each night and found the food excellent and a large selection to choose from, so I couldn't say what the a la carte restaurants were like. We had our lunch at one of the two pool / beachside restaurants, and with drinks and ice-cream on tap at the beachside bar, we were all kept happy. There is a kids club, catering for various age groups, that my son enjoyed, with a variety of activities on offer. This was open from 10-15am till 4-30 pm seven days a week, and kids can pop in whenever they want and the staff even take them for lunch if you want a total break. There is a variety of entertainment for adults throughout the day, organized by the hotels star friends, water games, dance lessons, etc and they also do bicycle tours if you are feeling energetic. You dont feel pressured to join in, if you just want to relax, they respect that. The star friends also organize the evening entertainment with the kids disco and games starting at 8pm which my son had a great time at, followed by the evening shows. The beach, although damaged by erosion, was great. The large sand bags that have been placed in the water to help prevent further erosion seem to be working as the beach was not as bad as we had first feared after seeing photos of what the beach was like a couple of months before we went. The bags also provide a safe area for children to swim and we used them as a boundary when playing in the large waves, as it was easy to loose your bearings and go too far out from shore. The turquoise sea is beautiful and the sand bags didn't spoil our enjoyment. As with the pool area, we didn't have any problems getting sun beds on the beach at any time of day. All the hotel staff were very helpfull and took time out to talk to you and made you very welcome.

There were four of us holidaying at the Tucan, our friends were celebrating their pearl weddng anniversaries and we were celebrating our silver wedding anniversary. Needless to say our worries melted away when I saw the beach for the first time. Paradise to say the least. OK there was some beach erosion and trying to carry a few glasses down the steps was difficult but laughable. There's no need to worry though as there are waitresses on hand to take your order while you laze away on the beach watching the surf spill over the sandbags. Admittedly I was glad of the sandbags because I am normally scared of swimming in the sea because of my phobia of fish but I was comfortable swimming in the lagoon the sandbags had created and to my knowledge the area was fish free. On a laughable note though I was stood on a sandbag admiring the view out to sea (along with my husband and friends) when a rogue wave knocked me off my feet and sent me spiralling down the sandbag and into the lagoon. Although it provided entertainment for other people it does show how powerful the waves can be and so those with young children would need to take care. The buffet food was good although some of it was cold (shame because it tasted delicious) and there was lots of choice. Each morning I opted for a omelette which was freshly cooked. And I must admit I became addicted to the burgers. Each day at noon I was there ready to get my burger and wedges washed down with a Martini bianco and Sprite. If you like drinks stronger then ask for a 50/50. The pool. What can I say but I've never seen anything like it. It was huge and there were so many activities going on. I tried the free scuba diving lesson and was afraid at first but once I'd got the hang of breathing with the equipment I thoroughly enjoyed it. The instructor was with us every step of the way and we felt safe. We are the type of people who join in the activities because if you're going to do something different then where better than in the sun! We tried archery, crazy darts, rifle shooting, water polo and without boring you all the list goes on. The amazing thing is the STAR FRIENDS run the activities AND do the energetic shows in the evening. I wish I'd half their energy. They work so hard and are very professional in what they do. Without the likes of Adrian, Fernando, Andy, Lara, Roberto, Alexandrou, Christian, Gabrial, Beto, Jose, Sergio, Carlos, Angel, Miguel, Ricardo and other people (I apologise if I can't remember everyone's name) our holiday would not have been the same. And not forgetting those behind the scenes, the set decorator's and lighting and sound staff who also did a great job! We booked a trip to Xel-Ha through the First Choice rep which we thought was excellent value for money. We swam with the dolphins; what an experience! I personally would recommend that those visiting here (if you want to do all the activities) do a full day rather than half / half with Tulum as you will not have the time to enjoy the day. We did a separate half day to Tulum which we enjoyed but I don't think young kids would enjoy this trip as a lot of time is spent listening to a guide. Overall we had a fantastic time and want to go back again next year so if you're worried please don't be.

The weather was perfect everyday. We have two grown children, ages 24 & 27 so I needed to book a place where we could do as much or as little as we wanted. My son is not a beach person like my daughter so this area was attractive because he wanted to scuba dive off of Cozumel and do a snorkeling excursion. The Tucan is located in an area that is near shopping and other restaurants if you wanted a change from the resort. A short cab ride will get you to the shoppingt area at 5th Avenue or you can walk to some stores 10 minutes away. I had requested two non-smoking, third floor rooms that were adjoining. I got everything I requested. We were in Building 14. Building 10 is on the beach and faces the ocean.Bldgs. 11 and 12 are closest to the pool. I would not pick Buildings 17 & 18 that face the outside because there is construction going on at the resort next door and it will be noisy during the day. I'm not sure when construction ends. The view isn't that great on that side. Try to request an inside room. The room was always clean, showers were great, just as I had read. The staff are friendly and the grounds people are always working to keep the grounds meticulous. The food was great. The buffet can be repetitious but you can pick something different every day so it doesn't have to be boring. My daughter is eating quite healthy these days, and she found a selection of food to her liking. The Japenese Restaurant was the best. We also ate at the Italian also very good and the Steak House was good but not great. The Tropical Restaurant closed on day we got there for renovations. The beach did suffer from erosion last Nov. or Dec. It is sad to see the postcards of the resort and compare it to what the beach looks like now. There is still enough beach and they have large sandbags that look like beached whales to help with further erosion. They are also pumping more sand each day to try to make a better beach. The shows were fun and the Star Friends are very talented and friendly and are always asking everyone to join in on whatever is going on in the resort. We did do one excursion as a family. We went to Tulum and Xel-Ha. We enjoyed them both, but wished we had more time at Xel-Ha. My husband and I snorkeled for the first time and loved it. We met many people from all over the world. Some came for the first time and others returned. Some vacationers have been to other resorts but find the Tucan a place they really enjoy. The tropical gardens and jungle make for a lovely setting. If you want to see the monkeys you will need to book on the Quetzal side. We did walk over there to see them before we left. You definitely can get a lot of exercise at this resort. Two things I am glad I brought along. We brought our own rafts and tubes to float on. When were done with them, we passed them on to families that didn't have them. The dive shop will blow up the rafts for you.

However, this was a pretty good trip. The hotel grounds were simply beautiful and very well kept. The wildlife that we were in the midst every day was the coolest thing, expecially for kids. Our kids were thrilled (to say the least) of the spider monkeys that visited our balcony every afternoon and played. A few activities the kids liked were ping-pong, and the painting of the knickknacks to take home for friends (this saved time rather than shopping for them and the kids were able to add a personal touch as well - very cool). Staff was somewhat attentive, but like another reviewer stated, if you weren't 25 wearing a thong and had your boobs hanging out don't expect too much. Also, the music and late night noise went on until well past midnight -1am. The rooms are definitely not soundproof. I guess not so bad if you enjoy the late night partying constantly. Also alot of young teens drinking who were not even close to 18. The food was quite boring after the first day for us adults, but the kids were extremely happy with the offerings. The themed restaurants weren't too bad, but remember to book your reservations with them at the front desk immediately - otherwise you'll be eating pizza and pasta, yet again. The kids won't mind. The pool was awesome - not terribly crowded. We did face the tune of attempting to reserve enough pool lounges for our family before 5am poolside, but the beach was usually always sufficient for lounges. Pool was clean, water was comfortable, and infloatable rafts and rings were usually always available for the kids to play on. Had a minor issue a few times with getting our towels taken, but we just replenished by getting towels from the massage area. Guard the towels - the hotel will charge you! And exchanging them daily was a cinch. Towel exchange area also had board games and cards available for the kids to play, but remember to return them - again, you get charged 4X the cost! The beach was beautiful, but as stated, eroded from the storm in December. Still impressed with it as some of the beaches in Puerto Vallarta are just plain bad and rocky. The sand bags were a big hit with the kids, except for the ones right at the beach line. The staff does not clean off the algae that forms on them, and we saw many people slipping and falling while walking the beach. A few people had sprains and broken bones from it as well, so be careful to steer clear of those ones near the beach. The sandbags further out proved to be somewhat of an attraction with the kids - they could spend hours playing on those when the waves came in. The rooms were basic, but nice. A few times we had to ask for new sheets as they were mold stained, but no big deal otherwise. The refrigerator in our room was disgusting, and we asked for it to be cleaned. Remember to ask for soda and water replenishment daily if you need it - use your door tag. When the kids ordered room service, it was usually quick and plentiful for them, but the hotel only offered basics - salad, pizza, burger, sandwiches, and a couple desserts which were blah. But, the kids were happy. Never worried about getting a taxi, either. We did the 4-wheeling/zip-line tour one morning which was alot of fun - the guys that handled that tour were great. It was just a 10 minute drive to Playacar, and after signing our life away on their release forms, we were off. Rode quads to the jungle-area, zip-lined, climbed down a cave to swim and dive in the cenotes, and rode the quads back. That is a morning trip that is recommended - we returned back to the hotel about 2pm, left 8:30am. Lots of fun and activity. The Catamaran day excursion to Tulum and for snorkeling was a big disappointment. We left the hotel at 7:45am, spent more than an hour driving to the marina, boarded an overcrowded catamaran (which, for the most part, was a nice vessel but too many people). Also, the \"boat staff\" attempted to make us pay for transportation which was included in our \"tour\" - we saw many people giving up more money which was a scam. The boat ride was about 2 hours and that was nice. When stopped in Tulum to snorkel, you fended for yourself when jumping in the water to get your own gear on -NOT good for the kids. The swells were huge, and a small storm was approaching which made the water even more treacherous - if you were not a strong swimmer you would not have made it back on the boat, and if you were not one of the first 30 people in the water, you missed the \"snorkeling\" tour. Actually, there was nothing to see - we saw maybe 2 colorful fish, and not much that resembled a nice reef. As stated, if you were not a strong swimmer, it was difficult getting back to and on the boat. I had to assist my daughter (who is on the swim team) and two other kids back to the boat as the water and waves were brutal. The food offered on the boat was basic, but plentiful - sandwich, salad, pop, drinks. We were then transported from the catamaran to smaller boats that only held about 10 people at a time to the beach - with the waves as fierce as they were, a few people hurt themselves. On the beach in Tulum, it rained - not many places to go for shelter. We waited there for over an hour for everyone to get to shore - big drag. Even though we changed to dry clothes in a disgusting outhouse, the rain soaked us again. We then walked to our van, and drove about 30 seconds down the rode to get out again to walk to Tulum. In the rain. The tour itself of the ruins was interesting, but could have been longer and less rushed. The sun came back out, and the pictures were great. After about 30 minutes, we walked back to our vans and endured another hour+ ride back to the hotel - for the $600 we spent it was definitely a trip I would NEVER recommend, much less if you have kids who want to snorkle. I would recommend taking the ferry to Cozumel, taking a taxi to Palancar Reef, renting equipment and going on our schedule - Palancar is a beautiful reef, lots of sea life, and calm waters for exploring and fun for the whole family. Xel-Ha was a nice excursion as well, but again, costly. The few restaurants in Playacar were terribly overpriced and the food was awful. Compared to Puerto Vallarta, Playacar offered little local variety. When visiting PV, the food is phenomenal and always locally great, low in price but high in flavor and taste. Remember to drink the bottled water, and ask for it at the restaurants. Overall, a nice place. Very nice for the kids of all ages.

We are with a large group of 8 adults and 6 young children. Grounds: The grounds are amazing. There are so many live animials walking around. You can see the monkeys close up, lots of flamingos, birds, peacocks and iguanas all roaming around. The shrubs and lawns are manicured to perfection. Pool: There is a huge pool in the middle of the complex. From one end, you cannot even see the other. It winds through the property. You can sit at the zero entrance with young children and still see the beach. There is also a small children's pool and an adult only swim up bar pool. There is a deep sports pool although, we never used that. Pools were clear and clean. Rooms: Very clean and no complaints. I did not find the beds or pillows bad as others mentioned. My bed was great. My brother in law ordered mattress pads which came right away. when we had any issue, the maintence people arrived promptly. There is a fridge in the room filled up every 2 days. Service: Excellent service and very friendly and helpful staff. They are not expecting tips and even without, they are happy to help. They are very strict about towels so hold on to them or your towel cards or they will make you pay $10.00 per missing towel/card upon check out. Drinks: Drinks are excellent and not watered down. The beach bar and the adult swim up bar have great drinks. We had nightly drinks in the lobby bar. Food: Make your reservations right when you arrive. They get full early. You are allowed 3 nights in the specialty restaurants for a 7 night stay. The Mexican was great! It was authentic and had lots of delicious appetizers. The Japanese steak house was excellent as well. Very fun to have them cook right in front of you. We didn't love the italian-sort of bland although some dishes were good, especially the filet. The buffets were fine, lots of selections but after 3 meals a day..that gets a little boring. You can always find something to eat in the buffet. There is a 24 hour buffet open in the hotel Quetzal-connected and basically the same hotel. The beach restaurant in the day has hamburgers, hotdogs and nachos and the ice cream shop served cones or cups and changed flavors daily. Beach-How sad to see the damage from the hurricaines. There is a lot of beach erosion. That being said, there is still ample beach and plenty of chairs available althought people do get up early to put towel on chairs. The beach is full of sand bags, huge bags. The kids enjoy playing on the sand bags with the waves. Kids Club-My son enjoyed it. There were some activities, it was not as active and organzied as other kids clubs we have been to. There is a nightly show at 8 pm that they kids enjoyed. Overall this was an excellent trip. I would recommend this hotel to people traveling with children. They are very child friendly at this resort. I would pick a different location if you are looking for a quiet romantic vacation.

Overall we had a lovely time, and would definitely like to come back again. There's a lot to say about this place, and it may not be the right spot for everyone, while for some it will be perfect. We were very worried about the beach, and it turned out to be fine. The beach is built back up enough that there were easily a hundred people on it each day during our trip. The short-distance view is admittedly not a traditional photo op. The large whale-like breakwaters built to retain the sand aren't exactly pretty, and some of them now have a thin covering of green seaweed. That being said, we've spent a lot of time on the Mayan Riviera, and the beaches can be a little rocky and the surf a little rough, so the breakwaters at the Tucan actually helped create a more protected area for kids to splash around in. And if you want perfect white powder sand beaches, I'm afraid you have to go the Florida panhandle (where it's not swimming weather this time of year!) or an island like Guadeloupe (which costs twice as much as the Mayan riviera). But the beach here is still large, sandy, and fun, and the sea beyond the breakwater is as breathtakingly beautiful as everyone says: a shade of turquoise unmatched anywhere else we've stayed along the Gulf or Caribbean coasts. Lounging on beach chairs in the sun (or shade--there are lots of palapas and umbrellas) and looking out at that beautiful water was a real treat. The grounds and pool(s) are gorgeous and spacious. It's not just the lush jungle and gardens, which we enjoyed endlessly: everything about this resort is designed so that there is beauty everywhere you look, anywhere you are. There's an absolute minimum of pavement and asphalt. And all the restaurants, lobbies, bars, etc., are indoor/outdoor, beautifully shaded but open-air. We'd heard a lot about the problems with poolside chairs, and it's true that every morning when we came down to the pool (around 9 a.m.) almost all the 200 chairs were \"reserved\" to varying degrees (with a towel, a book, or a pair of sandals); but we took the hotel's constantly-posted warnings against \"reserving\" chairs seriously, and we simply moved or consolidated other people's towels, and never had (or winessed) a single unpleasant encounter. Most of the time we never even saw the people who's towels we'd moved; I don't know where they were--perhaps in the water all day?! The fact that there are now lots of people on the beach probably alleviates the pool problem. We were admittely only looking for a couple of chairs, and perhaps if you were looking for more it would get difficult; but again, we've spent a lot of time in various resorts along the Gulf and in the Caribbean, and there aren't many poolsides where you can expect to find 4 or 5 empty pool chairs together any time you stroll by! The rooms are very nice, and are kept very clean, simple, and beautiful. The individual rooms are about the only truly \"indoor\" environments in the resort, and all the common spaces in the individual buildings (stairways, halls, etc.) are marble, so noise travels a bit. It's probably not the best place for a romantic, sleep-late kind of getaway. We calculated that there are only two buildings with lousy views (17 and 18 -- we were in 17!). The \"external\" side of these buildings (the side looking outward from the resort) looks directly onto the hotel next door, and, in our case, onto industrial-size air-conditioning units. Any of the other buildings, and especially the \"internal\" view sides (looking onto the Tucan/Quetzal resort itself) should have very nice views. The food was a little disappointing, and we were surprised. We'd read many reviews saying it was great, and a few saying it was terrible, and we were inclined to think it would be somewhere inbetween: pretty good, but not spectacular. I'd imagined that the daily buffet fare would be to our taste: lots of good, cheap Mexican food. Cheap Mexican food would have been great, but this was just generic cafeteria food (hot dogs, pasta, french fries, bad pizza, etc. -- lots of choices, but nothing overly appetizing). The specialty restaurants were a little better, but not great, and beware of false advertising: my menu selection read \"snapper over a bed of guajillo sauce and tomato coulis,\" except that it was just a dried piece of snapper with no bed whatsoever; my wife's menu selection read \"rib-eye steak with mango chutney and crunchy sweet potatoes,\" except that there was no chutney and no sweet potato (at least her steak was quite tasty). The ample appetizer buffets at these specialty restaurants were actually quite good; a cut above the entrees, and much better than the buffet food elsewhere at the resort. Happily, we acutally found some of the room-service food to be quite good (especially the Tacos al Pastor and the pizza with chorizo), so we got in the habit of having a lovely happy hour on our balcony, and just picking at the generic buffet fare a little later in the evening. By the way, we had expected that the seafood would be fresh in this area, but after repeated experiments we simply gave up; the seafood in Chicago is definitely fresher than any fish or shrimp we had at the Tucan, and we tried a lot. Okay, after having dissed the food at length, let me say that breakfasts were spectacular: endless fresh fruit, tables upon tables of baked goods, dozens of different preparations of eggs, waffles, french toast, bacon, cereals, smoothies, you name it. What a way to start the day! The service was friendly. Again, we'd read lots of reviews that said the staff here were the nicest, warmest people in the whole wide world, and a few reviews that said they were surly. So I repeat: they were perfectly friendly, period. They weren't surly, and they didn't want to be our best friends: frankly, given the differences in culture and class, it would have seemed a little weird if they acted like they did. The one exception is the \"Star friends,\" the professional entertainers and hosts, who really were ostentatiously friendly and energetic, which was probably appropriate for trying to get a bunch of strangers to play volleyball together or trying to get a bunch of kids to dance in public! There's one huge, meandering pool with multiple lagoons, fountains, etc., plus a toddler pool, a sports pool (for water basketball, etc.) and a pool dedicated entirely to a swim-up bar and waterfall. All beautiful, spacious, in pefectly-designed setting, with just the right mix of sun and shade. And you can see the ocean from most points around the big pool, and get a drink or a bite to eat anytime, anywhere. There's a great mix of adults and kids here; lots of kids of all ages, and lots of activities and facilities for them; but it's not kiddy-land, and you can have a perfectly adult time here as well. My wife came to the Tucan with a bad flu which quickly turned into strep; when she finally decided to see the resort's resident doctor, she was seen almost immediately, and had her prescription in hand within an hour. Within a day she was feeling a lot better, and we were grateful that we had come to a resort where this near-disaster could be solved so readily and competently. So if you're a couple looking for a quiet, romantic, unforgettable hideaway, there are probably a few boutique hotels on the Mayan riviera which might be even more successful than the Tucan. But if you're looking for a wonderful family vacation, you'd probably be hard pressed to find something more beautiful, varied, and fun.", "Date": "March 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "chicago", "Title": "\u201cwent to the well once too often\u201d", "Author": "mtrmetals", "ReviewID": "UR14474820", "Content": "My family went to this Iberostar for the first time, but for the 4th time over the last 6 years.

We dont consider our selves to be particularly snooty about food, but the reality is that the food is average at best and all begins to look, taste and smell the same after a day, largely because it is. They serve pretty much the same thing at every meal, excluding the \"special restaurants\". As others have commented the sandbags rule the shoreline because of erosion, but when you live in Chicago that incrededible clear salt water is great. Very easy access to the beach just a few feet from the pool, which happens to be very good, makes it easy to bring the kids down to play in the sand. We have 3 and travelled with another family w/ young kids who also loved the beach,actually preferring the sandbags! The staff was fine, but certainly didnt go out of their way, unless of course you were a 25 year old woman with a thong bikini on. Then, you were treated like gold. The beds are extremely hard but you can request a pad that helps quite a bit.

We had towels taken every day and would go to the massage table and grab one back, but the last day we forgot to and when we checked out I told the desk clerk what happened and he charged me 10 bucks. Meanwhile, they ruined a shirt and gave us a 20 dollar \"credit\", but when I told him that made it 10 bucks they owed us, he told me we could only use it as a credit at the gift shop. A small thing but it spoke to their cheapness and it bothered me enough since we dropped probably 30 grand over 5 trips that I told him we would not come back. Didnt matter to him.

WOW, what a fantastic job!! I have to give major props to the Wedding coordinator, Mayra Rodriguez and her staff!! They did an AMAZING JOB, I couldn't have been happier. We all checked in with NO problem, everyone was friendly and the bell boys took care of our luggage and brought it all to our rooms!! I was a little worried before we went about the beach with the whole land erosion, especially since we wanted our wedding on the beach. Mayra (wedding corrdinator) assured me that it was not as bad as everyone had been saying and she was RIGHT!! Yes the beach on the Queztal is not the best, but anyone getting married, you get married on the Tucan side. The 2 sides are not even that far apart, so if you are staying on the Queztal side, just walk over 50 feet where there is not construction, find a chair and relax! As far as the sand bags in the water, if you didn't know better they sort of look like rocks and they are not everywhere (as you can see in our wedding pictures). The ceremony was beautiful and the staff was wonderful. Shortly after the ceremony it started raining, I had no worries because the staff had very large umbrella's for the wedding party and transported all of us in covered golf carts or anyone else who wanted a ride. Mayra and the hotel, did their best for my request to have all of our guests to be as close to gether as possible, (ie, having everyone spred out in all 10 different buildings) it turned out great, we were very pleased with the results!! We had an age range of 6yrs.-59 years of age! Only 2 children, and they had a blast! My parents go to Mexico every year, and they absolutly loved this place and were very pleased! They have been to playa a few times and will go back!! Our room was fantastic with the ocean side view!! I really didn't care what kind of curtains or what our bed comforter looked like, who cares with the beautiful water and beautiful senery!! If you are that concerned what is on the walls or what color the comforter is why are you going to Mexico?? unless you never planning on never leaving your room and this was our wedding room and I thought it was GREAT. (yes, i have traveld to Mexcio, florida, the keys, vegas, etc. so no it's not like it's I have never been in Hotel before) :) The looby is beautiful with a great lobby bars and beautiful parrots! I loved walking throught the \"jungle\" to get to the resturants and the lobby, seeing the fun animals!! The staff was very friendly and welcoming!! The bartenders were excellent! Everything was always clean with our rooms along everything else. The maids always did a great job and made cute little animals on our beds everyday!! They always stalked our fridge with waters and sodas and if we needed more, just ask! I thought the food was great, some things better then others, but I can say I was very pleased with their selection!!!!!! If you don't like something, order something else, this is an AI resort!! Eat and drink on!! You don't like one, move to another!!! It was only a few minutes from 5th ave, (downtown Playa) and the Tucan always had a cab within minutes!! About the \"hard\" beds, I really didn't notice them being too hard or hard at all! But, I always had a lcouple of fruity drinks through out the day!! (maybe that helped) :) I would recomend buildings 15-10 on the Tucan, building 10 is beach view and 15 is right where all the resurants are. As far as building 16-20, I don't know, everyone in my party stayed in 15-10. Our friends got married here 1 year ago and were pleased to come to our wedding and celebrate their 1 year anniversary!! They stayed on the Queztal side again in their same room and the beach did not both them one bit. We can't wait to back on our 1 year anniversary! If you plan on a beach wedding, this is it!!! Great, great, great job!!! You will be soo pleased with Mayra!! Thanks again, Mayra!! Or if you just want to get away to a beatuiful resort not to spendy, this is it!!

It was hard for us because we remember what the beach looked like before the erosion. It always seemed that the Tucan was untouchable from Mother Nature as all of the other resorts to the North always had issues. The beautiful blue waters were replaced by the giant sandbags in the water. And this was the case at EVERY single resort in the area including Sandos!!

We went with another couple, who we have been trying to persuade to come to the Carribean for years. They really enjoyed it and will be returning for sure. Thanks to advice from the forum on TA, I emailed the hotel to ask for a specific block to stay in, and they gave us just what we asked for which was great.We stayed in block 11, rooms 1141 & 1142 on the top floor, it's the next block to the ocean view suites and you can see the sea from the balconies, the rooms are quiet, and in the far corner so no-one walks past your room at night and wakes you up!! This was our 4th stay at an Iberostar hotel, and it was up to their usual standard. The rooms were great, loved the idea of having an iron & ironing board, hair dryer and coffee maker in the rooms. It's in a lovely setting and the themed & buffet restaurants were amazing. We had intended to eat out in Playa Del Carmen a few times, but there was so much choice in the hotel we stayed put. The ice creams available all day from the beach bar were amazing, don't miss them. The staff are really attentive, and the star Friends encourage everyone who wants to, to join in. Playa Del Carmen is near enough if you want a meal or a drink out, the cab cost us $5 plus tip each way and only took about 5 mins to get there. There is a smaller Plaza shopping centre just up the road, which has everything you could want, we actually bought more there than we did in Playa Del Carmen, and they hassle you much less at the Plaza! Now to the beach! Yes it was disappointing to see such erosion of what was a beautiful beach when we last went 8 years ago, but they are working their socks off to try and rectify the situation, and it looked as if they are building a retaining wall along the front of the Quetzel hotel, to combat the erosion. The beach did change quite a bit in the 2 weeks we were there, and had certainly got smaller, but you are still able to sit on the beach if you so wish. This is not the only hotel to be affected by erosion, all the hotels along this coast are affected, some even worse than the Iberostar. The bladders in the sea to combat erasion are really great fun to play on, and whilst we were there, there were waves and surf, which certainly made it more interesting to go in the sea. The only slight gripe I had was the swimming pool. For a complex so large, there wasn't an awful lot of room around the pool area, especially when on some days it was too windy to sit on the beach, so everyone was round the pool. They really cram the sunbeds in together, so you are on top of each other. And contrary to comments on the TA forums, of the Europeans getting up at the crack of dawn to get the best sunbeds, it was the Americans or Canadians whose towels were out by 4.30-5am each day, and who really gave us the evil eye when we dared to get their spot one day!!! You really needed to be down by 9am at the latest to get a sun bed with an umbrella or some shade, by 10.30am there were no sun beds to be found anywhere. We did several trips, Xacaret, Xa-Hal & Tulum and the day trip to Cozumel. We also went on the Captain Hooks evening, which I felt was a rip off, but the other 3 in my party enjoyed it (something to do with them drinking and me not, I think!!)

The resort exceeded our expectations even though we had spent months looking at reviews and photos from previous travellers. We were concerned that the beach wouldn't measure up, but it was lovely with warm pools for our 8 year old to play in and awesome waves for our 13 year old. If you walk to the right when you are facing the ocean, it's jungle after the next hotel. Watch out for the time share scammers next door. Our room was lovely, the resort is so pretty and luxurious, but most of all the room, restaurant and bar staff were polite, pleasant and attentive. If we wanted a drink, they were there, an extra something for the room, ... a glass of wine. We even had room service for lunch one day when everybody was tired out. The days flew by even though all we did was eat, sleep and play, and drink kalhua and milk slushies in the pool - ahhh (ask them to do it up in the blender). We loved the steak restaurant, and were impressed by the presentation in the Japanese and Italian restaurants. The food in the Japanese restaurant was very salty and laced with butter/oil? At the steak restaurant, we had a rib eye (thin and really good), a filet (thick and nicely cooked), salmon and shrimp. I won't reveal all the other treasures we found in the restaurants except to say that if you eat a Gordita egg on the first day, you'll have to have one every day and you'll dream about them when you get home! Definately something for everyone. The staff told us they work very hard to ensure their guests stay healthy - water in the restaurant and ice cubes are made from filtered water. We ate salads, fruit, etc and we were fine. The pool was tons of fun for us and for our kids - clean and a nice temperature most of the time. A walk to the pool and ocean after dark is breathtakingly peaceful. Ice cream from the ice cream girl every afternoon for the kids poolside and kids club for our little one - she got to have her Scooby Doo fix and then right back in the pool. The layout of the resort couldn't be better (very accessible for people in wheelchairs and seniors - lower level rooms (and showers) are walk in and flat path runs around the outside of the buildings - the creatures and plants were a pleasure to see each day. I walked in the mornings and felt very safe walking around the resort when hardly anyone was out. We didn't feel much need to leave the resort except for a bit of shopping. We had planned to do a number of excursions, but we really enjoyed the resort and had a relaxing, wonderful family week. Great resort for extended families, couples with or without kids. Children were treated so nicely by the staff. People without kids will love the adult pool/swim up bar. It was a wild place once afternoon rolled around! At night there were shows for the kids and then for adults. Some nights we were into bed so early and never heard a thing. Hung out wet things on the balcony and wondered why it was soaked every morning til the last day when we got up early enough to see the lawn sprinkler watering our suits:) We had a great time; we'd go back in an instant (when we were getting ready to get on the bus to go to the airport my daughter said to me, 'Mommy, today is a sad day.' We got our little girl's hair hair done in half braids at the spa - 50 bucks - I suggest a 5 dollar cab to 5th avenue and find the lady who will do the same job for $15. 5th avenue fun, but most shops are expensive. You have to really bargain; many things cost more than at home. Sky Service airline lost one of our suitcases on the way down; we still don't have it back. Label your bags inside and out! Inflight service was horrid on the way down and great on the way home. Delay of about 3 hours getting out of Cancun on the way home; glad we had a few snacks stashed in our carry on. It wasn't pleasant but it gave us a chance to stroll through duty free and people watch. We noticed people who had a crib board with them - great idea. Sky Service phone cards didn't work - don't waste your money. We ended up calling home using our credit card - over 39 dollars for a few minutes (5 dollars a MINUTE, so be careful)!

My teen daughter, best friend and I went for a girls trip (one week) and returned on March 2nd. We had much sun, rest and relaxation. Like all of the reviews...it's a really nice resort. I have been to the area twice before to different resorts, and this one was very good value for money. Special thanks to a few of the staff: Jonathon, Carlos, Fernando and Daniel. Really helped to make our trip special. Beach - yes, it's eroded and not terribly pretty, but it didn't prevent us from enjoying the rays, the water and the sounds of the waves. Food - it's good. Not spectacular (had better at other resorts), but lots to choose from and like most (except for teen dauther who can eat anything and still look like a runway model!), we gained a few pounds, so it couldn't be bad! My friend & daughter both loved the Japanese and Steakhouse, personally, I preferred the buffet! Service - definitely top notched! Smiles, smiles and more smiles! Very friendly service and that does make a holiday that much better! Didn't seem to make a difference with or without tips...but we still gave them when we could. Rooms - nice...not over the top, but functional and clean. Mini bar was always well stocked. Shower wasn't the best...hot/cold spots so be careful! Beds...for us, they were not overly hard...but that depends on what you are used to! We stayed in building 11 and really liked the location...close to pool and beach. T.V., though not used much, was a little confusing to figure out. Disco was fun for a night - too many mojitos...but that's another story! Lobby bar was always happening and we enjoyed going there for a cappucino or nightcap most nights.

You cannot go wrong with the Iberostar chain in the Riviera Maya area of Mexico. They all have very high standards of service, cleanliness, and overall excellence. Our room was very large and did not have the damp, musty smell of some Mexico resorts. We had a fully stocked fridge with beer, water, and pop that was refilled every day. It was nicely decorated in cheerful, bright yellow colors. We had a nice big bathroom with a shower and tub combination. Our room was about a 2-minute walk to the pool and beach. There was a little couch and sitting area for reading. The pool area is gorgeous and huge. The water is crystal clear and the pool is extremely large, so you don't feel it's overcrowed. They have some jacuzzi areas that were very relaxing. The staff did some games near the pool, but nothing obnoxious and spring-breakish. It was never so loud that you couldn't relax. The beach was breathtaking. Plenty of chairs, white sand, no need to reserve chairs at 6am, and clear turquoise water with no rocks. Absolutely perfect. The food wasn't excellent, but with a resort this wonderful it didn't matter. The specialty restaurants were very good. We had some steak and shrimp dishes that were very high-quality. Great drinks too, and they'll make pretty much anything you want. The entertainment was fun too--the \"Star Friends\" put on a show every night around 8pm and they are great!

THE ROOMS - you will see from the photos on this web site that the rooms are in blocks which are three storeys high. I had e-mailed the hotel before leaving home to ask for a middle floor room in a quiet area and that is just what we got. It was block 15 facing the jungle. We thought this was ideal as it was just at the end of the tiled path to the lobby and restaurants but private enough to feel totally secluded. The decor was a little bit too rustic for my taste but I suppose it was done to fit in with the Mayan decor. The beds are really really hard but I got used to this after a few days. We had ants in our room on day 1 but it was our fault as we had left a coffee cup out and my husband takes sugar in his coffee. The maid came and sprayed the room and left us the can of bug spray but we didnt have a problem with it after that. The rooms are spacious with a coffee maker, internet connection and everything else that you would need. Because of the location of the room we were lucky enough to have a family of monkeys including babies on their mothers backs right outside the room for a full afternoon. My friends have been to this hotel three times and never seen monkeys. GROUNDS/POOL - the grounds are lovely and clean and the plants and flowers are beautiful. We loved spotting the iguanas and guinea pig things everyday on our walk to the beach but be prepared to be woken up very early by the roosters and peacocks. I am an early riser anyway so this didn't bother me and as a result we have loads of fab photos of the sunrises. I prefered the Tucan side to the Quetzel side of the bar and lobby mainly due to the fact that the Quetzel side has wooden walkways rather than tiled and I like to wear high heels on a night and my shoes fell through the gaps in the wood! Everywhere is spotlessly clean and there seems to be gardeners and maintenance workers wherever you go. The pool is huge but you do have to be there at about 6.30am to get a good spot. We didn't join in any of the games despite the Star Friends trying to get us to each day but don't worry, they arent pushy at all and are really nice and friendly even if like me you dont participate, just watch. RESTAURANTS/BARS - one word about the food - excellent! I am very well travelled including Europe and the USA and can honestly say that the food was consistently lovely wherever we ate. We tried all 5 of the speciality restaurants as well as the buffet. Our favourites were the steakhouse and the tropical. The steaks were cooked to perfection and the service is friendly and attentive without being too 'in your face'. The house wine was just to my taste and I tended to drink this in the restaurants although they are happy to make you cocktails if you want. We spent most evenings in the lobby bar playing cards and only went to the entertainment once but that only because we are not into that type of thing. The bartenders will make your drinks however you want and the waitress service was always really prompt and friendly. BEACH - yes the beach has eroded but it is nowhere near as bad as I was expecting from reading other reviews. As I said earlier I am an early riser so had my pick of spots on the beach and went for the ones right on the edge of the drop-off. But even if you dont get up early enough to get a fixed parasol there are always spare sunbeds and you can just ask for a one from the towel hut. The beach does get a bit crowded near the bar area but we went right to the other end near where they had the weddings. The sandbags look at bit unsightly but my husband and daughter had fun swimming up to them and jumping off. The sea is really warm but a bit rough so be careful if you are not a strong swimmer. We had a few walks up the beach and our beach was a lot less crowded than the Riu ones. All in all we had a fantastic holiday for the price. If you are expecting 5 star luxury and 'bounty advert' beaches then you are going to be a bit disapointed but for value for money I would rate this as the best holiday we have had. We visited Chichen Itza, a cenote, swam with dolphins and shopped in Playa-del-Carmen and Cancun and will definitely be coming back again.

It was our first time at an Iberostar resort, and we were quite impressed. We've stayed at other all-inclusives, and Iberostar was by far the best experience. The kicker was the Star Friends. I don't know how much they get paid, but they deserve more! The Star Friends provide entertainment around the pool during the day and perform at the theatre at night. They try to get guests involved (i.e. dragging people on stage). It is all in good fun, and made the trip that much more enjoyable. The Star Friends are way more talented that I would ever had expected. They are hilarious and provide hours of enjoyment for young and old alike. We took our 6-year old daughter with us, and she had a blast! The Kids Club was terrific, safe, and she never wanted to leave. At 8pm, the kids are invited on stage to either perform or be involved in some sort of activity. The kids loved it, and usually wanted to stay for the adult show afterwards, which was very family-oriented. The resort in generally is very family oriented, there are many water sports and other activities to get involved with. The pools are incredibly clean and well-maintained. The beach, although a bit eroded, is spectacular, along with the clear and warm ocean. The service was tremendous, and way beyond my expectations. Waiters were fast and provided service with a smile. The food was very good, and the specialty restaurants were especially good. Yes, the bed was a bit hard, but otherwise the room was wonderful, and the maid service was very good.

The bathroom has a lovely shower which is hot and powerful. The only downside to the bathroom was that there was no bath. The rooms also have mini fridges which are restocked every two days but if you leave the maid a little tip it will be done everyday!! Alot of the reviews stated that the beds are very hard and I cannot argue they are quite hard however they were not as bad as I was expecting and I found it quite comfy!! GROUNDS - What can I say about the grounsd, the hotel is like paradise. What seperates it from others is the jungle in the middle with all the animals roaming free. It really is a sight to see. FOOD - I am a very picky eater but there is such a good selection of food. There is the buffet restraunt which does all 3 meals and then there also also the snack bars by the pool/beach for burgers/hotdogs etc... There are also 5 al-a-cartes which are all very good,a steak house, mexican, tropical, italian and japanese. Make sure you have a go at them all! POOL/BEACH - The swimming pool is massive and there is lots of space for people in the pool, you will never feel to crowded. However the 2nd week we were there it was busy and you had to be done poolside by 9/10 if you wanted a sunbed for the day. People do reserve them very early even though your not supposed to. I have never been here before so cannot comment on the beach before the erosion but they are working very hard and it is getting bigger day by day we noticed a big improvement in the 2 weeks we were there. There is still lots of sand and the water is so warm you could stay in all day!!

I have used Trip Advisor extensively in the past to research holidays and hotels but have never felt compelled to write a review. The reason I do so now is because while I was researching Playa Del Carmen and Playacar I now know there was a lot of misinformation often with people commenting , particularly on erosion, who had not even been there recently and posting old pictures. Overall the hotel is a tremendous place to stay. The pool, general resort design, cleanliness and efficiency were all excellent. The food both in terms of quality and availability was also very good to the extent I had not nearly reached boredom point after 14 days and we only used 4 of the 5 allocated a la carte options.Whilst we all enjoyed the Steak House (twice), it was not of the very high quality many people were suggesting on the review board. On the contentious issues :- the beds ARE hard from someone who has used orthapedic mattresses for 20 years!! The reason is probably because they do not have divans but a mattress on top of a concrete plinth. Obviously these are hard and cannot be moved to push beds together, make room etc. Similarly what we thought would be a pull down sofa for the children was actually a concrete shelf with a full length cushion , about 30 inches wide. Neither would sleep there so it was 2 in each bed and although they did offer a z bed there was little room already and it would not have improved the \"arrangements\". It did not stop us sleeping soundly! The beach IS changing every day , sometimes for the good, sometimes worse. On the day we left the drop was about 6ft with a beach of around 20ft until the front line of whales and then another line about 20 yards into the sea. It was probably worse at the end of our stay after a couple of rough days. These now stretch across most of the property and there are sandbags on top of sand bags in places. They are also pumping sand onto the beach and on the day we left there was a mini bulldozer on the Quetzal side and earthworks to try and better / protect that side. The ledge runs into the Sandos resort although it is not as dramatic as the Tucan and the beach largely remains. Sandbags are now also in the first bit of the Sandos area. This did not stop our enjoyment of the beach at all with many people preferring to play on the sandbags than walk 20 yards to the \"better\" beach. Indeed people were coming from Sandos side to play on the bags. There IS a real problem with sunbeds by the pool and palapas in particular with seats being \"reserved\" by inconsiderate people. Many did not turn up and some had areas chosen by pool , palapa and beach to move between the 3 during the day.Due to having 2 young children and our body clocks on UK time we were up at around 7 to 8 most days and struggled to find four sunbeds together and on one day could not find anything at all- too polite to move others towels etc. There should be some system to officially allocate sunbeds or provide enough for all guests. I do not know if this was a problem because of the reduced size of areas but looking at past reviews this is a common problem. In addition the beds are very cramped together by the palapa area . We did tip quite a lot on the holiday but I would not say it gave us any preferential treatment at all ( not the intention ) - everyone was friendly and courteous and efficient at all times - although tips were gratefully accepted. Having walked up the Playacar beach I was happy we made the right choice of hotel and the beach was far better than all those towards Playa del Carmen and better than I expected generally. I would not hesitate to return to Tucan next time in Mexico and was glad I did not take up the offer to switch hotels because of the beach condition. The only better beach option was Sandos and the resort does not compare. I will try and upload some current beach photos later.", "Date": "February 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa", "Title": "\u201cSuperb Vacation\u201d", "Author": "proulx", "ReviewID": "UR13845996", "Content": "Hotel is just just beautiful beyond description. Great hotel, not a glitch, great restaurants including the buffet - lots for all tastes. Friendly staff everwhere.

Great location - safe and only a 40 minute walk to the town of Playa and 5th avenue. Cab ride is $5US or 50 pesos. The only downside is the beach erosion but you the Sandos next door has a great beach - and then a mile or so of wild beach with no hotels - just superb. Not much the hotel can do to fight nature but there is still lots of unobstructed access to the beach. We also did ChichenItza pyramids (2,5 hours to and 2.5 hours from) and Xel Ha water park (40 minutes trip) - both well worth the trip. Another tip for first time travelers - dont rush to book your trip with your hotel travel agent - check the price with Gray Line in the small nearby mall - prices are generally 25 to 40% cheaper for the same trip.

We've travelled as a family to many great resorts, mostly in the Caribbean, and although the facilities at Iberostar weren't necessarily that much better than some other spots, it was a combination of \"little things\" which made the difference: -We stayed in Building 14 on the jungle side of the building, so even though the room itself was of average size and quality, we had balconies overlooking the jungle and a great daily view of all the wildlife in it. -Food overall was good, but the specialty restaurants made the difference- we were allowed to reserve 3 nights for our 7 night stay, and chose the Mexican, Italian, and Japanese, the last of which was probably our favorite, primarily becuse of the Hibachi show cooking. - The pool is very large and there's lots of fun activities around it daily. The beach, as others have noted, has eroded substantially, but there's still plenty of room, and it didn;t really affect our experience, possibly because we spent far more time at the pool. Our only real disappointment was the daily chore of finding a place to sit. The resort has PLENTY of chairs there, but every day a minority of rude, selfish people run down to the pool around 7 or 8 AM (no kidding) to put their towels, old magazines, water bottles, etc all over the chairs to reserve spots for themselves and any friends who might care to join them later. Unbelievable. Management has plenty of signs up warning against doing this, but clearly don't enforce it. -The service is excellent and the staff really seem to care. The Star Friends, who are in charge of all the guest activities and also put on nightly shows in the theatre, are fantastic. These people really do an amazing job of contributing to a holiday-type atmosphere at the resort, and we miss them already. So would we go back? Almost definitely, and the only reason for our hesitation is the behavior of SOME of the other guests, but you probably get that at most all-inclusives which are not 5-star. By the way, we took a side trip to Xcaret, which is probably the ultimate family day trip, particularly if you also do the optional dolphin swim as we did. And it's only about a 15 minute ride away, unlike trips to the ruins at places like Chichin- Itza (sic) which can be 2 hrs or more each way.

This was our first time traveling to Mexico in the Riviera Maya area and it was great! It was quite a ride from the airport, but the air conditioned cars made it not a problem. When we got to the hotel, I thought it was beautiful. There were lots of animals like peacocks, roosters, monkeys, flamingos, anything you can imagine. Although the peacocks could be loud at times, it really was no problem. The first thing after getting settled in was to go to the beach. It was breathtaking and gorgeous. There were hardly any waves and it felt like bath water. The pool was also very nice and it was huge! The pool was also extremely warm, and definatly warmer than the ocean. The food was also good. They had a lot of food for everyone and the a la carte resturantes were good as well. The grounds and rooms were clean and they always restocked your mini bar. Also, the night entertainment was very interesting and every night was something different. What i did not like at this place was that they had messed up our reservation at the Italian a la carte and we had to wait for an opening until about 9:00 p.m., and there were hardly any people there anyway! I also didn't like the fact that you had to wake up early just to get a good chair at the beach/pool.

How can I explain?! This resort is fabulous from beginning to end! As someone else mentioned, I was also worried about some of the negative comments that were posted. I'm glad that I went there with an open mind because there is nothing there to dissapoint anybody! (at least from our experience) Service: I've never experienced service like that anywhere in my life. From the service desk to the maid service to the bar service to the restaurant and buffet service and even the beach service was amazing. The people that work there never stand around...they are always doing something productive and you will never be without a drink at the dinner table! They are so very courteous towards us and have a very respectful. Rooms: Very nice room...more then I could ask for (we were in 1225) in front of the pool, facing the ocean. Yes the beds are harder then normal but we were so tired when we went to bed that it doesn't even matter...And I didn't wake up with a sore back! Nice 3 storey villas beautifully painted in bright paradise like colors with flowers and plants on every balcony. 5 dollar tip everyday got us a well stocked fridge daily... The towel surprises on the bed are so exciting...I would rush to the room everyday after breakfast just to see what she left for us. Grounds: Always something to discover! There is an animal waiting to be discovered every step you take (peacocks, toucan, parrots, monkeys, turtles, big guinea pig like animals (don't know what they are called but so cute), iguanas, anoles, flamingos, swans, etc)...As amazing for adults as it is for children. The plants, trees and flowers are in abundance and make this place so special...there are path everywhere on the grounds, perfect for a nice stroll. The buffet areas are surrounded by ponds & fountains with large koy fish in them. The buffet area at Quetzal has a waterfall! The fact that it's 2 resorts in one makes it even more interesting...more to discover! Pool: Wow! The size, the shape, the color...salt water too...we aren't pool people but we couldn't resist..it was wonderful. They have straw huts all around and even gazebos with matresses where you lounge/recover from the nite before. The swim up bar is secluded so adults can be adults...kind of feel like a bar at \"Paradise Hotel\"...tons of fun to be had there. The beach: The sand is perfectly white and fine. The water is the colour everyone wants...Turquoise. They have sand bags in the water (kind of like big whales)...totally fun to go on, tan on..have adventures on...we bought a boogie board and waited for the big waves. Yes the beach has eroded...didn't affect anything at all...still plenty of beach to lay on and they are recovering tons of beach weekly. When they would empty the sand bags in the early evening, my hubby and I would search for seashells...they pour out of there! While on the beach, you get great service from the bar...Daniela made sure we were never empty handed. The Tucan & Quetzal bars: very nice....the ambiance is relaxing...the bartenders...TOO FUNNY!!! Especially Henry and Rafael...the waitresses...cute...especially Cinthia. Mascara is the club on the grounds. Very nice bar just doesn't get full but you know what...the fun is what you make it to be. Food: Breakfast buffet has something for everyone. I won't go into details because there is too much food to start naming. Fresh juice made every second (watermelon, pineapple, banana with milk) Delicious. 5 restaurants a la carte: Mexican, Japanese, Italian, Steakhouse, Carribean. For a 7 night stay you are entitled to 3 bookings...we ate every nite so long as they have room. Again...nothing to complain about (except the sushi). Best steak we ever had! Trips: We went to XCaret and Chichen Itza....money well spent...enhanced our experience in Mexico. Booked it through Apple Vacations...service was excellent and Jose was fun! Shopping: If you like to bargain...5th avenue is the place...we spent so much because everything is dirt cheap! (there are shops before you get to the actual market. Don't get impatient and spend your money there...keep going just a little bit and bargains galore). If you want a dream vacation in a paradise like setting book at Iberostar Tucan/Quetzal...you will not be dissapointed. This trip was so memorable that I have thought about it every day since we came back. Meeting all the new fun people from around the world made it even more special.

First time to Mexico. Stayed Feb 1st to the 8th BEACH For anyone debating about going to the Tucan because of the recent beach erosion......don't worry. The place is fabulous!!!! There is enough beach for everyone and you can walk it for kms to the south on a nice empty stretch of sand.(There are sand bags in the water to try and help the problem and they work on it everyday. The sandbags are a blast to swim out to and try and climb up on.For a real swim just walk down in front of the Sandos)There is an upper level with the palapas and the lower level with lots of sand and stairs to accomodate.Had no problem getting chairs at the beach however the pool was always full, but we are beach people. We did get the umbrella from the towel shack every time we went to the beach as all the palapas were taken but we didn't feel like getting up that early except to walk the jungle and find the monkeys.The hotel and grounds are beautiful and the location the best. The staff are friendly and very attentive.We even had great service on the beach. If you want a real drink just ask for the brand you want and they will pour generously until you tell them to stop. They will remember you every time. A dollar tip goes a long way. FOOD The food is your typical buffet food with lots of variety but I have discovered resort food just isn't my thing, although I never went hungry. (My husband and I were laid up one day....woke fine and a couple hours later we had some minor cramping and discomfort. We just layed around the room and watched movies.We ate on the Quetzal side the night before and think it was something we ate.?) What I really liked but didn't find until our last two days was the continental breakfast from 10 to 12. At home we are both up at 5am everyday but on holiday we tend to laze about the room until 10am when the regular breakfast is over.Also the beach grill made the best hamburgers!!! We traveled with our daughter and her boyfriend who would fill their plates two or three times and they never had any stomach issues. They loved the pizza and fries and nachos and cheese and did breakfast justice when we did make it to the buffet.Great bacon. (Sorry we never do the ala cartes as we don't know our plans from day to day) This being said I found the food in Cuba last year the best on our travels.(Melia Cayo Santa Maria) I must be strange as everyone says the food in Cuba is terrible.... this was not our experience. ROOMS We emailed the hotel just after booking in Oct. and again before we left and got the top floor jungle view room with adjoining room for the kids like we requested. Thanks Susanna and the front desk manager.(We had an hour and half delay at Toronto airport due to a storm moving in and de-icing and they even shut the run way were on down but we took off OK at 7:30am.) Arrived at the hotel at 1:30 pm, we checked in with a fruit drink and our rooms were ready.We were then brought a fruit basket delivered to our door. Very nice touch. Nice room with beds somewhat hard as mentioned but not enough to ask for the mattress cover. Our maid left us and the kids towel art everyday and even called to see if we were OK the one day we were not well. I would have liked a screen on the balcony door as we like to sleep with it open but didn't chance it here with all the wildlife. JUNGLE PATH The jungle path is great and we walked it everyday two or three times. If you want to see the monkeys my best advice is to get up at 6am and open your balcony door and listen for them. Then go out and follow the noise. Found them one morning by the stage area at the back. Another afternoon on the Quetzal side and once in the afternoon on the Tucan side. The birds and iguanas just walk around and seem to be used to people. We found the toucans, flamingos,peacocks, tortiose's and those rat things every where. STAFF The staff are the best. They even got my husband up on stage the first night. If you knew my husband as I do you would be impressed. I still am!! Chris,Lara and Adrian (starfriends)made our stay that much more enjoyable and Dominico in the restaurant is a doll. All the bar staff , star friends, the staff at the restaurants and the girls who walk around and clean ashtrays go out of there way to make sure your stay is enjoyable. Great shows at night too. We must have gone to about 6 or 7 and generally only make 2 or 3. TRIPS We took a taxi down to Akumal for a day and met some friends from Regina who were staying at the ABR. Walked the beach from one end to the other and found them. GREAT SNORKLING!!!!!Just 15 feet off shore and five minutes in we saw a turtle, stingray, barracuda and tons of fish and a beautiful reef. My husband and daughter are certified divers and never felt the need to go deeper.Spent the whole day there on the beautiful public beach and went to the Lol-Ha bar and restaurant for drinks. (approx. $20 for 3 corona and a rum and coke.)The cab was $27 each way and we just gave them $30. They do drive like maniacs.(My husband was not comfortable using the collectivo although our friends did and found it perfectly safe.) If were ever in the area again we will defintly go back to Akumal for the snorkeling. Did the royal dolphin swim in Delphinus and it was like they say .........an experience of a life time!!!!!!!!!!! Paid $149 each and well worth it for the foot push alone. Of course you buy the dvd when you see yourself and the exhilleration on your face. Another $150 later for dvd and pictures and my husband said the best $500 bucks for an hour we ever spent.It was just a great day and we all had the best time. Went into Playa del Carmen one night and walked around and had drinks at the Blue Parrot and meet our friends from Regina again. Got the \"Hey mister wanna meet my sista\" a couple of times and enjoyed the atmosphere. My only problem with a bar hop in Playa is the bathroom situation. Of course the bars have bathrooms but once you leave you would have to go to another to buy a drink just to use the washroom.There is however a public washroom at the bus station......3 pesos to get in. Cab ride $5 dollars each way. Didn't do any shopping here except the kids picking up their tequila. We had a great shopping area in Playacar about 5 minutes walk from our hotel and the prices at the hotel shops seemed to be the best. Had a fantastic time at the Tucan and would go back again some day. The kids are even talking about next year............could be a wedding. Wish we were still there. The weather was great with a few early morning downpours letting up to sunshine all day and highs of 28 to 30. Felt like 35. I found the nights warmer here too and never needed a long sleeve shirt like some places. And everyone please tip the staff. They work so very hard for so very little and never complain. When you talk to them some don't see their families for 2 to 3 weeks because of where they live. Some are going to school to improve and others are happy with what they are doing. Most speak 2 to 3 languages and some even 5 or 6!!! Some are from other countries. They deserve every tip you can give them and they share them. Came home to a four foot snow drift in our driveway.....plane delayed again due to weather in Toronto.

On the second day we got caught in our room during a downpour of rain...what a surprise to see all the monkeys in the trees right at our balcony! It was very exciting to have them so close. They actually swung from the roof of the balcony to the trees just beyond. The reserved restaurants we ate at were great. We had 2 meals at the Steakhouse (excellent steak) and 1 meal at The Bonsai. The Japanese show cooking was fun! The fried rice was delicious. I had chicken and beef and my husband had the same plus shrimp. They had little plates of Sushi ready for you as you sit down at the table. I let them know I was allergic to fish and they watched out for me! No Sushi for me! The buffet was typical all inclusive. It tries to please all nationalities. Some great picks and some you just pass by.The omelets made to order every morning were my favorite thing. The staff were absolutely wonderful! Before we started our vacation I sent a few emails asking questions and was very impressed with their quick and polite responses. (Thanks Sue K. for your input also!). They changed our room at the front desk after we arrived when I requested a 3rd floor jungle view room and we were very happy with their choice sight unseen. It was perfect. (coffeemakers in the rooms a nice touch) The beach does has some erosion but the funny thing is that it actually makes for more fun and a better view to watch. People were having a great time on the giant sand bladders as we called them. They were like big rafts would be on a lake with people jumping on and off and sitting to sunbathe on them. We spent a day visiting friends staying at Iberostar/Paraiso Beach. Their beach was huge but the view out in the water was a little boring! The Tucan also had the view of the island Cozumel that included cruise ships in the distance. It was very nice. IB/Beach was about 30 or 40 mins away $22.00 by taxi. It is BIG! Their pools are just gorgeous and grand. The biggest difference? No jungle (less shade) alot more hot walking and no monkeys!! We spent a day in Playa which was a lot bigger than I thought it would be but it was a nice day of shopping and stopping for Cervesas. My husband also went on a charter deep sea fishing boat that he really enjoyed. Apple Vacations set him up with Captain Rick's Fishing for $95.00 for 4 hours. The boat had a bathroom and a nice interior. They had about 16 different boats in their business. We had a great time and would highly recommend this resort for any age.

We were on the second floor of Bldg. 12. This was our 5th time back to this hotel, so we knew what it looked like in the past and it was good to see the jungle had grown back after the hurricane stripped it a couple years ago. Although I had seen pictures of some of the beach erosion, it wasn\u2019t as bad in the pictures as it was when we arrived. I\u2019m attaching some pictures. There was a good 10-12 foot drop off, rather than the beach going all the way out to the water, as in the past. There was recent storm a few weeks before we arrived that did the damage. They were working on setting out giant sandbags to save it from washing away even more during our stay. Hopefully, some day it will come back. The beach is about half of what it was, which makes it more crowded, but we could still find chairs. The night we arrived we asked for a mattress pad on our bed and it was much better. Don\u2019t hesitate to ask, they were very accommodating and it definitely made a big difference. The hotel is still beautiful with all the beautiful birds, monkeys and flowers. Breakfast: You can always find something to eat, they have such a large array of food. We prefer to go to the restaurant next to the pool for breakfast, it\u2019s not crowded at all and it looks out onto the pool and beach. The buffet at the main dining room has someone making omelets and pancakes. Lunch: We always ate at the restaurant by the pool (which is the other side of the pool from breakfast) where they grill burgers and hot dogs each day and they\u2019re great. Say hi to Leonardo, the bartender at the pool bar, he\u2019s a really nice guy and a great bartender. Dinner: Although the food is OK for dinner at the buffet, there aren\u2019t many people in there. When we were there the first few times several years ago there were at least quite a few people eating there. Now there seems to be very few tables of people eating in the buffet for dinner. I would suggest making reservations at the specialty restaurants right away when you first arrive. They allow you 3 for the week, but you can get on waiting lists for more and generally, you\u2019ll get in. Specialty Restaurants: This time we only went to the Japanese and we went a few times. Only because it\u2019s a fun place to meet other people sitting around you and the food is cooked in front of you, so it\u2019s fresh and pretty good. There is a big difference in the chefs preparing the meals. Some tables had a great showmanship by the chef, ours didn\u2019t entertain as much, but still a fun place to go and meet and talk to others while you eat. We've also eaten at the Italian in the past visits and it was good, try the Sea Bass. I highly recommend going into town for shopping and eating. The restaurants are really good and we\u2019ve never had a problem getting sick in 6 years. When you go, ask the cab driver to take you to 10th Avenue and 12th. (It\u2019s just down the street from 5th Avenue, only north a few blocks) and is a nicer area of shops and restaurants. The Glass Bar is right on the corner of 12th and a lot of good shopping and restaurants are in that area, both north and south a few blocks each way. The Glass Bar is a nice place for dinner if you\u2019re celebrating something special, but get reservations and plan to spend a few bucks, but it\u2019s worth it. If you want a fun evening downtown, go to Fiesta Siesta located just a couple doors South of 8th Street, across from Starbucks. We went there on Monday night for appetizers and enjoyed Chris Bolister singing. Chris is from London England and we loved his music. It\u2019s Chris on vocals, Mimo playing lead guitar and occasionally he has Bud Prince playing a wash board on the last half. It\u2019s a fun place, Chris plays a range of songs from the Stones, Eric Clapton to Hank Williams and has a great voice. We liked it so much we went back the next night. He was there Monday through Wednesday starting at 7:30, so check him out. This was our second time to take a cab to Tulum for the day. It\u2019s a beautiful beach and it\u2019s only about 45 minutes from the Tucan. It was $90 round trip for our cab ride.

Just came back from a fortnight holiday/wedding/honeymoon at this hotel and it was the best holiday so far. I booked my wedding direct with Catalina, the hotel's wedding coordinator and booked my holiday through a Tour Company who used First Choice. Before travelling we read some reviews which really scared us as our dream was to get married on the beach. Please ignore any negative comments on this hotel as some people are just out to moan!! The hotel is superb and jungle amazing. We stayed in room 1444 and we had monkeys on our balcony that we fed daily - but be warned, they do remember you and come back with lots of friends. There are so many animals to see in the jungle area and the grounds are massive, we were still getting lost on our last day. Room: Very spacious, kept very clean, mini-bar stocked every day (we left small tip), beds were hard but comfy. Beach: Yes the beach is suffering badly from erosion but this did not spoil our fun at all. You can still swim safely in the beautiful turquoise sea and the sand bags were so much fun. If you are a pool person then this is also beautiful, the biggest pool I\u2019ve ever seen. Food: brilliant, our favourites were the Steak House and Tropical - it was the best steak we have ever eaten. Hotel nightlife: Amazing theatre entertainment and a great disco until 3am. Recommended drinks; Kir Royal (Champagne with Cherry liquor) and Riveria Maya (ice cocktail). 5th avenue is the long stretch of shops/bars in Playa del Carmen and it only costs $5 to get there. When I say long, well it exceeded our expectations. We had our pre-wedding dinner at the Blue Parrot Hotel - very pretty and excellent food! Trips, recommend Xai Ha and Xcaret - we did these two tours 4 years ago and loved them so much we went back. Wedding: Catalina is superb, book her direct and not through travel agent as you will save hundreds!!. I wont tell you too much about the wedding as I don't want to spoil it for others but let me just say it was perfect. Beach location idyllic, flowers beautiful and pictures/DVD amazing - it was like a fairy tale. We had a couple with us who were on honeymoon and 8 more guests who stayed in neighbouring hotels. I will definitely return to this hotel and recommend to others.

We stayed at the Tucan in March 2007 for 2 weeks and loved everything about it. It was amazing from the word go, the entrance lobbies are really plush, you know you are in for something special, there are two lobbies depending which side of the hotel you have been allocated, either tucan or quetzel side, personally I preferred our side which was the tucan, but then I am biast! We were signed in really quickly which was great and given our braclets. We were promptly given a refreshing drink which was well needed after our very long journey. The reception/lobby area is really well set out, there are plenty of large loungers to well...lounge about on!, there are various shops, which I will come back to later, a lobby bar which served the most amazing cocktails. The staff service at this bar is impecable, they soon get to know you and what drink you would like without you even ordering it, just what you need on holiday. Our room was great, everything we needed, we stayed in a block really near the lobby, it was the best location, and we had a top floor room. It wasn't at all noisy either, you could hear people laughing and having a good time at the lobby bar but it wasn't intrusive. The buffet and al la cartes were great. They have this great water feature which runs round the outside of the restuarants, its great feeding the fish whilst you are having dinner. The food was great, plenty of variety. We did rather over do it on the guacamole, but hey we were in mexico!! We enjoyed all our food on holiday, there was always something to enjoy, I think possibly the japense was our favourite, there was always so much variety in all the restuarants and it was nice going for a meal round quetzel side for a change. I regret to say we did become serial sunbed blaggers, only because everyone else was doing it though, we had to get up early and put our towels down or you really wouldn't get to sit where you wanted to, a lot of people were down there about 7.00 doing the same thing, it was a case of who could run round the pool the quickest sometimes!! The pool was great and had a jacuzzi feature in the middle. The beach bar did some really amazing cocktails, and again the staff were very attentive, particularly if you were on the beach, they would bring drinks to you. Its worth sweetening the staff up for these little extras! Daily the animation staff ran some kind of competition/event etc, there was always something to get involved in it you wanted to. Paella on the beach is not to be missed. Also I would thoroughly recommend having a massage down near the beach, it is soooo relaxing. I didn't have my massage till my last week and wish I had of had it earlier so had time for another! The monkeys were amazing. We spent about 3 days looking for them all over the complex, then eventually we found them, and then saw them nearly every day thereafter! You would often see them up on the roofs when you are at breakfast, one day they were almost reachable from our balcony, another day they were swinging in the trees near the pool. One person had them sleeping on their balcony one night, so beware if you leave your belongings outside overnight! There is all kinds of wonderful wildlife to see on your walk through the jungle down to the pool/beach area, also look out for the pelicans flying over. The lobbies have some great shops, there is a couple of general stores, a tequila shop, trip outlet, photo shop to name a few, and the best one of all was a really really great jewellery shop! Do not miss going to 5th Avenue, it is well worth it, really great shops, you can easily spend a small fortune here!! You can walk it from the hotel or take a short taxi ride. Another unmissable trip is X-Caret, this was totally the best day of our holiday, the snorkelling through the underground caves is a must, and they have a great buffet lunch lol! We meet some great people on our holiday - hi to Phil and Amanda, Hayden and Nicola and of course little Emily, Jason and Gemma if you are reading this! Gemma I hope you had a good flight home! To sum up this lengthy review, it was amazing, nothing to fault at all, food and drink great, staff really really friendly and can't do enough for you, and yes we would go back tomorrow!!", "Date": "February 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, MN", "Title": "\u201cBest Wedding we could have ever imagined!!!\u201d", "Author": "Molikins", "ReviewID": "UR13337820", "Content": "Last Jan 28th was the best day of my life!! Actually - the whole 10 days I was there were AMAZING. My now husband and I had 45 of our closest friends and family join us at the Iberostar Tucan for our wedding. I had been doing a lot of research and had a lot of email communication with Catalina (A Wonderful wedding coordinator) and the PR contact (Mario - also wonderful), but I had no idea how absolutely perfect everything would be. We were impressed right away with our room and the wonderful food and alcohol. We've stayed at all inclusives before, and this one didn't even compare. Then on the wedding day, not only did I have a wonderful morning in the spa where we were all thrilled with our hairstyles, they brought us mamosas and fresh flowers into the room while we got ready. I couldn't believe when they brought in our bouquets as they were absolutely beautiful. The wedding dinner and the grooms dinner had delicious food - better than any wedding I have attended in the states. We had a blast in the discoteca and the photographs turned out so beautiful and were ready the next day in albums. I could go on and on - as I already kind of have, but I am an extremely happy bride who had the most wonderful time in Mexico. I have to admit I am having some post wedding/vacation blues being back in snowy MN - but it was so worth it! My whole family (including my 87 year old Grandpa who was able to rent a mobility scooter and cruise all around the resort) absolutely loved it and will definitely be going back. I couldn't recommend getting married at this resort more. If you have any questions at all as you are planning - feel free to let me know as I know planning can be difficult. Had I known our day and vacation would be so wonderful - I wouldn't have stressed the small stuff at all - they take care of everything there!

(Relaxing, warm, good drinks, and good food) and this place was perfect for us! After reading the reviews posted on this site, I must say, I was very worried about our decision. Please don't worry!!! Some people are just natural complainers! This place was Heaven On Earth!! My husband and I are professionals in our early 40's. We have 4 children, which we left at home. This vacation was for the 2 of us to relax and \"get away from it all\" This resort is beautiful! The staff are friendly, smiling and helpful. You will see the same people working from morning until night and back the next day. And they are always ready to serve your every need. (and we did not tip them until the last day of our stay.) The resort was CLEAN! Staff was always polishing the floors, sweeping the walkways, picking up beverage containers left behind from tourists, etc.. The best part was the animals! I am so glad we chose this resort over the more \"fancy\" resorts. I enjoyed walking through the jungle path seeing the different types of animals that lived on the resort. There were agoutis, iguanas, peacocks, howler monkeys, geckos, jungle fowl, toucans, scarlet mccaws, and many other critters too numerous to mention. The plants at this resort were also beautiful. I love color and the plants are just spectacular. The room we stayed in was oceanfront and I'm very particular about my room. Our room was large, bright, and clean. We had a spectacular view of the Caribbean sea. Our chambermaid, Mirna, was immaculate. We were greeted with towel critters, a fresh flower arrangement, and a basket of fruit when we arrived. The mini bar was stocked with beer, bottled water, coke, diet coke, sprite, and Fanta. We had a coffee pot in our room and Mexican coffee is Delicious!!! Mirna never missed a day of cleaning our room and stocking our refridgerator. We always had fresh flower petals scattered on our bed and new towel critters everyday. The bathroom was also large and spacious. The shower had a massaging head which felt very good after a long day in the sun. Now to the beach. Yes it is eroded. That is something that is not the fault of the resort. They are trying to get it built back up. There was plenty of sand to lie on to get a tan or drink a mohito. Take a walk south on the beach, and you will see how the beach looks in its unspoiled form. Great area for photo taking. Listen, you are in a beautiful setting, with turquoise waters, white sand, temperatures in the 80's, \"free alcohol and food\", and no work or worries. Who can complain about that! Obviously some people can. Oh, and yes you can always get a lounge chair no matter what time of day it is. You may have to drag it to where you want it, but there is always something available. The buffet has a large variety of many types of food. The food is always arranged nicely and is always plentiful. There are healthy choices as well as \"unhealthy\" choices. Whatever you are in the mood for. I would caution you to be careful of what you eat. Even though the water is purified in the resort, you can become ill. I was being a good girl, eating only fresh vegetables and fruit when I came down with \"Montezuma's revenge\" The only thing I can think of that may have made me ill, was perhaps the vegetables and fruit were washed with unfiltered water?? From that day on, I ate fried food, starches, and fruit that I had to peel. (Even though I got sick, my vacation was not ruined). Hey, I lost some of the weight I was putting on with those high calorie drinks:) You can walk to the city of Playa De Carmen from this resort. It is about a 30 min walk and I walk fast. Take a bottle of water with you and be prepared to barter. If you see something you like, do not buy it, but be coy and walk away after you express a small interest. These venders will come down to 1/2 the price that they originally gave you. They will chase you as you walk away yelling prices. I found it a little intimidating at first, but it's the Mexican way! If you don't like this type of transaction, you can walk to a small shopping area only 5 mins from the resort. Here the prices are pretty much set, but you can't get the deals you can in town. And the resort store is high priced. I didn't attend any of the shows at the resort. I am not really into that kind of thing, but other people that attended told me they enjoyed the entertainment. They are plenty of excursions to choose from, but my husband and I were interested in relaxing and didn't choose to do anything. I wish now I would have gone to Xel-ha. Mexico is the only place in the world with ceynotes and this is where they are plentiful. They say the film, \"The Blue Lagoon\" was filmed here. I know this review is long, but I really wanted to hit on some subjects that needed to be disputed from other people's reviews.

Yes the beach had suffered some erosion but so had all the other beaches along that area, you can't control mother nature. We are from New England so we understand that weather has it's own plan. We have visited this resort before and found it to be a wonderful location, great beach, great staff and beautiful surroundings. I have heard complaints about the food...When was last time you had fresh fruit drinks at every breakfast-made while you watch. Always fresh food with a great variety. The salsa and guacamole were fabulous, morning, noon and night. The buffet is good, the selections are many and varied and the coffee at the dinner buffet is great. The specialty restaurants could be better but the Italian and Steak house are worth a visit. Consisder that these are at no cost on the all inclusive. Where can you get a great filet mignon for free!!! We generally dine out a few nights while on vacation but this time we did dine in several times and quite frankly we were not disappointed at any of the restaurants. I would definitely recommend Italian and Steak house. The staff was always professional, willing to assist and friendly. The rooms were clean and well appointed. Each day a new towel designand and curtain display to entertain and surprise!!! We took pictures of each creation and appreciated the staff 's dedication to our pleasure. We have stayed at several Iberostar resorts and would recommend them to anyone. We have stayed at the resorts just north of Playa del Carmen, the Playa Pariaso and enjoyed that just as much but found that the size of the resort was quite a bit to navigate and negotiate when in a hurry to dinner. However we would definitely recommend a visit for a vacation there as well. Beautiful pools, beaches and again great staff and accomodations. What we like best about Iberostar Playa del Carmen is it's access to to the nearby small plaza and it's proximity to down town Playa. A great spot for a vacation!!! It is also so easy to catch a ferry to Cozomel- a great one day excursion. Rent a car get a map and take off for the day-well worth it. We headed out to the coast stopped at a beach with a little beach bar had a corona and moved along till we got to Coconuts- a great place for lunch and other interesting entertainment-you need to go there to know!

The beach is gone and going more everyday, yes that is mother nature and not fault of the resort. The beach was still fun for the children as is. We checked in easily enough, our first rooms were close to the evening noise (block 25) so we were moved the next day to the block 11 which is great for families with kids. The rooms have not been updated since the 70's. The beds are doubles not queens so very small. Very hard because the mattress sits on a slab of cement. The kids spent everyday at the kids pool which is beside the playcenter and kids club which is great. The problem... everyday we had to ask the front desk to have the pool cleaned. The big pool was cleaned every morning and they never cleaned the kids pool, i always sat out at the pool at 6:00 am feeding my baby so I watched what was cleaned and what was not. There was broken glass at the kids play center which was not cleaned up even after being brought to one of the staff attention by my husband, my husband ended up cleaining it himself after day two. The food is not good but I was not expecting it to be so we were fine with that. The star friends were wonderful, Roberto is great with the kids. My kids looked forward to the kids disco everynight. The animals were the kids highlight. The major upset for me is the fact that Iberostar would allow a Henna Tattoo stand in their resort that has a toxic chemical in it called PPD. There is no sign posted to say that this is not pure Henna and there are risks of a severe reaction to this product. The lesson was at the expense of my three year old daughter. We put a Henna tattoo (or what we were told was a henna tattoo) on her arm. When we returned from out trip it started to get blisters and go red. After a Dr. visist we learned about this \"black Henna\" and now she is branded for life with this tattoo on her arm. Also she now has a allergy to this product which is used in hair dyes, cosmetics, dark clothing, some sunscreens and antibiotics. She could have a fatal reaction if she ever comes in contact with this chemical again. Look it up on the internet and see the dangers of this before getting a Henna Tattoo in Mexico. Black Henna is illegal in US and Canada.

Our refigerator didn't work until we got our 3rd replacement half way through the week and the ice machine didn't work at our building either.

The place if beautiful but i could see how the animals could wake you up early each morning. The beach is gone but you can use the beach next to the Iberostar with no problems.

We love this place, and hope to come back in the future. The grounds are beautiful and well taken care of. There is a large pool with a hot tub in the middle, a kiddie pool for toddlers, a separate pool with a swim-up bar, and a separate pool for pool volleyball and occasional other games. Tucan and Quetzal both have a large buffet each, and there are 5 specialty restaurants. One of the things that we like about this hotel is that it is not too large - the size is very manageable, especially if you're traveling with little kids. The hotel is very family friendly. For kids 4 and older there is a kids' club, which is open from 10:30 a.m. until 4:30 p.m. The kids do an arts project in the morning, go swimming to the pool (they don't go to the beach), eat lunch, have quiet hour/movie, and then some other activity until the end of the day. Occasionally, they put up a show that they perform in the evening before the main show - it is very cute. There is also babysitting service available for $10/hour. Most babysitters are hotel employees who want to make some extra money, and those that we've met are all very nice. Food - we all thought the food was very reasonable quality. Buffets have a fairly good selection. Deserts were my favorite. They also have freshly squeezed juices for breakfast, like my favorite watermelon juice. Some of the meats for dinner were overcooked and oversalted, but, even with that, you won't go starving. Rather, quite the opposite. Last time I gained 5 pounds. This time wasn't quite as bad, but I still overate. We stayed for 6 nights, so we were allowed to make reservations in advance at 2 specialty restaurants. They also told us that we could check with them each night and see which restaurants are available if we wanted to eat dinner at more than 2. Most of the time, we could eat dinner at a restaurant, but around 9 p.m. We liked Italian the most. We also went to Mexican and Tropical, which were nothing special. Last time we also tried the Steakhouse, which was pretty good, but, eating so much all the time, it was hard for us to feel up to a big piece of meat, so we skipped it this time. Service everywhere was great - all the employees were very nice and friendly. Any issues that we had with our rooms got taken care of in a timely manner. The rooms were good. The mattresses are indeed fairly hard, but this is what we prefer anyway, so it didn't bother us much. Entertainment at night was OK - I'm not a big fan of all those shows, but some of them were amusing. My daughter loved them though - it was impossible to get her out of there. Beach - well, compared to the last time we stayed at the Tucan, the beach has definitely eroded. It was actually quite amazing to see the change since last time we were there - and it was only 8 months ago. We found out about the potential problem a day before we left, so we just hoped for the best. And to tell you the truth, it doesn't really have to ruin your vacation. The beach is smaller than before, and there is a 5 to 10 feet drop to the water (depending on where exactly you are), but you can still enjoy it and swim. We didn't experience any problems finding free chairs at the beach, and we never managed to get there before 11 a.m. (and usually even later than that). There were plenty available. I do hope that there is something that can be done to somehow restore the beach. We didn't spend too much time by the pool. We didn't scuba dive this time, but there is a dive shop on premises that you can set up your diving trips with, as well as get certification. You can also take a snorkeling tour to a nearby coral reef - the trip takes only one hour, and you actually get to see quite a bit. In conclusion, we enjoyed our stay, and hope to go back. Beach erosion seems to be a problem for all the hotels in the Playacar complex (some more than others), but Tucan's problem is not the worst, and it doesn't have to ruin your vacation.

Just trying to get down to the beach, and getting back up to the chairs is actually dangerous. As the sand area is so limited, all of us beach lovers were sandwiched like sardines. We actually witnessed the beach dwindle in front of our eyes in the time that we were there, 1/9-1/17. We had been to an Iberostar in the Dominican and absolutely loved it. The food there was great--in fact, we decided to eat at the buffet most every night as it was so good. The food at the Tucan was very mediocre except for breakfast. There was little variety in the lunch and dinner buffets--perhaps this would not be an issue if it was good. We were able to be accomodated in the specialty restuarants five of our eight nights. As the hotel was not at capacity, I asked to be put on the \"wait list\" for any available restaurant and time. We enjoyed the tropical, japanese and italian the most--stay away from the mexican. Drinks were very watered down. Nightly entertainment was fair. Shopping at Playa del Carmen was fun. Turns out there is much room for negotiating prices not only in town, but at the resort shop as well (for jewelry). I must say, the staff were wonderful. They are very customer friendly and do what ever is needed to cater to the patrons. The grounds are very well maintained. The various amimals on the premises are quite fasinating to observe. We booked our trip with LIberty Travel. Our transport was with Olympus--they were wonderful. So...if you are going for great beach, great food and drink, perhaps you should go elsewhere.

Initially, I had a lot of doubts about whether to do a destination wedding versus having one locally. I had never been to one nor did I personally know anyone who had attended or been involved in one. But after a month of solid research, I decided to take the leap and chose Iberostar. One of the most important factors that makes Iberostar unique from some of the other 5-6 star resorts is that they have a policy of only holding one wedding a day. That is very important to ensure that you get the ceremony and reception location of your choice, the photographers are not rushed, and that you feel special without seeing 5 other brides walking around in their wedding dresses. I booked my trip through Apple Vacations. Of all the Iberostar resorts, I specifically chose Tucan because: (a) it is a 5 apple versus a 6 apple resort (cheaper) and (b) the fantastic wedding coordinator, Catalina Cortez. (a) if a 5 apple resort is this close to heaven, then a 6 apple resort must be heaven itself! I was impressed as soon as we stepped off the shuttle into the lobby. Beautiful and clean grounds immersed in the jungle, friendly service from the entire staff, delicious food both at the buffets and restaurants, and plenty of things to do at the resort iself. I couple of our guests who had never been to Mexico were hesitant to go but were blown away by this place- they were reluctant to leave and want to go back again. You would be crazy not to love this resort. (b) when deciding among the 5-apple Iberostar resorts, I e-mailed the various wedding coordinators and was most impressed by Catalina Cortez. Most wedding coordinators can take up to a month to reply to an e-mail, which can be unsettling and nervewracking. Catalina always responds in a timely fashion, usually in 24-48 hours. Her e-mails were always reassuring, she would write \"don't worry\", and she would respond to each question thoroughly. She very quickly gained my trust. Originally, my pastor here in Minnesota was planning on performing the ceremony for us, but 3 months before the wedding he encountered some personal family problems that interfered with his travel plans, so I gave Catalina a heads-up about it. About 6 weeks before the wedding, he confirmed that he unfortunately would not be able to make it. No problem, Catalina confirmed the Mexican minister's availability and arranged for him to perform the ceremony instead. He did a lovely job! I never got to actually meet him since he left right after the ceremony and I was distracted, but I really wish I could have- he seemed like a very kind man. He chose very fitting words that were not the typical mundane wedding vows but at the same time had the traditional meaning. Catalina and the minister also accomodated my request to hold the wedding at 3pm rather than at 4pm like they usually do in the winter months. I was so happy to have an extra hour of sunlight for the photography. At the last minute, my parents decided they wanted to sing a song for us in Tamil and have Chris (my husband) and I exchange garlands during part of the ceremony, since it is traditional to exchange garlands in Indian weddings. The morning of the wedding they asked the wedding coordinator's assistant if she could whip up a pair of colorful garlands and indeed she did! And it was no big deal to have my parents sing, even though it included in the wedding rehearsal. Spontaneity is the spice of life! It was Catalina's day off during the day of the rehearsal, but her assistant Ilham was very nice and did a good job. In retrospect, the rehearsal was a tiny bit rushed but that's probably because it was starting to get dark and there's no artificial light in the jungle site. During the wedding, the bridesmaids walked in a little faster than I would have liked, but no big deal. My sister also sang at the wedding, and Ilham was kind enough to let us use the CD player in the wedding coordinator's office the morning of the wedding so that she could practice for an hour. I had also asked Catalina, after we arrived, if it would be possible to purchase some Glorias for our wedding favors- delicious Mexican candies of carmelized goat milk- from the resort itself without having to make a trip to Playa del Carmen since Glorias were seen in both buffets and in the Mexican restaurant. She passed info onto Ilham who had them ready for me the evening before at the rehearsal dinner. Catalina booked two tables for 30 people at one of the buffets so we all got to sit together. We got to chose between the jungle and the beach for our wedding ceremony. Both are beautifully set up- I chose the jungle because it is more private and quiet without people walking in the background in their bikinis, and I love the rich green foliage. We took several wedding pictures on the beach so it was nice to have both backgrounds in our photos. The photographers did a great job. They waved people in the background away so they wouldn't be in the pictures. They took 180 pictures total of us and the wedding party doing several very cute poses (e.g. the groomsmen lifted me up in one picture and the bridesmaids blew kisses at Chris in another). He also took a few pictures of us on the beautiful grounds and in the gorgeous hotel lobby. We bought all 180 pictures, which he gave us a break on, as well as a CD including all of the negatives. The quality of the prints is very good, the colors amazing, and they are all 6x8's, not 4x6's. Pretty cool. I brought CDs of the music I wanted played during the ceremony. One suggestion I might make is to have a friend or family member help the coordinator with which music to play when. This is not absolutely necessary- they knew what they were doing- but I had more than one CD which made things kind of confusing, so I had my brother-in-law be a back up in case they needed help. The wedding dinner was at the open air La Marimba steakhouse restaurant by the swimming pools. They close the pools in the evening to clean them, so it was very quiet and nice. The food was delicious. We had tables reserved for the 48 of us- I assumed there would be other people in the restaurant as well- but to my surprise it was just us! I gave them the wedding favors that morning, as well as silver champagne glasses with our names engraved on them, and they were all beautifully arranged when we arrived. I got to chose the seating chart, but I forgot to make placecards. I didn't even ask them to make them, but to my delight, they had made placecards with our names perfectly typed in cursive and arranged them at the correct seats. The cake was beautifully adorned with flowers and silver sugar beads. One tier was vanilla with strawberry and the other tier was chocolate with strawberry- delicious! There was enough for everybody. After dinner, which was from 6:30 to 8:30, it was off to the discotech! My husband's uncle acted as our MC- he introduced each couple of the wedding party as they walked into the discotech. We had a slideshow which we prepared on a DVD- they had an LCD projector and screen. They played the slideshow with music in the beginning while we all watched it, and while we were dancing they played it over and over again without the music. Well done indeed! We had the typical bouquet and garter toss (for which they thoughtfully provided me a barstool to sit on). The open bar was great. I had brought two CDs of my favorite dance music- I just thought they would be played on a CD player, but the DJ did a great job of blending the songs so that there were no pauses between songs, he was able to mix some songs, take special requests, and he threw in some own songs which I hadn't chosen, but I didn't mind a bit because they were all the great classic American wedding dance songs. The only tiny constructive (key word: constructive) criticisms I would make are it would be nice if the resort had a bridal suite, given that there is almost one wedding a day. We all changed in my room, which was kind of crowded. I also think the rehearsal could have been a little slower/longer. But nothing in life is 100% perfect, and as far as I'm concerned, the wedding was 99% perfect. All in all, it was a day I wish could go on forever, and as cheesy as it sounds, the best day of my life, thanks to Catalina, her assistants, and the Iberostar crew. These guys work their butts off arranging weddings every day, and they do everything in their power to please people and accomodate requests, all for so little recognition. I applaud the Iberostar Tucan and encourage all nervous brides to relax and put their trust in this exceptional resort.

I am in the food business and I'm quite fussy on service so bear that in mind when you read my comments, most of which are good to very good. Rooms. The accomodation and the maid service was excellent. If your room is facing into the centre of the resort you might want to avoid the buildings next to the theatre. We started in building 16 facing away from the resort and moved to building 14 to be near the rest of our group of 12. It could be a bit loud between 10 and 11 pm. Not to mention I still can't get their signature song out of my head. We left a small tip each day (two to three dollars, and we usually got rid of our pesos in this manner) and our requests for specific beverages were accomodated. My wife came back from breakfast each morning eager to see what towel art Marguerita had for her that day. None of our belongings was ever out of place or had been touched as far as we could see. Plenty of space in the room and the day bed was more comfortable than the regular matress. After one week I requested a mattress topper (eggcrate shaped foam pad) and it made a big difference in comfort. Pool They have a very large free form pool, cooler than the ocean but not too cold. It's adult deep at one end with a shallower area to one side and shallows out completely at the beach end. Yes, you will have to get up and be down at the pool or beach by around 7:00 am to get a lounger. Most are taken by around 7:30 and by 8:00am you will be searching. Yes, it if forbidden to save the loungers but everyone does it so just go along to get along. It's just how it is but here is a tip. While we were there the steakhouse (beachfront restaurant on the Quetzal side) was actually open for breakfast at 7:00am not the 10:00 am listed on the information booklet. Perhaps this was because it was the busy holiday season, I don't know. All I can say is that to have breakfast near the ocean, with quiet background music, the sound of the waves, and only a few other people in the restaurant, was a very relaxing way to start the day. The menu is limited compared to the main buffet restaurant but there was plenty to eat and the ambiance more than made up for a limited menu. So get up early, put your towels on the lougers and have a relaxing start to your day at the restaurant by the beach. Beach If you are a beach person (like me) you'll want to read this. If you are a pool person (like my wife) skip it. The beach was disappearing before our eyes. While we were there we lost about 8 palm trees, a couple of palapas, and about 10 feet of beach. The last few days they added additional sand berms in large 40ft x 10ft tubes of tarp material. It was too little too late. They had some berms in place in front of Quetzal when we arrived and the beach on the Quetzal side was completely gone. There was exposed pipe, conduit etc. and broken concrete from the sidewalk had tumbled down to the beach. When we arrived you could still walk directly into the water on the Tucan side. By the time we left they had installed two staircases to get down to the water, about a 10 ft drop. Sand berms now stretch across most of the waterfront to protect the beach they have left. The upshot is that the beach loungers are crammed together on the beach. Based on pictures I've seen from the past, they have lost 1/2 to 2/3 of the beach they used to have. The lack of beach means that more people are competing for loungers at both the beach and pool. Food As I mentioned I'm in the food business. First you need to realize that you are not at home you are in Mexico. If you find the food bland that's because you are used to it coming to you already seasoned and ready to eat. If you look around at the food stations you will see an incredible array of condiments, chilles, salsas etc. You are expected to season your food to your own tastes! The fresh salsa and guacamole were so good I had them at almost every meal. If you see a bowl of what looks like greem chopped onions and guacamole, avoid it at all costs. Its fresh chopped hot chillis. I survived but just barely. The wife had a good laugh though. I found there to be plenty of variety and it was a full week before I couldn't find something completely new at the buffet. I tended to concentrate on the mexican dishes. Take the time to look around, each table has something a bit different. I found the beef there to be substandard but where I live we have very high quality beef. They do the best with their pork which is very good quality (boneless chops, breaded cutlets, pulled pork), with chicken second (chicken mole was always a good bet) and beef a distant third place (the arracheras which we call skirt steak or plate back home was usually extremely tender and tasty, avoid the stews). We went for a group dinner (12 in our family) to the steak house and those that had the rib eye steak were very impressed. Strangely I had the arracheras at the steak house and couldn't chew it. Go figure. They do a variety of shredded or pulled pork, chicken and beef dishes in different sauces for breakfast lunch and dinner. I tried them all and liked them. It's true the food on the buffet is not kept as hot as I'd like it. I think this is because they rely on the heat lamps and not the steam tables to keep the chaffing dishes warm. Perhaps it gets too hot if the steam is kept on, I'm not sure. You can counter this by eating items that are made to order like the omelettes or keep an eye out for fresh items coming out off the broiler and grill. If there are two platters with the same item, the one in the back is fresh and the one out front is getting ready to be replaced. There was always more than enough fresh fruit, juices, pastries, etc. etc. There is a bbq station down by the beach. Their burgers are not pure beef but I think more of a pork/beef mix. Tasty but different. It it's fresh off the grill it will be hot, otherwise it sits on a plate next to the cold veg and condiments, which are not that cold. Don't eat the hot dogs. The ice cream station is at the beach bar. If they have coconut ice cream available, have it in a cup and add a shot of Kahlua. Delicious. All the a la carte restaurants are a bit hit and miss. We are spoiled at home with one of the original Japanese Village restaurants in our town for tepan style dining. The one in mexico doesn't come close and the food is not very japanese. It was all very overcooked except the sushi rice which was half cooked. If you haven't been to a tepan style restaurant give it a try just for the show. The italian was the best. Drinks Yup, they definitely water down the booze. No way I could drink the number of cocktails I had if they didn't. I asked for extra rum and he poured half the glass full. It ended being about equal to a double. You can counter this by asking for a different type of alcohol. I asked for spiced rum (their equivalent to Captain Morgan spiced) and it was full strength. The white rum and the Vodka seemed pretty weak. I'm sure it's a safety measure to keep people from getting carried away and getting blotto. We never saw anyone in that condition while we were at the resort. We avoided the swim up bar because it was small, cold and didn't really look to appealing. Service staff The hardest working people I've ever seen. TIp them because they've earned it. Bring extra one dollar bills for tipping. Many stores will try and give you change in pesos and you will lose on the exchange. The bartenders will get to know what you like so you hardly have to order. Sometimes we had severs bringing drinks to us while lounging around the pool and sometimes not. I didn't notice a pattern. The star friends work hard to make sure you are having a good time. We talked (sorry, my wife talked, I sat back and listened) to many of them and they were all wonderful people from a wide background and from all over the world. They were a big part of our trip and you should take the time to meet them. Diving/snorkling Dressel divers are the company who work at all the Iberostar hotels in the area including the one on the Cozumel side. They do a great job and if you are going to go snorkling or diving, take the time and spend the little extra to go on the day trip to Cozumel. The difference in the quality of dive/snorkle is significant. One of the top ten dives ranked by Couteau is on Cozumel and even the snorkling is outstanding. I've done a lot of diving and Cozumel is worth visiting for the diving alone. There is an Iberostar hotel on Cozumel so you will get food and drink there as part of your day trip and all inclusive. They will give you another wrist band when you get there. Do it! It might be the highlight of your trip, Xel ha. We also went to Xel Ha for two days. One to snorkle and hike around and the second to relax. It was fun but for snorkling it doesn't compare with Cozumel. Some of our group enjoyed swimming with the dolphins but it is extra. Bear in mind that anything you buy at Xel ha is at the higher resort price. Cancun airport I has been expanded since my wife and her mother made a trip here a few years ago. I found the airport to be modern, efficient, clean and well run. Better than the airport at home. Complaints. My biggest complaint? Inconsiderate guests. We were lucky not to have any loud obnoxious guests at our hotel but there were some at the Cozumel Iberostar there for a wedding and we managed to get some on our bus ride to the airport and flight home. As a Canadian it is embarassing to say that the loud American tourist is rapidly being overtaken by the loud Canadian tourist. My heartfelt apologies to those affected. Apparently once they have had enough alcohol, some of my fellow Canadians feel they are so entertaining they simply must delight you with their (very loud) presence. This hotel is well equiped to deal with school aged children. However, can anyone tell me why parents would be so selfish as to travel with one or more infants (not school age kids but babies). Don't get me wrong, our oldest was 20 before we went on a holiday without them. I don't think a long flight, hot and humid weather, dehydration, and exposure to tropical sun is a big joy for most children who are still breast feeding or barely walking and cannot tell you why they are crying or unhappy. There were a LOT of strollers at this hotel. Most of our dinners at the a la cartes and buffets included the crying baby/toddler in the background along with the music. Please don't drag your babies on holiday just because you want to be in Mexico. You're supposed to care for your offspring first and yourself second. It's called parenting.", "Date": "January 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cIf you've been to other Iberostars, you may be slightly disappointed\u201d", "Author": "skyfire75", "ReviewID": "UR12654354", "Content": "I've been to 3 IB resorts and this one is the smallest and of the least quality of the 3 I have been to in my opinion. Having said that, the grounds are still very well kept, the food is okay and the staff is helpful so if you've never been to an IB resort or this is your first all-inclusive vacation, don't let this review deter you from choosing here. It seems that you get what you pay for when it comes to Iberostar resorts however. If you're looking for a top-notch all-inclusive resort, the Iberostar Paraiso Maya is much more beautiful and luxurious. In any case, here is my assessment of the Tucan (which also shares the same grounds as the Quetzal): The rooms: a little outdated and dark. There was only a shower in our room as opposed to other Iberostar rooms I have stayed in that had both a bath and shower. The walls are stucco-style and painted an orangy color which may have made the room darker. But the lighting in the room was inadequate. Beds are hard and pillows are flat but it didn't bother me, I slept fine. I also always had enough water, beer and soda in my mini-fridge. The beach: If you're thinking of spending time on a pristine, sandy tropical beach, this is not the place for you. Nor is the Playacar complex the place for you. At the Tucan, the beach is very small and very crowded due to erosion from Hurrican Wilma 2 years ago. The same goes for most of the Playacar complex. There are places where there is no more sand, just a cliff into the ocean. The beaches are also scattered with giant 10 foot sand bags, I imagine to catch the sand and put it back on the beach. However, it will be a very long time before the Playacar beaches recover from the hurrican damage. The food: It's an all-inclusive so don't expect gourmet meals. But the food is okay. And it does seem to get repetitive after a while. The salsa is outstanding though. Also, the whole resort uses filtered water so you won't be drinking anything from the tap. Do a specialty restaurant too, the steak house is better than average. Other points worthy of mentioning: The service was good. Plan on doing at least one excursion if you stay here because you can't really walk around and explore this resort because it's really not that big. I'm not sure what other Iberostars you are allowed to go to but I don't believe there are many others in close proximity. All in all, don't expect a five star resort or beach and you'll have a good time here. If you do, then pay a little extra and go to the Iberostar Paraiso complex (I stayed at the Paraiso Maya).", "Date": "January 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cDon't book this season!\u201d", "Author": "yg28", "ReviewID": "UR12615121", "Content": "I hate to submit poor review for this beautiful place but there is a huge problem with Tucan/Quetzal which will ruin your vacation for next 2-3 months (I am writing this Jan 14 2008).

Room- nice size, clean and tea-coffee and mini-bar all well maintained. Food- lots of it and normally pretty good quality, but not much variety, speciality restaurants a bit of a waste of time to be honest as they seemed to be a small extension of the buffet.

POSITIVES: -the grounds are imaculate, well maintained -people, of all ages from all over the world, we have 3 teenagers, they had no problem finding people there own ages -walking through the jungle and seeing all kinds of animals (especially the monkeys) was a treat each day -staff was super friendly, funny and went out of there way to make your stay enjoyable -the shows at night were entertaining (don't expect broadway or Vegas quality), but they were something to look forward to after you gorge yourself at dinner, sit relax and have a drink, they were enjoyable and you will always see your favorite staff person in these shows -the maid staff was friendly and yes tip them for extra service (ie. more water, beer, towel art, curtain art) -Drinks, were good, I drank mostly beer but the other people we were with had mixed drinks and said they were good, try the \"riviera maya\" colorful and tasty. -rooms were fine, clean, large shower, yes they could use dressers, but overall they were good qualirty rooms after all you're only in your room to shower and sleep -food quality was good, the buffet had plenty of variety and the specialty reatarants were good espically the Japenese. -weather, not bad for Jan. it was partly sunny most of the time temps between 75 and 85 deg F, showers every now and then, the ocean water was warm and the pool was a litlle chilly but hey, this is January. NEGATIVES: NOW for the one big negative (no fault of the resort), the beach is disapearing, they have a huge beach erosion problem (as do most of the resorts in this area) and most of the beach is gone. I felt sorry for the resort because like us, most people chose the resort for the beach. Palm trees and palapas were falling into the ocean daily and there is literally a cliff of sand you have to jump off of to get onto the beach, and once on the beach you have to be carefull not to dive into the ocean and hit a huge piece of concrete from the palapa bases that have fallen in or one of the palm tree trunks. we spoke to some of the resort people about this and they are trying to resolve this problem by putting huge sand bags out into the ocean (which you can see and is an eyesore). The beach was a big disapointment so if that's what you want, check before you go to see status on that. one other comment, not a negative but beware,was the scuba diving excursion. I signed up my sons for the resort certification (1 day class instruction and scuba and training in the pool $150.00 per person) this also included two dives along the beach some where, but we were told the best place to dive would be Cozumel so we said let's do it, they said that would be an extra $91.00 per person. The diving over at cozumel was great, however it is a long day (we left the resort at 8:30am and got back at 7:30pm, the actual scuba time in the water on two reefs at abut 40 min. each so you spend a majority of the day traveling ). Overall the positves far outweigh the negatives. We had a great time and wish we were still there!!!! You will love the hospitality the atmosphere, the sun, the drinks, and meeting people from all parts of the world. Have fun and enjoy your vacation time you deserve it.

We were there from Jan 2-8. We had a group of 15 (ages 7 to 63) and we all had a great time. The grounds are beautiful and very well maintained, the hotel rooms comfortable, and the service was wonderful. We saw monkeys, tucans, flamingos, peacocks and Iguanas and several other animals everyday on the paths thru the jungle area. Beach: Unfortunately, the beach has experienced a good deal of erosion. That didn't stop us from having a great time at the beach. We still had plenty of room and I never got up any earlier than 8:00 and we still got 9 chairs together every day on the beach and in the sun. The red flag was up because of the high winds and waves but there was still a lot of people in the water. Our kids loved the waves so they could use the boogey boards. The little kids stayed around the pool and they always got chairs. - There is a pretty good drop to the beach (about 5 1/2 ft) but there were areas that everyone used to get down and they became a pathway to get down, It wasn't impossible to walk on the beach, we walked all the way up North of the resort past the RIU's and they have the same problems. If you go South there is plenty of beach in front of the Sandos and then there isn't any resorts past that so the beach is wide open. We played in front of the Sandos and no one ever said anything. They have had many beach huts damaged and turned upside down and many beautiful palm trees were uprooted but there wasn't one day that they weren't out there trying to save them. They were placing new sandbags in front of the Quetzel the day we left. Restaurants - We ate at the Japanese and Italian Restaurants and they were great. I emailed the hotel in advance to ask for certain rooms and when I told them we had 15 in our group we were allowed to make advance reservations at 2 Restaurants since we were staying 6 nights. Rooms: Very nice and roomy. Beds are on the hard side but asked for egg crates when we checked in and that helped a little. They decorate the room every morning with towel art and flower petals. Shows- Everyone enjoyed the evening shows. It would be nice if they were a little earlier. The teens enjoyed the Disco, it usually doesn't get going until 11:30pm. The star friends worked the crowd all day long. We would see them at breakfast, all day around the pool area, at the shows and then see them at the Disco at 11:30, they work long days. The staff there work very hard and are always friendly they try to help in any way possible. We had a wonderful time and would definately recommend this to other family groups. Only problem was - When checking into your room be sure to check and make sure everything works, we had a little problem with a TV control that was broken when we got into the room and we never said anything because the kids used the keyboard to change the channels, but when we went to check out they were going to charge us for it, saying we had broke it since we didn't report it broken. So just check things over and when something doesn't work be sure to report it. Day trips - If you are wanting to zip line, bike, and swim in cenote go to Selvatica just South of the airport. It was one of the best day trips we have taken. The workers there were extremely friendly and helpful and made the day so much fun. Everyone in our group participated and loved it. They pick you up at the hotel and feed you a light lunch. We would definately go back to Selvatica. Also went to Cozmel and visited the Iberostar over there. Taxi for 6 of us was $37.00 each way.

It's understandable you get upset when you plan for the beach and it's gone but this is not a hotel's fault! The food was nothing we could complain about either. I am glad when I don't have to cook or run out to get something for the family. The variety was the best we have had at an AI. The guys could and did eat some type of shrimp every night. We ate at the Japanese, Mexican, Tropical and Italian. Do the steakhouse instead of the Mexican. It was good but the buffet had tasty Mexican and we raise beef so we were trying something besides steak. Many commented on the steakhouse. No complaints on the food but food wasn't our priorty for our vacation. Drinks are drinks. Ask for better or more and they take care of it.

Overall the hotel was beautiful in a down-to earth way. It was just the right size-- not too big-- witha convenient easy lay out with beautiiful paths with natural beauty-- landscaped like a jungle with lots of birds, monkeys and other interesting local creatures running by. Rooms--I thought the rooms were terrific-- big enough for a party of four (and my two daughters, 18 and 16 don't share beds. There is a built in \"wall couch\" for someone to sellp on and they brough us a comfortable, extra bed (which was better than a cot). I read that the beds were hard but I thought they were fine. We asked for and received Building 13, thurd floor on the inside (like the reviewers suggested for less noise, more privacy and well located and it was exactly right). That bldg is right near the pool and close enough to the restaurants. The only negative is that when we first opened the door to the room, it smelled a little musty but we didn't notice the smell after a few minutes. I was concerned that the room may smell like smoke because the non-smoking bldgs were not as well-located but this was not a concern at all. Pool/Beach-- this was the biggest disappointment and if you are going soon, you may want to ask about this. The pool is beautiful. The beach had a great deal of damage while we were there-- there were terrible wind storms with think clouds and there was 10 feet of beach that fell into the sea each day we were there. It was impossible to walk on the beach, you couldn't get down to the water without a steep climb, many beach huts were damaged and turned upside down and many beautiful palm trees were uprooted. The beach became half the size while we were there so there weren't many places to sit (in fact if you didn't have a towel on a chair by 7:30 AM, you ran the risk of not having a place to lay.). It really happened before our eyes-- people who were there the prior week said it was not as damaged even though damage had started. The best area remaining was towards the right (when you faced the water) by the Sandos but even that was getting bad. There were two weddings there on the beach-- I felt bad for them since the beach was cowded and not pretty at all. Restaurants: Steakhouse and Japanese were by fat the best. We also tried the Mexican (appetizers were fun) but overall the food was a little dried out and we also tried the tropical (which was average) but they all are much better than the buffet (although we went to the buffet for dessert because it had a better selection. Evewn if you can't get the reservations you want, we found that we just showed up at the restaurants around 7:30 or 8 PM and they were willing to help us most nights even though they were supposedly full. Breakfast buffets were delicious-- lots of choices and the main buffet made personal omelets. Lunches were less attractive to me because it seemed like there were a lot of recycled foods leftover from dinner and I thought the burgers and hot digs were terrible and there weren't a lot of healthy options or foods that weren't hot foods (which isn;t my favorite during the days). I usually ate a bigger breakfast, a small snack at lunch (plus I always went to the ice cream bar near the beach bar in the afternoon) and I saved my appetite for dinner. Shows: Varied in quality but were overall entertaining. They are allll at 9:30 so plan dinner acordingly because there isn't much else to do in the evenings. Overall if the weather was better and the beach wasn't destroyed, we would have had a fabulous trip. The staff there work very hard and try to help in any way possible.

The resort is beautifully landscaped - the jungle with its monkeys, tucans, flamingos, and peacocks is just something you don't see everyday! The place was clean and well maintained. The staff was friendly and eager to please. We did some tipping but did not see others doing so. We felt welcomed and cared for. We thought the food was great!

We had great expectations for the Mexican restrauant...but it was disappointing. The entertainment started too late for us-what we did see recieved \"A\" for effort. The band was excellant. Yes, some of the beach is eroding but there was still plenty to come by. The main problem is by the dive shop. We were able to use a sailboat 3 times that week. Free! The snorkling expedition from the resort was also good. We preferred the half day options which was less expensive and still allowed for time at the resort. No problems with bugs, ants. Our refrigerator was stocked and room cleaned. We slept fine. I had read the beds were rock hard but we were comfortable. We never even used the pool. Even though people saved chairs with their towels, we still were able to find places to sit. We preferred to be by the ocean. The Apple reps couldn't have been nicer. We booked two tours through them. One to Tulum, the other to a national park for snorkeling. We enjoyed the snorkeling but were not impressed with the Morning Glory group they contracted with.

We enjoyed sailing (reserve early in the morning), tennis (reserve the day ahead) and ceramics painting. The pool is huge and pretty. The resort is small enough to get around easily without too much walking. We were lucky enough to have two rooms in building 12 which was perfect - close to pool and beach. Rooms are a nice size and shower was great. Clientele was a mixture of nationalities which made for interesting people-watching. Location is close enough to walk into Playa del Carmen in about 20 minutes for shopping. Not as good: Beds are very hard and none of us slept well. Food was pretty mediocre in both the buffet and specialty restaurants, although there is plenty of choice. They did have a nice New Year's Eve buffet and party.

When researching this resort, we found it helpful when the reviews were broken down into topics. So, we thought we would do the same... CHECK-IN: Prior to our stay we had requested a room near the beach/pool. The room we had wanted was unavailable upon check-in, but the staff was extremely accomodating and allowed us to switch to a wonderful room after 2 nights. It was well worth the wait because it appeared to be the best location on the property without being in the beach front suites. ROOMS: First room was in bldg 15. It had a king size bed which was hard but not as uncomfortable as we had expected based on past reviews. The room also has a good size sofa type piece of furniture. The balcony was great, the bathroom was clean, there was a stand up shower. Fridge was stocked with sodas and bottled water. The tv didnt offer much in English (but who is there to watch tv). We didnt see any bugs in the room, however, we did see some people walking around with huge red welts on their legs (bugbites). The room was cleaned well. Our second room was in bldg 11. We were lucky enough to get the room on the corner, facing inside, 3rd floor. Our view was of the beach and pool. We would recommend trying to get this room. The set up was very similar to our first room except this room had 2 full size beds. It was always fun to come back to the room and see the towel animals left on our bed. The maid also left flower petals on the bed each night which was a nice touch. If you can make a request for a bldg before you go, our recommendations are: bldg 11,12 or 13 (on tucan side). FOOD: There are 5 a la carte restaurants and a buffet. *Buffet: great omelets, not many healthy choices other than fruit. Lots of fried choices. *Japanese: Our favorite for food, hibachi style *Steakhouse: Delicious! a close second choice. highly recomended. *Italian: Not typical Italian so make sure you ask for a FULL description of what you are ordering. It was a good meal but not the best. *Mexican: We were not impressed. We thought since we were in Mexico it would be amazing. This was not the case. *Tropical: We did not try this restaurant becasue the menu choices seemed a little strange for our taste. Lunch choices: 2 buffet lunches daily by the beach. Lots of fried food but also lots of fruit. Main Buffet closer to the reception on the Quetzal side is open for lunch each day. More choices but still a lot of fried foods. Room Service: Tried this out once just because its included. Definitely not worth it. ***There was an ice cream stand by the beach which we tried every day. very good. Neither of us got sick from the food or water. The resort had purified water in everything they serve except for the shower and sink water. To be on the safe side we brushed our teeth with bottled water. DRINKS: Make sure to ask for top shelf liquor. Try the Dirty Monkey. Its great having drinks included, gives you a chance to try drinks you normally wouldnt try. We expected watered down drinks but our bartenders treated us well and we never had a problem with this. There are 2 lobby bars in addition to the bar in the theater for drinking at night. BEACH: The beach is gorgeous, water wasnt too rough and the sand is soft. There arent too many waitresses on the beach to bring you drinks. There are plenty of chairs on the beach. We discovered the trick of dragging cushions from the pool chairs down to the beach to make it more comfortable. People are outside very early in the morning claiming their spot with towels. We chose to sit on the beach where this wasnt as much a problem. The pool area though is a different story. POOLS: Swim up bar is not what you would expect. It is a separate pool hidden away from all the action. We found there to be rowdy and obnoxious drunks spending the entire day there and making towers with the bar stools. This was not exactly inviting. The main pool is huge. Our one complaint with it is the \"hot tub\" in the center which you have to swim to. It is only about 5 degrees warmer than the main pool. Ther e is also a kids pool and a sports pool. DAYTIME ACTIVITIES: My boyfriend spent part of the day going between games of beach volleyball (which he was impressed by the court and the other visitors playing) water polo, water basketball, bocci, ping-pong and water volleyball. This was great as he gets fidgity laying around. I was able to lay out when he was off playing the games. We also noticed but did not participate in ceramics, Bingo game, aerobics and some beach olympics. The entertainment staff was very enthusiastic and was always doing their best to involve everyone in activities. There is also a tennis court which we didnt get a chance to use but would have liked to. NIGHTIME ACTIVITIES: We tried to go to the nightclub one night but found about 4 people sitting in there. Each night there was a show put on by the entertainement staff. A lot of the shows were pretty good with a few being a bit cheezy. We always had a goodtime though and it was nice to have something provided for us each night. we found out that they run their shows on a 2 week schedule. So stay any longer than 2 weeks and the shows will start to repeat themselves. Other than the shows there wasnt too much going on at night unless you hung out in the lobby bars which was fun and the bartender was great. RESORT GROUNDS: GORGEOUS! You really feel like you are in paradise. There are animals everywhere. You have to walk through the jungle to get places so each day we got to see monkeys, peacocks, turtles, lizards, some rat type looking thing, flamingos and lots of birds. On the Quetzal side there is a waterfall near the buffet. FITNESS CENTER: The gym has slightly outdated equipment but has enough for a decent workout. EXCURSIONS: We did not go on any excursions since we had such a great timeeach day at the resort. We did go one night to 5th Avenue. This area has tons of shops selling different items. Some stuff is pretty Americanized but there are also lots of little shops where you can bargain with the owners. We also saw a lot of cute and trendy looking bars and restaurants. GUESTS: Being American, we felt like the minority. The majority of guests are European. We had no problem with this, but just something to keep in mind.

It helps that everything comes in at least four languages. The rooms were slightly nicer than most hotel rooms, with luxurious balconies which we found ourselves using almost every day. The organization of the resort in terms of beach towels, restaurant reservations and whatnot was a bit confusing at first, but made sense in general. The location of the resort was incredible, though the very left side of the beach in under construction from a previous hurricane. Regardless, the most beautiful water I have ever seen in my life: perfect temperature, even in December. The bad: the food was not the most amazing. Due to buffet style, some of the food did not seem to be very cared for or very fresh. The restaurants were hit or miss, However, some of my party really enjoyed some of the food I could not stand. Also, the chain-smoking Europeans feel it is only necessary they chain smoke since everything is open and outside, but this is avoidable with some effort. The good: the StarFriends were the best 24-7 resort amenities I could ever ask for. They seemed to offer something for everyone: Lucy's Miniclub and a show each night for the kids, sexy young latin things to flatter the older folks with dances, and ridiculous nights at the discotheque for in between. The pool games were fun to play and watch and every single one I encountered made an attempt to make sure I was having fun. In addition to this, all the staff was very, very friendly and courteous and genuinely nice. Advice: Don't waste money buying snorkel equipment, you can rent it for free here. Do bring lots of singles to tip, as everyone is very good at their jobs! Don't forget to check the average temperatures, I found the weather extremely pleasant but older folks or kids are much more sensitive to the changing weather. I rate this resort as 9.5 out of 10!

That's a definite plus. The staff at the lobby takes care of all the luggage and you can enjoy a walk to your hotel through a beatiful recreation of jungle, complete with wild animals roaming back and worth. This is another plus. Buildings 11, 12 and 13 are the best locations in my view - because they are the closest to the pool and the sea, and furthest away from the disco and the central stage where music and shows take place nighly, and can be pretty loud. The Beach was great. Although many times in the morning by the time we'd get to the beach, all the beds were already taken, and what was even more annoying they were no actual people but rather towels and other personal things. BY the end of our stay, management distributed letters indicating that reserving sunbeds is not allowed, and personal items will be removed, but next morning it happened again. While there may be no seats under the palm trees, you can always rent an umbrella in the same place where you get towels, and put it at any place on the beach. Food was average and less variety than at Acumal. But afterall you don't come there to eat, right? :) The a la carte restaurants we loved were Mexican, Steak and arguably Japanese, just because of uniqueness. Our friends also liked Italian, but we didn't go there. Carribean was not special at all. Entertainment - great entertainment team. Great shows (most of them). You can easily skip tutti frutti and mexican pop shows, but the others were quite good, especially the Hollywood.

Just returned from the Iberostar Toucan. Loved it as much, if not more, than the last time we were there, 7 years ago. Liked it so much would like our daughter to be married there. 2. That said, here are some points to consider, some which refute what others have recently written. 3. If bed is too firm for you, fine for my husband, too hard for me, ask for a topper. It\u2019s egg crate type and I slept like a baby after getting it. Call housekeeping and request one. 4. Beach is sufficient size. However they are having a problem to the left side as you face the water in the area where they give out sailboats and kayaks. The problem is due to the artificial piers hotels to the north have erected. Therefore currents have been disturbed. Iberostar management told me they are working on correcting the problem and it should be solved soon. They know this is an important issue. 5. Food. We never had a problem. The buffet has so many choices, I discovered some I never considered. Wait staff will bring you juice, coffee, any beverage. I requested iced coffee and cold milk every morning because there was no ice at self serve coffee station. 6. Loved the Steakhouse (wonderful fish choices, giant shrimp or chicken on menu also), the Japanese Teppanyaki (cook food in front of you) with their sushi appetizer. If you select all the offerings, shrimp, chicken and beef, you get a huge plate. They don\u2019t decrease the portion, but increase it by 2 or three, whatever you choose. Also loved the Tropical, especially the salad and hor d\u2019oeuvre appetizers which you can select yourself. 7. If you stay at least 7 nights you are entitled to reservations at 3 specialty restaurants. You can also sign up on a last minute cancellation list. Check with customer service after 4 or even go to the restaurant 10 minutes after your cancellation list time to see if they can take you. 8. Those who complained of mosquitoes went during the rainy season, May to October, when one should expect mosquitoes. 9. As for upset stomachs, I have a delicate one, and did not get sick. Drank the water, ate the salads and used the ice in the resort and outside. Cancun and Riviera Maya were built with modern water systems not subject to outside infection from sewage contamination. 10. Did not encounter any more rudeness than anywhere else in the world. Met some fascinating people and had great conversations. Yes, there is more smoking than we are used to in the states, but we were outside most of the time and could easily move away from the smoke during lunch in the outdoor palapa roofed buffet restaurants by the beach. There is no smoking in the specialty restaurants and no smoking areas designated in the big buffets. 11. The rat/squirrels someone on this site referred to is a cuatimundi, a cute little animal, not a rat. 12. If the drink was weak, specify what you want and how much. You\u2019ll get it. 13. Yes, chairs are reserved with towels and a book or something placed on them as early as 7:30 a.m. Then one goes to breakfast, etc and returns. This happens on cruise ships and all resorts as well, even if the hotel has a policy against it. 14. The weather was delicious Dec 11-19 with some clouds, welcome relief from the sun and some brief rain some days because of a severe rainstorm that flooded Dominican Republic. Rain never stopped us from enjoying the myriad offerings of entertainment from roof covered table tennis to billiards to shopping to everything one could do under a roof there and in private. 15. There is no way to please everyone. Even with some complaining, almost all of the reviewers rate this place a 4 or better. It\u2019s also a great value. That\u2019s why people come from all over the world. 16.

The weather was nice, upper 80\u2019s during the day and low 70\u2019s during the night. Pretty humid though. It rained most of the days but only for an hour or so. Lots of Russians, I would say at least 70%. The beds were fine. They are not rock hard as I read in other reviews. They may be harder than what we're used to but it's not bad at all. There are good and bad things: The good. The premises are beautiful. Especially the jungle, which separates the Tucan and Quetzal parts of the resort. While walking through the jungle, you can meet all sorts of animals \u2013 monkeys, peacocks, rat/squirrel type animals, iguanas, etc. There are flamingoes by the Quetzal side. The resort is 3 stories high with lots of vegetation, making it very cozy. The pool is big. Ping pong tables. Playground for kids. Aerobics in the water. Spa service, which is pretty expensive, I can get the same massage cheaper where we live. Beach volleyball. Dance club. Half of the beach is nice, the other half was destroyed by the hurricane a couple of years ago. The nice beach is by the Sandos Playacar resort, that\u2019s right next to the Iberostar Tucan. The bad. The food is not good. Out of 15-20 dishes maybe 2 would be good. We\u2019re not spoiled, never stayed in a 5 star hotels, so it\u2019s not like we are being picky. Restaurant food is better but nothing special and you get a choice of 3 restaurants per stay. I heard that the food in Dominican Republic was better. We liked the Mexican restaurant the best. The Japanese one wasn\u2019t worth it. The Tropical one was good also. The alcoholic drinks are better in the restaurants than the ones you get during the day. And of course, don\u2019t drink the water. Met a lot of people who got really sick during the first days from drinking Mexican water and the water is being served everywhere. The service is OK. Nothing special. We didn\u2019t get any special treatment. Most of the time we had a feeling that nobody has a clue of what we are talking about. I was asking if they add water to the juice and the answer I got was \u201cHow many glasses?\u201d. I am thankfull that nothing bad happened and we didn\u2019t have to deal with the language barrier. The smokers! They are everywhere. No offense, but for those people who don\u2019t smoke, like us, it was very unpleasant experience. The only place where there was no smoke, was our room and the buffet with non-smoking area. There would be occasional smokers in the non-smoking area but in that case we would just move. It really bothered us, the people were smoking even by the kiddie pool area where small kids were playing. The hotel is a child hazard! The room floors and most of the paths are made out of the marble or some other kind of stone which is glazed, so god forbid you have wet feet, will go flying. Our 1 year old son fell several times on the floor, it was pretty bad. Even the daycare premises had the slippery floor and the daycare place is right by the pool. We would put towels all over the hotel floor so that nobody falls. So watch out! The resort grounds are lighted very poorly when it\u2019s dark. The entertainment is not good. We\u2019ve seen 3 shows and all of them were crappy. We missed the Mexican dance night, which I really wanted to see, so can\u2019t tell if it was good or not. We probably wouldn\u2019t go back here again, we would go to some new hotel that just opened and doing their best job to attract people.", "Date": "December 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rochester, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cVery relaxing!\u201d", "Author": "00Vette", "ReviewID": "UR11710675", "Content": "The Iberostar Tucan & Quetzel was a terrific place to unwind and enjoy the lovely Mexican hospitality and weather. The pool was huge & there seemed to be enough poolside chairs to go around, even though we staked out our favorites early every morning! The resort was one of the few along the immediate coast that still has a beach, as the nearby RIU's beaches were lost in two previous hurricanes. The restaurants were on par with other all inclusive resorts we haved stayed at in previous years. Our favorites were the Italian, Japanese and seafood, in that order. The Star friends were a group of genuinely nice folks that truly became friends within the week we were there. They were persistent in trying to get us involved in the many events, but we LOVED just being lazy. They tried extremely hard to be entertaining. We will miss Nancy in the buffet restaurant and Samuel at the main bar. Ricardo is our Star friend with whom we swapped Formula One and racing stories. The city of Playa Del Carmen has \"grown up\" since the last time we visited 5 years ago, but remains peaceful and welcoming. (There's a Starbucks now, but it looked like the T.G.I.Fridays is gone.) The main street takes longer to walk down now, as it extends quite a bit further than back in 2002. For a fun time/place for sports, visit La Taberna, one block off of the main drag. We watched American & Mexican football there & the chicken fingers were excellent. We also took the time to visit the Walmart but found it to be not that great a place for inexpensive souvenirs, as the one in Puerto Vallarta.

For the life of me I can not understand how people could rate this place as \"excellent\". This is our 5th stay with Iberostar (stayed at IB Bavaro, Maya, Lindo, and Cozumel before), so obviously we do like the chain. This place was kind of an exception. Two major problems we had: the beach and the service. The beach is really not great--extremely congested, fairly small for the resort of this size and we thought was very dirty--broken glass, all kinds of debris and garbage (largely the fault of guests, but still...) Previous reviewers stated that beach is the nicest in Play del Carmen--this is probably comparing it to Riu that has no beach because of erosion! Even Sandos next door had by far nicer beach--much wider and cleaned constantly throughout the day. Palapas are impossible to get after 05:30 AM. During our stay the beach on Quetzal side underwent severe erosion and my prediction is by next fall or so the beach will be half its size unless they do something major to protect it. The service at the resort highly varied , in some instances it was non existent. Most of the times in the buffets we had to get our own drinks--waiters never even came up to us offering drinks--this has never happened to us at any of the Iberostars. We encountered the same rude person Francisco at the check in whom somebody else had mentioned befor--he checked us in total silence: no hi, no welcome--just did some typing and gave us the room keys. Could never really figure out hours of operations of the beachside bar/ice cream stand--went there at 15:00 one day to get ice cream for my 2 year old just to hear rude:\"ice cream closed, come back tomorrow!\" That really ticked me off--what kind of person would look at 2 year old kid and tell him that, considering that ice cream box was right there and it takes a second to give kid a scoop! Just an example, but rude behavior on the part of staff happened plenty of times while we were there. For our second week of stay we have upgraded to the ocean front suite (building #20) on the Quetzal side. Was totally worth it for me since we had an incredible view of the sea and since we had to stay in the room while baby napped it was perfect--we could sit on the balcony and just absorb the beauty of the sea! Room wise there was not much difference between suite and a regular room--they are almost the same size. We did not have a jacuzzi either--maybe not all suites do. We were on the 2nd floor, but all 3 floors on Quetzal side have great views. Tucan side is a different story--I think view on the 1st and 2nd floor would be somewhat obstructed by palapas/palm trees, plus you have people playing volleyball right there.

The construction of the resort next door was far enough away not to be a bother, hopefully its all done now. I totally agree with the previous reviews regarding great service, cleanliness, the rooms, and just how beautiful the resort is. The animals were amazing! We saw agouti, turtles, tucans, flamingos, iguanas, peacocks, guinea fowl, chickens (with complimentary 5 am wake up calls!), assorted other birds, and the infamous howler monkeys. If you don't spot them right away - you'll probably at least hear them - the males make a sound which can only be described like a loud burp. We even saw a couple of babies. One morning, I drank my coffee on our balcony watching them in the treetops (which was about level with the balcony). Be warned - they are wild - we had run back in our room a few times b/c the monkeys decided they wanted to get a closer look at us and jumped on our balcony! what fun! The food was better than expected...no complaints with breakfast & lunch at the main dining or poolside restaurants. Good variety for both. Same for dinner (at the main dining room). We tried a lot of stuff & liked most of it. We even ate cheeseburgers (that were surprising good). We tried the japanese & steakhouse restaurants which were good. We tried the mexican & agree it was not good. Take a trip to town ($5 cab ride)& try the street vender tacos (4 tacos, 2 sodas - $5.60 US) they are much tastier. The drinks at the resort were good (you have to ask for top shelf) & the draft beer was XX. The best bartender is rafael at the lobby bar. I definitely recommend bringing some $ for tipping. These folks work very hard for you! A few tips - be sure to put a towel or something on the pool or beach chairs by about 8 am. Its slim pickings by 10 am. If you go to town be sure to try El Alhambra restaurant (off 5th ave). it was delicious! The tequila is also cheaper at walmart ($5 cab ride) Sorry this review is quite long - but there is so much to say! Its not a 5 star resort, but we found it better than taking a cruise. Our only complaints were with Apple Vacations. We paid for a private transfer - but had a van full of people going to the resort (at least we were the 1st stop). We had a private transfer to the airport (but they also had no record of our departure which was a bit stressful).

Stuff never made us feel uncomfortable. Service was very good. We like good beach. It's hard to say much about the beach because all 5 days we had \"tropical depression\" - a little sun, a lot of clouds and rain, waves and, because of waves and clouds, we did not see calm turquoise water as we like it. But at the last day beach was back to nice caribbean beach and we even snorkeled of the beach and saw wonderfull school of angel fish. I was feeding them bread. Water was almost clear and turquoise blue. But beach may not be there next year. Part of Quetzal beach is disappearing as neighbour Riu beach already completely gone. When snorkel I saw sand bags on a bottom. And I really prefer coral... There is a deserted beach on a right side of the Tucan, passed Sands, but a lot of trush, not a noce walk unless you are walking just on the water edge and not looking on a beach. For me personally it is not a quality beach I can consider to come back. We took 2 wonderfull excursions. One - snorkel to Cozumel (almost the whole day, about $95 per person. We loved it. We went with Dressel divers (activity center at the hotel, Quetzal side by the beach) by small (about 15 people) group, part was snorkelers, part - divers. We took fairy to Cozumel (nice ride!), then about 40 min by small boat to Iberostar Cozumel, where people got equipment, ate and drink and the same boat took us to 3 different places on American barrier reef. it was amazing. It was deep, we saw a wall and a reef, water was extremely clear even with the waves. We saw tons of fish, rays, turtes and corals. We liked Iberostar Cozumel a lot. So we got to visit other hotel which may will be our next destination. We took Aquitic tour to cenote, caves and Yal-Ku lagoon ( we also swam to the reef where we saw huge rays and I was swimming with turtle so close so I could touch it...

There are still construction going on on Sands, now it's by building 16-17. We went to Playa del Carmen twice and enjoyed it. We ate at Tropical, Italian and Steak house. We liked food at Italian (I had grilled salmon and my husband - lamb chops) and at Steak house (my fillet was the best) Buffet was ok, sometimes excellent, I missed papaya... But food variety is much less that it was at Iberostars even year ago, probably because of the dollar value... I like to explore new places, this one was good, but I will go new place next time.

We booked through Apple Vacations. We took Frontier Airlines out of Chicago Midway. Flight was fine. FYI (we don\u2019t travel much and didn\u2019t know this) you are not allowed to bring food into Mexico that is not in its originally packaging. We had packed some snacks (that had been opened) and had to throw it out. Here\u2019s my rundown of the Iberostar Tucan. Transport to Resort: Apple Vacations was great but the transport was super long (to no fault of the resort). We flew into Cancun around 11:30am and did not make it to Tucan until 3:00 pm. We sat on a bus at the airport for about 40 minutes and then took about a 2 hour ride down, dropping people off along the way. I knew it would take a little longer and that we would drop people off but it got to be a little too long. Check In: No problem. We thought we would get drinks upon arrival but we didn\u2019t. No big deal though. We were just glad to be off the busJ Room: Great. A week earlier we requested a room in building 12 overlooking the pool and that\u2019s just what we got. It was very clean and Mario did a great job everyday keeping it clean. There was a new towel creature everyday and he kept it stocked with pop, water, and beer. There are some tv channels in English. You get some news stations and some movie channels. The temperature was fine. We usually kept the sliding door open for fresh air. Grounds: Absolutely beautiful. They were well groomed, clean, and fun to walk around in. We enjoyed taking a little time each day walking the grounds and looking for the monkeys. Staff: Great!! Helpful, friendly, and hardworking. Food/Drinks: Pretty good in our opinion-but we aren\u2019t hard to please. The buffet had a wide variety and they seemed to change it up a little each day. Breakfast was my favorite buffet meal. The made-to- order omelets were my favorite. For a la carte we went to the Steakhouse and Mexican-also pretty good. My husband didn\u2019t care for the Mexican that much but I liked it. Drinks were very good. Just ask for the good liquor because they do have it. No problems getting reservations. Beach/Pool: The weather was perfect all week so we sat on the beach most of the week with a few swims in the pool. The beach was wonderful. You do have to get down there pretty early for chairs in the shade. It wasn\u2019t a problem for us as I get up early (around 8:00am) and enjoyed going down while it was still quiet. I was amazed (and somewhat annoyed) at the lengths people go to to reserve their chairs though. The beach was definitely one of the nicest along the shore. We enjoyed walking down on the undeveloped part just down the beach a little ways. My husband was not impressed with the swimup bar. It didn\u2019t bother us much because we mostly stayed on the beach, but it was in a small shallow pool and was always busy. Activities: Our idea of activity on this vacation was getting up from our lounger and getting drink at the bar or an ice cream cone so I don\u2019t have a lot to report. We did go snorkeling one afternoon. We booked it on the beach through the resort. At 3:00 pm they took us in a boat from the beach and went about 10 minutes down the shore to a reef. We were back by about 5:00. It was perfect for us because it didn\u2019t take up a whole day. We also went to Playa Del Carmen for shopping. We enjoyed this as well. Just a short taxi ride into town for $5. There is also a little shopping area within walking distance from the resort (Playacar?). We like the fact that it felt very safe to walk outside the walls of the resort. Check Out: Very smooth. Now our situation was that our flight didn\u2019t leave from Cancun until 8:00 pm. We had to check out at noon but they had a locked room available for our luggage and we were able to enjoy the resort until we had to leave. They also have 2 hospitality rooms with showers. We got to the shower rooms a little early, and we\u2019re glad we did, because it got very busy the closer it got to the departure time. Overall we had an absolutely fantastic vacation and would go back to the Iberostar Tucan in a heartbeat. I would highly recommend this resort for anyone.", "Date": "December 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Vacation\u201d", "Author": "vacationnutMichigan", "ReviewID": "UR11505422", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Iberostar Tucan the week of 11-28-07 thru the 5th of Dec.

As all the other guest were waiting to board the bus my husband and I were well on our way to the resort. Check in was great fast and easy and our room well very nice. I loved the marble floors and the shower was big for two. The beach and water awesome plenty of chairs to go around never had any trouble finding a place to lay. The pool was very nice too, but we enjoyed the beach better because of the nice breeze off the sea kept us a little cooler than those around the pool. The food was good never went hungary and if you do it is your own fault. The snorkeling however was very disappointing we took TWO excursions and both snorkeling adventures was a big disappointment. Saw very few fish. Our guide of course after paying for these excursions tells us that it's not so good right now because of the hurricane. I wished the Apple reps would in form people of this.

The grounds of the Iberostar are very nice. Lush jungle with paths through it from the lobby to the beach. On these paths you will monkeys, peacocks, and lots of critters. The rooms at this hotel are a bit dated. The rooms are good sized with a balcony. The bathrooms are nice. There are problems with small ants in rooms so don't leave any food out or around because it will be infested with ants. The pool and the ocean are very beautiful. There is a lot of choice to where you want to spend your time. However, if you want a pool chair or hut on the beach be prepared to get up by 8am or there won't be much left to choose from. Also, they have really nice cabanna by the pool, however you will have to get up with the sunrise in order to score one of those. One negative that I found was that the swimup bar is a totally seperate pool, so you actually had to get out of the main pool and walk to get to the swim up bar, which kind of defeats the purpose of a swimup bar. The food was ok to good. The buffets and snack areas had pretty much the same things everyday which got kind of old by the end of the trip. There is a lot of selection. The al la carte resturants were good. We ate at each of them, with the Japanese and Steakhouse being our favorite. If you stay for seven days you get 3 guaranteed reservations, but if you are willing to eat a little later like we did at 8:30 or 9:00 you could pretty much pick an al la carte any night. Also one good things about this hotel is the proximity to Playa. It was only a $5 cab ride. There are lots of shops and places to eat. We went in a couple of nights and ate there just for something new.

Use the perimeter path if you are in a hurry (straight and flat) or the inner paths through the forest if you are not (lots of animals but path is crooked and bumpy). Good resort for families, but I wouldn't recomeended for a romantic get-away. Very diverse clientel, maybe weighted towards Eastern Europeans. Some of the German volley ballers were a pain (take things too seriously, they even slapped my friend and he's a cop!) Kept getting solicited by the Parasailing, Jewelry and Cigar guys, but I bought a box of Habana's and the women bought the jewelry. Negotiate everything except cab fare and set prices at the resort.

Really stayed at Quetzal, but couldn't seem to place review there. Read alot of reviews and picked this location based on TA comments. Very happy with choice for us - family of 5, with 3 other families, all with teenagers. I will only add/subtract from what I read/expected from reading other reviews. Beach - By far best one in Playacar, the rest are trashed. It gets crowded, but there are 700 rooms in this hotel. Every lounge chair by the pool and beach gets taken. The Sandos to the immediate south is closed right now, so their beach is open/uncrowded. Check location on google earth or similar for hotel location/layout. Cigarettes, trash, topless women were a non-issue. Property - Beautiful. Tropical, lush feel that larger, newer resorts can't match. Very junglely, thatched roofs, open dining/lobby, winding paths. Rooms were big. Great for 3 kids since there is a twin size foam \"couch\" plus the 2 dbl beds or king. Only adjoining rooms were up by lobby, ours were just next to each other. No problems with bugs/water/AC. Easy to walk everywhere in resort. Need shoes for rough paths, spiked heels a hazard. Don't worry about where room is as much as asking to be on the inside. Other reviews aren't kidding about the party noise to the north (only until 11:30 pm) and the construction noise to the south (only during the day). Food - Station after station of food. Huge variety. Much won't interest you, but something always will. They do mix it up and offer new things, and try fancy stuff. Restaurants - Worth doing, and only 3 of the 5 required pants, others dress Bermudas. None required closed toe shoes for men (although I read that somewhere in TA). Although nice change from buffet, some menu items weren't great. At least at the buffet, if you don't like it, you go back and get something else. Hospitality - Received everything we asked for, i.e. room requests, egg crates on mattresses, restaurant reservations, extra water in room, etc. Everyone at all levels helpful and friendly. Didn't need to know Spanish. Hardly ever tipped because I didn't carry money - still great service. When I emailed ahead (got email from old forums), I received prompt answer in good english. PDC town - Picked this resort because of proximity, but only went in twice during day for lunch/shopping (Los Rancheros was good). Wouldn't consider it a priority next time. So overpriced. Maybe if I was a younger partier - it looked like it would be fun at night. For mexico, it still had charm. Pavered streets, trees, lights, bars with swings for seats. Easy to catch cab or walk. Golf - Playacar course was good, but husband said newer course at Iberostar Paraiso was better and gorgeous, and because of \"sister\" priviledges, was cheaper. Weather - not great for this week. Rained a bunch at the beginning, and usually windy at beach, but no wind at pool - no hot tub though, spa is pool temp. Ocean temp is good and waves were fun. Too rough to snorkel. Amenities - didn't find ourselves or kids doing many scheduled activities or going to show or disco. When my kids tried, people were soooo serious - thought they were all professional soccer/volleyball/waterpolo players. No fun. Was nice being at an AI for the rainy days, because it did have things scheduled, places to hang out. Recommend getting the kids involved right away, because once they meet a \"star friend\" they would come find you for fun stuff. But, 2 ping pong tables, 2 pool tables, 1 kayak, 700 rooms - had to plan ahead if you wanted to reserve stuff. Excursions - (bargained with the travel rep guides because we had a group of 14) Went to Tulum, recommend hiring a guide, easy to do once you're there. Guide was a snoozer, kids were bored, but hopefully they will thank me later (overheard much better guides with other groups) still glad we went. Friends were happy with snorkeling right from hotel (excursion takes you on boat to a reef a few miles away $31 ea) go in the a.m., clouds came over every p.m. Banana boat rides are a giggle for everyone $10 ea. Booking/Transportation - Booked online through GoDreamVacations which contracts with FunJet and uses Lomas Travel for transfers. All smooth and good. Was told by Calif travel agents the Tucan was booked for my week, but with research was able to book the Queztal (same resort) through GoDreamVacations. Appears that the Queztal half books through European companies, and the Tucan through American. Also, was nervous about transfers after reading reviews, so I cancelled and booked a private through CancunValet ($110 rt). Went smooth, but others in our party kept the free Lomas Travel shuttle, and they got a private van, straight to our resort no problems at all. We all did our own airfare, so maybe because we didn't come in on a charter it was better? Further, the road from the airport all the way down the coast is straight, well marked, and easy to negotiate. I wouldn't worry at all about renting a car and driving. We hired a van with driver (but not really a \"package\") from the excursion guys for Tulum. Misc. - Didn't dislike anything. A bit busy for our comfort, but only around pool/beach. Never had long lines for drinks/food. Not sure we're AI people, but worked good for this group/rainy week. It's like being on a cruise, but you can get off whenever you want. I described my vacation to a friend as \"great, but it was like going to a party versus laying out in your backyard reading a book\" Both good, just different. I gave it a 5 because I thought it was honestly represented, and I wasn't disappointed in anything and overall I felt it was a good value.

We were very happy to finally see the monkeys after 5 days of looking for them. The staff were spot on - discreet, polite and pleasant. Always a hello for you and a smile on their face. We found we had to get up fairly early to secure a spot on the beach. We're generally a bit lazy on holidays but actually as it got dark at 5pm each day, it was good to make the most of the day. We even made it up for sunrise one day which I highly recommend! I was slightly disappointed by the food. I'm not a big buffet fan and found that it was difficult to get early sittings and that the food looked like it had seen better days on the later sittings. Japanese was by far the best restaurant. Playa del Carmen was nice - good restaurants and nice bars. We went out on a Saturday night which is considerably more lively than the week nights.

Construction was going from 6 am to 11 pm. It didn\u2019t bother us too much, just was annoying to hear hummers and drills going all day and smell the paint. Must say the room was very nice. We had no bugs and our fridge was filled with water every day even though it supposed to be only every other day. The worst part for us was the food. Most of leftovers were carry over to the next meal. Food was very poor taste and limited choices of meat and fish. The only places we liked it was Japanese and Italian restaurants. Previously, we were in Iberostar Costa Dorada in Puerto Plata and Iberostar Hacienda Dominicus in La Romana, DR. Their food choices and quality were much more interesting then in Tucan. Beach was fantastic. I saw how miserable beach looks at nearby resorts. Blowing wind was kind of chilly for me even though water was very warm. Pool, on another hand, was chilly so I haven\u2019t seen many people there. I would return to Iberostar Tucan in spite of bad food but not in late fall/ winter season.

A few tips, we are beach people and yes it is crowded, but if you go toward the Sandos Resort to your right looking at the beach, you will find it much less crowded and surprisingly quite. The shows are entertaining and at least try a couple of them. We went on the Coba Mayan village tour and had Aldo as our guide and it was amazing.

Negatives: Upon arriving at the hotel, we were given a room in building 12 facing the construction of the hotel next door. Being a light sleeper and wanting to \"sleep in\" a little on vacation, my boyfriend and I requested another room in the same building. The front desk staff were very nice about our request and were able to accomodate us 2 days later. Our new room was great, it faced the pool / jungle area, and we heard no noise whatsoever. However, the new room did have those ants that others have mentioned. It wasn't a total inconvenience, but just seems a little gross. And I did wake up with some mysterious bite marks here and there. Also, we only got one hot shower while we were there, at about 2pm in the afternoon one day. The rest of the time we were showering at peak times (morning or evening) and the water never got above lukewarm. Positives: The grounds of the hotel are absolutely gorgeous. There is plenty to see. Put your walking shoes on! You won't feel bad about eating 5 times a day all week. We loved running into peacocks and iguana's in the jungle, and did manage to see a monkey one day. I also thought the beach was very nice. We never had an issue finding a chair. We didn't try for any palapas since we didn't want any shade. The surf was a little rough a few days, but we had fun riding the waves. We ate at the breakfast, lunch, and dinner buffets. Basic food, which was fine with me. We ate at the Italian restaurant (great pasta) and the Steakhouse (one of the best steaks I've ever had). There was never a shortage of food, that's for sure. All the staff members we saw all day were always very nice. You couldn't walk down a path without hearing an \"Hola\" from every direction. The Star Friends were great and a lot of fun. We stopped by their shows every night for some laughs and drinks. We went to the Mascara nightclub almost every night to have a few drinks. It was never overly crowded (some nights a little bit dead). We had a good time people watching and doing some dancing. Again, we were also there for a friend's wedding, which was absolutely gorgeous. We were very impressed with how smoothly everything ran and how accomodating the hotel was for a function such as that. It was an amazing experience and all of our friends agree.

This is by far the best hotel we have stayed in. My fiancee and I ( we got engaged whilst we were there) stayed two weeks from 21st October. Reading all the reviews it seems like there are mixed reactions. For us this was a real treat and we were really excited about going to Mexico. it seems a lot of people have been to these locations before so are maybe used to hotels this nice.Therefore I am not going to dispute that there maybe hotels with nicer rooms and restaurants that would suit certain people more than these would but for us we could not ask for anything more. I will try and describe as much as I can. Rooms. The rooms are spacious, bed is comfortable, you do not sink into the bed but it was not like sleeping on a rock like some people have suggested, did not have one bad nights sleep. Mini Bar was stocked, if you did not have enough you could ask for more from the cleaner. Our minibar was rarely less than full. The bathroom is big, there is a walk in shower which anyone would love at home. The view from the balcony would all depend on what block you stay in. Ours was a bit limited due to the tree in front of it, but we rarely stayed in the room long enough to enjoy it. There is a tv and you can hire films but we never done this. Food. Get prepared to loads of weight on. There are 5 al a'carte restaurants. All of which have a very high standard of food, my fiancee loved every single one especially the Japanese. They cook the food right in front of you. Then play games with you later by trying to toss food in your mouth if you want to. I personally preferred the buffet restaurants, explained later Breakfast - what do you want for breakfast. Whatever you want is there. If you have children there are even chips and burger. Dinner - You can choose from three restaurants. We ate by the beach every single time. When it is only a minute from the beach then why do you need to go anywhere else? Again they have so much variety for dinner there is something for everyone. Tea- The two additional buffet restaurants to the specialised restaurants were amazing. I just wanted to eat and eat and eat. I so wish I could eat more. There were so many nice dishes there you wanted to try everything. Then when you thought you would leave the rest for tomorrow they had different options on. Dissapointing but amazing at the same time. Supper - we never went for supper we ate enough throughout the day. Drink. In other all inclusive hotels I have been in the drinks have been limited. But here it is the same as the food, whatever you want you can have and you do not have to pay for any of it whilst you are there. The only drinks they have not got is Bitter or Guiness. The local beer is nice and I am not going to complain about not having Corona. Staff. No complaints about the staff. The waiters and waitresses in the bars and restaurants are first class, they are always so happy to serve you and will do whatever you want. Just be a bit patient sometimes as they are very busy. Entertainment - The stars team are very very good. They work for so long but never ever look miserable. They are so friendly and want to make your holiday even better. They work on the beach and then by the pool and then walk around at night time to talk to you and then do their show. You will even get a dance with them, if you want to of course, The games by the pool are for everyone. There is a kids club which looks as though it is run really well. The main shows were good to amazing. Our favourite was the Las Vegas. Make sure you watch this. The staff dressed up on Halloween and had the night club changed into a haunted house then danced on the dance floor to Michael Jacksons thriller. Nightlife in Playacar. Go to Carlos and Charlies and Senor frogs. There is not a bar like it in Britain. The staff are amazing and make you feel so welcome, we ended up having pop corn contests. Dont forget your glasses when you leave Trips. We went on one trip only as we did not want to leave the hotel. We went on the Coba trip. Really worth going. It is a long day and it is really hard work walking up to the top of the pyramid but it is so worth it when you finally get back down. The meal in the mexican cafe was really nice and seeing the mayan village was an eye opener. The boy playing with alligator was another highlight for us I have left the best for last. The grounds. You will never go to a hotel that has better grounds than this. Where else would you get monkeys, flamingos, peacocks, tucans, turtles amongst others walking around your hotel. You can watch the wildlife whilst you are having your dinner wilst you are in the Quetzel buffet bar, we could of stayed their for hours, but there was too much to do after dinner. For the energetic people. The Interior of the hotel is so beautiful you will just want to take pictures all day. As there is a complaint with everyone I will have to add mine, but it is not with the hotel it is with First Choice. They are apalling. The construction farce, the air stewards and the way they treat customers when they have your booking. If you are thinking of going, go. You will miss out on so much if you go next door or to a hotel close by. We nearly changed because of the construction but we are so glad we did not.

My daily \"lunch\" was comprised of a Mojito and nachos with salsa and guacamole. Before dinner, we enjoyed drinks at the lobby bar. The bartender and the waitresses work their buts off and we noticed harldly anyone tipped them! We made sure to bring about $150 in ones just for tipping purposes (maid, waiters, bartenders and waitresses). Took a day trip to Chichen Itza and my husband got very sick at the Buffet. Ladies, this is the place to get good deals, though! This was the cheapest place around. I got a gorgeous heavy sterling silver bracelet; the merchant originally wanted $80 for it and I got it for only $25. We went there at the beginning of our trip, so I didn't know how prices would be elsewhere. This is definitely the place to get all of your souvenirs. Also took the ferry over to Cozmel-the merchants, time share folks and tour guides hound you the moment you get off the boat. Other than that, Margaritaville was great-very beautiful, right on the ocean. Staff at Iberostar were very friendly and left you alone if you weren't interested in joining the games.

My room, while not being infested with ants, had dirty sheets with holes in them, a missing light switch next to the bed causing my girlfriend an electric shock in the middle of the night, and had a non-functioning shower. All these things can happen at any hotel one stays at, but what truly distinguished Iberostar was the management\u2019s lack of concern about any of this. After waiting 3+ hours to speak to a manager, Miguel, one of the assistant managers came out with a strikingly negative attitude and after a conversation with us proceeded to say \"I have 700 other guests, why should I care about you.\" That was enough for us to get the message that they truly do not care about their guests.

As always, an excellent time was had. Nice beach, excellent pool and great food. The only negatives we experienced during the trip was that the construction taking place at the new Sands hotel was a bit noisy at times. Although it only slightly detracted from our experience it was a nuisance at times. The other unfortunate experience we had was we and the other guest were forced to witness a group of about 20 of the loudest, obnoxious and rudest American men (and three or four of their \"women\" )I have ever seen. Bringing their drinks into the surf, tossing garbage and food into the pristine sea, leering at the women, yelling and cursing at the top of their voices, banging their glasses on the table in the lounges and eateries and disgusting mocking the staff was almost intolerable. Most wearing baseball hats and sporting goatees, were surely the most adolescent bunch of clowns I have ever seen at a resort. I think their behavior disgusted all of the guests and workers and served to set back the nice feel at the resort and probably foreign relations as well! Fortunately, their stay must have been for only three or 4 nights and once they left peace and harmony was restored. I know the staff was relieved and my heart truly went out to them as they are some of the kindest, friendliest, hardest working, honorable people I have ever met in a resort. There was no way they deserved the abuse and disrespect bestowed on them by those louts. In summary, another great vacation at the resort and we shall return. I can only hope that in the future, Iberostar adopts a hard policy against those that take advantage of their hospitality and guests and acts to remove groups like I mentioned off the property when their behavior is unacceptable.

After going to Iberostar Cozumel last year and having such a great experience there, we decided to give another Iberostar a shot. It was just as good, if not better. I loved walking to breakfast every morning and feeling like I was in a jungle. The scenery and animals were just amazing! The dining room area (at least for the Quetzal side) over looks a beautiful waterfall. Our first morning there we watched monkeys play on a rooftop as we ate breakfast. The food is good, although I got tired of eating the same thing. My favorite dinner had to be when we ate at the Japanese restaurant our last night. Plenty of food and lots of flavor! We also dined in at the steak house, which was pretty good, however it did not compare to the Japanese food. The wait staff were all very friendly and would do anything to make you smile. The water was beautiful but the waves were REALLY rough. We lucked out on the weather, I heard the week before was the worst week and it rained every day. Make sure you get to the beach early so you are able to get your desired spot because it gets crowded fast. The resort is conveniently located about 5 or so minutes away (by cab) from 5th street. There are great shops there and I was surprised to see how nice 5th Street was. I would also suggest to go at night, it was so hot during the day, I could barely stand it! Most of the shops are open to 10:00 p.m. and the cab rides are only $5.00. We could definitly go back to this resort a 2nd time.

The hotel is beautiful and extremely clean and well maintained. Our room was a little dated (but not bad) and as mentioned many times before the beds are very hard and the mini fridge was not very cold. One thing to remember is that the Tucan's south side faces a construction zone; so if you are a light sleeper or want to sleep past 8am you may want to request an interior room. The staff was one of the friendliest we have encountered in Mexico. The food was average. I actually liked the Italian restaurant the best; but avoid the pastas. The steakhouse was very good but is outdoors and we were there on a very warm night. The beach: the water and sand are beautiful. The beach is 1/8 mile which is decent for a 350 room hotel; but since the Quetzel shares the same beach it actually accomodates 2 hotels (700 rooms) so it can be very crowded. Now the reason we will never go back. When we tried to make reservations for dinner at the ala carte restaurants we were told that we since we were there for 4 nights we could only eat dinner one night in the restaurants--the other nights must be at the buffet. We booked through apple and checked the Iberostar website and never saw anything mentioned about this rule. After we made a fuss with the PR person, they finally accomodated us. But we found this very misleading. We don't like to eat dinner at buffets--one night is fine but we like to have the \"full dining experience.\" So if this is not an issue, I'd highly recommend the Tucan.

The only place you could get bottled water was in your room but it was not replenished consistently and we had to ask on several occasions for more bottled water which was provided promptly.

The grounds/settings of the hotel was a constant surprise as wildlife of all kinds were roaming freely around the grounds and the jungle paths that lead down the pool and beach areas.

No problems getting drinks whatsoever. We didn't do any trips as we had been to Mexico before and had done them already. Though we did catch the ferry to Cozumel and we didn't really like it.

We took the sail boats out everyday. We went on the snorkle dive there and off site. The one there was just as good as the one off site, with the exception of seeing a shark at the off site place. WOW!! It was pretty...it was relaxing...food was plentiful...we could get into any restaurant we wanted to. The wedding was so no hassle, that's what I liked the most. I did not want to do a thing for my wedding and I didn't have to. I just showed up. And it was beautiful. I can't believe how wonderful it turned out. For us and my very picky family of chefs and cooks, the Steakhouse was not so great, all of the steaks were overcooked for their taste. Since I was the only one who didn't eat meat, I didn't care. Because there was enough food all over the place that one meal, even if it was my wedding reception, did not bother me in the least. The flowers the brought were sooo nice. I chose yellow roses and it was so simple and pretty!! the cakes were great for not having to pay extra for them, and it tasted great to me!! The disco was fun for our twenty year old daughter who closed the place every night. The one show we saw was fine to watch, but if you are an American that is used to cruiseline entertainment, the qualitiy is not the same. But they are very hard working and very nice entertainers that help out all over the resort so you really can get to like them. We had a regular room for the beginning of our trip and for our wedding night and the last night we asked for the Presidential Suite. It was $200 more per person per night. It was gorgeous!!! A huge living room and kitchenette two and a half bathrooms, two bedrooms, and a big balcony with a hot tub on the deck looking out over the beach. Well worth the extra money. After our wedding, we went to our room and there was this trail of red rose petals that went through the living room to the bedroom and on top of the bed the were shaped into a heart with our names spelled out.

TUCAN is a three to four star hotel with a five star beach, and fa five star attitude. The people and the service make the place much better than it is. The grounds are five star. The front bar is five star. The food is something you have to allow yourself to judge. It's good, it's plentiful, it's more than passable, but it is not five star cuisine.

Worth the trip if you've never been. Take a walk down 5th avenue in Paya-Del-Carmen...lots of shops and everything is \"almost free\" according to the shop owners. There is also a Wal-mart in town This was our first trip w/Apple. Flight was good. Transfers were good except for \"Apple Lobby\" tour. Made ~4 stops before getting to the Iberostar..of course we were last....~2hrs later. If you can swing the non-stop transfer they offer use it. The Apple reps at the resort were ok if you wanted to book a tour. There are several other agencies there which you can use or grab a cab...they'll take you anywhere. We've been to a lot of places.....been there done that....but we'll be back to this one !!", "Date": "October 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lansdale, PA", "Title": "\u201cAwesome vacation :o)\u201d", "Author": "tylersmom1220", "ReviewID": "UR10041197", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Iberostar Tucan Sept 27-Oct 4, 2007.

We went on the Royal Garrafin tour which we were underwhelmed with because we paid $170 to go there and it was no where near as nice as the resort. Don't waste your time or money on that tour. The Chichen Itza tour was worth it though but it's a long bus ride, about 2 hrs from the Tucan. We're into that kind of thing. I dont recommend it if you cant stand the heat and the sun; wear sneakers because it's a lot of walking, too. Bring a pool float...they are about $15 at the resort and only about a buck at Walmart. The pool is HUGE and crystal clear. You can float around all day and not bump into anyone.

We had an amazing time.. the energy at Iberostar is through the roof :) Everyone just wants to kick back and have a good time! Truly how a beach resort should be. The beach is beautiful by far the best in Playa del Carmen. The water is warm and the color of the ocean is truly breathtaking. The rooms were pretty big and kept very clean. The beds are not as bad as they say. Being in the sun all day will knock you out instantly anyhow. The showers are big and nicely tiled and there was always hot water. We had a nice patio area where we enjoyed a game of cards and a couple of electric lemonade before dinner. ..The food at the main buffet was average. I found something to eat everday. Esp Chips n guac couldnt get enought of it. The Hibatchi Resturant was amazing. We ate here twice during our one week stay. We actually changed our reservations from the Stake House so we could go back to Hibatchi. Italian one on the other hand.. not so great... The staff is like no other. They are very hard working and friendly people. Make sure you tip them generously ..it is well deserved. The entertainment crew will keep you on your feet and really make the difference between a good vacation and an unforgettable one! Special shout to Miguel and Edu :) If your going to the Tucan anytime soon make sure to take time to get to know these two they will make your trip so much more enjoyable. There are not enough good things i could say about this resort. The grounds are beautiful you always see something new walking through the jungle. Go to the shows at night - really! Me and my girlfiends are in our early twenties and did not think we would enjoy the shows at first but the first night we saw it we were hooked :) We then went to the shows everynight and it was a great way to start off the evening! Lets just hope you like the song \"hey baby\" ..youll understand once your there. Take time to go visit Tulum and Coba... these were great day trips. We took a taxi from the hotel and toured the ruins ourseleves. Which ending up working out very well for us. The beach at tulum is beautiful make sure you leave time to enjoy it. Also a great place to go at night is the Blue Parrot good mix of locals and tourist all looking to have a good time. Aslo went to CocaMaya and danced all through out the night literally.. Playacar is a great place to vist and i would recommend it to any one. Also the town was very safe and the people there will make you feel like you never want to leave.

Our last trip to the Riviera Maya was in December, 2006 and was also our first stay at the Tucan. Our stay was even better this time as the weather was beautiful every day. We stayed in a standard room in bldg 14 this time and it was the same size (or very close) and just as comfortable as the ocean front rooms in bldg. 10. The beach was in great shape, as beautiful as ever, and the pool was inviting and warm. We booked the Japanese and Mexican restaurants this trip, and both were ok. We had enjoyed the Steak and Japanese restaurants on our last visit. We were later spoiled by the food at the Riu Palace Las Americas in Cancun\u2026 But we love the Tucan and will return again \u2013 the jungle setting and excellent beach sets this resort apart from many of the other resorts in the area, including the other Iberostars. More details \u2013 Standard room is the same size as the oceanfront room. The only benefit the oceanfront room provides is you know where your room will be. Because the beach is so crowded right in front of the oceanfront rooms I prefer a quieter room like we had in bldg 14. This afforded us much more privacy on our balcony. Buffet & specialty restaurants were great, we find ample variety and often have an excellent dining experience. The service is first-class and my wife is very pleased with the different offerings that make each night unique. The pool is not crowded even though the lounge chairs are all \u201creserved\u201d. The beach palapas are also reserved and unused most of the morning but lounges near the beach are available as are portable umbrellas. Yes the towel game is in full force here, I\u2019ve not seen it at this level at other hotels although this was our first AI. The entertainment is sometimes hokey but that makes it enjoyable. Some nights it is excellent. We had breakfast with the Michael Jackson impersonator and learned about his training. Miguel is an excellent dancer and was perhaps the best show during this short stay. All of the Star Friends are very polite and really enjoy their work there. Playa is a must in the evening, many great restaurants to enjoy there along with the entertainment. 5th Ave is very crowded now, wondering where the next Playa Del Carmen will be \u2013 Tulum area? But the Ibero Tucan/Quetzal is a very enjoyable resort in the best location possible, and we recommend it to couples and families alike. It is a reasonably-priced resort that has many return guests because of the consistently superb service and the beautiful grounds and beach.

We have previoulsy been to Cuba and the Dominican Republic and definatley saved the best till last. We had requested room (1242) prior to arrival and were given one in the same block which was okey but a little dark. Reception staff were great and offered to move us, but due to Hurricane Dean's imminent arrival we were advised to stay where we were, as we may have ended up being evacuated from Block 11 which was slighty nearer to the ocean. The hotel is really fantasic, very large with an enourmous pool seperating the Tucan from the Quetzel. The drive into Playacar is really pretty with lots of private villas and tree lined roads - reminded us a bit of Majorca! The wildlife around the place is such a talking point and the vast array of animals you see is immense. As previously reported, the staff cannot do enough for you. They are so friendly and really do go out of their way to accomodate you. The food was really good, especially the breakfasts and the speciality restaurants. We definatley had the best stretch of beach which was out of this world. Guests from the Riu Palace, Reef and the other Iberostar hotel would often walk down and use our beach for the day as their's wasn't that great. Our 12 year old son soon made friends which left me and hubby drinking Havana Club's every night in the Lobby Bar which was great. The entertainment was really good with a different show every night. A great place to meet up with people and have a laugh or two!! Take a cab into Playa Del Carmen at night as there are so many bars, restaurants, shops and boutiques to visit. We were really surprised when we went for the first time. We had a lovely meal at Casa Aqua which we would recommend if you want something alittle special away from the hotel. We really enjoyed meeting people from so many different countries who all had one thing in common - 'Having Fun' and that's exactly what we did from start to finish.

This site is so helpful with every trip we plan. My husband and I wanted to stay at an all-inclusive in Playa Del Carmen hotel and we chose the Iberostar Tucan & Quetzal for our trip 8/30 \u2013 9/4 per the reviews and photos. Booking- We chose Liberty Travel, which had the best rates for the dates and flight times we wanted. The agents were very helpful and upon arrival, we were taken to our hotel by van and not by bus, which meant less stops. Hotel- I booked the Tucan side, but we were put on the Quetzal side due to our request to be closer to the beach, bldg 23. At first I was disappointed, but the Tucan and Quetzal really are the same hotel. Tucan\u2019s units are on the right and Quetzal\u2019s on the left. Each has it\u2019s own lobby and buffet area, but they share everything else. The tropical grounds were beautiful and clean. All lobbies and most restaurants are open air for a nice beach and jungle feeling. There are small jungle animals everywhere to admire along your walks on the paths: peacocks, flamingos, swans, parrots, monkeys, iguanas, agoutis. All were well behaved and kept to themselves, so no need to flee. Room- Not the most modern, but very clean and A/C chilled. Satellite TV and a mini bar that is stocked with beer, water and sodas. Fridge is not very cold. There is a hair dryer and small toiletries. The shower is huge and they stock fresh towels as need be. There is a drying rack on the balcony for swimsuits. There is a also a small safe in the closet for valuables. We chose to have our room cleaned every other day by leaving the Do Not Disturb sign on the door and our room was left alone when we wanted it to be. Food- We\u2019re not picky eaters, so we didn\u2019t have any problems finding food that was satisfying. We mostly stuck to fish and chicken dishes. The hotel caters to people from all over, mostly Europeans, so keep that in mind viewing the selections. I agree with the person who said the food was somewhat bland, but we\u2019re used to spicy Tex-Mex. Breakfast was the best buffet with fresh omelets and a good selection of pastries and fruit. We ate at the specialty Steak Restaurant, which was very good, and the Japanese Restaurant, which was excellent. Entertainment- Drinks were always available. The house beer is Superior, which is not the best Mexican beer, but it was free and unlimited, so no complaints. I fell in love with their Mojitos. Those were dangerous since they were minty refreshing in the hot sun. They have a couple of lobby bars, a theatre bar, a beach bar, a beach restaurant bar, a swim up bar and a discoteque club/bar. They have a themed show every night in the theatre which can be pretty cheesy, but festive and the crowd seems to enjoy them. The discoteque has a great bar staff, but the music is somewhat dated. It can get pretty crowded around midnight. The nightlife in Playa Del Carmen is a must though. They have great bars and clubs for a $5 cab ride. Pools- We spent most of our time on the beach because it\u2019s lovely. The pools had a lot of activities going on though for what seemed to be mostly in Italian. The games were fun to watch though. The main pool is large, but deep if you\u2019re short like me. They have a kiddy pool and a sport pool with basketball hoops that was always empty. The swim up bar is a separate pool that was pretty festive in the late afternoons. It closes at 6pm, which is somewhat early. All pools close at 8pm and are kept very clean. Beach- Turquoise and blue waters with soft white sand. Yes, people were greedy with the palapas, but they were always beach loungers available even when it was the most crowded. You can grab a beach umbrella from the towel stand and they work out perfectly. The sun is hot, so if you burn easily, an umbrella is recommended. The water is a great cool temp. and depending on the day it can be very calm or have slight waves. A lot of topless sun bathing and speedos, but that\u2019s the different cultures one gets to experience while on vacation. Most guests seemed to be very happy and cordial. Lots of beautiful people and languages. We made pals every day (hi Michelle & Joe). The service was always good in the restaurant and bars, some at better times than others. There are pool & ping pong tables, volleyball, ceramic painting for a fee and lots of water activities offered on the beach. We took a day excursion to Tulum & Xel-Ha. Tulum was nice to photograph, but it was extremely hot and their beach was closed due to Hurricane Dean. There were lots of fish to see while snorkeling at Xel-Ha, but the water was still very murky due to Hurricane Dean. Side Note: Olympus Tours was a let down on this excursion since we weren\u2019t told of the hurricane effects and it was pricier than the same tour offered in the hotel\u2019s own tour office.

The rooms were nice, and yes the beds are hard but I still managed to sleep enough and I'm not the greatest sleeper in the world. Book the specialty restaurants the first day and don't skip the Italian one, by far the best. The food in the buffets can be repetitive so it's up to you to select different items. Also, the first person up goes to the beach and reserves a palapa(hut). It's very hot in the sun. One thing that we were disappointed in was one of the side trips we took. It was called Discovery Park. You take an ATV down a very long and bumpy paved road with just a little off-road driving. You then go zip-lining which sprays oil over your clothes and ruins them. Next you climb down a very unsafe Gilligan's island type ladder into an underground cenote. You get to ride your ATV ten miles back to town. 3 years ago we did an ATV trip that was just south of Playacar that was all off road and had a cenote with easier access.

I chose this hotel solely on their reviews and pictures since I was tired looking through digitally altered \u201ctropical paradise\u201d pictures that hotels and travel companies usually post themselves and once you get there \u2013 too bad for you that the turquoise water you expected are in fact floating seaweed in the ocean. Me and my husband stayed at Iberostar Tucan Aug. 25 \u2013 Sept. 1. We stayed in bungalow 13, room 1328. It had a big king bed, but not all the rooms do. The room was very clean, spacious. Hotel grounds were beautiful with a lot of vegetation. I felt like I was part of the jungle. I love nature and was very excited to see peacocks strolling down the jungle path, swans on Quetzal side and variety of fish swimming in the pond around buffet. Tucans, parrots, flamingos, exotic birds and animals \u2013 they were all there! We saw many monkeys on the trees that were very cute and completely harmless. A bit disappointed with the beds though. Even though I\u2019m 23 and my husband 25, we found that every morning our backs were so sore that we found beach chairs very comforting. We woke up early everyday at 6am and went straight to the beach. We spend most of our day there (usually \u2018till 6pm) and ate lunch at Palapa/Grill restaurant beside the pool. There were plenty of chairs, of course unless you\u2019re one of those people who parties through the night and then wakes up at 1pm complaining that all the chairs are gone. You want the best spot? \u2013 Wake up early! The beach was gorgeous! I\u2019ve research many hotels and I challenge you to find the beach in Mexico better than this one. Yes, just like I\u2019ve read in other reviews- Iberostar has the best beach on the strip. Once you walk down the beach towards the other hotels, there are actual big black bags put there in order to keep the sand from being eaten away by the ocean. I actually felt sorry for the people on other parts of the beach since all the sand was torn away and the other hotel workers were desperately trying to build it back together. There were a lot of activities around the pool and the beach and Star Friends made sure everyone is entertained. We did not stay at the pool at all since the beach was amazing. We did rent a water seadoo from the local company right on the beach - $60 US for 30 min. We had tons of fun and it was definitely worth it. We also went parasailing and that was a blast, too short though. We also took excursion \u201cCozumel Adventure\u201d from the authorized excursion booth set up right on Iberostar\u2019s beach. The excursion \u2013 you will be picked up from your hotel and take a bus to the ferry that takes you to Cozumel Island which is famous for its coral reefs. Then you are taken by the boat to two coral reefs were you spend 50 min at each reef snorkelling/scuba diving. In the afternoon they drop you off at Iberostar Cozumel where you have lunch in all inclusive buffet. After that you visit the third reef and back to your hotel. It was amazing and while snorkelling over one of the reefs we saw many colourful fish and actually saw a shark sleeping on the sand. Al a carte restaurants \u2013 We went to the La Marimba Steakhouse and Bonsai Japanese restaurant. We loved the Steakhouse. The food was amazing, my husband had a great steak and we indulged in shrimp, salmon, crab meat, oysters, scallops, fresh veggies followed by a chicken steak. The food was really great. On the other hand, we really hated the food at the Japanese restaurant. Very limited selection and you have to order only 1 of three appetisers and one of 4 entries, 1 of 3 deserts. Also you will be seated very tightly around a square table and rub shoulder with someone next to you \u2013 not very romantic. Our reservation was at 8:30pm and after we were seated we started eating at 9:30, since you have to wait for the food to be prepared in front of you for 17 people. I am also not a big fan of raw beef and chicken chunks being cooked right in front of my face so that ruined my appetite. We actually left without waiting for the desert and our clothes smelled like burned soy oil. We were so hungry we barely made it to buffet that closes at 10pm. I suggest booking restaurants early since they book up fast. Don\u2019t make a mistake of booking them for later time (like I did at 8:30pm) because if you don\u2019t like the food, you don\u2019t get a change to go to buffet later. Buffet \u2013 was great. There were many choices and lots of fresh veggies and fruits. I loved their grilled chicken, crab, shrimp, beets cooked with pineapple, pico de gallio and guacamole\u2026you get the idea! Lots of choice. Buffet Tulum 7am-10am breakfast and 10am-12am continental breakfast at poolside Palapa/Grill. 1pm-3pm lunch at the buffet and 12am-5pm buffet at Palapa/Grill. 6:30pm-10pm buffet dinner plus late night room service. Lots and lots of food and time to eat. Also, if you drink Diet Coke, they have Cola Light which is exactly the same thing, since I wanted to make sure it is not just a reduced sugar cola, but a sugar free one and it is. How would I describe my overall impression of my Iberostar Tucan vacation? \u2013 Beautiful nature, cute animals, great food, good service, amazing beach, clean rooms \u2013 bad beds. Oh well, I can get over the beds because once you go to the beach you realize it was worth it! Have a great vacation!

The resort was beautiful, but overall we preferred our stay a few years ago at the Bahia Prinicipe. We also felt that the Rui resort that we stayed in when visiting Jamaica was overall a nicer resort. The resort: Is beautiful. We loved the jungle and the animals. It seems that the monkeys are only on the Queztal side, not the Tucan side. The path to the beach and pool through the jungle is really nice and shady, however the path itself is rocky and impossible in fancy shoes. Crocs, flip flops and flat shoes work the best. I feel that elder persons would have difficulty with the path. The room: One of the best rooms we have stayed in, we liked the little couch area which made the room more spacious. We were on the first floor and the balcony opened up to beautiful gardens full of little lizards. Despite tipping every day, our maid service was hit of miss. We only had towel animals a few days of our week, and one day didn't get fresh towels at all. That day our old towels were taken and not replaced. The mini bar was not refilled with Cokes and we had to call for them. When we called (for towels, cokes or whatever) we did get a prompt response. Yes, the beds are hard. They seem to be built on a cement foundation with a mattress on top. The bathroom was all tile and beautiful, no tub just a shower, which was fine with us. The food: Dismal. The buffets were repetitious, there was always something tasty, but sometimes it was hard to find. The pizza was almost always good, but sometimes it had funny toppings. We asked them to make cheese pizza. Our daugter is a vegetarian and there were no black beans. I thought this was odd. There were refried beans (who knows if they were truely vegetarian), being in Mexico, I would have thought we would have had black beans. Whenever we ate outside the resort, we had black beans. The food at other resorts (Rui in Jamaica and Bahia Principe in Tulum) was more diverse and overall better tasting. Room service was really good and open till 11pm. The Restaurants: We loved the Japanese restaurant. Our chef did not do all the fancy knife tricks, but it was still fun to see her cook and the food was excellent. We went to the Mexican restaurant which was fine, the shrimp meal was good and they made our vegetarian daughter a great burrito. The Italian restaurant was terrrible. I ordered Salmon and it was seared on the grill, but not fully cooked. I couldn't eat it and frankly it ruined my appetite. My son ordered a calzone, which was also not good. It was spicey like Mexican food. My daughter ordered lasagne which was not good, it was too salty and just did not taste good. My husband had a good chicken meal. The service overall: We never had a waiter that was attentive. You can get wine with dinner if you can flag down a waiter, otherwise you can just drink soda, which you can get. We only had drinks brought to us on the beach once in a week. I brought lots of one dollar bills and brought them home. I think I tip easily, but no one really paid attention to us. Of course we could get our own drinks or go to the bar near the beach, so that is what we did. The bars: We are not really big drinkers, but we drank less on this vacation than usual. I think it is because the bars were out of the way. There was a bar in the lobby that was quiet, but you never passed it. There was a bar at the beach, that was user friendly. And then there was a bar in the entertainment area. I guess other resorts had bars you would pass near the buffet. In that case I would get an after dinner drink. Guess it saved me some calories. The beach: Beautiful. The water was clear and turquiose. Some days calm, some days waves. Always very nice. I am very vigilant about sunscreen, even so you will get burned if you aren't under shade at least part of the day. People were pigish about the shade huts. They would reserve them and not use them. We went with the crowd and reserved one per day. We heard people say, let's get a shady place at the pool also. So unfair. The resort needs to better control / enforce the beach and pool reserving policy. We went on some fabulous trips: We went to Chichen Itza and snorkeling with Snorkel Adventure in Puerto Morelos. Chichen Itza was amazing and the hottest place I have ever been. Our bus tour gave us a bottle of water, but you needed more than one water bottle, you could buy water or bring it from you hotel. I was able to take water from our mini bar. The bus trip is 2-3 hours with a stop on the way for shopping or purchasing water or snacks. We received pastries on the bus and drinks. I recommend purchasing snacks, because lunch is late. We toured Chichen Itza for about 2-3 hours. There is a snack shop with nice bathrooms at Chichen Itza as well. The site is amazing and the history is incredible. It is disappointing that there are so many vendors actually on the historical site. While looking at the pyrimids and other structures children and others selling things come up to you. Everything is almost free. It takes about 3 hours to see the site and we did not see everything, we did not support the vendors on the historical grounds. Our tour guide recommended not supporting them. However if you need a drink, they have drinks as well as souvenirs. After Chichen Itza we had a fabulous lunch and then went swimming at a cenote. It was great to cool off after being so hot. The name of the cenote was Ik Kil. The cenote was beautiful and stairs were carved down to the cenote, where you could jump in. Fresh water, very cold and invigorating. Then we were taken back to the hotel. The whole trip was 7a-7p. We snorkeled with Snorkeling Adventure in Puerto Morelos. The reef is unspoiled and simply amazing. I did not really believe that corals that large could be present so close to Cancun and the area. We saw huge brain coral, elkhorn, black coral, fans, finger coral. You name it, we saw it. We also saw many sting rays, parrot fish, sargeant majors, angelfish, and lots of other fish. My son saw barracudas, I saw a flounder, we saw puffer fish and star fish. It was incredible. The guide pointed out many sites. Some people saw a small shark. My family are all strong swimmers, I think this open ocean snorkeling would be difficult if you were not a strong swimmer. Well that is probably long enough. Overall we would love to go back, but would probably choose something further south of Playa Del Carmen as the beach would not be as crowded. I would probably not chose an Iberostar resort, with all the others to pick from.

We had been to Tulum a few years ago, and wanted something a little closer to the airport and to Playa del Carmen. Our travel could not have been smoother. Our agent got us a private transfer from the airport - a new Suburban with a very friendly driver. Got to the hotel before checkin time, ate lunch and the room was ready. Building 11, right by the pool and beach. Perfect location for us. The resort grounds are beautiful. The \"jungle\" between the Tucan and Quetzal was the source of much wildlife amusement for us. From the big ratlike things to the birds and monkeys, there was always something to watch and photograph. Our room was immaculately maintained, our maid was a sweetheart, and when it became obvious that we only drank water she stocked extra bottles for us. The AC worked great, and I'm pretty picky about that. Yes, the beds were a little firmer than we have at home, but we slept well. The food was fine. The buffets offer a wide assortment of local and mainstream choices. Fresh fruit and juices were in abundance, and, a nice surprise, the coffee was very good. Birds do fly into and through the open air restaurants, but they don't bother you when you're eating and I never saw a single drop of bird poop. We ate at all four specialty restaurants. All were very good. The steakhouse (actually a poolside bar that turns into a restaurant at night) had surprisingly good steaks. Japanese was average for the genre, but it's a nice treat for the kids. Mexican was great, had a red snapper that rivaled any I've eaten elsewhere. Italian was my personal favorite. From the antipasti and cheese board to the grilled lamb chops it was all top notch. The staff was consistently excellent. Service in restaurants and bars was attentive and helpful. Maintenance and groundskeeping kept the resort clean, and after a rainshower immediately squeegeed all the floors. Best was the Star Friends. These kids (mostly) worked what seemed like 16 hours a day. Organizing pool games and activities, mingling with guests at lunchtime, putting on shows at night, and most importantly, taking great care of our daughter in the kids club. She fell in love with her two counselors, who took them swimming, did crafts, took them to lunch, and put them in a stage show, complete with rehearsals and costumes. The beach and pool are beautiful. No problem getting chairs or even the shaded palapas if you were out by 9. First morning I was up at five, so I took in the sunrise and snoozed by the pool. The towel card system is slightly annoying, but we only had one towel swiped, and it was no problem resolving it. I suggest you do as we did and bring some garishly printed beach towels of your own, so you can always find your chairs. We did the 3pm snorkel trip from the hotel, a great deal at 35 dollars each. Ten minute boat drip and we spent an hour in the water. Aside from one leaky floatation vest it was very nice. Free intro to scuba in the pool was enough of a taste to make me want to dive for real next time. And there will be a next time, only for two weeks. One just wasn't enough. Playa del Carmen itself is a trip. Yes, vendors will solicit you to visit their shops, but mostly calling to you from their seats. We ate twice at Yaxche, a Mayan restaurant in town, and it was very good. A great introduction to really local cuisine. Didn't buy much, some typical souvenir stuff. If you're into cigars (which I am) head for Morgan's - genuine product at fair prices. I would avoid the others, I looked in some and the prices were higher and some had questionable looking product. If you're considering a trip to the area I could not recomment the Iberostar Tucan more highly. I'm already trying to plan our next visit.

Hurricane Dean came through, took a good chunk of sand depth and a few beach palapas but the beach is still very user friendly and beautiful. The hotel did an amazing job of preparing for the hurricane while simultaneously keeping the smooth running hotel pattern unaffected. They waited until late afternoon to remove lounges and close the beach. We were kept informed of evacuation plans in the days preceding the storm. On the evening just before it hit, they had the dinner buffet as usual. We were in a bottom floor room and got re-located to the 2nd floor for the evening. They delivered bag lunches to the room just before the storm hit. After, the staff went about to return the place back to normal amazingly fast. This hotel has a Hurricane action plan and used it with speed and precision! We were extremely impressed and felt this was a great place if you had to be stuck for a hurricane. Our stay was extended due to the storm and the hotel gave us a rate of only $55/day/person. Half our original rate! Airport: Totally renovated and streamlined passage through customs and immigration. Skip past the numerous pesky tour desk people in the airport and head straight outside. Most of the tour operators hold signs up and will point the way to your bus, even if they aren't your tour operator. We went with GoGo tours, which is handled by Olympic tours in Mexico. We didn't have more than a 10 minute wait until the bus took us to our hotel, dropping off at other hotels along the way. The ride is about 45 minutes. Hotel Check-In: Paperwork. They need passport info and such. I asked for a room close to the beach in building 11. It was full but they gave us building 12, excellent location, and they were able to give our later arriving friends a room right next to ours. Room: Built for hurricanes. Yes the bed is firm but very comfortable. The shower has a supply of shampoo and body gel. There is an industrial strength blow dryer. I used the TV Internet for $20US for the week. It is not a very user friendly system, but did the job of keeping me in e-mail contact. The A/C worked very well and the little refrigerator is stocked with beer, sodas and water every other day. Any time I left a note for the maid (in Spanish) to leave more water, I was given more. (Well, you have to hoard when a hurricane is coming). The rooms were quiet other than the scraping of chairs on occasion. Why don't they put those little felt or plastic covers on the leg tips? Beach/Pool: You do have to get up very early if you want a poolside or beach shade palapa. Everyone does it, but there are signs saying no reserving them. The pool is heavily chlorinated each evening, but never eye burning and always clean. Hurricane Dean did take a lot of sand away, there are a few hard patches in places at the top of the beach, but mostly there is plenty of sand and the shoreline seemed unaffected. There were body surfing waves most days, a couple of days it was as calm as a pond. There were only a couple of topless bathers on the beach. It is nice to be able to rinse off in the showers by the beach/pool/bar. Buffet by the beach, no cover up required. We signed up to take a sailboat out, you have to do that a day in advance. Service: Just awesome for an all inclusive this size. I think most of the staff are genuinely nice and enjoy their jobs, really. Shows: The Mexican folk show we saw was fantastic. The other evening shows, not so much. Open air room with A/C (! ?), wonderful table service for drinks. There are a couple of pool tables in the area but you have to get the cue and balls way up at the front desk. Disco: Played a mix of all kinds of music. The place just started to fill in around 11pm. By midnight, more people but not much action on the dance floor. We didn't stay much longer so I don't know what time the place gets hopping. Activities: I didn't do any or see many but I know they existed each day. If I wasn't so injury prone, I would have tried the bull riding event! Tips: We left $2 each day for the maid and tipped $1 here and there for drink delivery on the beach and $10 for extra good service provided at dinner or at the bar. Gym: Fills up by 10 a.m. most days. There is A/C but they also leave the door open. Ceiling fans help. There are 3 treadmills, free weights, bench and bars, 2 stair master type machines, a multi universal type machine, 2 ellipticals and 2 stationary bikes if I remember. The water cooler gives nice cold water! Towels are provided. There is a staff member on duty. TV on 2 walls play music videos. Food: At all the buffets, the staff is very fast to pick up your empty plates but not so fast on serving drinks. Most of the time I just got our own water, coffee, soda, whatever. There is much to choose from at the buffet, I could always get something different each day. The specialty restaurants reservations have to be made in advance. Japanese, very tasty food and fun display of having it prepared on the grill in front of us. Steakhouse, okay meat, cooked to order, open air no A/C but no need for men to wear trousers. Mariachi entertainment. Italian, I thought was not bad but not great. Tropical, (open air...no trousers) very good food. There were 7 in our party and no one got sick. Bottled water is provided, and the water served at meals is also safe. You can smell the chlorine when you shower, so I don't think water is an issue anymore. Shopping: There is a 10a.m. bike tour that can take you to 5th street for a shopping tour (the guide protects the bikes) or take a $5 taxi ride, otherwise it is a long hot walk. 5th street area has a lot of culture and activity. The venders bargain. I found prices inconsistent from store to store so it pays to shop around a little before making a purchase. Also, there is a little mall just a few minutes walk up the road from the hotel. Tech: Need to dial 001 to call USA. Cell phone Verizon wireless and ATT worked in the room, on the beach, everywhere. T-mobile had issues, but worked in the lobby consistently. There is an internet cafe in the lobby area that seemed always busy, and there is wi-fi access in the lobby if you have your laptop. I forget how much, but it was reasonable. We were a party of 4 adults and 3 children. We would definitely return to this resort.", "Date": "August 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cParadise in the Jungle...?\u201d", "Author": "Sarin69", "ReviewID": "UR8503771", "Content": "We got out of Cancun the day before they closed the airport due to Hurricane Dean. The airport was a mad house of fleeing tourists and locals trying to secure the buildings from harm. I am glad and relieved that the area was spared and the reefs are able to continue growing. My heart goes out to all those who lost loved ones and possessions due to the storm. I found the Iberostar Toucan to be a beautifully landscaped nature friendly resort. They have various native species living on the grounds and freely roaming the resort. There are Giant Tortoises, Toucans, Parrots, Iguanas, Anoles, Snakes (rarely seen), Flamingos, Peacocks, and others. The biggest draw for me was the native troop of about 17 Black Howler Monkeys that call the jungle within the resort their territory. We spoke with a guest services representative that explained how some people have worked there for a long time and never saw any monkeys. I found that hard to believe because we saw them several times and they were amazing to watch. The rooms are very nice and comfortable and the food is good although there could be a lot more variation over the week. Do not go to the Bonsai Japanese restaurant. You get to pick from a few standard style restaurants at the resort. The food at Bonsai was horrible and the seats are so uncomfortable it is impossible to enjoy. I recommend the Italian Gondola and Tropical Uxmal for the best food. I found it difficult to get a room away from the noise of the activity area where they entertain every night. It was a lot of bass sound and it was annoying until it ended at around 11 pm or a little later. I wanted to get up early and I was unable to sleep. The resort gave us another room in the sister resort called Iberostar Quetzal and away from the activity area. After the move, we ended up hearing noise from the resort next to us. It was a lot nicer and I was very satisfied with the move. A bonus of the move is that we saw more monkeys on the Quetzal side and mostly at dusk when they are out to feed. They have a great dive center right on the resort grounds and the instructors are top notch. I would bring my own gear if possible since there stuff is a little rough like a mask that kept breaking, etc. It is a very safe and fun sport to try on a vacation. I would recommend this resort to anyone who wants a stress free all-inclusive experience. I do not do these very often, but when I do, it is a treat. Another bonus is having Playa Del Carmen right down the road and ferries there to Cozumel Island. The ride to and from the airport is quicker than if one chose a resort down toward Tulum. I will post some pictures of the resort and surrounding areas. I went with an Apple Vacations tour package and was not impressed with the Apple Representatives at the Iberostar. All they want to do is sell you their trips. They will claim to be having an orientation, yet it turns out to be a big sales ploy and no information about the resort is given. I would skip it entirely. Use the resorts excursions and dive center.

We arrived late, due to delay of USAir in Philadelphia. After trying to escape the timeshare salesman inside the airport, who tried to convince us they were our tour guides (Olympus Tours). Please beware of the \"Tourist Advisors\" in the airport. Once we completed the nearly hour trip in the pouring rain, everything went much smoother once we arrived at the hotel. The weather mostly great except that one rain storm. We checked into our room, Building 13 on the second floor. The balcony had a view mostly of the jungle and a bit of the kiddie area. It was beautiful and private. The bed was hard, but suprisingly comfortable. I did not wake up with back aches like I usually do in hotels. The tile floors and showers were great, so clean and polished to a gleaming shine. We had a problem with the toilet backing up the first morning, but we called maintenance and had it fixed in less than an hour. We got a fruit basket on our arrival and free iberostar tshirts with a card congratulating us on our wedding. We tipped the maid and waitstaff in the buffet, I know it wasn't required but we felt it was necessary after reading in a guidebook, most mexicans make only $10 a day. After tipping what we considered small amount. We were pampered by the maids, extra towels, flower petals on the bed, the made our room a romantic heaven. We spent two days exploring the resort. We spent two afternoons on the beach. One day each at Xcaret, Tulum, Playa del Carmen and exploring Playacar. The aviary at Playacar was beautiful. Loved Xcaret and Tulum. The breakfasts and dinners at the buffet were great. Lunch wasn't quite as good. Loved the pool, the beach area, and the beach bar. The coconut and mango ice creams were wonderful sweet treats on a hot day. My husband bought a beautiful tropical bouquet for me, it arrived midweek and was lovely. Portions in the room service menu were a bit small. Ordered apple pie to split with my husband and it ended up being only 2\" round. Loved the paint your own pottery, made a great frame to display our honeymoon photo. All in all it was a wonderful trip and we can not wait to go back on our 5, 10 or 25th anniversary.

We stayed from August 6-13, 2007. It was our honeymoon. Were both Canadian from the greater Toronto area. My wife is a 32 year old teacher and I'm a 38 year old firefighter. This website was an invaluable wealth of information so we want to reciprocate and share our experience. PRICE: Watched the prices for 6 months on websites Expedia and itravel2000 prior to booking. Paid $1150 CANADIAN plus taxes per person for a one week stay. We researched other hotels in the Playacar area including the RIU properties (which had comparable prices). Royal Hideaway was easily $1200 more per person during the same week. Our tour operator was Signature Vacations. FLIGHT TO CANCUN: We stayed at the Marriott Toronto Airport the evening prior to our flight. This included a shuttle to the airport and parking for 8 days. $130 CANADIAN including taxes. Money well spent. Shuttle picked us up at 4:15 AM. No problems. Flight was 3.5 hours with Skyservice. Provided in-flight movie, breakfast and continual update via monitor of flight location, altitude and speed. Nice touch. Flight was comfortable. Purchased headphones for $5 CANADIAN which we used for our return flight. No complaints. Landed at 9:30 AM Cancun time. CANCUN AIRPORT: No problem collecting luggage. Breezed through customs. Time share operators were waiting to pounce just beyond customs. Ignore them. Why mix business with pleasure? Just followed the Signature vacations signs. Right beside the bus station a palapa hut sold Corona for $5 US. TRANSPORTION TO RESORT: Iberostar Tucan/Quetzal is about 60 minutes (51 km) from the airport. Was contemplating taking a cab. Spoke with our Signature representative. He assured us we would be dropped off at our resort first. Everybody else on the bus (26 passengers) were going to the Tulum area which was south about 2 hours away. Very organized. Tour rep spoke during the drive and provided valuable tips and insight about the area. Drive to Playacar down the 307 Federal highway was an eye-opener. Very impoverished countryside. HOTEL LOCATION: Located in gated resort community of Playacar on the southside of Playa Del Carmen. Beautiful homes, golf course, condos and at least a dozen other all-inclusive resorts. Iberostar Tucan/Quetzal is bordered by the RIU Yucatan and Sandos Playacar. 5 minute/ $5 US cab ride to town of Playa Del Carmen. All the hotels in Playacar have a security gate which you must pass through in order to enter the front of the property. Just show your wristband. Basically a gated-community-within-a-gated-community. We always felt safe and comfortable. CHECK-IN: Wow! Palapa covered open air lobby is incredible. Arrived at 11 AM fully expecting to sit by the pool until our room was ready as check-in is at 3 PM. Surprise. Room was ready. E-mailed the hotel prior to arrival to request a property map. Requested building 24 (Quetzal side), second or third floor, overlooking the jungle via e-mail. Replied they cannot guarantee a specific building but would attempt. Request was granted. Were greeted with a lovely beverage while we completed our check-in. Had our larger $US bills broken down into smaller $US denominations for tips. No problem and didn't have to mess around with pesos all week. ACCOMODATION: Beautiful, spacious room with a high ceiling. Huge walk-in shower. King size bed was firm but comfortable. Didn't require the foam eggcrate. Pillows were a little hard. Air conditioning didn't go below 20 degrees celcius but temperature was very comfortable for sleeping. Ceiling fan. Iron. TV which picked up CNN and ESPN. Electronic safe. Mini-bar that contained 4 beers, 4 bottled waters and various flavored soft drinks. Balcony that overlooked the spectacular jungle. Impressive. Balcony had a rack to dry your swimsuit. Due to the humidity you were better off hanging swimsuits in the closet. Was warned about the slight musty odour in the rooms (no doubt due to the humidity). Brought along a couple of airwicks that solved that problem. Note: Buildings 24-26 (Quetzal side) and 14-15 (Tucan side) have rooms that face the jungle. We detected a constant sewage-type odor coming from the neighboring RIU Yucatan as we strolled past building 22. RIU Yucatan evening entertainment is quite loud and could be heard in your room if you were in building 21-23 facing their property. Building 26 (Quetzal) and 15 (Tucan) are very close to the Iberostar evening entertainment plalapa and would be noisy if you planned on being in bed before 11 PM. More so if your room faced the property inwards. After 11 PM you can shoot a cannon through the resort. Very quiet. I can't comment on any noise emitting from the Sandos resort neighboring the Tucan side. ROOM SERVICE: No complaints. Left $2 US everyday for the maid. Fridge was always restocked and a different towel animal on the bed everyday. Delivered a fruit basket to the room and dinner reservation confirmations the first afternoon while we were at the beach. Left the maid a note requested extra pillows. Never received them so we \"borrowed\" more pillows from the maid station for the duration of our stay. No problem. Noticed they were up cleaning the rooms early in the morning. Left the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign on the door until we went to the beach as we noticed they started housekeeping duties very early in the AM. Always came back to a clean room. Lots of towels. Spoke with an American woman who neglected to leave her engagement ring in the safe. Was most pleased to have found it right were she had left it. FACILITIES: Beautiful. Amazing. Huge resort. Technically two resorts in one with shared facilities. Tucan on the right. Quetzal on the left. Property must be 300 m wide and 1 km deep. Has ten 3-storey, villa-style, palapa covered buildings. Each villa is divided in half so that the units either face the property inwards toward the jungle/pool area or outwards toward the neighboring properties.The two buildings that house the junior suites are literally 30 feet from the ocean (Caribbean Sea). There is an incredible jungle in the middle of the property with lit walkways (not high heel friendly). The Quetzal part of the hotel is made of raised walkways and terraces over the natural tropical forest. Lots of widlife roaming around. We saw monkeys (swinging from the trees), peacocks, tucans, swans, iguanas and agouti's (looks similar to a large wild guinea pig). We spoke with an American family who had spotted the monkeys on their balcony. We tried to lure some to our balcony by placing some fruit out. Attracted nothing but birds. Grounds are impeccable. Staff is continually cleaning, polishing, raking and cutting. Four pools. A wading pool for kids. A 30 x 50 pool which is used for volleyball, basketball, water polo, swimming laps. It was salt water and very warm. A stunningly huge pool that was close to the beach. It wrapped around the lunch buffet buildings. It was salt water and very warm. Swim-up bar pool was freshwater, refreshingly cool, had a waterfall and surrounded by jungle. Twice took advantage of the daily free scuba diving in the main pool. Two gift shops (USA Today is $4 US). Internet service is $2 US for 15 minutes. Massage palapas by the pool. Gym and spa near the Tucan lobby beside the tennis courts. The disco was being used for a wedding reception the night we poked our heads in. On site dive shop (Dressels) for booking dive excursions, free snorkel rentals, catamarans and kyaks. At night, cigars were rolled in the lobby and vendors selling Mayan artwork and silver jewellery. BEACH: Breathtaking. Outstanding. Incredible. Without a doubt is the best in Playacar. Great breeze blowing off the ocean. Incredible sand. Turquoise blue warm water. Roped off area to keep away jet skis, parasail boats, kayaks and catamarans. Our preferred spot was literally 10 feet from the waters edge. No problem securing a lounge chair. Just placed our towels and umbrella (complimentary at the towel hut) at our location around 8:30 AM. People were obviously out much earlier securing palapas along the pool or the beach. Didn't bother us in the least bit. Plenty of spots available and wanted to be as close to the ocean as possible. Was there to relax and wasn't getting up early to play the towel game. Even when we arrived our first day at 11 AM there was no problem getting a lounge chair on the beach. Everyday we would be at the beach by 10 AM and it was starting to get busy. The occasional topless woman provided a European influence. A few vendors walking the beach selling sunglasses, silver rings, necklaces and cigars. Didn't hassle you. Same vendors everyday. People offering to have your picture taken with monkeys, iguanas, parrots (prints available at the lobby photo shop for $8 US after 4 PM). Parasailing. Same vendors everyday. Easy to barter with. Paid $45 US each. A jetski shuttles you to the main boat. Incredible. What a view. My wife loved it. Money well spent. Jetski driver shamelessly asked for a tip when he dropped us back off at the beach. Never gave him one. Went for a daily walk. You are able to walk the beach along all the properties without a hassle. Police are present as well as hotel security. When facing the ocean, walk to the right (past the neighboring Sandos Playacar). This is undeveloped land. Feels like your stranded on a deserted island. Walk about 10 minutes to the only piece of rock sitting on the beach. There is a small reef in 3 feet of water. Tons of tropical fish. Took advantage of the daily free one-hour snorkel gear offered by the Iberostar on-site dive shop (Dressels). Bring bread with you from the buffet and you'll be surrounded by lots of fish. Walk to the left and you'll be at the RIU Yucatan. My wife noticed they didn't have palapas or umbrellas but tilted extra lounge chairs for shade. They do have palm trees that are about 40 meters away from the ocean. As you near the end of of the RIU Yucatan property you notice an unbelievable amount of beach erosion. Sadly the remaining properties towards Playa Del Carmen virtually have no beach. I'm told this is from Hurricane Wilma in 2005. The beaches are being held together by sandbags and are using some type of large hose coming from the ocean in an attempt to fill their property with sand. This includes the RIU Palace, RIU Palace Riviera Maya and Royal Hideaway. Glad we did our research and stayed at the Iberostar. Those who are ambitious could walk along the beach into Playa Del Carmen. We never went any further than the last hotel (Reef Playacar) as we were tired of climbing the sandbags and it turns into residential area for the remaining few hundred meters before the ferry dock. You could see across the ocean to Cozumel and the docked cruise ships. Observed the Iberostar staff setting up for a wedding on the beach. Held on the fringe of the property beside the Sandos Playacar resort. Beautiful location. We never witnessed the ceremony but later overheard the bridezilla in the photoshop complaining about the order of the pictures in her photo album. BARS: Smartest move we made was bringing 52-ounce thermal mugs to the beach. Saved us from having to make many trips to the beach bar for refills. Also took them with us when we went for walks. Immediately tipped the bartenders at the beach bar $5 US to set the tone early. They were very generous with the alcohol and always happy to see us. We tipped them $2 US everytime we refilled our mugs. We actually had to tell them to go easy on the booze as the drinks were too strong. Everybody else drank from the plastic tumblers provided. Drank plenty of delicious tropical drinks all week. They had beach cocktail service as you relaxed in your lounge chair but I didn't see the drinks coming very quick. It was extremely hot and we were thirsty. No bottled beer (just draft). The beach bar also had seven different flavours of ice cream. Cup or cone. We took advantage of this everyday. The two lobby bars were beautiful. They would have some type of entertainment (soothing acoustic guitar). We preferred the Quetzal side. Tipped the bartender $2 US and they were most appreciative. The high-end liquor was kept here and on display. Bombay Gin, Absolute Vodka, etc. Made great cappucinos and Mojitos. We usually had one drink here before we caught a cab to Play Del Carmen. The swim-up bar was quite refreshing. Cool fresh water. Adults only. Never busy. Tipped them $2 US and they were grateful. FOOD: Made reservations for three-of-the-five specialty a-la-carte restaurants via e-mail prior to our arrival. Request granted. No problem. Our reservations were for 8:30 PM as we weren't in a hurry and wanted to relax. We had such a great time in Playa Del Carmen our first night that we realized that our dinner plans were too late in the evening. Spoke with the public relations desk the following morning and had them bumped up to 6:30 AM. No problem again. Note: They are quite strict about the reservation times. If you are 15 minutes late you lose your reservation. We ate at the following specialty a-la-carte restaurants and have ranked them based on preference. 1) Steakhouse (La Marimba): Open air located poolside. Actually is the poolside lunch buffet that is converted to fine dining in the evening. Buffet appetizers. Had a huge 12-oz filet with baked potato. Delicious and cooked to perfection. Played background country music until we were serenaded by a three-piece acoustic band. Really enjoyed ourselves. Service was excellent. Daniel our server spoke excellent English. 2) Japanese (Bonsai): We were waiting as they opened the doors at 6:30 PM. Air conditioned. Long pants required for gentleman. Sat at a big table with about 20 people. Had sushi for an appetizer. Food is prepared in the middle of the table right in front of you. Chef puts on quite a show. Flipping knives, eggs, food in your mouth, food in his chef hat. Almost like dinner theatre. It was a good show. I had the beef and my wife octopus. Tasty. 3) Mexican (La Hacienda): Air conditioned. Long pants for gentleman. Buffet appetizers. Had the tortilla soup and beef tacos. My wife's steak was slightly overcooked so we knew to under order when we attended the steakhouse. Everything was flavorful. Had our pictures taken wearing sombreros. Buffets were good but not great. They're all palapa covered, open-air. No flies but the occasional bird would fly through and scoop food from the garbage. Breakfast was always decent. Lots of selection. Could always find something to eat. Dinner was the same. Lots of variety. Would have ice sculptures at night. You would literally see them melt due to the humidity. One night they had crab legs. Salsa and guacamole was fantastic. As with every all-inclusive we found the buffets to get tiring after a week. Cheese at the buffet was sweating because of the temperature. My wife wasn't picky and enjoyed herself. She liked the good variety of fish and squid. She also enjoyed the selection of Mexican specialty desserts, especially the Glorias. Lunch buffet is located poolside and also had a large BBQ pit on the beach. We always left a $2 US tip to our servers. This included breakfast and dinner. They're didn't appear to be a lot of servers during the lunch hour. It was more relaxed as everybody was in swimsuits. No worries as everybody helped themselves. There is a midnight buffet that went from 11 PM-4 AM. The selection was minimal and the dishes were a repeat of dinner service. We would usually grab something on our way back from town before bedtime. We never took advantage of room service. ACTIVITIES/ENTERTAINMENT: One morning we walked to the RIU Tequila (across the street to the right) and rented bikes. The security guard at the gate will direct you. $4 US for an hour. $1 US each additional hour. That includes a bike lock. Note: Bike only has one gear. Rode to the nearby Plaza Playacar. Just a strip mall with various stores (USA Today was still $4 US). Rode past the RIU Palace and RIU Place Riviera Maya. Huge wow factor from the road. Looks like a hotel you would find in Vegas (Bellagio, Ceasars) but on a smaller scale. Too bad they don't have a great beach and I wasn't impressed with the TripAdvisor reviews. RIU Tequila isn't on the beach but they have a walkway alongside the RIU Palace that leads to the ocean. Rode into Playa Del Carmen (10 minute bike ride). 5th Avenue is quiet during the day. In the afternoon there was always some form of scheduled activity going on at beach within close proximity to the bar. Mechanical bull riding, salsa dancing, a live band playing bongos, a dance contest, beach volleyball and bocci. None of these activities were intrusive. You didn't feel obligated to participate nor was it so loud that it would be disruptive if you were only interested in relaxing. I occasionally observed out of morbid curiousity. We made use of the free SCUBA diving that was offered in the pool as well as the gratis snorkel gear for an hour. The ocean was substantially calmer in the mornings. Complimentary catamaran and kayaks were also available but we didn't partake. There is a huge open-air palapa in the center of the resort used for nightly variety shows. We never attended as we opted to go into Playa Del Carmen. Occasionally we would be back in time to catch the final few minutes. Quite surprised by the large audience. The performers were very friendly. Organized all the daytime activities and chatted with everybody beside the pool. They tried to coerce us at 11 PM to go club-hopping in Cancun one evening. We declined. Too old and too tired. WEATHER: Fantastic. 47 degrees celcius everyday (factoring in the humidex). It was very hot and obviously humid. People who have complained on Tripadvisor regarding the heat make me laugh. What would you expect in Mexico during the summer? Sunny everyday. Had to be near water to cool off or near the ocean with the strong breeze. Occasionally heard thunder and saw lightening across the ocean. Rained only one night at 9 PM. Torrential downpour for 5 minutes. Dried up in a half hour. Were initially concerned about hurricane season when booking. Wasn't even a factor. Bring a hat, sunscreen, sunglasses and seek shade often. Sat in the sun for 15 minute intervals. CLIENTELE: Spoke with many nice people from all over the world. Lots of Americans and Europeans. People were friendly but not intrusive. Everybody was having fun yet well behaved. Some topless European women on the beach. No big deal. Lots of couples and families. Kids were very well behaved and mostly hung out near the pool area. Resort is quiet at night. Wouldn't recommend for those seeking a party-spring-break-atmosphere. Spoke with an American couple in the lobby while waiting for a cab. This was their eighth time at this resort. PLAYA DEL CARMEN/ FIFTH AVENUE: Awesome. Great atmosphere. Very cosmopolitan. Must do list is stroll down Quinta Avenida (Fifth Avenue) in the evening. This is a cobblestone (hard to walk in heels), pedestrian-traffic-only walkway lined with an eclectic mix of silver jewellery stores, outdoor cafes, clothing stores, restaurants, flea markets, lounges, pharmacies, street performers, mariachi bands and cigar shops. Starbucks, McDonalds, Johnny Rockets, Senor Frogs, Carlos and Charlies are thrown in the mix. USA Today was still $4 US. My wife went into sensory overload marvelling at the spectacle. Initially overwhelming. Tons of tourists and a great spot to people watch and enjoy the evening air. We went to 5th Avenue almost every night from 8:30 PM-11 PM. 5 minute/$5 US cab ride from the resort. Note: Most cabs are air conditioned and drive very fast. It's a 25 minute walk from the resort but the street in Playacar isn't lit at night. We did see numerous people walking into town. We would get dropped off at the beginning of 5th (near the McDonalds). You could purchase a cold Corona at any of the stores for $1 US or bring bottled beer from your room and meander the shops and streets with beverage in hand. Make sure to pick up a free copy of Quinta magazine. We found it in a tobacco shop. Provides invaluable information about the Playa Del Carmen area. Police presence at every intersection ensured you always felt safe and comfortable. We never observed any trouble. 5th Avenue is about 2 km long. Most of the nicer restaurants with outdoor cafes are located near the end (corner of 5th and 12th). Lots of mariachi bands. Looked at all the menus for the restaurants that interested us. Our last night we ate dinner at Di Vino. Made the reservation three nights prior and requested a specific table right on the street. Table was waiting for us when we arrived. Started to rain as we were eating our appetizers. Staff immediately covered all the outdoor furniture and hustled everyone inside. Downpour lasted 5 minutes and dried within a half hour. Finished our meal inside and had dessert and coffee outdoors. Relaxed with a cigar that was handrolled by a gentleman in front of Morgan's tobacco shop. Great meal. Highly recommend. Service was excellent and waiter kept on apologizing about the brief rainfall and having to move inside. No problem. They can't control the weather. Total bill was $105 US including drinks and wine. Left him a $30 US tip. Were serenaded during dessert by a few mariachi bands. Would slip them a few $US dollars. Another guy showed up with a guitar to muscle his way in. At that point in time we were done with the mariachi and wanted to go for a drink elsewere. I slipped him $1 US to go away and he was offended because he expected more money. Caused a minor stink. Woman from Madrid, Spain was sitting across the street at another restaurant and came over and told him off. Spoke to him in both English and Spanish and told him he was rude. We were thankful and watched him sulk off and harrass other patrons. Note: The mariachi bands aren't employed by any specific restaurants. They just roam the streets playing and hoping for a tip from tourists. Head towrds the ocean at the corner of 5th and 12th. Lots of interesting bars including the Blue Parrot. They have a nightly fire show on the beach at 11:30 PM. Its worth a look and beer is $3 US. Apparently this bar was built in 1984, unfortunately their still playing music from that decade. Note: Blue Parrot employs a plane that flies up and down the beach dragging a banner behind it advertising the fire show starting at 10:30 PM. It's a scam and feeble attempt to fill the bar. We always caught a cab in front of the Blue Parrot back to resort. Still only $5 US and saved us from having to walk back down the entrance to 5th (near the McDonalds). One of the best part of 5th are the numerous silver jewellery stores. They usually have guys sitting out front on plastic chairs inviting you in. They'll even offer you a shot of Tequila. We even heard the stereotypical, \"Hey Mister. Want to meet my sister?\" Hilarious. Nothing is marked with a price tag. You have to ask. Everything is negotiable. Bring a calculator. Tell them you'll pay in $US. Offer them some ridiculous price. They might get offended. They might ask to see your money. They don't want you to pay with a credit card. One guy asked us to leave as he didn't like our offer. No problemo. We ended up buying the exact same piece from him 3 days later at our lowball price. If you find something you like.....keep going back. You have all week. My wife bought 3 rings from 3 different stores all for substantially discounted rates from their initial quote. One of them, they initially wanted $80 US and she purchased it for $20 US. No doubt their still making money. Note: Make sure the silver is stamped 925 (this ensures its authenticity). Best part....NO TAX. COZUMEL: One of the reasons for a Mexican honeymoon was a snorkel trip to Cozumel. They have the second largest reef system in the world. We researched many dive shops over the internet. Wildcat, Papa Hogs, Blue Angel (great web site that shows the reefs) and Eagle Ray. All of the these outfits are located in Cozumel with comparable prices. Went with Dressels which is located on our resort. They made it so easy. Arranged all the transportation and wristbands for entrance to the reefs. A dozen of us travelled in a group with a guide. Most of our group was diving. Picked us up at 8:15 AM. Caught the 9 AM ferry to Cozumel. Ferry ride is air conditioned and was 40 minutes. Docked in San Miguel which is a busy port for cruise ships. Stepped off the ferry and walked 30 feet across the pier to a dive boat waiting for us. That boat shuttled us to the Dressels dive shop located at Iberostar Cozumel (40 minute boat ride). This is near the southern tip of the island and within spitting distance of the reefs we would snorkel. The boat ride gave us a great vantage point to observe the barren, uninhabitated low tropical forest, damage from 2005 Hurricane Wilma and lack of beach on the western shore. Glad we did our research and never stayed in Cozumel. Landed at the Iberostar Cozumel pier (lots of marine life visible), collected our gear and off we went. Snorkelers had their own guide. We visited two reefs for 45 minutes each. Columbia and Planacar. Incredible. Great visibility. Bring an underwater canmera. Saw many tropical fish, coral, barracuda, small sharks and crab. Well worth the trip. Back on the boat for something to eat (fruit) and drink (water). Returned to the Iberostar Cozumel for a lunch buffet in their open air palapa by the pool. Virtually the same food as our resort. We also had time to wander the grounds. Small villas with hammocks, very tiny rooms (compared to Iberostar Tucan/Quetzal) and no atmosphere. A perfect spot if you were looking for quiet solitude. The resort is neighbored by unsettled land. We spotted many iguanas and flamingos roaming the property. Probably a great place to stay if your a diving enthusiast. After lunch we visted La Francesa Reef which is right in front of the Iberostar Cozumel. Didn't see as much marine life but quite a strong current. 45 minutes later we returned all of our equipment to the Iberostar Cozumel and hustled to catch the 5 PM ferry back to Playa Del Carmen. On the return trip spoke with a local who had been an exchange student in Canada. Suggested we rent a car and visit the Tulum ruins and snorkel a cenote on the mainland. Will do that next time. Great trip, long day and would highly recommend to do at least once. DEPARTURE: We never attended the welcome briefing but we did speak to our Signature rep earlier in the week who informed us of our 6:40 AM departure time. Signiture has a kiosk in the Tucan lobby. She was available if you had any questions. As we made our way to the buffet we saw many small bats flying around at 6 AM. Were picked up by a van right on time and made one pit 30 minutes later. Stop to pick up two other couples at the El Dorado Royale. Had plenty of time to meander the Cancun airport before our 10:30 AM flight. Prices in the duty free were quite cheap for booze: $15 US for a litre of Bombay Gin. Other things not so cheap: Pringles $5 US. USA Today $4.50 US. A woman turned to me in line and asked if she had read the price correctly. Flight home was great. Waited 2 minutes for the Marriott Toronto Airport shuttle. Everything flowed surprisingly smooth. OVERALL EXPERIENCE: Rave reviews. We had a great time. Very relaxing holiday. Fun place to stay. Plenty to do or not to do. Staff was wonderful. Great beach and location. Brought lots of $US dollars for tips. If not staying in the ocean view junior suites, request a jungle facing room. Great value for our money.

We had booked our reservations at the Tucan many months before...but when we arrived we were given rooms in the Quetzal. I had specifically asked for the tucan and did not get my request...so I did make a point to request a change, but there was nothing available ...but as we walked around the grounds we actually liked the Quetzal side more...the waterfall and woodplanked pathways were beautiful, very tropical. Our rooms (we had 2 rooms next to each other) were nice...clean, on the second floor and were in a good area...we were not too far from anything, right in the middle of the resort. We were close enough to the pool and beach and close enough to the food and activities. It was a few minute walk no matter where you went... Which we needed after all we ate! We were in building 25 and we felt like it was fine. From our room we also saw so many monkeys in the trees outside our balcony. They were amazing! Every morning (I woke up early, around 5:30-6:00) and the sound that came from the trees was like a loud roar...like a gorilla!!!! But it was only a small monkey..very freaky at first, until you got used to it. Some of the people that I met from the Tucan side had not seen or heard the monkeys...so we were glad we did. Looking back on our vacation, it was mostly good memories...a few frustrating moments...like having our towels, book and floating tube taken from our spot...never to be found again...and we looked and asked...but nothing...but we got a few good laughs about the whole thing with some great people...Heidi and Barbara...who gave me a new book and their extra towels...you guys are the best!!!! Be careful of the towel situation...it was amazing how frustrating it could get...bring a couple of your own towels. My boys enjoyed the Star friends so much...and it is hard to please a 19 year old and 11 year old in the same trip...they were GREAT!!! Thanks for everything. So all in all this trip was a success...great place for families...alittle crowded for my husband and myself... but we enjoyed ourselves! Food was good...to fair depending on where you ate...service is great, people are so nice. We would definatly choose Iberostar again...maybe in a different part of the world since we have been to this area a couple times already...who knows...we may be back!

My husband and I have been to sever AIs, including Sandals in Jamaica and the Divi in Aruba. This place is awesome, and for the price, you can't beat what you get. I joked with my husband that if we hit the lottery, we'd live here. I won't go into details that have been told in previous posts. However, we did do the Catamaya catamaran snorkeling cruise. The boat itself is nice, but the food is bad and the snorkeling is like swimming a marathon. We hardly saw any fish, the reef wasn't that great, and there were so many people in the water that you were constantly getting kicked or pushed around. I enjoyed snorkeling much better at Sandals where they take 5 or 6 people in a small boat and you go on your own for a while. Here, there were probably 40 people in the water and we swam through so fast that it wasn't even enjoyable. The crew is very good though, and very entertaining towards the end. But I still would not go again or recommend this tour to anyone. The beach at the Tucan is still great, although much more crowded than I remembered. You do need to get up early to reserve a chair and umbrella at the beach. Forget about the pool, those people must put a towel on the chair before they go to bed. It is much breezier at the ocean though, and the one afternoon we sat by the pool we were baking in the sun without a breeze. We got to the beach around 8am and all the palapas were taken. Thankfully, we always found 4 chairs in the first row of the beach because I refuse to get up any earlier on vacation. By 10am, all the umbrellas were gone at the towel hut. Rude people will literally shove their beach chair in between the three feet that is your personal space from the people next to you so they literally end up sitting on top of you. Then, when the sun moved, you couldn't even sit in your own shade, so you'd have to reposition the umbrella. Each time it happened to us there was plenty of space behind them a few feet back, but they insisted on shoving their chair into the first row. This year, we walked south, away from the resorts and it is beautiful. We didn't do that last year, but after reading recent reviews on it we decided to give it a try. It is well worth an hour or so to walk the deserted, beautiful beach. I wish I was still there now. We have some really nice pictures and video. Also, it's so quiet because you are away from all the people at the resort and there aren't as many boats and jet skis. It was on of the highlights of our trip, but we love long walks on the beach. The food is very good, although I think the buffet had more to choose from last year. But it was still very good this year, just maybe not as much to pick from. We ate at the steakhouse, mexican and japanese sit downs and they were all excellent, even better than I remembered from last year. Of the AIs we have visited, this one is by far our favorite and the only one we've been back to more than once. We're going to try someplace else next time, outside of Mexico, but I'm sure we'll return to the Tucan again in the future (hopefully near future).", "Date": "August 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Old Bridge", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful resort, great shows, service and beach, needs better buffet selection\u201d", "Author": "BBMMOldBridge", "ReviewID": "UR8430010", "Content": "My boyfriend and I just got back from vacationing at the Tucan from Sat, August 4 to Sat, Aug 11,2007. We have stayed at an Iberostar in Punta Cana(2005) and thought we'd try the Tucan in Playa Del Carmen this time, (we stayed at the Palladiium in Rivera Maya in 2004, liked that as well, bigger resort, lots of walking to get anywhere). Over all, we had a great time. We traveled with Apple (good choice). The bad thing about going through Apple is that once you get your bags, you have to wait for a coach bus and then wait for it to get filled, then drop everyone off at their hotels. Ours was the last stop, it took close to 2 1/2 hours for us to get there. We landed close to noon, didn't get to our room until 5ish. A long day. Room- Our room was ready with the king bed we requested and was located in Building 15. It was really a great location. We were close to the restaurants and where all the nightly entertainment took place. It was about a 3 minute walk to the pool and beach. I'd say building 14 is the best place to be if you can request one. Our cleaning girl, Flor, was great and left us plenty of towels and gave us extra pillows. The beds are hard but we loved them and slept well every night. The pillows are eh, not like your own, but ok. We stayed on the top floor (steps to walk) and still had little bugs on the dresser the whole time we were there. Don't leave out food. They really didn't bother us though. The air was GREAT and the shower was awesome. I went to the dollar store and bought nail polish and hair stuff to leave with my $2 tip daily for Flor. She was very appreciative and always made our room look pretty. Tip- Bring an umbrella in case it rains to walk around the hotel. It rained a few times and we got soaked. Beach- Our first day on the beach was not as relaxing as we had hoped, there was several weddings going on and the guests got a bit loud in the water. It was bad enough that several people we met were going to complain if they were there the next day (which they were'nt so we were happy). The beach was smaller then ones we have experienced in the past but was very nice. The water is warm and the color is an endless shade of blue. The sand is wonderful and is so light that you don't have to worry about burning your feet. We did not really go to the pool, we are beach people but, it is very pretty. The water is very warm and is deep if you are under 5'5\" like me. I had to get towed on my boyfriends back. We did go down every morning around 730am to get a place to lay on the beach. They have plenty of umbrellas if you need. We suggest bringing a raft from home to float on in the ocean and a good mask for the kids if you bring them. Bring plenty of sunscreen!! Dining- We planned 2 nights at the Japanese (a must) and one at the Steak House (a MUST). Both we excellent, liked the Steak house better. The breakfast buffet was excellent, a lot to offer and good food. We did not do the lunch buffet since we were at the beach everyday, all day. The food at the pool/beach bar was ok, nothing great really. The dinner buffet was very dissapointing. Monday night my boyfriend got very sick. He was out of commision all day Tues. From then on, we really had to watch what we ate, we were scared of getting sick. We found out on Tues and Wed that many guests got sick Monday night and some went to the on-site Dr to get meds or went to the local hospital to get an IV. They were all fine and seemed to enjoy the rest of their stay. As far as the dinner buffet, it really was very boring. I am not a picky eater and I had a hard time finding food that looked appealing to eat. We stuck with the chicken, rolls, potatoes, etc, stayed bland. The dessert was nothing great either, ice cream on the beach was yum-yum. We liked the food at the Palladium better. Overall, we really loved the resort. It is truly beautiful and the staff is wonderful, funny and always willing to help. The size of the resort is great (smaller then our past vacations). The shows were the BEST we have seen and we met great people there as well. We plan on taking the kids back next year, we just have to figure out the dining situation. One more note, we did use the gym daily for those of you who work out, it was clean and had a great selection (air too!!)

We had a great time and the Tucan was really nice. I\u2019ll break it down in sections and try to give you some info based on our stay in relation to the accommodations, food, beach, and drinks. I posted some pictures you will want to check out too. This will be a long review, but I will put info in it I was looking for when trying to figure out where to go. There are a million places and if you\u2019ve never been there, you really feel like you\u2019re taking a chance. The Room We paid the extra money to stay in a beachfront Jr. suite and felt it was worth it. Of course, we don\u2019t really know what the other rooms are like, but when we go to the beach, we want to see the beach from our room. If you don\u2019t care about that, don\u2019t spend the extra bucks. Although being right by the beach made it real convenient for reserving beach chairs, going back to the room for beer, or to use the bathroom. By the way, you can get front row beach chairs at 8:00 AM. The first chairs to go are under the cabanas away from the water. Who wants that? Get an umbrella from the towel room and get down by the waves! The room was clean and pretty good sized. We went with another couple and spent at least some of most evenings in the same room playing cards. Unit 10 sits right on the beach and we were in room 1021. Our friends were in room 1026, which was a little bigger and had a better view. Try to get it if you can. The beds were firm, but with enough free drinks, who cares? It actually helped my back, which was hurting when I got there. The mini bar was weak at best. It was just a small refrigerator that barely kept things cool, but I\u2019ll get into that when I tell you about the drink situation. The Resort Everything was very clean and well maintained. Lots of pools, but we only got in one because we are beach people. The swim up bar is the one we got in and it was okay, but we would much rather see the beautiful water, sand, and people than to hang out in a pool where you know nobody ever leaves to take a leak. Only a couple of restaurants were air conditioned, but after you\u2019re there a couple of days, you get used to it. It\u2019s Mexico and it\u2019s supposed to be hot. I will say that we never really noticed it while on the beach. There was always a breeze and the water was great. There was lots of stuff to do, I guess, but we just ate, drank, and played cards so I\u2019m not a good source on the shows and other activities. I\u2019m not much into shows anyway. The jungle walks were pretty cool. A few animals you don\u2019t see in the states. The buffet restaurants are full of oversized black birds, but the weird thing is, you never see them crapping on anything. Clean black birds... who would have guessed. The disco was a bit of a joke. We went Friday night at about midnight and the place was dead. Ten people maybe? We still had a good time and got the DJ to play some AC/DC, Def Leppard and The Doors. If you\u2019re looking for a big party resort, Tucan isn\u2019t the place. Everything seems to wrap up early and there are more families than party people. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the families and kids were never an issue, you just have to decide what you want. The Staff Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The other guests were not very friendly though. Maybe it\u2019s the language barrier or maybe it was unfriendly week and we didn\u2019t know it. Tips It says tips are included, but everyone knows you should tip anyway. Take a hundred bucks in ones and give them out one or two at a time. Don\u2019t go crazy with it because some of the staff persons acted like they didn\u2019t want a tip, but that was the exception. Maybe throw the bartender a couple of bucks when you leave for the night and always leave a buck or two for the person cleaning your room. You get a towel animal, which I couldn\u2019t care less about (I would rather have got a couple of extra beers) but it is nice to do, and you\u2019re making someone\u2019s day for only two bucks. Plus, I don\u2019t like to feel like I\u2019m stiffing the person who has total access to everything in our room (except the safe, which was nice). I never felt like I was obligated to leave a tip, but it was fun to do. The Food The food was okay. Nothing great, but not bad either (I gained five pounds if that tells you anything). The buffets did get a little old, but they had gobs to choose from. It\u2019s just the same gobs every day. Don\u2019t expect to go to a place where they have to serve hundreds of people, almost nonstop, and have five star quality food too. I have to believe you are going to a beach resort in Mexico for the beach and not the food. Otherwise, go to New York City or LA and dine and some of the finest restaurants in the country. You only get three regular restaurant dinners if you stay a week. We got on the waiting list, but never got in anywhere else. No big deal. We ate at the Steak place, Japanese place, and Italian place. Best was Japanese, second was Italian, and third was steak. The Drinks The drinks were definitely watered down, but just ask for a floater (extra shot on top) on all frozen drinks and a double in all others. Who cares if they water down the alcohol if they put in as much as you want anyway? I probably drank fifty Big Macs worth of calories in banana coladas that week. I will have to warn you about the Jose Quervo straight up shots though, they do sneak up on. On my last morning, I woke up with sand in my pockets and a pissed off wife. Now, here is my only complaint: the beer. All beer at the restaurants and bars is draft. Draft gives me a killer hangover and is never ice cold. You only get three or four bottled beers every other day in your room (one beer per person per day). I begged and bribed the first day or two and got a few extras, but that wasn\u2019t getting it. The beer they give you \u2018Superior\u2019 isn\u2019t bad, and my favorite is Coors Light, so that tells you it isn\u2019t too heavy. I would have been okay with it, if they gave you what you wanted. All inclusive does NOT include all the bottled beer you want (even if you leave a note and extra tip). The first night we walked to this place right down the road that has some shops and stores. Get ready to bend over on the snacks and beer though. $25 for a twelve pack of Coors Light! Well, it was vacation so I did splurge once, but I immediately found out where a Wal-Mart was and went there for our stash of beer. Take a cab to Playa De Carmen fifth street (don\u2019t walk it like we did unless you don\u2019t mind a 30 to 40 minute walk in the heat) it only cost five bucks. Good shopping and Coors Light is only $12 a twelve pack. Wal-Mart is only a $2 cab ride from Fifth Street and you can get beer and snacks there close to US prices. Make sure you get a Styrofoam cooler while you\u2019re there so you can ice down the beer. Grab a six pack of Carona while you\u2019re at it. It\u2019s fun to say you drank a Carona on the beach in Mexico even if you don\u2019t like it. The Beach The beach was fantastic! From the Tucan south, the beach is unbelievable. Just like a calendar. Not much in the way of resorts and only a few people walking back and forth. Be sure to check out my pictures to see what I\u2019m talking about. The beaches to the north get worse and worse. Some are nothing but fifty feet of sand and a bunch of sand bags. However, guys, tops are optional and you\u2019ll be pressed to see women more beautiful anywhere you go. And to all you guys who get offended because we check out the scantily clad beautiful women... sorry, just can\u2019t help it. Summary: If you are going to Mexico to hang out on a beautiful beach, go to the Tucan or the two resorts just south of it (don\u2019t know the name, sorry). If you\u2019re hung up on great food, don\u2019t go all inclusive. If you like ice cold bottled or canned beer, bite the bullet and go to Wal-Mart and stock up. It\u2019s not that much money and you\u2019ll be happy all week. I will be happy to answer any questions you have about the resort or what to look out for while you\u2019re there. Just email me. I don\u2019t check this site all that often, so it may take a few days to get back with you.

We booked the hotel, flights and transfers all separately. GROUNDS Beautiful! Tucan and Quetzal share all facilities which gives guests more restaurants and bars options. We chose this hotel mainly because of the jungle between Tucan and Quetzal and it was really nice to walk through it when going for breakfast/dinner. There are tucans, turtle, flamingos, iguana, peacocks, pheasants and monkeys. We saw monkeys 3 times \u2013 once a family of three climbed to the balcony in building 15. Weather in June Hot, hot, hot. Rained twice for 15-30 mins very heavily during the day and a few time late at night. Rain didn\u2019t cool us at all. Most of the time we were baking! ROOM We emailed the hotel in advance to request a room in building 12 or 13 facing the pool. We were offered a room on the other side, facing Sandos with an option to move after 3 days. We didn\u2019t move \u2013 room was perfect and quiet. We couldn\u2019t see or hear the other hotel. Trees and plants separate the hotels. The room was very clean and specious. We didn\u2019t have trouble sleeping even that the bed was a bit hard. Minibar was stocked as they felt like it. We had it fully stocked on one occasion- when we forgot to leave a tip! There are hairdryer, iron, ironing board, safe, coffee maker in the room. BEACH Water beautiful, blue, clean and clear sand on the bottom. Most of our stay it was calm, we only had 2 days of big waves which everybody enjoyed. Beach itself was sandy, but very crowded. It\u2019s not the kind of beach were you have space to relax. Sunbeds quite close to each other and you can\u2019t hear the sea because of the noise from entertainment in the pool or beach itself \u2013 which never stops. Most palapas were taken by 7am. . During our 2 weeks stay I would say that the sea took about half a meter of the beach (watching the distance of turtle egg nest from the water which was shorter every day). We also saw a palm tree fell on Riu beach. SWIMMING POOL Very big and pretty with lots of activities going on all the time. We didn\u2019t use swimming pool much. We prefer the beach. Sunbeds were reserved even earlier than on the beach. Swim-up bar was full of drunk people in the early afternoon but was well hidden. FOOD Lots of everything. Buffet was very good \u2013 lots of different dishes, but it\u2019s not air-conditioned which in June was not too comfortable. There was plenty to choose from every day, although some days were quite poor. We tried Japanese, Mexican, Tropical and Italian restaurants. We liked Italian and Japanese. Japanese, Mexican and Italian are air-conditioned and no-smoking. We didn\u2019t have problems with booking restaurants. Lunch at beach buffet offered wide choice too. GYM Gym is basic and non air-conditioned. SPA We used spa once for a great massage. NIGHTLIFE There are shows every night which are really good and well organised. Again heat and lack of air-conditioning made it less pleasant than we expected. We took a taxi to Playa del Carmen a few times. It\u2019s a really nice place with lots of restaurants, cafes and shops. TRIPS We went for 1 day Tulum / Xel-ha trip. Tulum is beautiful. We expected more from Xel-ha park though. We also did Mayan Encounter trip which included Coba, Mayan village, flying zip lines over cenote, rappel into the depths of a cenote, lunch in the Mayan village. What a great day we had! We also did Cozumel snorkelling trip which was fantastic \u2013 3 different spots and lunch at Iberostar Cozumel. Overall It was very nice holiday. The hotel is beautiful but it was too crowded in our view.

The pool was really big so was never over crowded although you had to get up early to get a lounger in a good spot. No problems getting a lounger on the beach. A very good variety of food and always plenty of it any time of day. The restaurants were not what we expected but nice anyway, the steak house was the best. We had read reviews that the drinks were watered down but we found if you asked for named spirits as opposed to local spirits these were fine and we had many a good night. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful, and rooms were cleaned every day to a high standard. Our advice would be to give the maid a tip a couple of time during your stay and your mini bar will be well stocked every day as opposed to every other day. The hotel facilities are really good and the rooms are comfortable, we were really grateful for the air conditioning in the room. Getting around was very easy and unlike some places you do not have to haggle over prices, a taxi into Player de Carmen was $5 or 50 mexican peso's. We visited Xel-Hal, Tulum and swam with Dolphins at Dolphin Discovery, all were excellent especially the Dolphins (highly recommended). We also went to Cozumel and went to Paradise Beach, but we would not recommend this as the beach at Tucan was much better and Cozumel wasn't much to write home about either.

Try to avoid the rooms on the top floor where the thatch overhangs, if at all possible. Secondly, the food quality consistency deteriorated during our second and third weeks - supposedly hot food was cold - which in the event culminated in my getting food poisoning the night before we were due to leave owing to the fact that the Steak in for fishing the Steakhouse was \"Blue\" rather than \"Medium Rare\". The Spa and Beauty Salon are \"too expensive\" - \u00a327.50 for a basic wash and dry - I believe more people would use the hotel's facilities if they were more reasonably priced. Captain Rick's fishing - as a treat, my husband took my son-in-law out for the morning - \u00a3120 - only to be told that it was not really the right time of year for fishing and just spent several hours sailing round the ocean without even a chance to drop the fishing lines - in my vocabulary - that's good money for old rope!!

Go with Apple Vacations - they made it so easy from the time we got off the plane, the shuttle, setting up the excursions, etc. I will always use them again when we travel. Our 2 kids (1 boy and 1 girl - both 14) were amazed at all the wild life. Lizards, flamingos, toucans, chickens, peacocks, we even had 2 monkeys cross our balcony! (see photo) The food is great and the restaurants are wonderful. The buffets were good as well, but there is no air conditioning except in your room and a few restaurants - be warned, it is VERY hot and humid in July! The pool and the ocean are clean, warm and wonderful The Iberostar has the best beach compared to the others we saw. The other hotels had NO shade huts or even beach umbrellas. I think the reason we were so impressed with the Tucan was how much it felt like walking through a jungle in Mexico. That was what I wanted the kids to experience. Some of the other hotels are very fancy and they should be in downtown Denver somewhere, The overall feel of this hotel was tropical. We went on one scuba excursion - Maya Adventure $89 each. It was good. They took us to 3 different places and served lunch. I was a little disappointed in that it doesn't look like what you see on the Discovery Channel. There were lots of fish but colors and the water are a little murky - not their fault. But I just was thinking it was going to look like what is on TV. However, if you go out to the beach at the hotel and walk to your right - (past the next hotel) there is a great reef that we saw just as many fish with our cheap snorkel and mask we brought. Also, we brought our own beach towels. If you don't the towel cards are a hassle. We stayed in 1242 on the 3rd floor, close to the beach. Be warned - the shows at night start at 9:30 and are VERY loud. They are close to the main lobby and restaurants. If you want to go to sleep at a decent hour you may want to be sure to get a room closer to the beach. The first night we arrived at the hotel at 6:00 pm we were hot and hungry. We went to our room the then to the buffet to eat. We then wanted to cool off in the pool but to our surprise it closes at 7:00 pm every night for cleaning. Maybe all the hotels do this, I don't know. One day we walked to the little shops just 5 minutes from the Tucan. Lots of Mexican trinkets and fun stuff to look at. But the stores with cash registers will not bargain at ALL. If it says $13.00 for a T-shirt or necklace, that is what you pay. We did take a $5.00 cab ride into Playa del Carmen. They have a great mall area (Starbucks, Senior Frogs, etc) They also have a guy that will take a picture with your camera and his 2 monkeys sit on your shoulders for $5.00. The kids loved that! Overall it was a great experience. 5 nights was just enough time to spend here. The only downside was that I felt we paid a lot for things we did not do. There is daycare, tennis, bike tours, ping pong tournaments, bull riding, salsa competitions, shows every night. We did not do any of these activities. We just wanted to be at the beach or the pool and do a little shopping. Plus we did not eat and drink nearly as much as most people.

We booked through Apple, including excursions, and the entire process through check-in went extremely smooth Our room was clean and comfortable but was on the 3rd floor with no elevator which was tough on my Dad.

I did extensive research and relied a lot on this forum. We ultimately selected the Tucan for its positive reviews, the location, quality of the beach and the jungle atmosphere. I had emailed a request for the non-smoking building (#16) and the top floor. Both requests were met. I also requested the Japanese steakhouse for my daughter's 19th birthday and ordered a cake. There was a mix-up about the cake when I checked on it the afternoon of her birthday, but the staff graciously came through on this at the last minute. The good: Service is excellent; the staff is very friendly and work extremely hard. Resort is very clean. Wildlife abundant (too abundant in the buffet -- see below). Good variety of food choices. Beautiful beach and pool areas. Lots of activities; we especially enjoyed tennis and the bike tours. We ate at the Japanese, Brazilian steakhouse, Tropical and Italian. Liked the Japanese and Italian; did not care for Brazilian and Tropical, mainly because they are outdoors and it was so hot and humid. Also did not care for the beef in Mexico. The not-so-good: Lack of air conditioning in restaurants and common areas is really difficult in the summer months. Even the so-called air-conditioned specialty restaurants aren't very air-conditioned. The towel game is in full force; all palapas were gone by 8:30 a.m. You could, however, drag an umbrella from the towel stand to the beach and pound it into the sand. Did not mind the hard beds, but couldn't stand the flat hard pillows. Tried to get new ones, but front desk said they are all the same. Even though it looks like the walls would be thick and well-insulated, you could hear noises from other rooms (especially yelling kids downstairs from us). Got tired of birds dive-bombing in the buffet. It seemed to get worse as the week went on. No gift shop in the Tucan side (it was being remodeled), and the Quetzal shop didn't have a whole lot. Nighttime activities not our thing -- cheesy shows in -- once again -- very hot outdoor theater. Disco not our thing, either. But we were usually so tired from the day's activities and sun that we wanted to relax after dinner anyway. We did three excursions: Mayan Encounter (with All-Tournative) and it was excellent -- went to Coba, a cenote for a quick swim, hiking through jungle (very rough terrain), Mayan ceremony (quite hokey and went on too long), rappelling a short distance, then zipline through woods and across a lake (terrific), canoeing across the lake (fun) and traditional Mayan lunch (delicious, especially the vegetable soup). My 19-year-old daughter and I took the shopping excursion to Cancun -- a disappointment. We were the only two English-speakers on the bus (the rest were Spanish), which was okay, but we would have enjoyed getting to meet people we could converse with. The first stop was a horrible, junky market in downtown Cancun, where all the shop people try to force you to come into their stalls; the second stop, on Boulevard Kulkukan, was not much better; the third, La Isla, was the best of the three. Enjoyed getting to take photos on the southern end of the pennisula. Third excursion, wave runners and snorkeling at Punta Marmoma -- kids loved this. All in all, a nice vacation, but if we go in the summer again, we will definitely choose a resort with more air-conditioned eating and common areas.", "Date": "July 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Clitheroe, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cService as you would expect\u201d", "Author": "babybiffa", "ReviewID": "UR8131888", "Content": "We travelled with friends to this hotel, after meeting them on a previous holiday to an Iberostar and being very impressed. We were not disappointed in any way with the hotel, the grounds are beautifully looked after, and the animals that live there. Rooms are well maintained, and the maids do a superb job of cleaning them and leaving figures made from the towels and sometimes chocolates. Beds are very comfortable. The food - the first few days were below average but after that there was a great choice. The speciality coffee that was served a couple of days was absolutely lovely, we had a great time wearing the sombreros and having photos taken in the restaurant. The major problem was the reserving of sunbeds, getting up at 7am latest to get one where you wanted to be, we actually sat on ours though, but there were a lot of guests that got up earlier to put towels out and then didn't bother to sit on them until later which is very inconsiderate! Unlike the other Iberostar the hotel would not remove the towels. The pottery painting was good fun, the jewellery shop in the quetzal is well worth a look. Do wonder down to the shops which are a ten minute stroll outside of the hotel, we went on a shopping trip to Cancun for a day, if you don't like bartering don't go as the stall holders can get very aggressive with their selling techniques!

The hotel rooms are nice but very dated. They are clean and comfortable, but the beds are solid, but we did sleep well on them considering. We had no problems booking the other restaurant's. We didnt need to book when we arrived, we just booked as we went along and got to try most of them. i wasnt impressed with the choices and the buffet had much better options. The Steak house- tiny piece of steak and massive cold hard baked potato. Also starters where only seafood. Mexican - only thing on the menu is taco's. that is honestly all there is. Italian - i had a pasta dish. It wasn't freshly made and you could tell it had been sitting in a oven being kept warm as all the sauce had formed a skin. Not nice and we ended up having to go back into the buffet But the buffet was really good. Advice though, go for a walk round to see what is on offer before you choose your food, sometimes there are different things on different service areas. I think the reason why some people say it is repetitive is because they dont have a walk round. We had a different kind of meal every night because we looked at all the options. The pool area is great and you can order drinks whilst sunbathing, you just call the girls over and they take your order no problem at all. They even go round asking you if you would like a drink. swim up pool bar is seperate and water is cold so it can be good for cooling off. Can get quite full and noisy but great fun. Only problem with the pool we found was a few large groups of american's all together and they got really loud. Not great when you are on holiday trying to relax during the day. Nightlife/entertainment is not good for anyone who wants to stay out past 11pm. You have the lobby bars for drinks and then the 'show' is on at 9.30pm to about 10.30pm. I give full credit to the star friends people as they do work hard and the shows are varied. But after it finishes the bar empties and most people go home. So it gets very dull in the evening and boring. They have a band that play but they are not good at all. Best to go out after about 10.30pm if you want some more exciting nights. Even just a lively bar with chatting and music doesnt happen here. This is where it was lacking for us. The entertainment was not up to scratch and we got really really bored. Its fine if you are an elderly couple or family with kids but not for those looking to have a good time at night. There is the nightclub but we went a few times and it was either empty or full of very young kids who would be underage to drink back at home so are very very very drunk and annoying. Not the best but the music was good, if you dont mind dancing on an empty dancefloor and you are in your own group it is okay. We did enjoy this holiday and the hotel was lovely. I would not go back to it as the evening entertainment let it down, and being a taxi ride from any other bars with proper entertainment meant it became expensive. I would say it was a good hotel for those looking to relax and unwind, but this is dependant on who happens to be there at the same time. We met some lovely American families and couples but there are always a few that spoil it and the loud,screaming, shouting, drinking by the pool ones did that for us. Also if you are up after 9.30am then sunbed space is limited as lots of people go to the pool at 4am and 5am. But you can usually get a bed but it will probably be in the shade. If you are used to going on holiday in europe and having a varied choice of evening entertainment with lots of different bars and acts then i think you will find this hotel boring so make sure you take money to go into town.", "Date": "July 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cWinter holidays in the sun\u201d", "Author": "Dave07", "ReviewID": "UR8081807", "Content": "From Cancun it takes about 1h20min to transfer to the hotel. The hotel is located at the end of the Playacar resort, with excellent, well cared sand beach, 10 min. walk from a shopping mall and about 5 min. by taxi to the 5th Avenue of Playa del Carmen (taxi rates are usually fixed and reasonable). The Iberostar hotel is composed of two twin hotels (Tucan and Quetzal), having a U-shape, with the arms being the room buildings and in the middle having 5 theme restaurants, 4 buffet restaurants, a very big wimming pool, a miniature jungle with animals/birds (kind of a childrens zoo) as an in-house park, 2 smaller pools, several bars and a central ball/theatre hall. My wife and I stayed at the Tucan from 23.12.06 to 2.01.07 and we had the best vacation so far. The hotel complex is quite big, therefore an advantage is to be situated in the buldings no. 17/27, 16/26 and 15/25 in order to be kind of centrally positioned for all the attractions (restaurants, beach, reception, etc.). Seaview is only available in two \"on the beach\" buildings (no. 10 and 20). Walking from reception to the beach takes at least 5 min. and a map is usefull in the first few days. Also, preferably to have a room on the top (2nd) floor, because of the small animals creeping around and the trees. The hotel is very well maintained, although the marble floors can be dangerously slippery. The only thing to watch for is your luggage, since the bellboy-system is overzelous and you might look for your belongings later. A safe is to be found in the room. Swimming pools are more than enough and the beach offers enough space even in peak season. The animation team is entertaining and the service was always perfect. Tips are at your discretion (i.e. for the cleaning staff) and do not appear to be a must to get things your way. The buffet food was varied, always having a typical mexican corner for every meal. On this note, you could not starve in this hotel, since you could virtually find or order anything to eat 24/7. Just remember to reserve for the theme restaurants as soon as you arrive, since you might not get otherwise the time&date you like throughout your stay. The bars were also always up to the challenge to provide enough and various quantities of alcohol & juices. Minibar is free for all inclusive. For Christmas and New Year, the preparations were quite serious in all departments: festive dinners, special shows, extra decorations, more staff everywhere, etc. The hotel has also some shops, but not really anything worth mentioning besides the fact that it is safer (and cheaper) to buy post stamps and to send your greeting cards form the hotel than from Playa del Carmen. Otherwise, a very relaxing holiday and a place worth returning.", "Date": "July 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Valparaiso, IN", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely loved the Tucan!\u201d", "Author": "Three-tz", "ReviewID": "UR8072050", "Content": "This is my first time writing a review so please bear with me if I go astray, I am writing this because the trip we just had to the Iberostar Tucan was fantastic and they should be commended for this! We found the hotel and grounds to be very clean at all times, there was always someone sweeping or straightening up. You would think for a hotel on the beach there would be sand all over the place - but there's not, very clean! I'll start with our room, everything is tiled, no carpet The shower is huge, definately room for two if need be and it has two shower heads! There is a safe for your valuables that can be coded to your own combination (nice). There is a refridgerator that is stocked with beer, soda, and water but it didn't keep things cold very well. But we drank from the bars not our fridge so not a big deal to us. And when I say bars you can order whatever you want (coffee, soda, alcohol) so don't worry about that. There is a small pull out clothes line on the balcony (nice touch) for your wet clothes. But it was very humid when we were there so our stuff actually dried faster in the room with the air conditioning on. I read a lot about the beds being hard, well, they are certainly firm but I had no trouble sleeping. But thats personal choice I guess. The food was good, definately plentiful and a huge selection. You can easily find something you like. One night they actually had grilled filet mignon on the buffet!. The specialty restaurants are OK - which I why I give a above average rate not a excellent. I did not find the food to be spectacular and actually enjoyed the buffets more. My husband liked the restaurants... The service was great though. The tips were included in our package - but please tip! The people there work very hard and deserve a little extra! There are exotic animals all other the place on the hotel grounds, pretty neat. If I can figure out how to post some pics I'll put some peacocks on there for you. The pool is well kept and HUGE, very pretty. It does close around 8:00 or so, we would have liked to have had a evening swim but could not. We went to a couple shows and my husband actually went up on stage with the actors,(that was a fun night). the shows get crowded fast so go early to get a table. There is a lot of activity at the hotels that can be taken advantage of. We chose to go on day trips, but our traveling companions never left the resort and were perfectly happy too. I would like to recommend the snorkeling. We went on \"The Original Snorkeling Adventure\" The brochures are by the \"Apple Vacations\" courtesy desk. There are several snorkeling tours but try to find this one - it is well worth it. I had never snorkeled before and was a little timid - But the guide (Martin) took me under his wing so to speak and I never felt unsafe at any time. Anytime I looked up from the water he was there asking if I was Ok? Many times while swimming he was there just to point me in the right direction or show me something really cool. They cook a nice lunch on the beach, good music, open bar, and here's a hint for you - You will go out on the water in the morning and again after lunch, stick close to the guide after lunch towards the end of the dive, there is a special treat - But I won't spoil it for you - just go see! We also went on the \"Tulum Xtreme Adventure\" this one is a zip line , cenote snorkel and then a Tulum ruin tour. Ok ladies - wear a one piece bathing suit, I went on the Zip line into the water backwards and lost my bottoms. Luckily no one saw anything, but wear a one piece. Also wear sandals or flip flips, I wore gym shoes and was taking them on and off all day. Eat a good breakfast - the lunch on this one is not as good as the other. But you are in the jungle, so what can you expect? Then they take you to Tulum ruins. I really enjoyed this also, very pretty on the ocean. We went into \"town\" to Senior Frogs and a couple other bars one night- my husband liked that better than I did. Seemed a little seedy to me. Shopping, well you should definetely barter a bit, they will readily come down on their prices - so they must be used to it. This is getting kinda' long - so I'll close saying the service was great, people were mostly wonderful and seemed really happy to have you there, and I can't wait to go back!", "Date": "July 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cRead an honest review\u201d", "Author": "BPsoxfan", "ReviewID": "UR8069576", "Content": "We just returned from Iberostar Tucan. 28 Jun thru 6 July Check in was a breeze, gave us a room even though it was before 3:00 p.m. We requested a ground floor room, we were in the 1300 building, two double beds. Should have requested a king size. Building was conveniently near pool area, about same distance from restaurants and beach. Yes beds are hard, get over it, It's mexico they don't do boxsprings. Other esorts it is the same. Fridge was not working well, pop and Superior chilled not cold. Yes that is what you get in your room fridge Superior beer, 4 bottles every other day. No Corona. Bathroom small, showers only, door definitly in the wrong place. Two people could not work in bathroom at the same time because of door location. Made reservations at the allotted three restaurants, got on a waiting list for the others. Ate at all of them even though hotel was full. In order of preference. Long pants for men rule adhered to in some restaurants but not others. No air conditioning anywhere in any restaurant or bar or lobby even though they make you wear long pants. Japanese - Bonsai - Good Chef did not do anything entertaining like at other Japanese restaurants, or other tables Steak House - good - filets, Mine was a little under done. potato cold. Tropical - red snapper good, shrimp good Mexican - some items cold just so - so Italian - not recommended I had tortellini - could not tell you what it was stuffed with. Husband had veal, grilled marinated in something. Buffets - Never ate at the dinner buffet. Breakfast okay, lunch mostly poolside - they are right buffets do not change same thing every day. Nothing outstanding. Drinks - Beer on tap is Dos Equis or Superior, no corono or Modelo or sol. Pool bar, one bartender worked very hard by himself. Beach side bar, 3 bartenders usually a line, one guy serving ice cream all day. funky smell by bar. Lobby bar top shelf liquor, still had a hard time finding a drink I liked. Efraim made me a Purple Rain was good, next guy didn't make it the same, horrible. Entertainment - never saw it. Poolside stuff is the usual. Pools - main pool very large and VERY warm. if you want to get away from the kiddies go to the deeper end. No one in kiddie pool, go figure. Jacuzzi, same warm pool water but with jets and kids. Bar pool very small and water much more refreshing. Separate from main pool which does not seem that way from pictures. Saving chair issues. Yes we went out and saved chairs early in the morning but if you didn't, you did not get one. Sorry I don't do beach, but beach was very large compared to other hotels. Swam in the ocean to cool off or bar pool. Husband had a 1/2 hour massage poolside, was well worth it he was asleep at the end. In 7 days was asked by waiter for drink 3 times. Don't expect poolside service no biggie but don't expect it. Lots of kiddies at this hotel, lots of foreigners who don't speak english. Not recommended for couples. Some honeymooners and wedding parties. Excursions usually an hour away into Cancun ask first. Dive operations okay be prepared to dive with beginners who may not complete dive.

I wanted to share with all you travelers what an awesome resort this is. My wife and I have been to Hawaii & Aruba, but the Iberostar Tucan is now are favorite. We are definitely going back! The beach is beautiful and kept clean. It is has one of the widest beaches in the Playa area. The water is 3 shades of blue, just like a postcard. There is only 1 more resort after the Tucan, then miles of pristine beach. Make sure you walk south of the resort. The rooms are in good shape, nicely decorated, and the maid service was wonderful. The shower is big and can hold two people easily (not that we did that!). We were in building 14, which is in the very center of the resort. Great location facing their jungle. There are only a few rooms that have an ocean view (building 10) and not worth the extra price. The food was awesome. Normally I don't like buffets because I don't think the food is as good and can be very repetitious. The Tucan's Buffet proved me wrong. It was really good. My 17 yr old son and I have stomach/colon problems and we usually get sick when we eat out. This never happened at the Tucan! They have 5 specialty restaurants. We ate at the Japanese, the Hacienda Steakhouse, the Gondola Italian, and the Tropical. All are unique and had great food. Our teenagers like the Japanese the best because of the show the cook put on in front of you. The entertainment was very good. We enjoyed the nightly shows put on by the Star Friends Team. Before the show, I really enjoyed the Star Friends Band. At 8:30 they played salsa music and had 3 singers. During the day the Friends worked the beach/pool area. One afternoon, 3 of them came down the beach dressed as cave men with big rubber clubs. They were really funny and were jumping and shouting in front of my wife, as she video taped them! The Service was outstanding. Everyone was kind, polite, and went out of their way to take care of you. We took two tours which I would highly recommend. The Fat Cat Catamaran was a great sail with a snorkel stop at a lagoon. Lots of fish and coral at the stop. We also took Anna & James Coba Treasures tour.

The Mexican people and staff at the hotel were wonderful. Rooms were clean, beds very hard and it is time to update a bit. The weather was beautiful and the beach very crowded. BUT>>> If you have ever been to any Sandals, Beaches, or other high end All-Inclusives you will not care for Iberostar Tucan/Queztal. First of all, the food presentation and quality is average at best. You are given virtually the same choices every single day in all of the buffet restaurants. It gets very tiresome and boring. As for the \"reservation only\" restaurants, the only reason to eat in them is for a change of atmosphere. Japanese was salty, Mexican (AWFUL!), Italian (average), Tropical (average), and Steak House (pretty good). You have to reserve these places as soon as you get there or you won't get in. I do not understand how their system works though, because none of the restaurants were more than 1/2 full at any given time, yet people were turned away and told nothing was available. I do not care what anyone says, Iberostar is definately watering down their alcohol. And this is not only my opinion. Almost everyone I met there feels the same way. Even when having multiple shots of tequila or whiskey right from the bottle, you can drink them like water with little or no effect. If you ask some of the bartenders (who were great guys), the ones that get to know you will wink or smile if you ask them about the weakness of the alcohol. Drink all that you want, you will feel as if you had a soft drink. The activities staff were wonderful people and did their best for you. However, if you expecting the fun and quality of shows, entertainment and activities you receive from some of the better all inclusive resorts you will be very disappointed. It just does not have a lot to offer. The advertisement for \"Free\" watersports is far from true. This is my BIG complaint. All of the equipment is owned by a company that contracts through the hotel. One of the employees who has worked for other all-inclusives said it is terrible what Iberostar contracts them to do. You get 1 hour a day for a Hobie cat, windsurfer or kayak. If you are not experienced and cannot sail or windsurf and want someone to show you how, it is $40.00 per person. If you take out a boat or windsurfer and have a problem, it is$50.00 to come get you. Snorkel equipment is free for 1 hour, then $15.00 for the rest of the day. If you want to snorkel you have to let them take you to their \"reef\" at a cost of $30.00 per person for 90 minutes in the water. My kids wanted to take a ride ($10.00 per person) on the \"Banana Boat\" and asked everyday we were there. Every day they were told that the Jetski that pulls the boat was broken. This was an outright lie. The staff was told not to bring it out as they make more money renting the Jetski. The kids became quite bored and I was angry. Jet ski is $55.00 per person for 30 minutes, Parasail is $55.00 per person. This was a total ripoff! I have read many rave reviews for this resort. It is the reason I chose it over others. However, it is just not up to being a 4 or 5 star resort as advertised. I have been to more all-inclusves than I care to mention and this is average at best. If you want to lay around by the pool or beach, and drink and eat all day it is free and will be fine. If you want activities get ready to pay every time.

I know this is a private resort and they do their best to keep smokers away from non smokers (dining room). It would be interesting to see one of the resorts on this beach go smoke free.

We were a group of 8 4 couples, we have been to quite a few different destinations but none of them could beat this one, the food is amazing there's lots of variety make sure you book in all the restaurants on your first day as they do get booked up quite quickly (japenese was beautiful), if your worried about cleanliness then don't as there wasn't a spec of dirt in site the cleaners came daily and each day they were different little gifts in our room. We will definelty be re visiting the resort in the next couple of years it was just a shame it took us 10- hours to get there. The entertainment team were brilliant and made our holiday one to never forget, they performed different shows each night and it catered for all ages, if your going soon then please look out for \"Adrian, Fernado and Laurence\" There part of the Star team and are also friends for life they made us feel like we were right at home.One thing us would say on a negative was Cancun is very commercialised so if you are thinking of venturing there then make sure your ready for a crazy time!!!! i would give this holiday 10/10 and highly recommend it to anyone thinking of going!!!!One last thing on my stay i won Miss Iberostar it was the funniest show ever so make sure you watch it!", "Date": "June 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brooklyn, New York", "Title": "\u201cParadise.

We booked it via a travel agent, so the van/bus pickup/drop off was included in the package. Even though we checked into the Iberostar Tucan we were on the Iberostar Quetzal side. The Iberostar Tucan and Iberostar Quetzal are the same hotel but have separate lobbies. The Quetzal is on the north side while the Tucan is on the south side. We had a junior suite facing the Gulf (building 20). Check in was easy and fast. The bellhop took our bags and drove the both of us and our suitcases in a golf cart to our building. There were no elevators in our building but that wasn't an issue for us, not sure how the other buildings though. Our junior suite was large. King size bed, and as stated by others, they are somewhat firm. It didn't really bother us though, after being out on the beach/pool or doing a tour to Coba, etc, we quickly passed out. The room had a mini-fridge stocked with bottled water, Coca-Cola, Sprite, Diet Coke and Beer, all included with the stay. Our cleaning lady restocked it daily. We were also greeted with fruit basket on the first day. It was not replaced with fresh fruit after the first day. The junior suites had a sitting area, near the balcony door. It was large enough that you could lay down on. It was also made of that firm material the mattress was made of, or so it seems. Bathroom was nice, with a stand up shower, with a shower head and removable shower hose. Unfortunately you could not have both running at the same time. The balcony faced the ocean and there was a plastic table with two chairs. There also was a drying rack outside, great for hanging your wet bathing suits. As mentioned before when sitting on the plastic chairs you could not see over the balcony railing. Closet space was ample. The safe in the closet was large enough to fit my professional camera equipment (camera, lenses, flash, etc) , and other electronics. Pool was very nice and big. Lots of space to swim around, not very deep though. Maximum depth of about 5 feet, so no diving. The water in the pool is very warm. There was a separate pool with swim up bar that didn't allow any children. You had to leave the main pool and walk about 10 feet to get into the swim up bar pool. There was also another pool that was used for water polo. Lots of activities to do. Tennis, bike rental, billiards, table tennis, yoga, step class, water aerobics, table tennis, foosball. You could also rent kayaks for an hour as well as catamarans on the beach. They did mention that if they had to rescue you, there was a $49 USD fee. If you wanted to rent jet skis, you could go next door to the other hotel to rent them for 30 minutes. You could also find para-sailing representatives on the beach. The lobby had a desk with several tour agencies. We booked a trip to Xcaret and Coba through them. Bus would pick you up and drop you off at the lobby. The buffet was good, lots of selection. The restaurants were really good as well. We ate at the Mexican restaurant and the steak restaurant. Make sure you make your reservations early for the restaurants. The night shows were a little corny, but we sat around drinking from the bar. The hotel had a currency exchange counter, but no ATM. The nearest ATM was about a 10 minute walk down the road to a section with lots of shops. You could also walk to Playa del Carmen, but it was about a 30 minute walk. I would recommend taking a taxi. It was very humid when we walked that we got to town drenched in sweat. Taxi costs fifty pesos (about $5 USD). Overall a wonderful experience. I would definitely love to go back soon. Great service by the hotel staff. I would definitely recommend tipping the staff. We tipped our waiters at the buffet, as they brought us drinks, and cleared our plates. Also tipped the bartenders and the cleaning person the day we left. Great place to stay.

There were a lot of the same things like hamburgers and hot dogs, but there was enough variety that we never got tired of eating the same things. There was even a wide variety of healthy foods, if you are trying to eat healthy (however I can't imagine why you would want to do that on vacation).The beds are just mattresses on concrete slabs, so they are very hard.They did get uncomfortable by the third night. That, however, is our only complaint (I wouldn't even classify that as a complaint). I also read some complaints about the staff being less than friendly. We found that to be about far from the truth. I would say that the staff was even more friendly than most of the hotels I have stayed at here in the States. I don't think I saw even one staff person whom didn't smile and say \"Hi\" when we saw them.

It was a beautiful resort and the jungle atmosphere and colorful buildings were exactly what we were looking for on our first trip to Mexico. The room we stayed in was lovely (1328) and was in a great location. I had emailed the resort prior to our stay and requested building 11,12, 21, or 22. We got 13 and I was a little disappointed, but after the first day of navigating the resort we realized that this location was perfect. It was right next to the area that we got our towels each day, right next to the pool and very close to the beach. I loved walking through the jungle to get to the restaurants and lobby. The staff was very helpful and the Star Friends were very friendly. We enjoyed the food, there was enough of a variety to keep it from getting boring. We ate at the Japanese restaurant and the Mexican restaurant and enjoyed them both. There were 3 other restaurants to choose from, but we were in town several nights and just never got around to trying any of the other ones. Two of the restaurants are the lunch buffet during the day down by the beach and then at night they are reservations only restaurants. I was a little disappointed to see that what I had read about people going down early in the morning to save chairs is true. But for us it was not a problem. We never laid by the pool, always on the beach, and they will check out umbrellas to you at the towel shack. We got to see the monkeys the first day we were there, but they never showed themselves again for us. Yes, the beds are hard. But we didn't have any trouble sleeping on them. Of course, we did have a little trouble getting used to the \"jungle noise\". Between the peacocks and the roosters.....there were times when I was wishing to strangle them.

I was still a little nervous because my expectations for my first all-inclusive were not high. I was plesantly surprised at every turn. First, the grounds where spotless. There's is a ton of staff. They have several people walking around the beach all day long just picking up your glass as soon as it's empty. Nothing sits out. Everyone also does it with a smile. I thought being an all-inclusive, they'd be stingy on drinks and service. I was so wrong. Everything is done with a smile and they are more than happy to bend over backwards for you. Drinks are made fresh and there's never a line. Ice cream cones on the beach are a nice as well. The pool was wonderful, big and warm. The only down side is there was no hot tub and way to many kids. Marco polo is still ringing in my head. Note to parents; we know you love your children, but nobody else does, so try and keep them civil as they aren't the only ones on vacation. The grounds are amazing. It feels like the South Pacific. Monkeys, birds, all roaming wild. Didn't hear any roosters. With the room door closed, it's dead silent. The beds are hard, as are the beach loungers. I don't think Mexico is known for being cushy. The room is very nice though, but more rustic than fancy. If your used to the Ritz, this isn't it, it's Mexico. But the showers nice with great pressure, and the room is clean. I was really worried about the beach with all the erosion talk at most resorts. this one is still in tact and was wonderful. I suggest walking south past the next resort. The beach is untamed and empty for like a mile there. The crowds are gone and it's awesome. The resort to the North has no beach, totally washed away. They must have been jealous of us. Due to a 3 night stay, we weren't allowed access to the specialty restaurants without begging, which I thought was a bit cheesy. But on second thoughts, did I really come to Mexico to have Italian or Japanese food? NO. The buffets were very good for the most part. A few items missed, but overall we were fine with it for all the meals. I suggest going into town to eat as well. Didn't do any shows as I usually think they are pretty lame and contrived at a place like this. Overall, very impressive.

Let me start with the positives.... 1. Grounds--This is hands-down the most aesthetically beautiful resort we have ever visited. From the minute you step foot in the impressive lobby, you're immediately brought into a paradise. The greenery, waterfall, exotic animals, mayan statues, and walkways are breathtaking. 2. Room--They are well-sized and kept very clean. The maid sevice was top-notch. There was a large shower stall and every room gets a balcony overlooking something gorgeous. I've read about the complaints about the firm mattresses, but we had no problems sleeping like babies in the bed. 3. Pool--Huge and beautiful. You will never feel crowded in the large pool. Most of it is at least 5 feet deep, with a shallower section near the beach. This is nice because it keeps the adults and kiddies separate. We found the adults-only pool with swim-up bar a little dirty since it is surrounded by trees. 4. Beach--UNBELIEVABLE!!! LOVED IT!!! It is so large, and we had absolutely no problems reserving chairs under cabanas every day (granted, my hubby was up before 7 AM daily). It is way nicer than the neighboring resorts' beaches. 5. Staff -- They were some of the friendliest staff we've ever encountered. They aim to please, and offer everything with a smile. 6. Activities-- The Star Friends have activities going on all day. You can do anything (or nothing)--from salsa lessons, to volleyball competitions, to riding a mechanical bull!!! There was something for everyone. 7. Snorkeling--We paid to go snorkeling through the resorts dive shop and it was totally worth it. We only had 4 people in our group, which was nice. Saw some beautiful fish. And now the \"negatives\" 1. The food-- Ranged from great to bad. It really depends on where and what you eat. They told us we were allowed 3 reservations at the specialty restaurants, but we ended up eating at all 5 because we went on waiting lists. In our opinion, the mexican and japanesese restaurants were really good. The Steak restaurant was good, but our meals at the Italian and Tropical restaurants were pretty bad. If you're used to good Italian food, you'll find the Chef-Boyardee-quality pasta and sauces to be kind of gross. The buffet was okay (again, it depended on what you got). For instance, the fajita bar at the buffet was great, but the pasta, mashed potatoes, and pizza were sub-par (beware of the mashed potatoes and white sauces that must be about 80% butter). On the positive, we loved the breakfast buffet everyday and the fruit and yogurts were out-of -this-world. And, we really enjoyed their mexican foods and japanese hibachi restaurant. 2. Drinks--Mixed drinks were pretty weak. If you ask for a little more alcohol, they would give it to you without complaint. The red wine was BAD, but the white was pretty good (and they really only have 2 brands of wine available). In summary, we really did love this place and would highly recommend it. You will definitely love your overall stay. Just don't expect gourmet food and drinks.

The Iberostar Tucan was GREAT. The resort grounds are very clean and well kept. The pool is very nice, although, our party spent the majority of our time on the beach as this resorts section of the beach was the nicest we saw (and many people walked to look at other resorts) The water was clear blue, LOTS of beach chairs and umbrellas available (it was much easier finding a great spot on the beach as many people reserved chairs by the pool very early). They have staff members walking up and down the beach and pool areas with various animals (monkeys, parrots, tucans, lizards- if you want a picture, they will take as many as you want with thier digital, post them in the photoshop and you can buy one for 8 dollars US). We bought 3!!! The food exceeded my expectations for an all-inclusive in Mexico ( i stayed at the Oasis Cancun a few years ago and rarely ate a thing). The steakhouse was excellent, the antipasto bar in the Italian resteraunt was the BEST and the Japanese was fairly good (get the banana tempura for dessert) and the buffet had LOTS of chioces for picky eaters. Also there is an icecream bar right by the beach/pool area - - with different plavors to choose from. Our room was average, but BEWARE- - the Iberostar Tucan has a jungle running through it (you can walk through it to get to the beach/pool area), monkeys, peacocks, lizards and a rooster! Yes- a rooster, so if you are staying in our building (1500's) facing the jungle you will hear the rooster at about 5 am for 45 minutes (if you are a light sleeper as I am). The peacocks are also pretty loud. But after the first few nights you get used to it or just sleep through it. Apparently our friends staying closer to the pool area did not hear a thing. The service is very good (we have stayed at an Iberostar resort in Cuba and had a similar experience). TIP- - arrive early for the nighly shows, the seats fill up fast. The wedding was beautiful.. right on the beach at 5pm. They only have one wedding a day . Apperently the resort has both an english speaking minister and spanish- - our friends had the english speaking gentleman and he was GREAT. We witnessed a wedding the next day with the spanish minister and a translater and it didnt have the same feel. THe flowers were beautiful, bouquet arrrangements were beyond my expectations, rose petals down the isle- - really adding to the romantic atmosphere we were all feeling.

We had a reservation at the Italian resort after the wedding and it was great. Next our wedding group (which totaled 29 people) had the entire disco to ourselves from 830-1030pm for speeches, cake drinks and dancing- then it opened up to the other guests of the resort.

They are all so helpful and cheerful even though they work so hard. This was the same of the animation team who we felt were like our friends at the end of the holiday!

We stayed from May 12th thru May 18th, 2007. Very nice place! There were many positive things and a few negative, but overall it was a nice trip. Upon arriving at the Tucan we were informed that we were being upgraded to the Presidential suites in Bldg. 10. We had requested by email prior to the trip Bldg. 11 so we could have some view of the ocean. What a pleasant surprise to be upgraded to these rooms for no additional charge. They were HUGE with 3 separate rooms, each with their own bathroom. There were sliding glass doors all along the rooms that accessed a balcony that overlooked the beach and ocean. On the balcony was even a hot tub! In hindsight I think I would have been disappointed if I did not have a view of the ocean from my room so if that is important to you make sure to request Bldg 11 on the Tucan side. We soon found out what others have written about the beds. They are very hard, but we were all so tired by the end of the day we just tolerated them. I did see several eggcrates being delivered to other rooms, but we didn't feel the need for them. The airconditioning in the rooms was good, but it shuts off if you open the sliding doors or leave the room for long periods of time. I tipped the cleaning lady the first day as she was just finishing up our room when we arrived and asked her for more bottle beer (Cerveza). She placed two six packs of beer in each day along with plenty of bottled water and soda. The bottled beer was Superior. The resort had Del Sol on tap for draft beer. I was told that the beer changes occasionally so it might be different for the next person. The resort is huge and plan on doing alot of walking! With our rooms on the beach it was a good walk to the main buffet where we ate most of our meals. There was always plenty to eat and the food was mostly good. Breakfast at the main buffet was excellent. Lunch was okay with the buffet on the beach serving a variety of food. The burgers tasted a bit strange, but they weren't too bad. Dinner at the buffet had a large variety and even the picky eaters could always find something. We went to the Japanese, Steak and Italian restaurants while there. I liked the Japanese the best. The Steak and Italian were ok, but nothing special. To me the Italian was the most disapointing. I ordered ravioli and it came out with 4 small raviolis that looked like the came out of a can. We did go to the seafood night on Thursday night at the main buffet, but no lobster tails. Instead it was large cooked whole shimp, whiskers, legs and all! We all enjoyed the activities the resort had for the most part. Several of the activities nobody showed up for. The biggest problem that I see was that they have the activities displayed in the ping pong room with the time that they would be offered, but unless your wearing a watch outside with you it's hard to know when they are starting as there are no clocks outside. The Star friends will go around and try to round people up but it's not easy to do. They only have two speakers that announce the activities at the far end of the pool near the beach so if your not in that vicinity you can't hear whats going on. A good PA system around the pool would really help. They have a separate pool for water basketball, polo etc. and its hard to pull people out of the main pool to come over and do the activity. The main pool is so big they should just do it in there. They did have water volleyball in the main pool and a few other activities. The pool is huge and looks very nice, but it has some problems. While playing water volleyball one of guys with us cut his foot on the tiles on the bottom. The pool is in poor overall shape but looks nice from afar. My daughter and I did the free scuba lesson offered by Dressel Divers there in the main pool. That was alot of fun, but I noticed many tiles underneath that were missing or had been recently worked on by the different color of tiles. The steps leading out of the pools are patched in may spots to fill in voids and cracks that are developing. So a warning to everybody, becareful in the pool! The adult pool bar is just okay. I really prefer the swim-up type so I don't have to get out of the main pool to get a drink. The water was colder in there and it just didn't look that clean so we did not spend much time in there. There is a bar on the beach so if we needed a drink we would head over there. We spent much of our time by the beach and the ocean was warm and beautiful. You do have to get your towels out early for a good spot. By 8-9 all of the huts are gone! We did do the free Kayak from Dressel Divers on the beach. To rent the catamaran or wind surfer they wanted us to take a course for an additional $39. He said that we didn't have to take it but it was a $45 rescue charge if they were needed to come get us. The teens were always involved in the daily activities and the older ones loved the Mascara night club that opens at 10:30 and stays open till 3am. The Quetzal side main buffet opens up at 11pm and stays open till 4:45 am for the late night munchies. We did all go the main show in the theater each night, but after a few nights it gets old. It is so hot with everybody in there and no breeze blowing. I felt bad for the actors in those costumes! They try real hard and are very talented. There is little air conditioning throughout the resort except in some of the restaurants. I couldn't imagine staying there in mid summer! The water that surrounds the restaurants is all green with Koi fish in it and could really use a cleaning. Some days it smelled worse than others! We did see lots of wildlife and even a few monkeys! Be careful going through the jungle after a rain storm which we had a few days while there. The jungle pathway gets very slippery. The rains did make it challenging trying to get to the restaurants from our rooms. Our first night it really poured and we had to run through the rain to get to the restaurant. Our rooms were beautiful, but being on the third floor with no elevators got old after a weeks time going up and down three flights of steps. We did the bike tour from the hotel at 10am and we rode for 1.5 hrs through Playa. This was fun and we did get to fifth ave. It is very nice, but all of the vendors are very aggressive and want you to come into their store. We ended up just walking from the hotel to the small strip mall to purchase a few things. Nobody hasseled you there. I bought a bottle of Kahlua there for $13. Found the same bottle at the airport for the same price. The duty free shops at the airport were very reasonable. We did do a dolphin tour at Delphinus at $149 p/p. This included round trip transportation and was alot of fun. They try to sell you the pictures at the end and they are $19 each and the video was $50. They tried telling us that the video was encrypted, but we had no trouble copying it as there were four families doing this and we all wanted a copy, but not at $50 each!. We also found a small reef that you can snorkel from about 400 yards down the beach. Lots of bright colored fish to see. It's not great but its free. I did Xel-Ha a few years ago and that was fun, but I didn't want to do that again. The guys on the beach who run the parasails said that for $30p/p they would come right up to the beach and pick us up and take us out to a reef for two hours. I wasn't sure my 13 year old would like it so I declined. She did get scared at the fish she saw at the small reef near the hotel so I am glad I saved the money. The service was excellent throughout the resort and they are very fast to clean up empty glasses, plates etc. They work very hard keeping up the grounds and the cleanliness. We left many tips as they really deserved it.

I was very nervous before my trip (I always am) worried I would not like the hotel, etc, but I was very pleased. This review comes from someone who has traveled quite a bit and is very picky. First the airport arrival. It was a hassle waiting for the van to take you to the hotel, we waited about an hour and then you pile into a van that has 3 rows of seats so it carries about 9 people and their luggage. The ride took about 45 minutes I guess and was ok. If you've never been to Playa, once you get there, it's like it's own little gated resort community. The grounds are gorgeous and all the hotels look wonderful.Check in was quick and easy and we were pleased with our room. We had a jr suite in building 10 on the 2nd floor. It had a really nice bathroom that looked like a spa, all terrecota tile and very spacious shower with good water pressure. The room had a safe where you put your own code and the TV had many channels and some were english speaking. We had a very nice balcony and were right on the beach. I am always willing to pay extra for an ocean front because I just think it's worth it and I like to see and hear the ocean in my room, especially at night. The only disappontment with the oceanfront balcony was the fact that when you sat in the chairs on the balcony to relax, you were sitting low and in front of you were plants that blocked the view to the ocean, you had to stand to see the ocean which was a bummer. We left the room and returned that night to a large welcoming fruit basket and our next to last day a lovely bouquet of fresh flowers were waiting in our room, real nice touches. The air cond worked, but it automatically turned off when balcony door was open and we did not have bed bugs, thank God, I was very worried about that. The food was very good and a large selection, the only thing I was disappointed in and this may sound petty, but all the dressings (salad dressings, etc) had no flavor to them because they must have been extremely watered down. I love salads so that was a disappointment to me and the deserts were kind of weird, mostly jellied molds of something or other. One night was very good for deserts though, a chocolate fountain with strawberries, ice cream, brownies, all good stuff, most other lunches/dinners, the deserts were just weird. The only other complaint about food is the fact you can only eat at one speciality restaurant if you are staying for a week, I thought that was cheap of them. You should be able to experience all the restaurants for what you pay. We chose the steakhouse and it was good. The other choices were italian, japanese, tropical and mexican. The beach was wonderful. Don't listen to anyone who complained about it, there is nothing to complain about. The beach is not rocky, but if you walk in the shallow part of the water, of course there are rocks, but found this very pleasurable as I had a blast hunting for pretty rocks and shells. They tell you upon arrival you cannot go out early and put a towel down and reserve a chair, but believe me, we did and everyone else did too and no one said anything. If you get out there later than 8:30 am though you probably will not get a hut to sit under. The beach bars had good drinks (the tropical cocounut with fresh banana was great) they had ice cream and food constantly. The staff also had volleyball and other games going as well. We basically just chose to relax and take it easy under a hut and had a great time. In the evening there were some vendors there selling silver, art, etc. We went to Fifth Avenue one day shopping and it was nice. You will find a mix of local craftsman as well as nice stores like Diesel, Starbucks and some high end designer sunglass stores. Many bars and restaurants so we went late in the day, did some shopping and ended up for hours and hours at Carlos and Charlies and had a blast. The staff was hilarious and we loved it there. We saw lots of peacocks, lots of annoying, constantly screaming birds, these animals that looked like huge rats without tails (yuk) lizards, fish, turtles, swans, flamingos and even a cat, no luck seeing a monkey though I really wanted to. There also were 3 weddings at the beach while we were there. I would very much recommend this hotel. If you have any specific questions, please email me. Thanks and have fun.", "Date": "May 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milwaukee", "Title": "\u201cA Perfect three-peat\u201d", "Author": "BellaMilwaukee", "ReviewID": "UR7616577", "Content": "We stayed for 8 nights at the Iberostar Tucan over Easter Vacation.

I must say that we ( 2 couples ) were not disapointed with this resort. We arrived on Friday May 5th at 12:30PM and only had a short wait until our room was ready. I had sent an email request asking for room in building eleven and we got exactely what we requested. If you are traveling to the resort, i would offer a few tips. 1. Try to avoid staying in buildings 18 -21, facing the back. There is a slight oder that lingers in this area...sewer. 2. Make you dinner reservations right after you check in. The restaurants are very good and popular. 3. There is supposed to be a \"No Reserving\" policy in regards to the beach and pool area chairs, however that is not adhered to very well. What you will find it that if you try and follow this policy...you will be left out. Here is a tip..keep ypur towel from the day before. If you get down there around 6:00AM you are going to get pretty much whatever area you desire. Leave your towel, sandle, hat, bag, whatever on as many chairs as you need. Trust me when I tell you they will be safe. Then go back to bed. 4. If your staying on the Tucan side, the main buffet closes at 10:00. Room service stops at 11:00PM. You can however take a short walk to the Quetzal side and eat at the buffet, it is open all night just for this purpose. 5. Be sure to go and see the shows every night. The Star Friends put on a fantastic show everynight. Most of these guys/girls have gone to a dance school and it shows. No need to get to the shows any earlier than 9:00PM, plenty of seats available. 6. The food was fantastic and you never went hungry. I would recommend the Japensese restaurant. 7. The pool bar is exceptional, Jesus the bartender will tell you that he has the best job at the resort. Great area to hang with your friends....no kids allowed. 8. I hate to bring up anything negative about this resort however.....the beds are crazy rock hard. I had read in the reviews that they were hard, however I figured it wasn't that bad. How wrong i was, they are the hardest beds that I have ever slept on. The reason is that the bed is actually a concrete slab connected to the wall with a 6 inch mattress on top of the slab. Ask for a mattress pad, it will help some.

Stayed at Bahia Principe Tulum once before, but much preferred the size of the Iberostar Tucan/ Quetzal. We were on Tucan side. Decor is more Mayan. We both felt absolutely safe and very,very welcome here. Buffet staff recognized us whenever we entered, repeat waiters would know our beverage of choice, and had the best of service. The staff was always willing to accommodate - special diet requests, information, seating preference, take pictures of us, special drinks from waiters. I always tipped after, as a reward - not before, as a bribe. Entertainment staff also paid us alot of attention. Made sure we weren't lonely. Always asked us to dance (since we didn't have a partner). They visited with us at poolside, tried to include us in all activities, sat and visited with us at some night shows, and even sat to eat lunch with us. They were polite but not bothersome.Their shows were great. The hotel also brings in professional entertainment like Mexican ethnic dancers, and magician. Very impressive. Had great food all week. Never experienced a hint of illness. Buffet was never crowded. Theme nights added variety. Reservations at 3 a la carte - Japanese (entertaining and huge amounts of food), Italian ( some original dishes and some same old), Tropical ( was OK). No problem making reservations. Two large snack bars near pool. Drinks were varied and made with real fruit and juice. Not just slush machines. Yummy flavored icecream at beach/pool bar. Coconut, mango, etc. Water conditions varied from intense waves to yellow flag calm to very still after a shower. Wonderful pool to spend time at. Divided into different areas like deeper, medium depth, and then exercise/activity area. Separate pool for ball games. Also separate adult pool bar. Don't forget to bring your own floaties from home($$ at gift shop). No problem getting a shaded chair at 8:00 am. Can get umbrella at towel hut for beach if no palapas available. If room by jungle (1500), entertainment is loud until about 11:00. Also , roosters and peacocks tend to wake you. Bring ear plugs and gravol - that works. Clean rooms and no bugs in room. Temp comfortable and fridge always full. Watch for photographer who comes around pool/beach area on different days. Can inquire for details at photo shop at Akumal lobby. He brings parrots, iguanas, toucans, and monkeys around to have photos with ($8). Help at front desk is somewhat aloof. Not as friendly as rest of staff. Cozumel snorkel excursion from hotel dive shop NOT recommened ($80) for whole day,3 sites. Included taxi pick up to ferry, ferry tickets, park passes, private boat to Iberostar Cozumel, snorkel equipment, lunch at other side, 3 snorkel sites, then return. Guide was wonderful, caring, and kind. Sounds good, but the sites were way too deep for good snorkelling. Anything to see was 60 ft. below you. We went with divers, perhaps that's why so deep.

Disclaimer: My wife and I are not big on sitting in the sun. We had previously stayed at the Xpu-Ha Palace (XHP), before the hurricane destroyed much of it, where swimming in and sitting by the lagoon (fed by a cenote), and lying on a hammock on chaise lounges on the porch feeling the breeze and listening to the ocean were important attractions for us. The Tucan did not offer these special things. Booked vacation through TNT. Vacation Outlet and Jet Blue have similar vacations. Miami Air check in was fine, a magician entertains while you wait in line. Didn\u2019t charge for overweight bags, thankfully. Flight left exactly on time. Some snacks on the plane, better than many airlines which only give pretzels. Plane was clean and new. Cancun airport has a new customs area which is airier and more comfortable then before. TNT rep meets people, directs them to proper van. Van (Best Day) was clean and well air conditioned. Driver drove sensibly. Check in: Check-in at the Tucan was quick and efficient (not may people checking in on Friday). Rep listened to request for a quiet room, and gave us a room in Bldg. 14 facing the jungle \u2013 a good choice. Offered to put us on waiting list for Bldg. 10 with ocean views (would have been an extra charge), but we ended up staying where we were. Grounds: Immaculate. Beautiful inner area is jungle. Peacocks, rabbit-like rodents, monkeys, many birds can be seen from the meandering paths. Rooms: Generally excellent. Clean, quite large. Stone and stucco interior. Bathroom large, stone tiles up to ceiling. Shower large, good water pressure. King size bed very hard. Cable TV, small fridge with water, beer, soft drinks. Porch clean, very well shaded. Plastic chairs and table on porch, no way to lie down (you couldn\u2019t see anything anyway, porch walls are concrete). Very few electrical outlets in room \u2013 you may want to bring a simple extension cord. AC very good. Staff receptive, not quite as perky as at XHP. More of the staff had problems with English compared to XHP, perhaps because of more varied international clientelle. When I needed an extension cord, one PR person said I should have brought it from the states. The next one sent one over without a word. Tipping: We usually left small tips at the XHP, and the service staff seemed very grateful. At the Tucan, I saw one other tip the entire time we were there. The staff ironically did not seem as grateful when we did tip. Weird. Maybe they were just surprised. Overall, the staff was not quite as demonstrative as at the XHP. Fewer wide smiles and cheerful Olas. Still, very good service overall. Food: Buffet excellent, almost too good (incentive to overeat). Wide variety of meats and fish, fruits and vegetables, and desserts. The fussiest eaters should find something to their liking. Only problem \u2013 birds flying in to find food at the unattended tables at breakfast and lunch. Coffee OK, some bars can make espresso. Not quite Starbuck\u2019s, but OK. Snack bar at beach OK. Too many birds examining food. Very good fried fish one day. Reservations are required at several restaurants. Japanese and Mexican restaurants quite good, \u201cTropical\u201d restaurant not as good as buffet. Drinks: Margaritas not as good as at XHP, but OK. Not as good at the beach, better at the lobby bar. Beach: Very nice. Sand good, no rocks. Sand could use a raking/cleaning. Hurricane damage apparent farther north (Riu properties). Very busy during the day. Walking south towards undeveloped stretch is quieter. People start reserving loungers under palapas quite early, in spite of hotel warnings not to do so. I can\u2019t see how this can be controlled without pissing off some of the clients. Lots of people in Speedos, burnt to a crisp. Melanoma business will be booming. Pool: We\u2019re not pool people. Looked clean. Quite large (though not as monstrous as pools at Palace properties and others). Area around pools quite crowded. Small mall 10 minutes walk towards Playa del Carmen. Cheap t-shirts. If you have a Mexican phone access number (through Onesuite, for example) you can get access using Telmex phones for free. 800 access at hotel costs a Lincoln just to connect to dial around service. Local phone calls, internet access (when it\u2019s working) are more reasonably priced. Diving: Dove with Dive Mexico, a small operation in Playa del Carmen. Dressel Divers, the resident outfit at the Tucan, seemed good but didn\u2019t offer 2 dives each morning, only 1. Strange arrangement. Snorkeling: Arranged Mayan Adventure half day snorkeling trip through Dressel. Snorkeled at Akumal/Turtle Bay, where we saw many turtles, a huge school of fish, and Jackfish and barracudas seconds from the beach. Didn\u2019t think that could be topped, but the dive in the Cenote was even more spectacular. Worth every penny. The flight home: Picked up at Tucan 3 hours before scheduled departure. Check in was painless. Flight was delayed due to weather in Boston, wait in secure area is rather hot and crowded. A can of Pringles costs a Lincoln. Bring a snack. I came home with several bedbug bites. We saw a number of people similarly afflicted, one women covered in them. I guess this can happen anywhere. Hopefully they can address this issue. Overall \u2013 The good: Grounds beautiful and immaculate. Room nice. Service very good. Food excellent. Beach very good. The not-so-good: Birds in the buffet area. Bedbugs.

Our room was in Block 11, which is nearer to the pool/beach and was lovely and comfortable. We got tequila and fruit as it was our honeymoon. We left a $1 tip everyday for the maid, and were always greeted by towel and curtain art when we returned to the room! The pool areas are lovely, there seemed to be lots of loungers until about 9.30-10 am when the pool area seems to get a bit busier.

The beach is great, the sea's quite wave-y, but great fun! Be sure to hire a canoe! We also went parasailing and on the jet bikes. The beaches to the left of the hotel are almost eroded further down, so walk to the right if you want a little wander along the beach (unless you want to be nosy!)

The food was great, buffet always had loads of choice both morning and evening, and there was plenty to choose from at lunch time...they often have beach BBQ's with fish, chicken etc. Our favourite a la carte was the Japanese, and our least favourite was the Mexican..there was more Mexican choice in the buffet where they have fajitas every night anyway! We did 3 trips whilst away: Chichen Itza: Brilliant day out, the tour guide really made our trip, he was called Armando. Its a long coach trip, but well worth it. Unfortunately you cant go up the main pyramid anymore due to accidents, but there are plenty of places you can go up and explore...if you get a good guide, we recommend going around with them rather than on your own as there aren't many signs around telling you whats what. Xel-Ha: This was another great day out. There are loads of fish to be seen, and you really can spend all day snorkelling! We did the Sea Trek, which i hated as it involved the guides pushing sting rays right near to your face, but my Husband and the other 7 people loved it! Dolphin discovery: We went to the Puerto Aventuras site, and did the full swim involving dolphins, manatees and sea lions...it was well worth all the money we payed, we had a fab time. We didn't buy the video cos it was very expensive, but the photos were actually quite reasonable. We also walked into Playa Del Carmen for the afternoon, which was really nice. Quite busy but a nice change from the hotel. We walked there but got a taxi back which cost about $5. You can also hire bikes from the hotel and cycle in! There is also a little shopping centre about a five minute walk from the hotel, which sells mainly the same stuff as Playa, but can be more expensive as there isn't much competition.", "Date": "April 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canadian in So.

Once on the coach, you will be told that to get out of the country again at the end you will need to pay an airport tax of 50USD this was not explained to us when booking the holiday. Then your holiday actually starts at the hotel, the staff are very friendly and efficient, we were checked in straight away and although our room was in 19 block (out of the way a bit), the room and facilities were nice. We enjoyed our entire stay and the cleanliness and features of the hotel are very good. The pool and beach are amazing, although it has to be said i think we were one couple in very few that ended up in the sun all day as everyone of the sunbeds was reserved, it seemed like they were being reserved from midnight as it didnt matter how early you got down to the beach none were free. I have to agree with previous comments some (not all) americans on our trip were loud and extremly rude. They are definately the majority and it was very overpowering. Tipping was not compulsery or expected but staff were at your becking call. Please dont use your tour advisor for the excursions, we went with first choice and felt utterly ripped off, our rep wasnt the best, there is a shop advertising excursions on tucan side, my advice would be to book through them. Please wait for the second week to see the monkeys we thought they were fake until then. Overall we thought the hotel and surroundings were great Definately make a visit to the swim up bar, the barman was fab! However.............

There is the magnificent pool area, and people that stay around it tend to spend their total time there. Then there is the beautiful white, cool to the feet, beach and again, those that like the beach don't leave. We didn't. The grounds have really come back from Wilma's damage. The trees are full again. The walk from the beach to the loby, on either side , is a walk in a jungle, full of different shades of green, flowers, and wildlife, that is more relaxing than getting a massage.Food is great, at buffets maybe don't get a little of everything every day because that might get old, but rather maybe have 2-3 things a day to keep things a little more varied. The diving, whats not to love about Dressel Divers and their unbelievably qualified staff. They are the best and can be totally trusted. If you have never dove, take advantage of the free one hour pool tryout. Give it a shot, you're on vacation. That's how I started 5 years ago and I'm hooked. Now, back to the beach. Since last year, something odd is going on. No one that I spoke with could explain it, but the beach all along Playacar and Playa Del Carmen is being destroyed by wave action. The Sandos to the south and the Iberostar, are the only resorts that have a beach left. The Iberostar's is 2/3ds what it was last year, maybe. The last Sat. we were there, April 14, the Riu to the north, lost five palm trees due to sand erosion. Such a heartbreak! We saw 10 feet of beach dissapear at the Iberostar, while we were there for just one week. So sad. The Iberostar is still a place of beauty but I don't know for how long. Sure hope \"they\" come up with a game plan quickly. If you have a trip planned, GO. If you are planning a trip GO, but don't book anywhere else, your lounge won't be 6\" from another.

I highly recommend this resort to anyone who has older teens. The disco \"Mascara\" was the meeting point ( after the show); there is no age limitation, except to drink. Both my boys made friends there and had a great time hanging out. The resort is 100% safe. This was important to me. The kids had complete freedom ( we had adjourning rooms) and they loved it. My husband loved the beach ( plenty of chairs) and the attentive service. There are lovely women who take drink orders, and remembered what we were drinking! We never had trouble making dinner reservations, and had dinner in all of the ala carte restaurants. The food was not gourmet, but, really, who cares? I was happy to have fresh salsa and guacamole for lunch with a glass of champagne. Does it get any better than that? We had a wonderful time just hanging out on the beach . There are plenty of really fun activities happening all day long. I was surprised that my kids ( and husband) actually participated in the mechanical bull riding, beach olympics, and dance lessons. The staff really do become your friends, and make you feel incredibly comfortable. Some tips: do NOT speak to anyone at Cancun airport. If you are looking for your ground transportation and ask for help, you will be directed to a very official looking person who will fast talk you into signing up for all kinds of excursions. KEEP WALKING! You will easily find your transporation. Please bring about $100. in singles and tip everyone. They deserve it, and appreciate it. You will never need pesos; everyone accepts American dollars. Give yourself plenty of time at the airport for your return flight. It is a very small airport and crowded with tourists.

They like rocks.coral etc. which you will not find swimming there. If you like to snorkel, I suggest trying Xel-Ha or another day trip outside of the resort.

The food was fantastic - especially the buffets! The choice was amazing and everything was really fresh. We didn't have one tummy upset during the whole of our stay and we really did try everything. Another concern before we left was being \"over entertained\" but we were very pleasantly surprised. OK the pool dance/games are not really our thing but you don't have to join in! The variety of things to do if you want to participate was fantastic and I can't sing the entertainment team's praises enough. They do a fantastic job, especially with the evening shows - some of them are really very professional. In fact all the staff are fantastic, very friendly, very efficient and always smiling. We scuba divided for the first time and were really pleased with the service of the dive center - very competent and efficient and again so friendly! I would highly recommend the day trip to cozumel to dive/snorkel organised by the dive centre. The room was spacious and clean. OK the beds are a little hard but we had no trouble sleeping! Our son also loved the kids club and all the activities they organised. Most of the kids were around 5-7 when we were there and our son had a great time. If I have to say anything negative about this resort I'd say it is not a 5 star hotel by international standards, more like a 4 star and if you look closely there are a few maintenance improvements that need doing but nowhere is perfect and any negative points were far out weighed by all the positive points. There is lots to do in the area and we used the public buses (leaving from the bus terminal in PDC) quite a lot - again everyone was so friendly and it all ran like clockwork. Excursions - don't miss swimming with the turtles in Akumel, snorkelling in Yakul, Xel ha, Xcaret and visiting a Cenote. We also spent a day at the Iberostar on Cozumel and loved everything about that too. It is definitely hotter over there (less wind) and you can snorkel right off the beach. If you are staying long enough then it makes a nice change. If shopping is your thing then it is worth going into PDC - I found the prices were a lot cheaper further down the main shopping street - so don't start buying at the beginning of the street if you want a bargain. The beach at the hotel was not how I imagined it to be at all. Yes, it is definitely the best beach along that stretch but I expected there to be a lot more of it and calmer water. The waves were quiet big sometimes. This is not a complaint, we really enjoyed it but be aware that it is not a particularly calm, warm sea.

Took a taxi into Playa Del Carmen a few nights and it was quite good although very commercialised. We went to Xel-Ha/Tulum for the day but wasn\u2019t too impressed with Xel-Ha.

Everything postivie you read about the reviews is correct. We had a great room in the 2000 building. The staff works hard, the resort is very clean and friendly. I really can not understand how anyone would find a problem with the food at the buffets. So many choices and all good. We really could have cared to make reservations at one of the restaurants. The buffet has so many choices and they change nightly. My favorite shows the Star friends put on was the ones where they did their own singing without the audience participation. I did notice that the beach had changed quite a bit from the last time we were there. Since Hurricane Wilma. Still nice, but not as big, as a bit of a drop off to the beach now. The weather was not the best on this trip, which made us a bit sad, but it was still warm, just not the bright sunlight we Pacific Northwesterns crave at this time of year. The beach was very rough for swimming in, red flagged 4 out of the seven days there. March 1-9. Noticed all the new work since the hurricane and asked the employees all that had been replaced since . The only trip we booked while there was the Pirate boat dinner. A little to lame for us, but I think it is because we are too spoiled with all they we have done over the years in various places in Mexico. The food was terrible, I hate to say that, but really it was. I think the funnest part of the trip was the people we picked up our bus ride there. Four different couples all from other countries. We had 4 different languages with the driver being spanish that made five. Wow what a trip that was! I have read many reviews about the Americans being loud and obnoxious, thank god I have not experienced it, but I have to say that I had more than my share of British men be extremely rude during our trip. I just assumed their names were all \"Dick\". Between the Tucan and the Quetzel I will say there is a huge difference to me. While the Tucan is more open and has a much nicer wooden walkway, ecspecially for those that wear shoes with heals, where the Quetzel side is dark and more of a cave atmosphere and your heals get stuck in the walkway. I much prefer the Tucan side. I also think that their lobby is a much happier , brighter atmosphere. I absolutely love the walk path through the jungle . The ambiance of it all just makes the whole trip. Having a hard time being back in the states. The pool was warmer than the first time we went 2 years ago. It is really a great value for all-inclusive, cost about 400 more than 2 years ago, but they had to rebuild quite a bit. My only dissapointment was the Star friends were not the same. I did not get to ask if they change them out to other Iberostar resorts. None of the faces from before were the same, but they were all friendly non the less. It is just fun to come back a year later and see the same people working there, but that is my only complaint, a very trivial one at that. I left my deck window open at night just to hear the sound of the jungle animals, the ocean and all the music going on at the resort. If you are thinking of staying you can't go wrong. Good food, Awesome ambiance, makes for great coohie-coohie (as they say in Mexico) anything your heart desires just ask and you will receive, even late nights if you want.

It's much more lush than it was last year, probably as full as it was in 2005. We finally spotted the monkeys, and we saw a new creature, maybe a coatimundi? It looked like a cross between an anteater and a badger. My daughter and I got a bit of a startle when a snake flopped off the top of the ceramics hut near the pool, landing at my feet. No harm, no foul, and it zipped right back into the greenery. The only glitch was that our room was really late in being ready, it was pushing 4:45. We packed our carry-ons prepared to spend time at the pool and beach, so it was OK. They also got us a room in the 1300 building. Near the pool and much quieter than the 1500 building.

We booked this trip through Apple Vacations traveling from Chicago. The Iberostar Tucan is rated a 5 Golden Apple resort by Apple Vacations. The resort grounds were beautiful and lush. Very tropical, loved the landscaping. Very well maintained. Check-in was a breeze and our room was ready. I had requested (a head of time) a room in building 15 since this was somewhat in the middle between the beach and lobby although it ended up closer to the lobby and buffet. Not a big deal because I didn\u2019t find walking from one end to the other to be that long. The middle section of the resort is a very tropical jungle like place with paths that go from the front of the resort to the pool area towards the beach. There is wildlife roaming about, roosters, peacocks, pheasants, lizards, monkeys and some weird rodent looking thing. It\u2019s very unique. At night the path is lit up by lanterns. I thought it was cool. The room was your standard resort room -- nothing special but acceptable. It\u2019s true what you\u2019ve read in these reviews, the beds are not firm they are HARD. We did not like the bed. For being rated a 5 golden apple resort I would\u2019ve hoped they could put some money into buying decent mattresses. However, I had no problem falling asleep each night. It might have had something to do with the mudslide and whiskey sour drinks ;- ) I did wake up with a sore shoulder one day due to the hard bed. The maid service was good and we did tip her a few dollars a day. There is a safe in the room that we found easy to use. The refrigerator was stocked with beer, soda and water but it wasn\u2019t cold but an ice machine is available. In the shower the water pressure was good and there was always hot water for a long shower, no Jacuzzi tub in the room. No bugs in the room either. The room was kept very clean. The beach was nice. The water is beautiful. We are beach people so we hung out on the beach each day. We never had a problem finding chairs but we got out there early. The beach did get a little too crowded for me. If all the straw umbrellas are taken you can go to the towel stand and sign out a beach umbrella. We did this many days so we could have shade later in the day if we wanted. Sign them out in the morning. All of the workers and at the resort were very friendly and helpful. We didn\u2019t tip the bartenders at the bars but we did tip the waitresses during the evening shows. They were running their butts off bringing people drinks. The nightly entertainment was cheesy at times but we enjoyed most of it. The entertainers are good and really seem to love their job, they are very energetic. I liked that the nightly entertainment was gear towards the adults rather than children. My biggest disappointment was the food. My husband didn\u2019t mind as much (but he\u2019s a guy and they pretty much eat anything). We were disappointed in the selection and quality. I understand it\u2019s not the US but we\u2019ve been to Cancun, Bahamas, Jamaica and Punta Cana in the past few years so I know what to expect. With a buffet I can usually find something I like especially if there is a salad bar. The salad bar was weak with only a few selections. There were times I struggled to find something to eat and I\u2019m not a picky eater. There are buffet restaurants by the lobby that serve breakfast and lunch. Breakfast wasn\u2019t too bad, I could find something to eat. We found a lot of the food that should be warm was not really warm. It was pretty much the same food each day. Lunch is also served down by the beach. Here you get hotdogs, hamburgers, fries, etc. While they added a little something new each day for the most part it was the same day in and day out and this got old real fast. Not the healthiest food either. The lunch buffets by the lobby weren\u2019t much better. Very little change in variety. One evenign we went to the buffet for dinner and it was serving the same stuff they had for lunch by the beach the day before (not the hamburgers and hotdogs), shrimp, tostada\u2019s etc. Not impressive. We did get 3 meals in the ala carte restaurants and we chose the Japanese, Italian and the Steak House. We enjoyed the food at all three. Overall it was a nice trip, decent weather and we enjoyed ourselves. Based on the hard bed, the food and the price we would probably not go back to this resort. Being rated a 5 Golden Apple resort my expectations were a little higher for this place. I wouldn\u2019t rate this a 5 Golden Apple.

We stayed twice at the Iberostar Beach (about 30 minutes north of the Iberostar Tucan). The Iberostar is only 35 minutes to the town of Playa Del Carmen (and a very safe walk!)

We didn't see a monkey for the first week but then they appeared and one even spent our last night asleep on our balcony. The beds were a little hard, but no more than any other holiday I have found and that was remedied by a nice massage in the spa. We chose to have ours in the Spa rather than around the pool area as we thought it might be a bit more relaxing. Believe me it was. The food was good. Plenty of choice of cooked foods and salads, as well as some plain food for those who don't like things a bit different. We tried the Japanese restaurant (which I am very surprised my husband ate at. It was Ok and we were glad we tried it. I can't fault it on anything; even the person who changed our sheets was fantastic. We had nearly a different towel animal/ basket every night (complete with eyes) as well as petals and chocolates on the bed. A real effort.

The Iberostar Tucan is easily the best resort we've had the opportunity to stay with in any of our travels. The hotel is spotless and gleaming, from the lobby to our rooms, even the public washrooms were always clean, with the scent of freshly cut flowers in the air every day. We found all the staff we met to be friendly and happy, always concerned that we were enjoying our stay. Our room was simple, and always comfortable. Our chambermaid, Margarita, always kept us well stocked with all the necessities, and always responded to our requests for more coffee or water, etc, and we were pleased to leave the occasional tip for her, generally around $2 U.S. The restaurants were all very good, with our favorites being La Gondola, the Italian a la carte restaurant, and the buffet, which was always good. The staff in all of the restaurants were always attentive, and the service was always excellent. Special recognition to Nora, one of the chefs on the resort, who toured a different restaurant nightly to make sure everything was okay with the food. She is delightful, and we always enjoyed chatting with her. Perhaps the part of the resort we enjoyed the most was the walk to the beach from our room. we were staying in Bldg 18, so daily we got to walk through the jungle that dominates the resort.The variety of birds, animals & repltiles we saw was extensive, and every day we made that walk we saw something new or different. The pools are large, continuous and always warm, but getting a lounger around the pool meant an early start to the day, so we spent all our sun time on the beach. The beach was beautiful, and the ocean was warm and refreshing. For an all inclusive, we found the Iberostar Tucan to be a great value. We never had to deal with any surcharges on menu items or international drinks, which was something we had grown to expect, based on our stays at other all inclusives. At the end of our two weeks, when I viewed our final invoice, I was very pleased to see no additional charges. The resort is located in Playacar, a gated community of resorts, condos and private residences. The area was always clean & well manicured. A small shopping centre, Plaza Playacar, was a 5 minute walk from our resort. Fifth Avenue, the main tourist strip in Playa Del Carmen, was a 20 minute walk, or cab fare was $5 U.S. 5th Avenue is closed to vehicle traffic, so lots of room for wandering. A large assortment of shops, restaurants and bars line this street, as well as the side streets. We had dinner at a restaurant called the Blue Lobster, just off 5th avenue on 12 street. The lobster tails were MASSIVE!!! We highly recommend it! There are lots of other attractions in the area, but highlights for us were the ruins at Chichen Itza, and Xcaret ecological park. Plan on spending a full day at each place, you'll need it to fully enjoy them! We definitely plan on returning to Playa Del Carmen, and would not consider staying anywhere else but the Iberostar Tucan Resort.

Nothing is too much trouble for them. We loved the al a carte restaurants, and were entitled to 5 bookings (no extra charge) for our 14 day stay, but at 5pm you could check the availability and book if there were spaces. The Japanese was the best for us - very entertaining. However, the others were also very good. The buffet restaurants were almost brilliant. Sometimes the dishes of food in the buffet were not as hot as we would have liked. Minor problem! The beach is great, soft white sand and blue clear sea. The hotel has lots of thatched sun huts, together with palm trees providing lots of shade all day long. We walked along to the beach past other hotels in the resort, and no other hotel had as much shade available. Entertainment was great - beach parties, beach BBQ's, games for adults and children - fun to watch even if not taking part. We had a brilliant time, and would not hesitate in returning again next year. Can definately recommend this hotel and resort. Our only downside is the travelling time from the UK. We had an 11 hour flight going out, plus the hour and a quarter transfer time to the hotel, which is hard work.

Over all it was lovely grounds and a beautiful beach. The room was beautiful (2028) on the Quetzal side. The sound of the waves crashing was worth the price of the trip. We were right on the beach/water. The sunrise in the morning is surreal. We had fresh flowers in our room upon arrival and another arrangement delivered 3 days later. They also sent a fresh fruit basket. The bathroom was very average, however, the shower was a walk in and made of concrete. I wondered how they sanitized it? The beds were very firm and my roomate did have a stiff back. I loved it and slept great. The closet had limited hangers with no clips to hold a skirt. They do not have drawers in the room, just shelves. Our safe was broken and we could not get our things out. After the second call, we had a total of 5 maintinence workers that eventually got it open. I would recommend making sure you open any safe before you go to bed if you have a flight in the morning, as it took quite some time to rectify the situation. The room does supply an ironing board and a hairdryer of average quality. They do not supply conditioner and you really need it after swimming in the pool and ocean so bring your own. The towels are by no means plush, but they served the purpose. They do provide bathrobes, which I thought was very nice. Our ceiling fan make a clicking noise the first night so we used bandaides to tape the chain s down and it worked. Service is actually pretty good. Anytime we called for anything, we were accomodated. Food and beverage: I will compare the food to a Royal Caribean cruise for a point of reference. If RC is a 5 , this food was a 2.5. The buffets were okay, but not clean. If you are not comfortabIe with animals walking around when you eat, then be sure not to dine during the day at the pool buffets. I always saw bugs either crawling or flying around. I justified this by knowing that we were outdoors and often that is the price you pay. My dinner one night had a small worm in the bowl and a bug crawling on my plate. I was with a group of 9 and the majority will agree with the quality of food. Example, the Japanese rest. used white and dark chicken meat. The steak and chicken had a lot of fat on the meat. The shrimp was not de-veined. If this is not important to you, then you may not mind. I hope those examples will put it in perspective. Presentation and service does not compare to a cruise. The beverage was fine if you drink beer, frozen drinks, and soda. The wine was less than average. The Lobby bars carry Absolut, but that is considered top shelf. We never had a problem getting a drink and we always brought singles to tip. The pool was beautiful, as was the beach. The jungle was really neat. I saw monkeys almost everyday. OH! In case you plan to wear heels at night, be sure not to walk through the jungle that goes through the middle of the property. The surface is very rocky. You have the option of taking the outer paths that are brick paved, but easier to walk on. The restaurants and show area is closer to the lobby toward the front of the property so you will need to pick one path. The shows were really pretty good. I particularily enjoyed the Mexican Folk Dancing. Very cultural. They have a group of employed people who execute the social events call The Entertaining People. I had a 50 minute massage on the first day with Alberto. Great job, very relaxing. Spa is average in appearance. With tip set me back about $95.00 Not sorry I did it. Played tennis with the pro one day $30.00 for 1 hour. One of the best lessons I've ever had. Worked out in the gym twice. Old equipment but served the purpose.

I read reviews faithfully the whole year about the Tucan, and based on the reviews, I was sure I picked the right place. It was fantastic, I couldn't have asked for anything more! Thank you to everyone who wrote reviews. I chose what restaurants to try, what excursions to do, based on the reviews. We ended up with a room just one building from the beach, so we were by the beach and pool. The room was excellent, the beds were a bit hard like so many people said, but we were so busy all the time that we still slept very well! I thought the food was very wonderful too, and I actually liked the buffet better than the specialty restaurants. There was always something different to try, and everything was very fresh. The staff were so nice and friendly, they made our stay that much better! We got to see the monkeys, which I was hoping for, and I loved those little \"rat\" things (sereques), all of the tropical plants, the whole layout of the place is just beautiful. We did the Pac Chen Mayan Encounter with AllTournative Tours which was a blast! I would highly recommend that. It was my idea to do it and when it came my turn to rapel down the wall, I whimpered pretty badly (but I did it!) and nobody laughed. We also went to Xel-Ha and snorkeled and that was wonderful. We went on the Captain Hook Lobster Dinner cruise, and that was great fun, but I really didn't think it was a family thing like advertised, it was more for adults. I just can't say enough good things about the Iberostar, or the people who worked there to make our stay so wonderful. I hope we can go again sometime and I would stay there again without hesitation. Lastly, I would like to say, that I found everyone we met while on our trip, from the people that we road the shuttle with from the airport to the hotels, to the people we met on our different excursions, were all so very nice! I saw some comments awhile back about people not being very friendly. I never met anyone who wasn't! And while we were there, my son lost his wallet with all his ID, credit cards and cash, and someone found it on the hotel grounds somewhere and turned it into the front desk, and nothing was missing from it! We asked who turned it in, and nobody left their name, so we never got to thank them properly.

We are a party of 6 who have just returned from the Tucan after 2 weeks holiday. I read all the reviews before booking and was a little surprised how many differing views were expressed. The truth is this is probably not a true 5* hotel. Having said that it does give very good value for money. The food is above average for an all inclusive, the service is terrific. The room service takes about 15 minutes from the time you order till delivery ,and is free !!. You can go to the al-a-cartes as many times as you like, subject to availability. The Japanese is truly wonderful. The rooms are adequate if not spectacular, and the beds are hard. I suggest you try and book a room on either side of the hotel , but not on the ground floor. This is because the jungle area is very close and can make the rooms a little dark. As for the jungle, you will see all sorts. Don't try and seek out the monkeys. If they are hiding you won't find them. If you bide your time they will make an appearance somewhere, and when they do make sure you have a camera handy. There are 17 of them, some tiny babies. Its great fun watching them feeding and jumping all over the place. The beach is great. It is a little difficult to get loungers on the beach and around the pool if you arrive after 10:00am. If you can't five a shady place on the beach , just ask in the towel hut for an umbrella. The pool area is good. The swim up bar is a little cold as it is tucked away down some steps. The alcohol soon takes care of that. We did the sea life swim plus at Adventurous. Its a 3 hour experience which involves seals, manatees and dolphins. If you have never swam with dolphins .this is the place to do it. I booked online for $179. This was the same price as the resort rep so you might as well book when you get there. If you do book any trips with the First Choice rep make sure she gives you all the facts. Sadly we had some issues, which involved 2 complaints and a refund.

We arrived very early on the 22nd, the day after our wedding, and we were exhausted. Our room was not ready until 3:00 PM, so we had a long day sitting around in jeans waiting for a room. When we did finally get a room, it was very clean and totally adequate. The resort is very pretty, and there is a lot of wildlife roaming around. You will see lizards, peacocks and \"capybaras,\" which are like large hamsters, everywhere! There is a waterfall and giant swans and turtles in the lobby of the adjoining hotel. The beach was very nice and clean, and we ALWAYS found beach chairs, no matter what time we wandered down there, which was a very big plus. The pool is huge, and it accomodates a large number of guests. We always had plenty of room to swim around. The swim-up bar is separate from the main pool, which we did not like so much. I have stayed at places where the bar is attached to the main pool, and we liked that better. The food was good, but there was not much day to day variety at the buffet. It was pretty much the same every night - although one night they did have a sushi bar, which my husband loved. We did eat at the japanese restaurant one night, and that was very good. We took the ferry to Cozumel one day, and shopped and ate in the city. The ferry takes about 45 minutes, and I think it was about $20 per person. You can totally bargain for prices at most places... the sticker price is always ridiculous. We wanted these ceramic fish and we were told it would be $100 for four of them, and we ended up getting them for $30.00. We also took $5 cab rides from the hotel to Playa del Carmen several times. The cab drops you off in an \"OK\" area, there is a modern mall there, but nothing really impressive, but if you keep walking, you'll find a really quaint area with really neat bars and shops... we had a great time there. We had mojitos at a local bar (and did not get sick) and ate at \"Sushi Ito\" in Playa del Carmen. Also, once or twice a week, local vendors come to the hotel and set up their stands in the lobby, and you can shop right in the hotel. As far as nightlife at the hotel, you could either hang out in the lobby bar, or go to the nightly show in the theatre.

This was our first Mexican and AI vacation so we really weren\u2019t sure what we were looking for. And after staying here we realized it wasn\u2019t here. I would only recommend this resort for people with families or people 40 yrs+ that are traveling in groups. ROOMS - The rooms were simple, and clean - about what we expected. Bathrooms only had a shower, wasn\u2019t a big deal to us. All rooms had a balcony and we even had a partial ocean view from ours - which was a nice added bonus. My complaint about the rooms was 1. The beds were VERY hard. I could not sleep through the first night on the bed, I had to move to the slightly softer sofa/sitting area. We got mattress pads after the first night, but it was still WAY to hard for me. I woke up with back pains every morning. With all the complaints about the beds I\u2019ve seen, I can\u2019t understand why the hotel doesn\u2019t invest in something softer. 2. The temperature was not very controllable. It was either off, on high or on low. Off left it too warn, and high/low made it too cold in the middle of the night. 3. You could not turn off your balcony light. I think this is b/c the balcony lights are part of the hotels outside night lighting scheme. But leaving the light on only attracted unwanted bugs that got in when you opened the door to get out. SERVICE - The buffet service left something to be desired. For breakfast and lunch I often had to get my own drinks, when I don\u2019t think we were supposed to. The wait staff seemed more worried about setting up new tables than making sure the existing guests had enough drinks/water. No complaints about the service in the two ala carte restaurants we ate at, front desk staff, and the bar service. It was very good. FOOD - The Japanese restaurant was VERY good. My boyfriend who is a picky eater even really liked it. Italian restaurant is good too. I did not like the appetizer or desert buffet, but my meal was very good. The buffet food was just OK. We usually found something we liked, but there was not much variety from day to day and sometimes some of the food looked like it had been sitting out for a while so we quickly grew tired of buffet food. The drinks were OK. As I expected, very cheap alcohol was used and I got tired of it after a while. POOL/BEACH - Beach was nice and big, as was the pool. I was able to get into the pool and swim with ease at just about any time of the day. The pool was so big it easily accommodated the large amount of people. The chairs around the pool were often crowded. We had a hard time finding two unbroken chairs together during the day. After about 4pm people started to clear out. The pool bar was OK, but we did not spend much time here. ENTERTAINMENT - There seemed to be a lot going during the day and night. But we had no interest in participating in any of these events. So I can\u2019t really comment on them. Others seemed to enjoy it. We watched about 15 minutes of one show on our way back to our room one night. It looked OK, again we just had no interest in it. My only complaint about the entertainment is it was very repetitive, loud and obnoxious to those of us who did not want to partake in it.. I think I heard the \u2018Hey Baby\u2019 song 5 or 6 times during our stay. It got really old very fast. MISC - 1. The location is excellent. You are inside of a gated community so it is very safe. And you are a 5 minute and 5 dollar cab ride to Playa Del Carmen, which we really enjoyed. 2. Hotel grounds were beautiful and kept up well. It was neat to see all the animals. 3. There was nothing going on by the beach at night. I did not like nor understand this. Since none of the common areas are air conditioned, why not take advantage of the cool ocean breeze at night? The lobby bars got very warm at night, as did the buffet restaurant and the show area. It was very uncomfortable. I can\u2019t imagine being there in the summer. 4. Internet access is very slow. Don\u2019t waste your 20 pesos and time. 5. We found it annoying that you could not order/get food all the time. From the hours of 5-6:30 I don\u2019t think there was anything. And you could not get anything before 7am. We left at 7am to go home and it would have been nice to eat or grab something before our long bus ride and line at the airport. And we came back from an excursion once, hungry, and unable to get anything for an hour. All in all we did not have a bad time nor do we think this is a horrible place. I just don\u2019t think this is what we wanted. Next time we will look for a less family oriented place, and a more classy adult oriented place. Specifically we\u2019ll be looking for unlimited non-buffet food at night, better quality alcohol (if it exists in an AI place), stuff open on the beach at night, and food service 24 hours. On a side note, as far as excursions. We did Captain Rick\u2019s Deep sea fishing, Morning Glory Snorkeling tour, Xcaret, and Playa Del Carmen. We really enjoyed all but Xcaret. The only thing we enjoyed at Xcaret was the underground river, and that alone I think is worth the price of admission. But unless you want to pay extra for swimming with dolphins or variations on scuba diving, the rest of the park is basically just a zoo, housing animals that I can see in a cage back home. MG snorkel was great b/c they take you to the Great Barrier reef and you have guides that stay with you that is a major plus for those who can\u2019t swim.

We found the rooms to be clean and the air conditioners were always running. We called the front desk twice for wake up calls and once for more towels, and were greated with friendly staff who were more than willing to make our stay great. As other people have found, we did find the beds to be very firm! At no time did we ever feel that our belongings weren't safe in our hotel room as we had heard that several other people from other hotels complaining about missing their property. We stayed in building 16 which was central to everything, the eating lounge, the pool and the beach. The buffet meals were excellent with constant friendly workers who really catered to our children. The food was always excellent quality with a huge variety. Sometimes our kids can be a little fussy but it was never an issue here. We had one meal at the steakhouse that was a perfect end to our vacation. Our suggestion is to make your reservations for the a la carte early as they do fill up quickly. At the steakhouse we had a fantastic steak supper in a wonderful atmosphere. We had our opportunities to attend the other a la carte restaurants but chose to stay with the buffet, not only for the food but for the friendly staff that greeted us with smiles each and every day. The pool was very large with a depth of water for every age as well as very clean. Then there was the beach! The beach was beyond our expecations and we spent several hours baking in the sun there. The kids loved the water and even though there was rough seas that week, the kids had a blast. We were always able to find a lounge chair on the beach regardless of the time of day, there was no shortage. However, if you're looking for a chair around the pool you should go early. Although you aren't supposed to reserve chairs, we saw ones with towels on them that sat without people for several hours. The only thing we could have done without were the topless tanners as there were several children at the hotel. We are planning to come back soon and will be staying at the Iberostar Tucan, when you find a place that makes your vacation fantastic and your family so welcome, you return. The facilities were great and only made better by the ever pleasant staff. Whether you were wandering about the resort or just passing by hotel staff, we were always greeted with a smile and a friendly \"HOLA\". We highly recommed this hotel to other families and look forward to returning ourselves.", "Date": "January 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Alberta", "Title": "\u201cHad a very good time\u201d", "Author": "Valuator", "ReviewID": "UR6650634", "Content": "We were at the Iberostar Tucan from Dec 26, 06 to Jan 2, 07. We are a family of 5, mom dad and three young adult children. This was a return trip for my wife and I. If you are going to Playa del Carmen and like the beach, this is the only game in town. The hurricane from a couple of years ago wiped out a substantial number of resorts beaches. The IB and the place next door, I believe it was Sandos Gala have by far the best beaches in Playacar (that's the name of the hotel district). The beach was crowded but we always found louge chairs for our family of five any time of day. The accommodation is simple but very nice, clean and well maintained. The maid service was excellent. The fridge was always well stocked, towels were always replaced, room cleaned perfectly etc. The pool area is very nice. Large pool. A little cool certainly not cold by any means. The food is good, not great. It could easily be improved and the resort would only be better. We ate at the Tropical, Japanese and the buffet. The Tropical was very good although I seem to recall some minor complaints from other reviews. A couple of our family felt a little quizzy and thought the food may have been at fault or it could have been the different foods eaten while on holidays. For myself, I tried just about everything, drank the water and had no problems. I am sometimes amazed that some people complain the drinks are to weak. If you ask the bartender for more there is never a problem. In fact a number of times the bartender simply held the bottle upside down until the glass was pretty much full and that included the preium brands. There is a guitar player at the lounge that plays on alternate nights that studied in Mexico City and is quite simply the best of the best.

From the very first moment of arriving into the Cancun airport and getting on the van to head to this resort in Playa Del Carmen, we had a blast! When we arrived at the resort after about an hour drive, we were so happy with our decision. The resort is amazing and the beach is so beautiful - the ocean there looks just like the Corona Beer commercial with the Blue green water and soft white sand. The staff at the Iberostar was very friendly and always happy to offer a cold drink. They do a nightly show for the guests and it was a lot of fun. The room that we stayed in was basic but also very nice and very clean. Our cleaning girl was great. Every day she would stock the cooler and leave us a little towel shapped liked an animal. During my months of research, I had read in reviews to bring bug spray because of the little bugs in the area so we brought 'OFF' with us and sprayed down in the morning after showering and never had any problems. We also sprayed a little around the room just to be safe and also never had a problem the entire week. The food on the resort was great. The buffet food was always good and the snack shack was too. We ate at the Mexican food restaurant and it was good and the steak house was also very delicious. We spent a week there and even though we often ate the same foods, they were always very good. We ate off the resort one night at Senior Frogs and were both very disappointed. Senior Frogs is a great place for drinks after dinner but don't go there for the food. During the week that we were there we spent it sitting by the pool and playing in the ocean and shopping in Playa del Carmen (a short walk away from the resort or a $5 cab ride). Plus during our stay, we took a couple of excursions. One was a 'half day' tour to the Tulum Ruins. it is really a neat place. Make sure to bring your camera. The other trip we took was to Xcaret - a nearby ecological park. This place is awesome - it is part Zoo part water park and very beautiful! FYI - make sure to wear a none oil based sunscreen because they won't let you bring oil based sunscreens into the park. Plus make sure that you spend the time and money to go snorkling thru the Cenotes (sp?) and the Sea Trek Scuba Tour - they were both really fun. We didn't do the Dolphin Qwest or stay for the dinner theatre but we wanted to save a few things for the next time that we go (which is what brought me back to this website). I'm actually checking out packages to go again this summer because we haven't stopped talking about it since we got home over 6 months ago. So to sum up a long review - Save your time and your money and sign up for a trip to the Iberostar Tucan!

We traveled January 4-11th, 2007. The weather was okay while we there. It rained a couple of days for about half an hour and all day one day. We went down with 30 of our closest friends and family for our wedding. We got a good deal from an agent, but the agent caused more stress then anything. Making promise that he could not keep and screwing up some of the documents. We all got there and the trip was great. Rooms = Due to the amount of us, we all wanted to be close together. We were all over when we got there, but the front desk was great at trying to get us all together. The majority of our group was in 18, with 2 couples in 17, my younger brother in 15 and us in 14. They are all close enough to walk between but there was definitely surrounding noise. The ones in 18 and 17 had to deal with the lobby bar noise all night. 15 had the wildlife on their porch. 14 does not attach to anything and all we could see were the trees. We also had the neighbouring hotels night club was in close proximity. It was entertaining to listen to on the walk home, but loud enough to keep us awake. The beds are as hard as all the other reviews say. We figured we would be able to cope but they are very hard (the box spring is a slab of concrete!). The maids were great. They always left the towel creations on the bed and were very organized. They have body soap in the shower that is nice and offer you the whole basket of needs. The hair dry was not great. It would dry your hair, if you could hold the handle long enough. I would recommend bringing your own if you use it daily. Food Buffet - The buffet was great. They had a wide selection of foods for all meals. A little bit of everything. A'la Carte meals were unpredictable. The Steakhouse was horrible. We had bad service. We had booked with two tickets. One for 5, the other for 7. Due to the meal being our \"rehearsal dinner\" with friends, we wanted to all sit together. His remark was 'two tickets two tables\". We had to pay the dude and moved the tables our selves. The rest of the night went down hill from there. The steaks were okay in flavour, but the cut was not what you thought you ordered. Plus for the 10 that were ordered they were all over cooked. We had hopes for dessert, but that were squashed. The brownies were like hockey pucks, we were lucky not to chip a tooth. Due to our reservation being for 9:00pm, we were the last group to be seated. The staff was too busy stacking chairs and pushing everything to the side while we were eating to bother serving us drinks. I would say the only good thing about the meal with the blooming onion appetizer. It could have just been the day, because my parents went a different day and said the service was amazing. The food still sucked. We were very worried about how the wedding meal was going to go. We also tried the Italian. Everything about it was amazing. The food was delicious and the service was great. We had the pasta and the veal. Both were cooked and flavoured to perfection. The appetizers were different, plentiful and delicious. We only tried one dessert. It was absolutely to die for chocolate cups with a hard outer shell and melt in your mouth mousse inside. The addition of fresh strawberries made it over the top. There was mariachi band playing to all the tables which added to the ambiance. Adventures We did two of the excursions. We did Xel-ha with the group. It was great snorkeling and a fun day. The fact that it is all inclusive and you don\u2019t need to worry about anything while you are there is a bonus. Some of us left and went to Tulum. They said that it was a bonus. A bunch of us also did the Coba tour; we saw the Coba ruins, then cenote (underground caverns full of water) and then a Mayan village. The only thing that I enjoyed was the Mayan village. The bus ride is long and uneventful. We definitely realized that renting a car and doing the tour by ourselves would have been more enjoyable and a better management of time. The Mayan children stole the day for me. I had brought lots of toys that they loved to receive. We also had lunch at a little stop on the road. The food was not something that I would eat again. A friend and I also enjoyed the parasailing on the beach. Unfortunately we did not really think it out and did not plan the crazy Jet Ski ride to the boat where you get hooked up to the parasail. The water was very rough and made me sick. Odd, but I actually felt better in the air then in the boat. The landing was rough. From the beach it looked like I had broken my leg, but it was just a little bump. Definitely take a camera up and take pictures. Wedding I had been coordinating with Mariela about things from the time I booked the resort for the wedding. She was great about answering all my questions and letting me know what would work. I met with Mariela when we got there and finalized everything. She was a big help!!! It is great being the only wedding that day!!! It definitely makes you feel like the day is yours. I started my wedding day with an amazing chocolate wrap at the spa in the morning to relax and then wondered around from bar to bar with some of the girls to take of the edge. I then traveled back to the spa with drink in hand to get my hair done. I met my mother and mother-in \u2013law who were already in the chairs. It was a good thing they went first, because my mom had to change her hair. I went in and showed the lady a picture of the style I wanted and showed her how my head piece was supposed to sit on my head. I was optimistic. I should have left! I have naturally curly hair that has not seen a hair brush in years. The first thing the non English speaking lady did was attempt to brush my hair. I had to put up my arms to get her to stop. Needless to say it was all down hill from there. The whole time I sat in the chair I prayed. She had screwed it up with the brush so I had to see what she had, plus I was not able to get my headpiece on with the vale without help, not to mention the flowers. My hair was the only thing that I did not like about my wedding! Of course, no one else noticed at thing!!! I would recommend going with an up do. The wind was blowing my hair all over in the pictures and by supper it was up because I was so hot. Mariela and the staff delivered the wedding gift packages to the guest that day. So that was a big bonus and one less worry. The wedding decoration were done an hour before the ceremony. I had ordered more flowers for the arches and some of the girls added the decorations that I had brought to personalize the wedding. The dinner went well. Mariela was great at accommodating some personal things that I wanted added to the dinner tables, like tablecloths that I had brought and extra flowers. We had brought a CD player to play our own music for the reception, but the bar people were great at letting us play our dance songs on the big stereo in the bar. The serves were okay, the bartenders were the best! They were very accommodating in all the special requests. We had to share the restaurant with other guests of the resort because there were not enough of us to book the whole thing. It was odd at the beginning, but everyone there was a good sport and made it an experience. Not sure what the other 15 people felt like being on the outside of wedding dinner though. We did our first dance and the father daughter dance after dinner before the cake. The cake was to die for!! I did not care for the carrot flavour added to the plate, so I had 3 pieces of cake instead. I could not get enough of the chocolate strawberry heaven! After the dinner we headed back to the lobby bar. Carlos made us lots of special drinks and everyone was drinking and having a great time. We had a great time hanging out in the lobby, taking lots of pictures and celebrating. Some of us headed to the disco to end the night. It was entertaining and a place to dance. The photographer we got at the photo shop on the resort was good. She definitely captured the beauty of the day. We had a gorgeous blue sky with some white fluffy clouds. The pictures show everything to perfection. There is even the bonus of the parasailing in the sky for colour. The pictures look like they are from a magazine. I\u2019m a little bias, but it was definitely the most beautiful wedding I have ever been a part of. We have pictures of the ceremony on the beach and lots of pictures in front of the ocean in the sand. We also did some by the pool and in the jungle. The colour and clarity that the photographer was able to capture was good. We got our pictures the next day and they were great. We did not get the DVD, we had friends that took video\u2019s for us. All in all, the wedding we everything I had dreamt it would be. I would recommend the beach wedding to anyone. The planning was different and still a bit of a pain, but nothing like getting married at home.

I wasn't expecting the walk through the forest to get to the beach, but it was very nice and very exciting to see all of the different animals walking around. The hotel is all inclusive which I definitly recommend! All meals and all drinks are included, it's so nice - you never have to spend money! The hotel also has specialty restaurants aside from the buffets they have every night. You have to reserve a seat but it's worth it, they are nice. The beach is very clean and the pool is big. There is also a shopping area right down the street from the hotel, maybe a 2 minute walk, and it has many stores with all the souveniers you could want, so you could theoretically never leave the hotel! If you'd like to leave, you can call a taxi and go outside of the hotel area, or they also have excursions that you can sign up for and the bus picks you up at the shopping area. I highly recommend taking an excursion. We went to Tulum and Xel-Ha (Tulum is mayan ruins and Xel-Ha is snorkling). They were both very memorable experiences.

We couldn't fault the hotel. The room was spacious, clean and comfortable. All the hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. The grounds were well kept and the jungle area down to the pool is lovely, especially when you see the peacocks and monkeys. Although we are not usually interested in hotel entertainments programmes there were all sorts of activities to cater for everyone and if you wanted to join in that was great, but no problem if you wanted a quiet day. Pool: Huge pool with plenty of space to sunbathe. Well maintained. Beach: This hotel is situated on a really nice stretch of the beach, it didn't seem so nice more towards Playa del Carmen centre. The sea was lovely and clear and not too rough. The beach is not a particularly quiet beach for those in search of solitude but there were always sun loungers available and the hotel towel hut always had spare parasols to lend out if none were available on the beach. Food: Excellent variety and quality. We ate out at 4 of the 5 speciality restaurants (all except the tropical) and had really nice meals in all. The buffet restaurant always had plenty of choice and was very well run. Even breakfast had loads of choice from fry ups to doughnuts, pancakes and waffles, to fruit and freshly blended fruit juices. Evening entertainment: The entertainment in the main bar was not really our type of thing, a little bit cheesy, but we tended to go to one of the lobby bars which were more chilled out. Really good cocktail menu and all the international spirits were within the all inclusive option. We went to the on-site nightclub a couple of times which was OK but the music was a bit out of date. A taxi into Puerto del Carmen was only $5 each way, or a 30 min brisk walk, and there are plenty of shops to look around and bars to stop in throughout the evening. Location: Nice resort and an excellent base for day trips. We caught the local ADO bus (from the bus station in Playa del Carmen) to the ruins in Tulum, lovely setting and worth a half a day visit. We did a snokelling trip on Cozumel (through the hotel dive centre down on the beach). We opted for the full day tour which we really enjoyed but it was a joint dive and snorkel tour and so some of the reefs were a bit deep for snorkellers. We did a night out in Cancun, organised by the tour operator, which was excellent. Involved going to a couple of bars and then onto Coco Bongos which is a fantastic night club with lots of shows.

Noticed little tiny \"bugs\" on wall and chambermaid there within ten mins to sort. Toilet blocked twice during stay but plumber there within ten mins also. Oh, we didnt even notice the \"hard\" beds and slept like babies for the whole 3 weeks! Food: I am vegetarian and my hubby is not and there was plenty of variety for us both. We didnt have anything that tasted horrid or wasnt cooked properly and neither of us got ill. The only problem with the buffets were the food was only ever warm, not hot which disappointed a bit. We tried all the A la cartes (5), but not much for me to eat at apart from Italian but my hubby said every meal he had was great, (and hot!). Grounds: Pool huge so never crowded and plenty of sunbeds, beach gorgeous and never had a problem finding 2 beds even if we got up late. The wildlife was amazing here and we were lucky to see the monkeys several times which was great. Well maintained and always someone cleaning or pruning wherever you are. Entertainment: Always something to do during the day although we didnt take advantage of everything. Our disappointment was the evenings as there was always a show but if you're not keen on these then it can become tedious.

The jungle and beach are pretty - but blend into the background after a few days - not worth staying here for them We went to find some lunch (we were up at 4am and starving) and were told to go to the lunch palpa - by the beach hot dogs,burgers,chips and beans ect.. rolls hard as rocks and cheeses melted from sitting in sun. Please take note: FOOD IS HORRIBLE HERE. the same foods are in breakfast,lunch and dinner buffets. And you better get used to buffets - we got in on Sunday and tried to reserve the so called \"al a carte\" restaurtants(more on them in a moment) and weren't able to secure a reservation until Wednesday night late. The food is sweaty from sitting in heat - kinda gross.As for Sunday - we find out (not from the staff) that you need a reservation for the buffet that night - it is a \"gala new years buffet\". they wouldnt give us a reservation at first until we argued because the other restaurants were closed and we wouldn't be have any dinner at all and then couldn't get in until 9pm. It was bland and boring. Just because you stick shrimp in a buffet doesnt make it special - especially when under hot lights all night. The meals were all the same EVERY DAY. Fill up on breakfast as you will be sick of it by dinner. As for specialty - Bonzai was pretty good (imitation of Beni Hana) our daughter (17 yrs) enjoyed it. You are allowed 3 if you go for a week. You have to book days in advanced- so you have to plan your trip around it. The Italian was a pretty room. But alacarte is a loose term. The appetizers and desserts are a buffet. They only bring your entree. Limited menu - if you like Olive garden - your in....As for the steak house - it is outside =you are eating a hot meal with no a/c. again everything but entree is buffet. Baked potatoes were frozen = we sent them back and new ones came back frozen. We thanked the waiter and left and went to the buffet to eat - again. Now we did go into Playa del Carmen a couple of nights for a great meal - and wasn't dissappointed. Very reasonably priced as well. The drinks are crap as well - pina coladas are not frozen and all wine (all 2 - 1 white and 1 red) are too sweet. Even the \"champagne\" is fruity wine. Just go into town for food and drinks. The room - spacious,ac works - the beds are on cement platforms, not boxspring and frame. HARD,HARD beds. We read reviews and a few said they would be hard- so I brought bed pads AND had the hotel put \"egg crate cushion\"on and it was still like sleeping on the floor. None of us ever got a full night sleep - back pain and constant hip pain are included in the price. The room doesn't actually come with an iron we found out. We called and asked for our iron - they brought it with a dorm size board. We went to use it next time - it was gone. I called the front desk to be told they only lend irons for 1/2 hour and then take it back for other guests. Well I paid for 2 rooms and we needed an iron. So I suggest you do what we did - Hide the Iron. Your read right - Hide it. We put it in the cabinet that matches the fridge and we had an iron for the week. Other things (too much to detail) 1 beach towel per person only, never seats around pool,you have to reserve the pool table- even when it is open and get sticks from front desk. Drinks are weak and should'nt have to keep going in pocket to tip- and it doesn't work we tried. Ugly green wrist band, tons of kids and NO Nightlfe at all.Again Go to town.,water sports not included,\"late night buffet is food from dinner buffet - hot dogs and burgers with no buns- I could go on. This is not like Jamaica \"no problem mon\". Here everything is a problem - our teenager asked us to never come here again. OK. The whole reason to do all inclusive is food and drink included.These are just 2 of the reasons not to stay here. The Europeans didn't smoke too much and the Americans weren't really loud - maybe we were too sleep deprived to notice....

I'll try be brief. We traveled early December. we booked thru Apple vacations. We were a group of four in our fourties looking for a great beach,secure , clean conitions, a variety of foods for the different palates, close to town but not right in town....we found everything we were looking for! The grounds as everyone has said previously ...are beautiful and well kept. Word of advice for the ladies...don't even bother bringing heels. A lower heeled sandal will work best as their is alot of walking on uneven surfaces. Also...if it rains the marble tile near the restaraunts is super slippery!! Caution! Guys, yes, you do have to wear a collared shirt (Polo is fine ) no tank tops or shorts in the reservation restaraunts. We personally don't have a problem with that. The world has gotten a bit to sloppy for my tastes anyway when given the option to say \"go casual\" some people give an inch they will take a mile. I'm not saying by any means \"pack a suit\" but yes, put the dress pants in there with a polo shirt. The beach is one of the best in the area. Loved it. We hung out on the far end closest to Sando Playacar resort and found it to be near the action but not too noisy. We loved it!! Access to water is perfect. When you take a left on the beach you can walk quite a distance without a problem. Nice for taking off the extra calories from the good food. Ice cream stand with real scooped ice cream is available each afternoon right on the beach. Lunch buffet is close to the beach and ocean. Perfect! We found the food, hot and plentiful. The pools were pretty and also...pretty busy. We chose not to hang out there as it's not our bag. Those that were by the pool seemed to be having a great time and entertained by the STAR team. Yes, there are families there but the grounds are big enough to keep your distance if that's what you choose (quiet , romanitic get away anyone.) Massages are available at either the beach or in the spa area. Gym area is newly renovated (but not airconditioned...but who cares ) Safes are in the room, are free and are the programmable type. Towels plentiful and new. Beds..........HARD!! Balconey at the rooms which made for a nice a.m. area while drinking coffee we made in our room w/ Coffee, The pot, and water all provided each day by the maid. Fridges filled daily , sodas, beer and water! Nice touch. Wireless internet available in the room. Along w/ pay per view movies. Clock radio is in the room mounted on the counter by the mirror/tv.. Playacar shopping area is a mere five minute walk and they have an internet cafe and telephone area that is cheaper than at the hotel...and the internet is wayyyyyyy faster there too. Playa Del carmen is a Five Dollar taxi ride away and was a good time. All the name shops and bars (Carlos and charlies, senor frogs etc...) tons of restaraunts to choose from all on fifth ave. Fifth ave reminds me of the FREEMONT Street in Vegas in a way , that it's all one lonnnnnnnnnnggg street w/ acess to everything w/o traffic (except at cross streets) ...well worth the cab ride in. Leave tips or trinkets etc...for the maid on your pillow. they work so hard and they truly do appreciate it!! Weather was soo/soo in December but we made due. Still came home with a great tan!! Personally we chose not to use our Apple Rep in the lobby as they were higher for day trips than we found elsewhere. Have a great vacation!! Go there with a smile, the idea that you will be doing things at a slower pace...don't sweat the small stuff...and Lay back on your chaise with a cold one andddd ENJOY!!!", "Date": "January 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "madison, wis", "Title": "\u201cA Must Visit Resort\u201d", "Author": "patricia1956", "ReviewID": "UR6556603", "Content": "We Wisconsinites LOVE warm weather in winter months so the 6 of us headed to this resort. We have stayed at the Ibersostar Paraiso del Mar before but wanted to try something a little different. The service was great. The weather was sunny and warm all 7 days. In fact, this resort and the Paraiso are identical in many ways. We had three specialty meals - all WONDERFUL: would recommend the Tropical and the Japanese restaurants. Great staff and meals. The resort also made a fantastic party for New Year's Eve - the menu was very diverse and delicious. Also, wait staff was generous with champagne and wine. The beach is the best - no problem getting loungers even as late as 10:00AM. Loved the umbrellas available at the towel station. The rooms were generally clean - we would have liked our minibar stoocked with more diet sodas but we had plenty of water and get extra towels any time we requested. The entertainment was good clean fun and the Star Friends really knock themselves out keeping everyone involved and happy. Our 4 kids (16, 18, 19 and 22) all loved the beach volleyball and water basketball. Because it was the holiday season, there were manay families and less spring breaker groups. The resort was pleasant and quiet - very peaceful and relaxing. We always found something eat, something to drink, sunshine, and friendly staff.

The second visit, however, surpassed our first visit. We were pleasantly surprised by the improvement to the beach. On our first visit 6 years ago there was a large drop-off just as you were going into the water that was very hard to climb, and very scary to our young son. This time, there was still a very modest drop-off, but nothing compared to the prior visit. Much improved!! The grounds at this resort are amazing, probably the best part of the resort. I have stayed at around half a dozen other resorts in the stretch of Mexico, and the Tucan has the best grounds by far! The jungle is wonderful, which makes the walk very pleasant. You do have to be careful if the path is at all wet, at it can get slick, but I imagine that would be a problem anywhere. My kids had a blast watching the peacocks, looking for the monkeys, staring at the iguanas, and trying to figure out what the big rodent-things are. The pool is just wonderful. It is so large that you never feel crowded, and there are always chairs to be found (unlike the beach). We decided to compromise on how we would handle the chair situation. I personally can't stand the tendency that you see of people rushing down early to \"reserve\" all the best chairs, then hardly being there all day. So, to ensure that we would at least have a tiny spot of shade (which you need when traveling with small children) I went down before breakfast and grabbed ONE chair, rather than 4, and that gave us a retreat from the sun when we needed it, without unduly effecting other travelers. We then shared the one chair all day. Okay, I would prefer not to, but you kind of get forced into it. Back to the pool, there are varying depths, which made it good for the kids. Our older son, 10, could swim around and explore, while our younger son, 4, had a great sloped area perfect for him. Best of both worlds. We spent most of our time there (not that my husband and I wanted that, but when traveling with kids...) We ate at the buffet restaurants for every meal. Again, not what we would have chosen, but easier with the kids. The food was ample, well prepared, and varied. There was always something to eat, and we were all happy. That truly is saying something, when we have stayed at other resorts where I was sure my youngest would starve before the end of the week. True, he is picky, but still. You want choices, and they have choices. The hostess at the Tucan buffet was Angelica (or Angelina) and my youngest fell head over heals for her on the very first visit. So helpful, very caring, and very pretty. Made our stay very welcoming! Our room was incredibly clean, with towel art nearly every day. I do tip, but I doubt that was a factor. The fridge was always stocked. I asked for extra water one day, and ended up with gobs of bottles of water every single day. The beds are hard, but not so that you couldn't sleep. The blow drier in the bathroom worked just fine. It was a waste of space to pack mine. ( I have very thick, long hair-I imagine the blow drier will work for everyone) We were in building 13, which was wonderful. We walked down from our room and were right next to the towel hut. Everything was an easy walk from there. I had e-mailed the resort in advance to ask for a room in buildings 12 or 13, and to please have us above the ground floor, and both requests were met. A first for Mexico. All other requests to prior resorts went unnoticed. One final note- On every trip to Mexico at least half the group gets sick. Sometimes that is 1 person, sometimes it is 5. When I say sick, I mean REALLY sick. Stomach issues that last for days, and often require anti-biotics. Not that this stops us from visiting, but it is an unfortunate reality of travel to Mexico, at least it has been for us. This time, NOONE GOT SICK. Not one. Wonderful bonus!! We honestly don't know if general hygiene practices in Mexico have improved that much, if we have just built up a resistence, or if the Iberostar just takes better care. Can't tell you. But I know it was a pleasant surprise. If you want a visit to Mexico to a family friendly resort that has a great pool and a really good beach, the Iberostar is it, as far as I am concerned. If the beach is everything and you care less about the food and the proximity to town, take the Barcelo Maya. For us, the Iberostar has become a favorite.

My husband and I went for 4 nights to relax after a long stretch of work, house and family issues, etc. Our goal was to lay in the sun and not do much of anything. This was the perfect place for that. Playa del Carmen has wonderful weather, a lovely downtown, and great beaches. Those looking to experience the Mexican culture might try visiting somewhere a little less touisty. My husband and I loved the beaches, had no trouble getting the sun shade huts, and we had all the food and drink we could handle. The food was great. Unless you're traveling with small children, make sure to have lunch at the restaurant buffet and not the snack bar (note for Americans: lunch buffet starts at 1pm-- we got a little confused the first day). We really liked the a la carte Japanese restuarant, which is the only a la carte place we went to. Drinks were great and plentiful, though maybe a little weak. Definitely a bit grossed out by the raucous, drunken swim-up bar. But we didn't go in that pool, so it dodn't bother us. Beach was gorgeous, rooms were super clean, service friendly, food was good (you might get bored with the same foods if you're there for an extended stay, but we thought the buffets were great for our weekend trip). Beds were very hard by American standards, but we had no trouble sleeping. Very much the consistency of a camp bed. Another note for Americans...people smoke at this hotel. There's non-smoking in the restuarants and buffets, but expect to see and smell cigarettes on the beach and in the bars. I didn't think it was at all overwhelming, and the room was absolutely pristine. Definitely recommend snorkeling, and if we had stayed longer we would have taken a day trip to Cozumel.", "Date": "January 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "MA", "Title": "\u201cDidn't want to leave\u201d", "Author": "bricheet", "ReviewID": "UR6521734", "Content": "I just returned, today, from my second visit to the Iberostar Tucan. The place is as great - maybe better - as it was for my last visit two years ago. Checkin is pretty fast and the bellboys are friendly and happy to help. The staff also speaks pretty good English. In fact, the process went so smoothly on the first day that we still had time for a quick swim in the afternoon. Now, the food. Let me start by saying that all of it - buffets, restaurants, popcorn at the bars... all of it is prepared very well (with one exception - at the Tropical restaurant my mom ordered steak very well done and she got it rare... wether this was the waiter's misunderstanding or the cook's fault, I don't know). The buffet food, for the first three or four days, was wonderful. After that, like the last time I stayed at this resort, I noticed that it served the same food for each meal. Don't get me wrong, there was a ton of variety to suit every taste and need, but if you tend to try a little bit of everything like I do, you soon get a little bored by the repetition. They did occasionally add some new dishes though. But don't worry, the variety of food that WAS present was plenty and delicious. The restaurants also served fantastic food - especially the Japanese, where diners are seated around the cook and get to watch him make their food. He also did some pretty neat juggling tricks with his cooking utensils. I highly reccomend this restaurant - the food was delicious. The Italian was okay - it served very small portions - but I guess that's the way it was supposed to be. The Tropical was very strange and a bit hit or miss depending on taste. Overall, these three restaurants were great and I hear that the other three were as well. The rooms were very nice. The beds were comfortable, everything was kept clean and orderly by the maids. My only complaint was that the TV and cable clock would turn off occasionally (and the remote didn't work at those times). The actual resort was gorgeous. It was kept clean and beautiful daily by a hard-working and plentiful staff. The jungle on the way to the beach was beautiful - different kinds of trees, peakocks, chickens and roosters, other birds whose names I didn't know, capibaras, iguanas, lizards, and monkeys everywhere. This is a fantastic place to go with children because of all the animals. Addidionally, the place is great for kids because there's so much for them to do - there's a miniclub for kids 7 to 12 I believe (or something like that). They get their own mini disco at night and as far as I saw, they loved it. The only major downside to my stay was the lack of activities for teens. I'm a teen myself, and while I could usually find something to do, I sometimes felt like I wasn't quite included. For example, as I mentioned the kids have their own little show/games during the day and at night. The audience participation show is for adults only. So the teens don't realIy get to do anything at night... They can go to the disco of course, but that's also targeted towards adults with the amount of alocohol served and the slightly sketchy people who attend. I felt this was unfair. This resort is targeted towards families with younger children, and while it's a nice vacation for more outgoing teens who can easily make friends and make their own fun, it's harder for those who want something organized for them (which is what a good resort should take care of in order to provide for a fun vacation). Organizing fun activities yourself is hard enough at home, and you shouldn't have to worry about it on vacation, especially at a resort of such class as the Iberostar. The entertainment was also nice. On some nights it was a bit cheezy, but mostly very funny (when the Starfriends team ran it). It was great when outside groups were invited to perform traditional Mexican dances or Pre-hispanic stories. So, overall, I give this resort a 4.5 out of 5. It's a very good value - great food, rooms, helpful staff, and activities, though it's targeted less for teens than for families with younger children.", "Date": "December 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Wales", "Title": "\u201cBUTLINS\u201d", "Author": "HolidayMole", "ReviewID": "UR6520109", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel having booked through First Choice last Christmas and were not impressed.On arrival we had no room and when they did find one it was dreadful so basic no luxury what so ever.

It takes about an hour Hotel/Room On first impressions our Hotel appeared to be amongst the best we had seen. With the open Lobby and immaculate floor we were immediately met by a porter (with a smile) who took our bags and asked us to check in. We were met by another smiling receptionist who immediately booked us in and explained to us where to eat etc, and Tagged us (Asbo stylee which you do get used to). We were then given a lovely drink which I can't remember the name of, but was nonetheless very welcome. Our room was basic a la concrete Slabs for beds but we had the best sleep for ages in them. Our Fridge was restocked everyday. The View was of the Tennis Courts but we don't go on Holiday to sit in the room. Bev said the Hairdryer in the Bathroom was OK so you don't need to bring one. There is Shampo and Soap in the Shower which have plenty of room. You get a free safe, you add your own Pin which is always a plus. Entertainment We only watched the Mexican night which was impressive at times and nice to see a bit of traditional dance. Wildlife The walk through the Jungle is brilliant when you start to see the different Wildlife. Be careful of your footing on the path especially if you've had a few. While swimming on the Beach a Pelican actually dived about 5 feet away from Bev so I got a great picture when it did again. Children would love all the seemingly tame animals. There's too much to list here. Food You cannot complain about the variety of food at this hotel there is something for everyone. Yes you do pine for home cooking after about a week but I find that to be true wherever you go in the world. What with Lobster night and Prawn nights I actually had my fill of sea food. This made up for the fact the Sea Food Restaurant was closed for our stay. Surprisingly we found the Italian to be the best Restaurant. The Mexican was nice and we had booked the Japanese twice but cancelled the second time, we found it far too salty (I cook & eat Chinese food all the time so I know it wasn't me). The first time we went to the Steak House it was fabulous, the second time there were no starters left and my steak was tough, so, I suppose it's very much a case of taking the rough with the smooth or the tough with the tender as it were. (pun intended) We had room service once and it was prompt and ok plus there's no extra charge. Drink We had no trouble whatsoever getting Branded drinks. I asked for Bacardi once each night and got that every time. I don't like lager so the beer was like any other lager to me (I like Bitter). They do a dark beer but I thought it was disgusting. It's the first All In that I've not had to pay a premium for Branded drinks. Trips We only did Tulam 1/2 day and it was good enough for those who don't want to walk around ruins all day. Which I do but the Mrs doesn't, she did get bitten by mossies which she normally doesn't. I get bit in my Garden at home but only once in the two weeks here, so, you'll just have to wait and see. Cover up if you get bit a lot. There was a Torrential downpour on the way and our Bus was the only vehicle that didn't pull over, or even slow down, twice we Aqua-planed and I was genuinely worried for our safety. Tips We spent \u00a3300 on tips but a word about it. Many of the staff said it was not neccessary but I still tipped. I was talking to an Ex -Pat in Playa del Carmen and apparently Hotels charge 12.5% (ish) Service charge to the tour operaters which is divided up amongst the staff so you have already tipped when you paid for your Holiday but on saying that a good personal service deserves rewarding and let's face it, outside the glitz it is a poor country. Staff We found the staff really friendly, helpful and curtious at no point was any of them rude to us and if you don't speak Spanish it didn't seem to matter. Fellow Tourists I stopped saying Hello to fellow tourists after about three days after Bev convinced me that three days of people (most not all)ignoring you is enough for anyone to get the hint. We paid for our Holiday by saving the money we used to spend on Smoking so we aren't exactly pro Smoke but I didn't think it was as bad as I've read. There does seem to be a Europe v US on these pages. I will say one thing we met some lovely Americans and some lovely Brits. I think the fact that many Americans seemed to be rude (no please and thanks) was just a case of the culture they're used to. I can honestly say that the only Drunks I saw were from the States and Eastern Europe and they were often the loudest (maybe the Cold war has been replaced by who can drink the most war) but it never affected our Holiday makes it a great place to people watch. Beach Fantastic and the first three days we were there it was so calm and clear you could see the fish swimming around you. It's clean and you only have to turn left and walk up about half a mile to see how much room you have compared to the other Hotels. They are virtual Sardines compared to you. We had no trouble getting the same Palapa nearly every day. If you're down there for 08.00 you won't either. Yes I know guests are not supposed to reserve them but if you want to remove somebody's feel free but why worry, there were always spare Loungers and you get a Free Brolly from the Towel man. It 's a shame that if you turn right there is a lovely walk for about a mile that is spoilt by rubbish. I know it's probably because it's nobody's responsibilty but it does spoil a nice walk and it's also a good place to try Snorkling (free for an hour every day) by the Rocks. Wriggle your fingers and watch the Fish come to you. If you don't like it, and it can be slightly worrying first time, you haven't wasted any money on a trip. Take a walk down to the beach at night very romantic and we discovered a lovely piece of Sand Sculpture. Safety In Playa del Carmen I was offered drugs in broad daylight at 10.30 in the morning. So if you're a druggy you're in, me, I found it slightly worrying. You do get hassled a little by shops but just say no thanks and they leave you alone. Be careful in Senor Frogs I asked for a large a Vodka & Orange & Bacardi and Coke, we got a Yard of Vodka and Fanta and Bacardi and Watery Coke for \u00a314. To make things worse (for me anyway) I was propositioned in the Toilet by a Mexican. If that's your thing by all means go there. Overall we would recomend this Hotel, the Staff are great and although it's not five star it was definetly worth the Money and even the Cramped 13 hour and 11 hour flights. We will go again in a few years and take the Kids.

I booked this vacation nearly eight months in advance so I spent a lot of time on this forum \"researching.\" My previous experiences with all inclusives in the Caribbean includes two stays at Riu Tropical Bay in Negril, Jamaica. CHECK IN - We arrived at the hotel in the early evening. It took about 20 minutes to check in. My request for rooms in building 11 was honored. Two rooms on the third floor. I requested building 11because it is the closest building to the beach and pool besides building 10, which is all suites. I requested second or third floor for the chance of an ocean view from our balconey. Sure enough we had a nice, partial ocean view. Nice perk. Pros and cons to being in building 11. Yes, you are very close to the beach and pool but it is a bit of a hike to the buffet and lobby. ROOMS - The rooms were fine, we had no problems. Yes the beds are firm but not uncomfortable. Only showers in the bathroom, no bath. A bit of a downer for the wife and two daughters. Small refrigerator and as others have mentioned not cool enough to keep drinks cold. Maids did a decent enough job and the towel art was appreciated by my 8 year old. LANDSCAPING/JUNGLE - The landscaping was beautiful. The jungle seems to have filled in nicely since the hurricane in October '05. The jungle path runs from the buffet (just south of the lobby) to the pool area on both sides of the resort (Tucan and Quetzal) about 75 yards. I must say it is a really cool feature, especially for the kids. At any time during the day you can see peacocks, roosters, a large rodent creature (forget name), iguanas and monkeys along the path. The monkeys are hardest to find but we did see them one day. There were two days during the week that staff photographers had a small monkey on the beach for photos with guests. Tucans, flamingos and turtles are in designated areas. FOOD - The buffets were OK not great. For breakfast everyday I would get an omlette at the omlette station, that way I was sure my eggs were fresh. Fruit was not nearly as good as in Jamaica. The dinner buffet was hit or miss, not impressive at all. We only ate at the dinner buffet twice because it was so unimpressive. We tried two speciality restaurants. The steak house was very good. Three of us ordered the tenderloin and loved it. The Italian was mediocre. My lasagne was not good. Lunch at the restaurant by the pool was pretty good. BBQ hamburgers and hot dogs, french fries, a couple of pasta choices and always plenty of guacamole and chips. If not for the food I would give this resort a five star review. They could do better with their buffet, particularly the variety and quality of fruits. We ventured into Playa Del Carmen twice for dinner. We ate at Yaxche (Mayan cuisine) and Babes Noodles (Asian cuisine). Both were excellent; great atmosphere, tasty food, good service. POOLS - The main pool is large and beautiful. Very clean. Thumbs up! BEACH - Magnificent! Soft white sand, beautiful multishaded green/turquoise/blue water. That is the main reason that I travel to the Caribbean, for the gorgeous beach. The beach at Iberostar Tucan will not disappoint. The tempermant of the ocean will change daily. We had two days with little to no wind. The water was like a bay and it was literally perfect beach days. The other four days were windier and the ocean was choppier and there were small waves. I was down at the beach by 7:30 each morning and had no problem securing as many lounges as I wanted wherever I wanted. Suggestion - we buy cheap inflatable rafts before we go and have the dive shop inflate them when we arrive. Very enjoyable and relaxing to float on a raft in the Caribbean sea. Time to go home leave the rafts for another family. STAFF - Not nearly as friendly and outgoing as in Jamaica but the Iberostar staff were very nice and helpful. It is a cultural difference I know, but it still is a meaningful difference as to the overall enjoyment of ones vacation. ENTERTAINMENT - We only made two and a half shows based on how tired the kids were in the evening. I was impressed with what I saw. Much better than the shows that we saw at the Riu Tropical Bay in Jamaica. The Mexican Folklore show was great. The entertainment staff works very hard and it shows. EXCURSIONS - We hired Edventures for a private tour for a day. It was a truly memorable day. We swam with the turtles in Akumal bay, snorkeled at Yal Ku, experienced a cenote and went to a private beach. We also did a half day on our own to Tulum. The ruins were very interesting and the beach below, spectacular. The Riviera Maya and Playa Del Carmen is an amazing location to vacation.

The Tucan along with the Quetzal that shares the property is a wonderful resort and we had a great time. I highly recommend the Tucan/Quetzal We booked our trip trough Liberty Travel and flew direct to Cancun on US Airways. Unlike some reviews I read, we got through the airport and customs easily. As soon as we got to the customs line they opened up a new lane and we were the first through. I pushed the button and got a green light so we didn\u2019t need to have our bags checked. Liberty booked our shuttle to the resort on Olympus tours. We ignored the time share people and were directed to the Olympus booth. A porter took our bags to the pick-up location and we boarded a 15 passenger van for the 45 minute shuttle to the resort. We had other passengers that were dropped off at other resorts on the way. The van was a little crowded but the people were friendly and we all were looking forward to a nice holiday. We got to the resort before check in, and were met by Pablo, our Olympus Tours representative who explained the check in process and encouraged us to see him at his desk after we got settled to provide the information to ensure our arrival at the airport for our return trip. Olympus and Apple Tours had a representative desk in the main lobby. Of course they were also available to book additional tours if desired. We were pleased with Olympus, as they were helpful and friendly without being pushy. We knew that we were early and it was not check-in time yet, but were sure we could still begin to enjoy the resort even before we were able to get into our room. We were surprised however, that one of our two rooms had been finished. I emailed the resort about 3 weeks before we left to request a room closer to the beach [--] . The customer relations representative, Mario Bernegger, responded quickly and was very helpful, and he said he would pass my request on to the reservation department but couldn\u2019t promise anything. Since beach front units are more expensive I didn\u2019t think we were going to get one of those, but we were pleasantly surprised when we were upgraded to two beach front units for no additional charge. I would suggest that as soon as you arrive you book reservations to one of the specialty restaurants. If you are staying 7 days you can make 3 reservations. We were only staying 6 days so could only make 2 reservations. You can, however put your name on a list to get in one of the other restaurants if they have room. We were able to get into the restaurants of our choice, but not always at the times we wanted. We really liked the steakhouse and the seafood restaurant. If you can\u2019t get into a restaurant, the buffets were still very good with a wide variety of food choices. We booked two tours through our Olympus representative. My son and I went to Loma Bonita, a ranch where you can ride horses, ATV\u2019s or Wave runners. The guides speak English and are very good. They also provided a lunch of nachos salad with black beans. We had a good time. My daughter and I took a snorkeling excursion through Catamaya. We sailed to the reef on a 65\u2019 catamaran, snorkeled and when we were finished there was a lunch of barbecued lobster tails waiting for us. The trip also provided free drinks. On the way back the crew entertained us by playing music and getting the guests up and dancing. The facility is beautiful with loads of animals in a jungle setting within the resort property. Guests can walk through the wooded area on walkways to access the restaurants or the beach. The rooms were nice and as other reviewers stated the beds were a little hard, but that didn\u2019t bother us any. The beach was fantastic and the water is as blue as the pictures indicate. We never had a problem getting a beach chair. A note for those with children, there were a few instances of topless sunbathing. The resort has a huge pool which my daughter and wife used more than I did. The Star Friends work hard to entertain, but we did not make use of most of the resort entertainment. We did go to one show where a magician performed who was pretty good. The staff is very helpful and friendly and work extremely hard. Please tip them as they don\u2019t make much and it is greatly appreciated. We met people from Europe, Canada, Russia, and of course from the US. Even though the Tucan is an all inclusive resort and there is unlimited alcohol, we never saw any drunken or unruly behavior from any of the guests. We all just wanted to relax and have a good time. Olympus set up our shuttle back to the airport. This time we had more people going back and we also picked up some from other resorts so we used a small tour bus which was very modern and comfortable. The airport was busier than when we came down, but we got through without too much of a problem. It was sad to leave since we had a great time and it was 85 degrees, and when we got back to Philadelphia it was 37. Oh well, we hope to return someday.", "Date": "December 18, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "northumberland UK", "Title": "\u201cAn honest opinion\u201d", "Author": "NewYork96", "ReviewID": "UR6448052", "Content": "Please, please ignore one recent review. We were there the same time and her comments are simply not true. We had no problems with sunbeds, beach noise or Americans smoking. As for Cozumel Iberostar being better than Tucan - this is just a joke. We also went there and had poor food and terrible service in Cozumel but it is a beautiful hotel. To British readers she should go on a SAGA holiday to Eastbourne! This is NOT Butlins in the sun! We were @ the Tucan for two weeks and had a great time - like living in a zoo. Animals including monkeys and the birds are fantastic and our small kids loved them. Food was good, but speciality restaurants were very good. Go for the Italian and be looked after by star man Alandlo and the Japanese with top man Clemente. Hotel was very clean and well equipped for 700 guests when full. Huge pool, beautiful beach, very attentive staff and in a great location. We went to Xcaret (buy online $54 and get a taxi $6) for my wife's birthday and had a great day - watching turtles being born! Cozumel is interesting but please choose a calm sea day as the ferry is a nightmare in high seas. Worth the trip for a days snorkelling (see review of Iberostar Cozumel). Animation team were not pushy but worked hard and pool noise was only a couple of times a day. Hard to please all the people all the time but they had it right. Night show was slightly above usual all-inclusive standard - as people say not Las Vegas but the Argentinian magician one night definately was. After two years staying in Dominian Republic it was good to get off-site with no danger and Playa del Carmen is a good shopping area. Worth it to watch the Cruise Ship passengers rushing about desperate to buy anything. Do not pay sticker price - we got a hand painted turtle down from 600 pasos to 100 pasos. Only downer was the weather - cloudy with rain most days but it seems to be a very bad Nov/Dec this year so we might try it again next year. PS - Noticed an American/British battle starting in the reviews. The hotel was 35% American/Canadian 35% Russian and 35% European (with British 15%).

However we went up to our rooms and were a bit dissapointed. They were clean and had everything you needed but we found them really small and not really the quality you'd expect from a 5* hotel. The decor just looked cheap and definatly didn't suit the very high standards of the rest of the hotel. But as I said it did what it needed to do just a bit of a let down. The Pool and beach are excellant and really well laid out with plenty going on throughout the day with the hotels entertainment team doing various activities all day. Only downside to the pool was no matter how early you woke up all the good posistions around the pool and in the cool little beach huts were already taken. I wouldn't of minded but the people who 'reserved' these places rarely even sat there until late in afternoon. very annoying, and mostly americans I'm afraid. The A la carte restaurants were good Italian and steakhouse especially. Word of warning though, the Mexican that we'd been looking forward to was crap! I wont go into details just dont bother going there. Buffet's where a bit disappointing this (aswell as the rooms) is where i'd say it definatly isn't a five star, lots of choice but just not particulary nice or Hot!! on too many occasions (especially at lunch) the food i picked up was stonecold. very dissapointing. Last of all the staff...... They absoloutly made our holiday, friendly , funny, and extremely helpful. Always remebered your name and there was loads of them there.

The pool was a little loud for our taste with loudspeakers blasting music and aqua aerobics,etc. This would be my only complaint, so we would sit at the end of the beach and it was rather peaceful. We had quite a bit of rain in the mornings but it would usually clear up. One day it rained all day. I must say I am perplexed by the many complaints by Brits about loud Americans. We found that a very small percentage of the guests were Americans. Many, many Europeans at this hotel and the only loud drunks we observed, yes, they were British.

The highlight of the hotel is definitely the jungle in the center of the hotel, we saw monkeys, turkeys, peacocks, flamingos, iguanas, lizards, tucans, praire dog like animals, spoonbills, herons, etc. Our 2-year old son was fascinated, many of the animals stood as tall as him, and he would gauk at them and squeal with joy. Well worth it. The only unpleasantness is the smoking at the hotel, many Europeans (Dutch, Russians, Germans, Swiss, Brits) frequent the hotel and they smoke like chimney stacks. Particularly unpleasant when your in the dining room or at the beach. Also, the tour organizers from Apple, or the others for that matter, tend to rip you off a bit with their tours. The tour agents quote a trip to Xel-Ha for hundreds of dollars for a family. We did the trip using a taxi from the hotel to the minibus in Playa del Carmen to Xel-Ha and back for way less than that.

Gorgeous jungle, very good beach (compared to some such as the Riu Palace that only have partial beaches with walled areas). I particularly liked that the Tucan is the next to the last hotel on a very built-up strip. So, it's only a short walk to a lovely stretch of beach with only wilderness facing the beach and much less people. Value is excellent: lots of good food, unlimited frozen drinks (the kids love the virgin pina coladas and daquiris). While not top-of-the-top gourmet, the food is varied, fresh and good. The many ceviches were excellent. The Japanese restaurant was our favorite, but the grilled shrimp at the tropical Uxmal restaurant was fabulous, too. (The lobster pasta was disappointingly bad, but they let my son replace it with the shrimp.) Book restaurants the first day and get on the waiting list for more than your allotment. We got an extra restaurant night that way. Our room was clean and comfortable (and we loved the different \"creatures\" our room person created for us each day out of towels,napkins, fresh flowers and paper eyes!) The mattresses are firm, not uncomfortably hard (They're just not for jumping!). I called the week before to request a room facing the pool (the others face other hotels) and on the second floor with 2 doubles. (The first floor rooms are somewhat lacking in privacy.) We got everything I asked for. If you're not a night life person, ask to be near the pool/ocean as that is as far from the show area as you can get. Even then, the bass is audible in the room. We met people who were very disturbed by the noise and had to move farther away (near us) when a room opened up. The scuba set up is excellent, if a bit pricey, but they're open to negotiation. They say they can't share the \"Shrimp Package\" of 6 one tank dives for the price of 5, for example, but they can and will. There's a 10% discount for cash. Call ahead with any questions. My older son still needed his Open Water certification, and they let him work at his own speed to get it quickly with no corner cutting. While certification at the Tucan was about $100 more expensive than in the States, it included 4 open water dives in one of the best dive locations in the world, so I considered it to be a good deal overall. Very nice multi-lingual staff. Small dive boats come to the beach 20-30 yards from the dive shop. Great marine life: lots of big turtles, rays, eels, barracuda, one enormous crab, lots of the usual tropical fish. Not a lot of big coral, but I think that's the result of last year's hurricane. The water is still delightfully warm at Thanksgiving, but cooler air makes for a pretty miserably cold boat ride back. The good news is that the dive sites are very near to the hotel; no more than 10 minutes away. They have good wetsuits to rent and most equipment was in good condition although my younger son did have a regulator come apart on him on one occasion and an inflator valve stick on another. Fortunately, we weren't deep. The only negatives were probably just personal to me: a few too many loud, heavy-drinking Americans. Also, to my mind it's a beach destination with little of real sightseeing interest beyond the natural beauty (unless you want to take a plane into Chichen Itza which we had already done a couple of years ago, or make a visit to nearby Tulum). If you like amusement park type entertainment, though, there's a fair amount of that sort of thing around as well as touristy shops.

Therefore not amused to be held up by an american lady in front of us who had to go and retrieve her husband to sign in (he had gone to get drinks!!!) Our room was in block 18, very clean throughout, have to agree with some reviewers on the hard beds! Room position not too bad, convenient for lobby and Buffet. The staff work very hard (always with a smile and a \"Hola\") nothing was too much trouble for them, so I was somewhat embarassed to witness the attitude of some american guests who treated them as inferior, when in fact they themselves could have learned a lot from the staff in relation to manners and courtesy. Respect is a two way thing. I personally had no problems with the food and felt the selection was good for the price we paid. I think some people expect champagne standards for lemonade prices. The pool was very large, though I didn't use this as preferred to swim in the ocean. The swim up bar seemed to be mainly occupied by groups of americans who became progressively louder as the day went on. As mentioned by previous reviewers not many seemed to move to visit the toilet.....ugh! The beach was fantastic. Plenty of palapas and beds, but you had to be up early to get a palapa as a lot (along with loungers) were reserved, despite requests by the hotel not to do this. Personally, I found it better to get a parasol from the towel hut and find a plot with some space, away from some of the louder groups of americans. One texan guy shared his country and western music with all in the vicinty whether they wanted to hear it or not. Maybe he should put an MP3 player on his christmas list! The drinks, other than those in the lobby bar were watered down, even the beer, so on the beach I gave up and drank bottled water instead. A few Coronas with a twist of lime would have gone down well!! This let the place down a bit, as I feel we should be treated as adults in relation to the alcohol we consume, and be allowed to enjoy a nice cold beer or a full strength drink.

I'm going to break this review down into tthree parts: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. The Good - The resort is beautiful. The rooms are clean and very comfortable and the maids do a great job keeping everything up to standard. The grounds are fantastic and well maintained due to the hard work of the staff. The Star Friends do a great job entertaining during the evening and running the activities during the day. The service at the bars and dining areas is excellent and the the staff always has a smile for you. The pool areas and the beach are super and there are plenty of lounge chairs available, if you get there early enough. If you wish to go shopping or sightseeing this resort is in a great location, only a $5 cab ride into town and within a short distance from the ruins at Tulum, Coba, and Chichen Itza. The Bad - The food is not the best in the world but as the old saying goes, you get what you pay for and in this case you're getting plenty for your money so don't complain if it's not five diamond dining. If you want that then go to the Ritz and pay five times as much. The beds are hard but lots of people like a firm mattress and it didn't keep any of us awake at night. Everyone complains about the saving of lounge chairs at the beach and pool but we found that we enjoyed getting up early and going to the beach around 7:00 to read for a couple of hours before breakfast so it was not really a problem for our group. The Ugly - Too many underage kids getting drinks from older brothers and sisters. One night as we were walking back from dinner at La Marimba we came across six young boys (between 12 and 17 it appeared) and at least three of them were under the influence. One boy wearing a sling for a broken collar bone staggered off the path at least twice and ended up breaking his glass on the walkway. Another boy was passed out across the walk while his \"friend\" pulled on his arm and yelled obscenities at him within in front of our wives and in sight of another dining area where I'm sure there activities were well noted by the staff and diners. I wonder where their parents were and how they would have reacted had they come down the path around the same time we did. We reported the scene to the front desk and the girl called security right away. I can only hope they got there in time to catch them so no one else had to listen to them.

Enjoyed our stay the the staff was wonderful. We checked in and it took a bit longer than expected. They gave us a room right by the lobby, which was a great distance to the pool and beach. We requested a closer room, and they were able to accommodate us the next day. Changing rooms was a bit of a pain, but well worth it. At the Tucan a lot of walking is required. Although we were now close to the beach, we were a distance from the lobby and restaurants. We didn't realize that the rooms didn't share a mutual hallway. So when we had a few sprinkles on our way to dinner, there was nothing to cover your head unless you came prepared with umbrella (not a bad idea....). Ok...the beaches were breathtaking! The pool beautiful too, no slide for the kiddies though. We were able to get chairs...if you go out by 8:00 you're good. Food....not the best....but not the worst. Breakfast...at the buffet you could always get an omelet, toast, hard boiled eggs, scrambled, bacon, sausage, pancakes and waffles were plentiful too. Lunch....we always managed to find something by the pool restaurants. Dinner....We booked the Italian, wouldn't recommend it to you. My children ordered tortellini and received 3 monster tortellini's that were spinach (pasta) filled with meat. Not only was the presentation bad, the food was equally. My meal was horrible as was my husbands and the other couple & their children that we traveled with. We then booked the Japanese Steakhouse...and finally had a really good meal.... Decided to cancel the regular Steakhouse and booked the Japanese again. Put it this way, if you're a food snob, this is not the place for you. I'm not saying it's terrible, but it's certainly not the top of the line by any means. The Star friends kept the kids and husbands entertained with games by the pool. The evening shows were ok (once or twice). However, don't miss the \"Michael Jackson\" night....that was actually worth seeing. Went to 5th Avenue two evenings and did a lot of silver shopping. The people were great and always looking to make a deal. The kids (girls) can get braids there too. I think we paid $25 for a half head. Only a $5 taxi ride to town... If you're looking for something a little more upscale my friend just got back from the NEW Riu Palace. Apparently there are a lot of them in the area. She said the food was fabulous as was the hotel. The food is a bit more upscale...just comes down to what's important to you. My husband said he wouldn't go back to the Iberostar, although it was nice, he's more of a food critic than I am. I would go back..the kid's enjoyed themselves tremendously...as did I. Ceramics are extra...they get you for our $30 per piece....we had to drag the kids away after doing two each. They also offer great massages pool side. They also braid hair by the massage tables. Massages were $50 for a half hour, not sure what they charged for the braiding. They also have some vendors come in for silver in the evenings after dinner, you can bargain with them too. Also my husband was able to pick up quite a few Cuban cigars too. All in all if was a nice vacation...not perfect...but to me as long as it has a beautiful beach, nice pool and clean room, I'm happy. Only downside was the food, and getting wet when you didn't want to. If the hotel was enclosed, you would have lost the feel of the hotel. Oh yea, went to X-Caret. Beautiful place, but the \"lazy river\" is lazy because you have to swim the entire way (with my seven year old holding on to my feet for \"dear life\"). I had been through it about 14 years ago and don't remember it being so gross and very dark through certain areas and way too long. If you have little ones, I don't recommend it. They swam with the dolphins there which is approx. $80 per child, well worth it. That day, however, was expensive... Cost approx. $80 each adult, $56 each child to just get it. Dophin swim an extra $80 per child, then they rope you in to the $50 DVD $12 each photo, etc. Which was adorable, and you'll want too. Wound up approx. $600+ day (just a heads up). Didn't do anything else, just enjoyed the warm sunny weather and great beaches. Also a note...it is a topless beach. I was a little worried (don't know why now) with the kids, but after the first chuckle from my son he was too busy digging in the sand.

We even had a small view of the ocean from our balcony. The service was great in all aspects. While tips are not required I would encourage them. The people work very hard to make you as happy as possible and deserve a dollar here and there. We always tip the bartenders and housekeeper upon arrival which proves to be money well spent through the week. We had no complaints with drinks and were served Jose Cuervo exclusively which was fine with us. When we asked for an extra amount of alcohol they always added more. Our room was very clean, the housekeeper kept water in our fridge everyday and a large gallon was left so that we could refill bottles. As everyone talks about the shower was large and had great water presure, room enough for two. I suggest bringing thermal cups for drinks. By using these we were able to keep drinks at the beach cold for hours. We also brought rafts for floating in the ocean and left them for another couple to use that were staying longer. You are a semi-short walk to 5th Ave or by taxi for around $5.00. The food was very good. We ate at four resturaunts and if you check daily you can usually get in beyond your allotted amount. There is probably enough on the buffett to satisfy even a pickey eater. This was our second trip to Playa and we will be back to the Tucan.

So I was going with them on a whim and a prayer. We had a wonderful time. My kids want to go back and they can't stop talking about the trip. I really have nothing negative to say. It was a great trip. We used Apple vacations. (I'd always done worry free or funjet before.) But Apple was fine. The hotel is very open and our room was very nice. We had 2 beds and then there was a daybed/couch. My youngest daughter slept there. We had plenty of room. A safe in the room was nice to have. The ref was stocked daily and we had fun animals on our beds made out of towels. The beach was a long walk from our room. Take a bag you can fill with stuff so you don't have to make lots of trips to the beach. I was pleased with the beach though. It was clean and private. We did not have all the vendors walking by bugging us. Several woman were topless. (Most of them were the one's who did'nt need to be.) My kids did okay with it and thought it was kinda funny. You can get an umbrella from the towel hut for the beach and place it in the sand. That was helpful because most of the Covered areas were taken. We spent most of our time on the beach. I've been a lot of places in Mexico and this was by far the best beach. Take a Budda Buddy Keg.( It holds about 32 oz) I went to the bar and they filled it up. It kept my drink cold for hours and I had plenty of beverage rather than the little 8 oz cup. Rum and coke kept me good! The pool was very large. The nightly shows were okay. Nothing special. We had fun picking our place to go for dinner reservations. There are lots of choices. We never got in the steak place. It was always full ( a good sign). Everywhere we went was good. The \"Tropic\" was our least favorite. (More adult foods than kids.) We took a cab ($5.00) into downtown to shop! You have to go about 2 blocks back of where they drop you off to get good deals. It's called 5th Avenue. The newly constructed shops are more expensive. The shops in the heart of downtown are where the deals are. We took water bottles from the hotel with us and did not eat any food in town . I just did'nt want to have to deal with sick kidos.

We sailed on a Katamaran everyday (included in the package) up and down the Playacar area. Iberostar Tucan and Sandos definitely have the best beaches in Playacar. Riu Yucatan may be a close second but looked extremely crowded. Anyhow, the beach was gorgeous and water was extraordinary. There was a fair amount of toplessness on the beach which I wasn't used to, but you grew sort of accustomed to seeing it I guess. The pool area was very nice too (the pool is a large, lake style pool). Some may argue that it is not as fancy as some other resorts (there are no wave pools, lazy rivers, or ledges to sit in the water with your chairs), but the pool was definitely more than adequate. The rooms are average. Beds are hard but we slept really well anyway. Large walk in showers with hand-held shower sprayer. Entertainment was awesome. Some reviewers in the past said the shows were cheesy and they didn't enjoy them. I disagree. The ideas behind some of the shows may have been somewhat cheesy, BUT... the entertainers were extremely talented. And the live latin band that works at this resort rocks! Actually, the Michael Jackson impersonator working at this resort could probably pass more for Michael Jackson than Michael Jackson himself these days. He was amazing especially at moonwalking! The magic show and the Mexican Culture show was great too. I would definitely return again and again to this resort! This is truly a beachlover's paradise.

I have been reading reviews of this hotel for about 3 straight months, and had very high hopes and expectations. Everything people have mentioned about the hotel in terms of the cleanliness, food quality, and beauty of the hotel is accurate. This is an amazingly beautiful hotel with a stunning beach, excellent food and food choices, and excellent a la cart restaurants as well. We never grew tired of the food, and ate at the Italian, Japanese, and the Steakhouse, which was superb. Our room was spacious and nice, and after tipping the maid a couple of bucks each day, we had our refrigerator stocked daily. Now for the bad. I had heard that the hotel serves Dos XX beer on tap, and I was really looking forward to it. As soon as we arrived, we headed to the lobby bar and I ordered a beer. Much to my dismay, it was watered down by nearly 50% and ended up being a very weak imitation of full strength Dos XX. We headed to the beach the next day and we ordered a mai tai from the beach waitress. She arrived with the drinks a couple of minutes later and we found it to be almost undrinkable. It tasted like watered down juice with no alcohol. We then switched to margaritas on the rocks for the remainder of the trip, and I was amazed at how unresponsive virtually every bartender was to our request for tequila better than the standard Cuervo junk. Even when we would SPECIFICALLY ask for better tequila, they still grabbed for the cuervo, and it wasn\u2019t until we said a second or third time \u2013 \u201cNO \u2013 mas bueno tequila\u201d did they listen to us. And even then, the tequila was still mediocre quality at best unless you were in the lobby bar. The beach bar was almost exclusively bottom shelf alcohol. This went on hour after hour, day after day, despite generous tipping on our part and my wife, who has very generous \u201cassets\u201d being topless at the beach bar and wearing a skimpy bikini in the other bars. Even the bartenders in the adult swim up bar were not friendly. This was pretty shocking to us, as this was our first time to the Yucatan side of Mexico. In February, we stayed in Nuevo Vallarta at the Allegro Nuevo and received service from EVERYONE that puts this service at the Tucan to shame. And, the Allegro Nuevo had top shelf alcohol and would make the drinks as strong as you wanted. There was something very wrong about having to literally fight with the bartenders to make even a decent drink. And unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t just the bartenders and alcohol that was a problem. We found the waiters in the buffet restaurants to be very inattentive and they kept making mistakes with the drink orders (kept forgetting to bring orange juice, never refilled the water, etc.). On the way back to the airport in the Apple van, we picked up another couple who was staying at the Iberostar Paraiso. They had a similar experience with staff that was pretty inattentive and bottom shelf alcohol. If this is a common factor with the Iberostar chain, we certainly will not stay with them again.

There were only ever a few people in there at one time and it did not look as bad as what I had read about.

Check in was quick and smooth and all our questions were answered. We stayed in room 1210---which was almost exactly what we requested. A fruit basket was in our room upon arrival. We had requested a crib, which was not in the room...but after leaving for lunch, the crib was there. The room was just as described in past reviews. King size bed. We had the couch made into a bed for our 10-year old daughter. The shower was great and the A/C kept the room cold enough that at times we had had to adjust the temperature. My only complaint about the room is that the Fridge did not keep anything cold....it stayed about room temperature...no big deal as there is an ice machine on the 2nd floor of every block. The grounds to the hotel were immaculate. The \"jungle\" was amazing and we saw all of the animals daily. Monkeys, peacocks, birds, lizards, iguana's and the mexican rodents that are everywhere. The pool was refreshing, cool and larger than the pictures showed. The beach was well kept and easy to locate a chair. I tried not to play the \"towel game\" but by the 5th day of vacation I found that if I wanted a good area to sit in by the pool...I would have to join the others who were out by 6:30 am reserving a chair. The food was amazing as well. We were allowed to make 3 reservations and learned that if you check the reservation desk at 4pm each day you can sign up for any reservations that had not been taken. We ate at the Italian, Mexican, Tropical and Japanese restaurants. The Japanese being our least favorite...but it was still good. The buffets were excellent...many many different choices each day or night...but they do seem to get repetitive day after day. Having said that...I don't know of any buffet that wouldn't get repetitive day after day...even Vegas!!! The entertainment was \"good\". Some shows were better than others....but the \"star teams\" do an excellent job trying to entertain all.

We went to 5th Av one day and did some shopping. A very nice safe area. Lots of haggling, but worth the time. Our other excursion was a trip to Akumal bay for snorkeling. We hired a cab outside of the front gate of the Tucan. Once outside of the gate...you can negotiate the price you want to pay....it seemed that if you had the desk call a taxi...you are going to pay exactly what the chart in the lobby states. We went snorkeling in Akumal bay and had a great time. We saw 12-large sea turtles and many many fish. We ate lunch at Lo Ha restaurant right on the beach and it was a nice break from the buffet at the resort. After a full day on the beach we took a cab back to the resort. Highly recommended place to snorkel if you are interested in seeing the large sea turtles. You can rent snorkel equipment right on the beach.

The steak house was ok but the buffet restaurant was better! We found the whole complex to be immaculately clean from the rooms, right down to the poolside bars and restaurant. The beach is fantastic too! Crystal clear water and plenty of sunbeds to choose from. The hotel also puts on loads of activities during the day from beach parties, riffle shooting, salsa classes to water aerobics, volley ball but to name a few. If you don't fancy being active, the waitresses will glady keep coming over to your sunbed and take your drink orders! The shows in the evening can be a bit tacky but the entertainers are a good laugh and once you've had one too many of the fantastic cocktails, they're great fun to watch! We also did a few trips whilst we were in Mexico. We recommend the sea life plus trip (swimming with dolphins and sea lions!). Xel-Ha is definitely worth a visit too if you like snorkelling.

Did the ROYAL SWIM at DOLPHIN DISCOVERY at PUERTA ADVENTURAS and paid a bit extra to swim with the sea lions and manatees. Well worth every dollar. also recommend the COBA JUNGLE TOUR . IN THE HOTEL BAR DONT FORGET TO TRY THE MEXICAN FLAG SHOT...WOW....We stayed in the 18 block near to tucan reception and had to walk through the jungle walkway to get to the beach.What a joy each day to see peacocks, pheasants, iguanas, little rabbit type creatures and the famous monkeys in their natural habitat. Just a word of warning. Do not exceed your luggage allowance at CANCUN AIRPORT as they charge for every kilo over as we found to our expense. Cant wait to return to the TUCAN.

We chose this one after the good reviews it got from this site and boy did we choose well. There is a reason why this hotel scores well, the staff, the location, the atmosphere, the facilities, the food - they're all so good. We won't forget the wedding day in a hurry, Mariela and her team took care of everything - they even move swimmers out of line of sight during the wedding! The day was perfect and our photos turned out so well. The atmosphere is so relaxed and the staff are so happy - ask them and they'll even tell you they love working there. We've been to other more expensive hotels in Mexico but this one bettered them in many ways and proved to be surprising value for money. Make a point of going to some of the shows cause they're quite good and we always made a point of stopping for a drink around 9 / 9.30pm to catch the Star Friends animation film - so funny. There are plenty of critters around, monkeys, flamingo's, cute little cat like things & lizards and although they are wild, you just enjoy that they let you share their company for a few minutes. If you're looking for a wedding location, we'd recommend it. Unlike some hotels, there is only one wedding a day & there wasn't one every day, so it's your own special day. One piece of advice if you're getting married. We booked through the travel agent, but discovered that we are still responsible for the paperwork and legalities and checking everything is accurate. In fact, the travel agent did very little. However Mariela's services were invaluable and can be purchased direct. The mexican website gives tons of information about getting married there so between that and Mariella, you could save \u00a3400 or so by getting in touch directly - we now wish we had.", "Date": "October 29, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Illinois", "Title": "\u201cPretty good\u201d", "Author": "slepickatak", "ReviewID": "UR6025300", "Content": "Check-In: It was great for us because our room was ready, but others in our group waited as late as 4pm for their room. Rooms: Our room was great. Very clean. Others in our group mentioned bugs but we didn't not have any. We all agreed that the beds were way too firm. I woke up with an achey back in the mornings. Food: It was good the first couple of days, but I grew tired of it after that. It's the same thing over and over at the buffets. The restaurants were just mediochre. The steak place to me was the best. We ventured out to 5th Avenue and ate at La Parilla and that was EXCELLENT. Night: There wasn't much to do unless you wanted to just hang out at the lobby bar which was very hot with all the lights they had on. We tried going to bars at 5th Avenue but nothing was really busy. The discoteca at the hotel was very lame. I don't think I saw more than 50 people there at any time. Pool: The pool was good except that it is 5ft tall in all areas and I'm only 5ft tall so I had to be on a float the entire time. There is one area near the beach that has shallow water, but it's very salty from people coming back from the beach. It was very easy to get a chair by the pool though as long as you got there by 10:30am. Entertainment: The people during the day tried real hard to get you to be involved in activities, but they were the same things everyday and it grew boring. The nightly entertainment was just ok. Most of the shows were dragged out longer than they needed to be. Drinks: The drinks were very weak. The joke in our group was \"mas rum por favor!\" and the bartenders would happily oblige. Excursions: Too pricey. We had groups of 10+ doing snorkeling and hiking, but it still cost at the very minimum, $70 per person. I felt that was too much after paying for an all inclusive trip. Staff: The staff was pretty good. A+ to the housekeepers. Our room was always clean and tidy when we returned. They left little towel animals on our beds. A person in our group had a lost bag at the airport, but the hotel was not very cooperative in helping us track it down. Landscaping: the landscaping at the resort was very beautiful. It seemed natural yet kept up. We saw many animals like birds, pheasant, monkeys, and guinea pig-like creatures that roamed around. We had an iguana that lived underneath the sidewalk by our building (#11) that we named Fred. He would come out in the morning and sunbathe on the sidewalk and then return home in the evening.

We all had a great time. Let me start off by saying Catalina in Public Relations was awesome in getting my requests granted. I asked for rooms close to the beach and all together which they were. I asked for building 11 or 12 (they were working on 12) got 13 which was still good and think turned out better. Had a bit of jungle view and could see part of the pool, close enough to the beach and not as far to walk to the front for dinner. Catalina responded to my e-mails promptly and helped me organize my request for flowers and champagne in the room upon arrival along with a birthday cake after our meal at the Japanese Restaurant (which was great by the way) the cake was delicious too (chocolate mousse) !!! Checking in went smoothly, we received a drink while signing in and getting our wrist bands and towel cards. Our rooms were ready, which I wasn\u2019t sure would happen since we got there pretty early. Rooms where spacious, cool and very clean. They were average, nothing fancy, but who stays in them long anyway. Showers were big with good water pressure and soap and shampoo dispensers. Hairdryer was ok for me since I have short hair, but others complained it took too long to dry and the hose does get hot. Frig was stocked, has a sofa seat, chair and small table in the room. Closet has some shelves in it with hanging space. If you over pack like me you may want to take a few extra hangers (maybe with clips). Food was very good with a variety to choose from at the buffets. Servers, hostesses, were very friendly always had a smile on their face while working extremely hard. Specialty restaurants were good also; our favorite was the Japanese, followed by the Steak then Italian. The pool/jungle/grounds are beautiful!!!!! You can walk on the outer perimeters from the front to the beach or take a walk through the jungle and see all kinds of wild life. We saw the monkeys 3 different times. Once over by the Quetzel side near the water polo pool. Then again near the front on the Quetzel side and our last day saw them between our building 13 and 14. Keep your camera handy!!! The beach restaurant/bar is steps away from the most beautiful stretch of beach in the area. There is also another bar/ice cream stand right near the sand along with showers. There are many palapas for shade and you can also check out umbrellas at the towel hut. The bar tenders were all very friendly; most drinks were somewhat weak, unless your doing tequila shots, watch out!!!! We went to the bars to get our drinks, but did use beach service a couple of times when they walked by. Wed. there was a beach party which was fun. I ordered room service one night, they were quick getting it to the room. This service stops at 11:00. They did have some food out late in the evenings on the Quetzel side, that worked out good if you came in late and wanted something to snack on. We loved this hotel and would stay here again. This was our 3rd trip to the area and the first time to the Tucan and loved this place the best. The food/service/grounds/beach was a great value for the money I spent. I would highly recommend it. By the way we visited the Del Mar/Beach resort for the day ($22) cab ride each way and didn\u2019t like this resort nearly as well as the Tucan. The beach is much better here and property is not nearly as big. Seemed like it took forever to get to the beach. Don\u2019t hesitate to book the Tucan!!!! Tips: take a cheap raft; Insulated mugs are a must; maybe a few extra hangers. Ladies, I like to wear heels but not such a good idea if walking in the jungle or on the Quetzel side they have wood planks up around the Restaurants, wedges or sandals would be best.

This was our first trip together without any children, and we had a most enjoyable time! Although our tour company booked us at the Tucan side, we ended up staying at the Quetzel side, rooms 2322, 2324, and 2342. I am so glad that we ended up on the Quetzel side, as this is where I would request a room on this side for a future trip. (Especially if you want to see monkeys) We were greeted by the bellboys as soon as our transportation pulled into the driveway, and we were told to leave our bags, go check in, and once we were told our room numbers, to return to them. We asked the reception if the ocean front suites were available, and 2 were available, for $50.00 extra per night. We decided that for the extra $200.00, we really didn\u2019t need ocean front rooms\u2026.as we figured this could be money to use at the spa! After we received our wrist bands, we were handed a welcome drink, and told the bellboys our room #. (They told us to have a look around, and when we were ready to go to our rooms, they would be there waiting for us with all of our luggage) We headed straight to our building #23, on the Quetzel side, and decided to take the path through the jungle. Wow! What beautiful foliage, flowers, birds, fish, swans, ducks, rat/squirrel-like animals, and lizards. I felt like we were walking through an open-air zoo on the way to our rooms. (There is also a straight path, on the outer sides of the buildings, which I recommend for older guests, as the jungle paths are made from stones, and are winding up and down, and there are steps, and trees as obstacles) Once at our rooms, the bellboys were waiting for us, and in we went. The rooms were very clean, and perfect for doing what most normal people do in their rooms on vacation.. sleep, shower, and well\u2026. Our safe did not work, and it was fixed before we had our bathing suits on. Room 2324- the door key would not work, and someone was sent immediately. Although it took 4 people and 1 hour to fix the problem, we were impressed by how quickly we were taken care of. So our suits were on and we headed to the towel shack. Pools were gorgeous, lots of chairs available at 3pm, but off to the beach! B-E-A-U-T-I-F-U-L!! There were chairs available, as well as palapas\u2026however, we wanted to be directly in the sun, and in the turquoise water! Around 6 we headed off of the beach and to the pool. Pool was really nice, but warmer then I had expected. (Watch the bottom steps into the pool as they are a big drop!) We also headed to the pool with the pool bar, which was a lot more refreshing, but really gross\u2026people had been there all day..and one man even told us that he hadn\u2019t left his chair in 6 hours, but had been drinking the whole time. (After we heard that, we headed straight out\u2026oh, and people smoke in the pool bar..so it\u2019s really gross) I had emailed ahead to make a dinner reservation for our 2nd night, but wanted to see how many reservations we were allowed\u2026 only 1 for 4 nights, and our reservation was in the book..but we were able to get on a standby list, and ended up eating at the Japanese, Mexican, and Italian. Only had buffet 1 night- which was good as far as what to expect at a buffet. All of us have dined at many fine restaurants, and had no complaints at all about any of our dinners, except for the fact that we had tooooo much food. I don\u2019t eat onions, and at the Japanese rest. the waiter had a meal made just for me! He was great. Make sure to tip all of the employees as they really do whatever they can to make your stay wonderful! Our drinks were always full..as there was always someone asking if we\u2019d like another. My husband brought an insulated cup, and the bartenders had no problem filling it. My favorite drinks were the Dirty Monkey and the coco Loco. We did learn that the alcohol was watered down, by someone who works at the resort, but like she said\u2026who would be stupid enough to think that they could drink 20 drinks in one day, out in the sun, and not be completely drunk, unless the alcohol was watered down? Entertainment was good, and Spanish humor is a bit different then American humor, but we saw 2 shows, Mr. Iberostar, and Tutti- Frutti. My husband was a volunteer for the Tutti Fruitti Show, and he received an Iberostar T-shirt for playing along! We visited the night club, and it was really cold in there- very refreshing! But the music was just so-so. They played a lot of old American songs, and needed more modern club songs. Our friends visited the spa for a one hour massage, and a half hour massage. I believe it was only $50 for the \u00bd hour- and it was good! I prefer not to have a massage when I have sunburn- so I passed, and instead 4 of us used the Hobie Catamaran that is free to use for 1 hour a day. It was fun! Overall, we loved this resort, and I can\u2019t wait to plan our next trip. Advice- Bring pool floats, and mark your last name on them- Some of the guests thought that people were stealing their floats, and made a big deal about it. (We gave ours away to other guests before we left)Monkeys- Are on the Quetzel side in the morning and around 6:30 pm. Make sure that you bring small bills and lots of $1\u2019s for tips.

The Hotel is amazing; the army of staff work so hard for the guests and nothing is ever too much trouble. We even got a free complimentary drink on arrival. The smiles and friendly welcoming atmosphere lasted from the moment we arrived to the moment we departed. With comprehensive daily entertainment programmes there is always lots to do for adults and children alike if you want it. The evening entertainment is 1st class. It is varied, fun and professionally presented. The many bars and restaurants mean you can be fed and watered pretty much 24hrs a day. Mascara, a nightclub located on the edge of the resort is an excellent place to dance until the small hours. Of surprise to me was that the music does not seem to travel outside! Great accommodation, the rooms are very spacious and well equipped with cable television and a mini-bar. With the high quality landscaping around the hotel complex a good balcony view is almost guaranteed. The food and service in the restaurants is second to none. The international buffet restaurants and snack bar cater for almost every taste. The five themed restaurants (of which you are entitled to dine in a fixed number of evenings) give this hotel a unique atmosphere and provide dining variety throughout the stay. I would recommend you book these early, as they are popular. The Japanese restaurant is a top evening experience with fresh meat, fish, vegetables and rice cooked in front of you in a fun and impressive way. The waitresses around the many bars continually look after your needs both day and night. You will never go thirsty here. The bar staff will prepare any drink you can describe. We would highly recommend a black kamikaze in the Tucan lobby bar. For lazy days in the sun there are ample sun chairs both around the pools and on the beach. During the heat of the day the main pool is both large and welcoming. The beach is clean with golden sands. A gentle sandy slope takes you into the warm and clear turquoise Caribbean waters.

The dinners were pretty good. You are only supposed to eat at the specialty restaurants 2 or 3 times if you stay a full week, but we were able to eat a la carte every night- just go to the reservation desk the day of and see where the openings are. We really enjoyed the italian, japanese, and tropical restaurants. The bad part of the food was the breakfast/lunch buffets. The first day or two was fine, but you literally eat the same food for breakfast/lunch every day. There is no variety at all. Also, the buffets are open air so the entire time you eat there are birds flying around you trying to pick food off your plate.

From the minute I arrived at the resort my problems started. 30 days prior to my arrival, I requested to be on the Tucan side preferably as close to the pool/beach as possible. I could not stress enough that I wanted to be on the Tucan side. The woman who wrote me back assured me that my request would be taken care of since it was low season. Well, apparently no one told the front desk of my resquest because it also seemed like they did the complete opposite of what I requested. I asked to speak with a manager (kind in mind I arrived around 1 pm), and never saw one until 9:30pm that night. After arguing with the manager for about 20 minutes, amazingly he could meet my request. I don't wish to rave about all the places I've been, but I do know that in a 5 star resort there would NEVER be blood on the pillow, as there was in the other couple that we were travelling with's room. Minus the blood incident on the pillow, overall I'd say the rooms are pretty nice. The shower is very large, which is always nice. Tipping the maid everyday definitely helps with the fridge always being stocked. The Restaurants - If you come from New York, you know quality food, and this was far from it. Yes, I understand I am in another country, which is fine... but if three out of four people travelling got food poisioning... I think there is a problem with the food. I am a vegetarian, so I understand that there will not always be a large choice for me to eat, but after getting food poisioning we barely wanted to touch the food.. I read prior reviews about the Japanese restaurant being amazing, well I can assure you it is so far from amazing.... It is probably the worst restaurant in the hotel. The Italian was pretty good considering it was Mexico. The Steakhouse (vegetarian), everyone else I travelled with enjoyed it...however somehow I got food poisioning from the baked potato and corn (go figure). Lastly, the Mexican restaurant, by far the best restaurant there. We ate in the buffet a few nights, I believe it was three nights, and out of the three nights, only one of them offered a variety of things I believe it was International Night. The pool grill is where we ate most of our food, because its kind of hard to mess up french fries and nachos..At night, there is snacks from 11pm-4am... these are just leftovers from dinner, and sometimes they do not even have anything. one night we went there around 1 am and there was literally nothing there. The beach was very nice... I agree with the last review that there are so many people there that wear things they shouldnt, but hey if you feel comfortable -- whatever. In the disco, there is a bartender, Daniel, that is by far the best person working at this resort. Since this is the only place you can get a drink after 12, visit Daniel.... he is awesome.

The rooms were very clean and comfortable. The minibar was cold and restocked daily. There was a wide variety of food selections, both at the casual buffet areas, and in the restaurants. Food areas were very clean, and the waitstaff worked hard to please everyone (tipping was greatly appreciated). The pool was exquisite-very clean and just the perfect temperature. The beach had soft white sand and the water was warm, clear, and blue. Although we did not venture out on any hotel-sponsored trips, we did walk to the city of Playa del Carmen (about a two mile walk) to engage in some shopping. There was also a local market area, located about 10 minutes away on foot, that had many local crafts and a few souvenir shops. The weather was hot & humid-perfect for a tropical vacation!

I felt I had to write this time and counteract some of bad reviews about the tucan on this site. This hotel is amazing and unlike others I don't feel the need to point out that I have stayed in many 5* star hotels around the world...but I have. Anyway it doesn't matter how much you have travelled because when you get good service, you know. The best part of this hotel and what makes it so special are the staff. From the moment we arrived we were greeted with smiles and wonderful service. Before you need to ask, the staff have taken care of it. My husband wanted to visit the steak house but as I'm vegetarian I was happy to just go along and wait for him to have his meal and just grab a snack later. The staff wouldn't hear of it and insisted that I tell them what meal I wanted, went to the other kitchen to get the ingredients and then prepared crepes from scratch. The restaurants are great, everything is very clean and continously checked to make sure it doesn't run out. There is plenty of choice and obviously I was limited because I'm vegetarian. The food was definately nothing to complain about. The staff working at the restaurants, again are superb, they go out of their way to ensure you have everything. The drinks aren't very strong but the staff willingly put in extra if you ask. When you finish a drink the waitresses are there straight away to replace them. The bar supervisor -Alberto - was wonderul and we spent many evenings chatting to him, all the staff want to make conversation with you and make sure that you are enjoying your holiday. We spent most of our time at the beach and always managed to find longers under the parasols. The sea is beautiful and the beach is kept very clean. I thought the afternoon food was the nicest because there was always a good choice of salads and light snacks. I absolutely loved the hotel grounds because there was so much wildlife and nature. I thought it was cruel though that they clip the wings of the parrotts just so they can keep them in the reception area. Birds are meant to fly! I really think the staff deserved to be tipped when appropriate and was quite annoyed that some people took all inclusive to mean the incrediable service to. The are a couple of wonderful 3 piece bands that come around the bar and restaurants and play the most wonderful latin tunes. They are not part of the hotel staff, they obviously just come in to help create the atmosphere. More than once I saw people ask them to play requests and then not even give them $1!! They are too polite to say they expect to be paid for playing you a song but please do give them a couple of dollars, they are really good and grateful for any tips. I really cannot understand how anybody can complain about this hotel.

I do not feel this is a 5 star resort according to American standards, but considering the price we paid, it was a good value. The beach is very nice, we thoroughly enjoyed the palapas. Going offseason, we never had any problem getting one no matter what time of day we went down. We didn't spend any time at the pool, so I can't comment on it, except to say the adult pool bar was loud and rowdy -- we didn't go near it except when walking past. The rooms are nothing special -- we booked a junior suite for the ocean view -- it was clean and the view was lovely, but the room itself was far from a \"suite\" in my definition.... yes it had a sitting area, but the bathroom was tiny and the whole room, with the sitting area included was still small by my standards. The maid kept the refrigerator stocked with water and soft drinks. We had a towel animal every day which was nice. The food was average at best.... we ate in 4 of the ala cartes -- the Japanese which was below average, the Mexican which was average, and the Italian and the Steakhouse which were both very good... We ate at the buffet one night -- very disappointed. I am not that picky of an eater, and I found it hard to find something I would eat. The breakfasts were adequate -- definitely have an omelet made to order -- much fresher and better looking than the already prepared eggs. Most of the foods were lukewarm, not hot. The pineapple and melons were not that sweet or fresh. This was our first time at an all-inclusive, so maybe the food is the same at all of them, I don't know. We were definitely less than impressed with the food at the Tucan. All the staff were extremely friendly and nice - with the exception of the breakfast wait staff. It was hard to get any service, to get some coffee or refills, you had to wait a long while till they decided to visit your table. We always tipped our servers, but didn't tip that well at breakfast since it was not deserved. It was my husband's birthday while we were there and we ordered a cake for dessert at the Italian restaurant -- they did an outstanding job -- chocolate mousse with strawberry topping. It was delicious and they brought it over with candles and sang happy birthday. Also brought him a shot of something -- tequila he thinks - and made a big fuss of him drinking it. They were all extremely nice and friendly. The grounds are very nice - we really enjoyed walking around and seeing all the animals -- only saw 1 monkey on our last day, but saw tons of the little rodent-like creatures, I forget their name, and iguanas, birds, peacocks, flamingos, etc... Staying in the beachfront building is very quiet, and very convenient to the beach, pool and afternoon buffet, but a long walk to the lobby area or the ala carte restaurants. But it is a lovely walk due to the scenery and animals around you. It was our impression that this hotel is more popular with Europeans than with Americans. We hardly met anyone else from the US, but heard lots of other languages being spoken. Also, there are FAR too many people wearing bathing suits that shouldn't be worn by someone with their bodies..... men in Speedos and women in two-piece bathing suits. Also, saw a number of topless women on the beach. All in all, for the price I would recommend this hotel, but if you are a \"Spoiled American\" like I am, you need to consider how much cheaper this resort is than others in the area. For the price we paid, it was very nice, but if we were to return to Playa, which we won't since it is just too hot for us), I would probably prefer to go to one of the more expensive resorts.", "Date": "October 7, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "columbus, ohio", "Title": "\u201cLone Traveler To Iberostar\u201d", "Author": "michaelschadow", "ReviewID": "UR5897507", "Content": "Single Traveler, 45, I enjoyed this resort with its awesome beach and found the beach itself not that different from the cancun beaches. I found the resort comfortable for a single traveler as I found a few groups of 3-5 friends traveling together which made it easy to interact without feeling like you were interrrupting some romantic vacation. Some resorts are all couples, and even though this resort would fall into that category, there were others if you noticed them. The difference in tourists between this resort and others I have stayed at in Cancun would be that in Cancun there are mostly Americans, Canadians, and some Englanders. I found the time I was at this resort there were many from Holland--a 12 hour flight for them. I was able to speak with some as they spoke some English. The pool was indeed as warm as a warm bath and the ocean was warm but still cooler than the pool. The pool bar is separated from the main pool---and I think it would have been better had it been connected to the main pool. Mostly around 4 each day it seemed to be the busiest. The best aspect of this resort was the entertainment team who daily organized and rounded up tourists to compete in water polo,volleyball, water basketball, etc. They do a wonderful job of meeting the guests and by the time you leave you will indeed hate to say goodbye to them--so friendly and they seem to really enjoy their job. Be sure to tell them you appreciate them--they make a good resort a great one. The disco was nice but wasnt real active but the entertainment team goes there after the nightly shows to dance up until around 12:30pm--another chance to speak to them on a one to one basis---they all spoke english and with the exception of a couple knew it well. The specialty resaturants were good but you do need to make a reservation. My only complaint was that I met 3 guests from Belgium and wanted to join them in a reservation they made-thinnking adding a fourth plate at a 4-seat table would be no problem but the restaurant refused. My advice would be if you want more Americans and a more festive atmosphere to go to a Cancun Resort--but overall I enjoyed this resort and would return in a heart-beat. Its hard to find a resort as a single traveler but this one is comfortable which is a compliment to the staff for making everyone comfortable and welcome.

From the front desk to the servers, the bartenders and the Star Friends, they all make you feel special and help to make your vacation a memorable experience. Everyone at the resort works very hard to keep the grounds beautiful and they always have a smile and \"Hola\" when you pass them.

The jungle area between the Tucan and the Quetzel make this resort standout as a favorite, especially with the animals and the beautiful plants and flowers. The Star Friends work hard all day long, getting the guests involved in various activities, then they put on a show every evening. After the show, they get the guests dancing in the theatre and then over at the disco. They have so much energy and really spend the time to make the guests feel special.

I usually take a cruise this time of year and thought we would just relax on the beach. I would rate this hotel as average. I travel quite extensively for my job and stay at a lot of hotels so trust me. Food-I have to say the food selection was fair to poor for lunch and dinner. Breakfast was pretty decent at the buffet. We ate a lot of hamburgers and fries and I usually don't eat that. I love salads and thought the salad bar was very poor. I ate at the Japanase restaurant and I love Sushi but I wouldn't even touch it there. They can't mess up the fried rice and veggies though. I didn't get a chance to try the other restaurants. We usually ate at the buffet for lunch and dinner. Beach-I rate the beach as excellent. This was one of the best beaches I have ever stayed at.

The shower was nice, but overall I would rate the rooms as avg. Entertainment -Okay, I do cruises every year so to compare to cruise entertainment this was fair/below avg. I have to say, I don't want to see another Michael Jackson impersonation again. Night Club-It was okay, I understand I am in another country but the latin music got old after a while. They did play some American musics but it was 50/50. They also had activities at the pool during the day. I attended a dance class once. We mostly did excursions.

I don't think you could really have a bad time in Mexico, but we will not be returning to the Iberstar Tucan. Our room was decent- there was a fruit basket with tons of fruit flys all around, and a patio full of tiny ants that climbed up your ankles and bit at your feet. The mini bar was stocked but everythign was warm. Our idea of \"all inclusive\" was to be able to eat and drink where ever and when ever you wanted, because that was how it was for us at Dreams Resort/Spa in Cancun- Excellent Excellent Resort by the Way (that is where we will be returning next year) but at Iberostar- you had to make reservations for the restruants- that were already booked two weeks out before we even arrived. Therefore, we spent all of our meals at the buffet which had no variety at all! The food was a huge disapointment! The drinks were okay- the beer was usually warm. The pools had a nice lay out but were way too warm. The adult pool with the swim up bar was dirty, poor service from the bartenders, over crowded and not enjoyable at all. The beaches were way to crowded- we got up one morning around 7 a.m. to try and find a chair and didn't have much luck. We had to rent an umbrella that didn't work from the hotel and could only check out one towel per person with the hotel as well. The ocean was nice- Can't complain there. Night life was decent at the hotel- I've seen better. My husband treated ourselves to a day at the spa and were barely satisfied with the service for the price we paid. The spa set up was nice but I thought there services were way overpriced. The staff was just okay- definitely not as friendly and helpful as the people at Dreams in Canucn. Also, I don't think we had figured out the resort within the 6 days we were there. The hotel is too big and very hard to get around.

My husband & I just returned from a week\u2019s stay on 9/9 and had a great time, especially considering the price we paid. We would have paid much more to go to the Jersey or Carolina beaches. We are in agreement with the other flattering reviews, so I\u2019ll just hit on a few things. Arrival/Check-in: Our USA3000 flight arrived early and the check in and flight crew were efficient and courteous. The trip from the Cancun airport to the resort took way too long\u2014over 90 minutes! I wish we had arranged private transportation, but we heard some people on our bus complain that they had arranged for this with Apple, but when they arrived at the airport, the reps knew nothing about it and they were put on the same big bus as the rest of us. We arrived at the hotel before noon and were told our room would be ready at around 1:30. In the meanwhile, we had some lunch, and when we returned to the desk, we were taken to a room on the Quetzal side. I had emailed ahead of time requesting a king bed in a room near the beach, but apparently this was overlooked. We were given a room in building 24, about halfway, with two double beds! This did not make us happy, so the bellman took us back to the desk. We politely requested a room with a king bed, and after a few minutes we were given a room on the Tucan side in building 15 with a king bed. Rooms: Though our room did not have a beach or jungle view, it was very adequate and convenient to the Tulum buffet. Being halfway between the lobby and beach had its advantages. We really didn\u2019t mind the walk and made very few trips back and forth to the room, since we spent the whole day at the beach. Room was immaculate with clean sheets and plenty of towels every day. The mini bar was stocked daily with lots of bottled water, soft drinks and beer. It was plenty cold, but there was an ice bucket and ice was just outside our door. The room itself was always cool, almost too cool for me at times. Rooms also had a coffee pot and unlimited internet was available for $25 per week. Beds are hard, but not uncomfortable to us. Pillows could have been a little fluffier, but I\u2019ve stayed in luxury hotels where I didn\u2019t care for the pillows, either. We left around $3 a day for the maid. She deserved it. Food: We mostly ate the buffet restaurants. The main breakfast buffet is fantastic, with any breakfast food you can imagine. Fresh fruit and vegetable juice is made on the spot, and pastries are unbelievable. Good coffee, too. Limited breakfast is served in the pool restaurant later in the morning. We mostly ate lunch at the pool/beach restaurant. It does get a little repetitious, but you can always find something to eat. There is always pizza, burgers, hot dogs, pasta, chicken, salads, French fries. One of the servers, Jesus, took very good care of us at lunch and seemed to enjoy practicing his English. All of the servers were friendly and helpful. On Wednesday there is paella on the beach, which is very good. For dinner we usually ate at the buffet so we weren\u2019t tied to a schedule. Mexican food is served every night and is fantastic. In addition there is an assortment of many other dishes with two featured carved meats (turkey, pork, beef, veal, fish). Lots of salads, vegetables, desserts, breads to choose from. On Friday night they had lobster tail\u2014as much as you wanted to eat. Thought this is not haute cuisine, it is very good and plentiful. I ordered room service one night after too many drinks at the beach and was pleased with the service. We ate at the Tropical and Italian restaurants\u2014very good. Drinks: The daquiris & pina coladas are made without alcohol, so make sure you request rum if you want it. The menu lists these drinks \u201csin alcohol\". The other drinks had plenty of alcohol. Bartenders were efficient, especially at the pool bar. They cranked out the drinks quickly, asking for the next order before even finished with the current order. They can\u2019t win! If they goofed around with the guests, people would complain about long waits! Beach/Pool: The beach is totally fantastic! The water is clear, turquoise blue and calm. If you like to walk on the beach, you will be happy. In one direction you can head toward the other resorts and you will see that the Tucan enjoys one of the nicest beaches at Playacar. In the other direction, you will pass the Sandos Gala and then will be on an undeveloped beach area owned by Sandos, which is very beautiful. Beach vendors will not bother you like at other resorts. There are plenty of palapas and umbrellas for shade and just a short walk to the beach bar, showers and restaurant. A waitress came to our palapa regularly to take drink orders, so we didn\u2019t even have to walk the short distance to the bar! A small tip now & then helped. If you got to the beach by 10 you could get a palapa with little difficulty. There was turnover thoughout the day. You will find many topless sunbathers on the beach, as there are many Europeans at the resort. The pool is gorgeous & clean, but a little warm due to the dark colored tile surface probably a plus during winter months). We loved the beach so much that we spent very little time at t he pool. The adults only pool bar was very pretty and was always crystal clear and clean and much cooler than the main pool. It was pretty low key when we were there. There were always plenty of beach towels, and if you wanted extras you could have them for $10 each, which may have been a worthwhile investment. Weather: Could not have been better. Everyday started out sunny and humidity was lower than expected. Three days it clouded up late in the afternoon and one afternoon it rained for a very short while. There was a little rain at night while we slept. There was almost always a nice breeze at the beach. The open air restaurants were pretty comfortable with the breeze and ceiling fans. At least you don't have to deal with cigarette smoke. Grounds: The landscaping is perfectly manicured and beautiful. The jungle area is a real attraction, especially if you stay on the Quetzal side of the resort. We saw the monkeys a few times and lots of other birds & animals. There is a walking/running path around the perimeter of the hotel. Since Playacar is a gated community you would feel safe to walk outside the hotel grounds. I can not for the life of me understand the reviewer who called this place a dump! The surroundings are beautiful. I have stayed at some luxury hotels and though they might be more posh, you would pay $300-$400 a night for just the room. People shouldn\u2019t come here and expect the Ritz, though it is very nice. The rooms at the Tucan are fairly basic, but they are clean and the property is well cared for\u2014hardly a dump! This place is a tremendous value and we had a lot of fun here, more fun than we\u2019ve had at some places that cost much more.

We had worked the web and phones very hard for several weeks prior, in order to find the best possible price/value for a family friendly beach vacation on the Mayan Riviera, and ultimately wound up being booked at the Iberostar Tucan via a website called Go Iberostar Vacations (---) Speak to Kellie Davis, she was very friendly and helpful, and got us the best deal we could find. Ultimately, we were pleased with our selection, and we found the Tucan to be a terrific price/value, although as with most all-inclusives, there is always room for improvement. FYI, the swimming pool water got so hot on most afternoons that you felt as if you were swimming in ... you know what. With the large volume of little kids in the pool most days, including our own five year old, we probably weren't far off course. Most important for us, the kids enjoyed themselves thoroughly, even though we didn't venture off of the property very often. We took one independent snorkling excursion by taxi to Akumal (a medicre (and pricey) snorkling experience, at best); and two separate evening trips to Playa del Carmen, by taxi, where we enjoyed a lovely Mexican dinner and did all of our souvenir shopping (whatever price they quote, offer half ... and start bargaining from there.) As for the resort itself, we were pleased with most everything that was included in our all-inclusive package. No reason to book a Junior Suite. The price is substantially higher, and the only real difference between a Jr. Suite and a ROH (run of house) room is the proximity to the beach. Believe me, it's not worth the price difference. We actually learned about this strategy by reading a few postings on this Trip Advisor website. One possible exception was the food at dinner, which was always plentiful and varied ... but we grew tired of the dinner buffet by the end of our first week. Not worth really complaining about, as we are a little spoiled by the plethora of New York-style food choices. The kids never complained about the food, as they could always get a burger and fries, or pizza which was also available at lunch every day at both the beach grill and poolside restaurants. And ice cream was always available at the bars and buffet restaurants, all day, every day. The a la carte restaurants were really not much better, cuisine-wise. But they make for a somewhat diverse dining experience, which was important, and the food was okay, not great. Make your reservations early in your stay, because they fill up quickly. My first choice of the a la cartes was called the Tropicale, where I had fresh grouper. Second choice was probably the steakhouse (especially the Bloomin' Onion knockoff and a decent appetizer bar.) The Japanese/Benihana-style restaurant is worth going to for the \"dining experience,\" because you share a table of 12, and get to meet some new people, but most of the food was frozen, and not teribly fresh or tasty. Our attitude was ... what do you expect for a couple of hundred bucks a day, all-inclusive, for four people (3 serious eaters) -- Nobu??? We relaxed, we ate, we drank, we swam, we slept, we had fun. The A/C in our room worked great all the time, and there were enough English TV channels available to keep up with world events, and follow the hurricane reports (never came near Playa del Carmen.) Speaking of drinking ... amazingly, I never saw one inebriated person the entire ten days at the Tucan (not that there's anything wrong with that.) It wasn't due to huge Mexican bouncers standing by at every bar to check ID's and cut off any intoxicated guests. The real reason? The bartenders make the drinks so weak ... that you would probably have to inhale 10-15 cocktails inside of a couple of hours, to get a serious buzz. If you drink like a fish, my recommendation is to either drink cerveza (aka beer) ... or tip liberally. The latter option was our preference, though none of us were big drinkers on this trip. The bartenders (and wait staff) work their tails off, and they all responded favorably to a dollar bill, or two when you ordered a drink. Even though I was medically restricted from drinking too much alcohol on this trip, one day when I finally decided to have a margarita, I gave the guys at the beach bar a couple of bucks and they immediately made me what they proudly announced as a \"Margarita Especiale\" ... \"con\" Cuervo Gold. Big difference. They even made a real show of pouring the Cuervo Gold into the blender. My theory ... is that the majority of the bar liquor is (seriously) watered down, for two reasons. One, to keep inebriation to a bare minimum (definitely a good idea.) And, two ... a little issue called \"profit margin.\" Again, the best way to circumvent this deliberate prohibition is also the American solution to most vacation woes, aka the aforementioned GRATUITY. Gratuities are also very well received and appreciated by the chambermaids and the wait staff. We usually left a few bucks at breakfast, so that we didn't have to get up to get our own coffee, and always left a dollar, per person at dinner, to keep the ice water and Coca-Cola Lights flowing. Or wine and cerveza, if you preferred. The Mexican people who work at these resorts are hard working and genuine. If you had an inkling of their lifestyle, compared to our own, you would consider tipping generously. We found that by treating all of the servers courteously and with respect, and by leaving a few bucks, here and there, that they returned the appreciation positively, and with a smile, even if your command of the Spanish language is as weak as ours was. Don't be afraid to try out your few words of Spanish on anyone who works there. The response to our five year old's assimilation of three simple words: gracias, agua and helado (Spanish for Ice Cream) ... was remarkable. A few more highlights: Don't miss the tortoises, who have their own private jungle pit near the sports pool. According to management, they mate at least three times per day (we could all learn a lot about foreplay from these two.) The monkeys tend to congregate nearest the entance to the buffet restaurant on the Quetzal side. And the local \"jungle rodents\" are plentiful and actually cute, sort of a cross between a prairie dog and a rabbit (although their resemblence to a NYC rat on steroids was unmistakable.) The iguanas are also huge and amazing looking, and reminded us a little of Jurassic Park. All in all, a good time was had by all. We would consider going back, but next time we might consider either one of the Iberostar 6-Star properties (Maya or Lindo), or perhaps even one of the Riu Resorts, which we were told are very impressive, if the price is right.", "Date": "September 12, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "BEVERLY", "Title": "\u201cdefinetly not a 5 star\u201d", "Author": "ELEONORASILLVIA", "ReviewID": "UR5784106", "Content": "We had payed for 4 nights at this hotel all inclusive.If I had not arrived too late I would not even have stayed the one night.We got up very early the next morning and checked out,what a dump.The room was full of fruit flies that got all over my suitcase.The pool is so crowded and hot...You cannot even see the beach from the pool.The pool bar a total joke,separate from the main pool full of people who were drunk and cigarettes floating in the pool..trashie looking crowd.No pool towels,they ran out...Long line to get a lousy drink.Snack bar food was disgusting,with flies all around.Needless to say it was that bad and lost 4 paid nights that I will not get back.If you are used to great service and beautiful hotels this place is not for you,you will hate it.

One towel per person at a time, no 24 hour room service, mini fridge was more like a mini oven. No bottled water. The buffets served the same thing over and over and the Japanese restaurant was average at best.

The resort is huge and confusing to navigate, signage is poor and it takes 3 days to figure the place out and we didn't see one monkey.

Don't get me wrong, the place is still nice and if you haven't enjoyed the service of another resort you would probably be very happy with Tucan, but we won't be going back and would never recommend it to friends.

An overview of our stay: Ride to hotel: We obtained transfers from our travel agent. We don\u2019t recommend using a transfer. It took us nearly two hours to get to the hotel. We were the last ones to be dropped off. Then the travel agency that gave us the ride would not give us our return transfer until we met with them later. I assume they wanted to sell us packages. We opted for a cab back to the airport. About $50 USD. Check in: Very smooth. Our room was ready when we arrived around 2:30 pm. I had emailed hotel a day or two before we left with room preferences and received just what I requested. Even received a \u201cwelcome cocktail\u2019 to sip while checking in. Our room: Very nice as you can read in previous reviews and photos. The property: As everyone else has stated, just beautiful! Well maintained, landscaped, and clean. The Tucan has less jungle than the Quetzal. Fine with me. The monkeys kind of creeped me out! Dining: I thought the buffets were very good. Something for everyone. Very good breakfast in the main buffet and good dinner in the main buffet. We only ate at one ala carte restaurant, the steak house and it was very good. Lunch at the pool buffet was just okay. Previous reviews have been somewhat negative about the dining. Maybe someone had a bad experience I don\u2019t know, but take it from me I get sick going to some fast food places; I did not feel ill one time on the trip. I even gained about 3lbs! Cocktails: Yes, they are not the strongest, just ask for a double. The bar tenders are happy to do so. Remember, the resort is serving basically free drinks all day; they may know what they\u2019re doing. Could you imagine 500 drunken guests? Beach: I truly have never seen such a beautiful site! The water is crystal clear. The beach is clean. I don\u2019t believe I\u2019ll ever go back to FL. I thought the Gulf/Destin was beautiful until I experienced the Caribbean. We never had a problem getting a chair. We were on the beach everyday after breakfast until dinner. Pool: Only used the main pool once. Nice, but very warm. We used the swim up bar several times. Nice, but shaded. I like the sun. PlayaCar/Playa Del Carmen: As the last review stated, Playacar is a gated community making you feel very safe. As is the resort. I don\u2019t believe that has been mentioned before. Playa Del Carmen is a must visit. About a $5 USD cab ride. Visit Playa for the real Mexican experience. The shopping is okay. It seems all the little shops had pretty much the same product. Went to Senor\u2019 Frogs. Very nice staff and good beer selection. Sorry no Bud Light! When you go into Playa plan on having dinner at AJUA Maya on 5 Ave. Great entertaining staff and wonderful food. I had one of the USDA streaks and my friend had the lobster tail. Incredible! Don\u2019t miss this cute restaurant. The Staff: I can\u2019t even begin to say enough about the wonderful crew at the Tucan! They are amazing! EVERYONE is so happy to be there. They treat everyone so wonderfully. Even those who did not tip were treated very well. We tipped everyone very good, and were treated like Kings! The bar tenders remembered us and had our drinks just the way we liked them waiting for us. The wait staff was courteous, happy and eager to please all the guest. The cleaning staff were always very pleasant and also happy to help any way they could. Our room was cleaned every day, mini bar restocked everyday lots of bottled water! A must at beach and when return from beach. We also had a cute towel animal everyday! Please tip all these wonderful, hard working people! Only two negatives: The beds are not comfortable at all! Very hard. Dress code at the Steak House: The hotel needs to be very clear as to what the dress code is and strictly enforce it. The dress code states something like casual elegant attire or nice Bermudas (should say nice cuffed walking shorts). I was not sure what they meant by Bermudas so I played it safe wearing linen slacks. When we arrived and ate, there were people (mostly men) in jeans, torn jeans, not nice shorts, and one in a T-shirt! Note to management: Please enforce the dress code. Those who follow it, as we did, feel stupid sitting there in \u201ccasual elegant attire\u201d when everyone else is in vacation rags. Not to end on a bad note. Everything with only a small exception noted above, was top notch! I will return again and again.

What can i say? Firstly the only negative thing i can think about our trip was the long haul through Cancun Airport!!! This queue that queue arggghh!!!! Then we were through and on our coach after a long 10 hour flight from London Gatwick - but the journey was worth it!!! What a beautiful large lobby entrance to greet us, marble floors and a cool classy spacesh air. Check in very quick. and i was pleased to find that my email to the hotel paid off with my request of a room close to the ocean granted!!! We were in room 1105 - perfect!!!! I cannot fault the beautiul cool room whihc was spotless and comfortable. The food in all the restuarants was excellent. Our favourite was the Italian followed by the Steak. But the buffet never let us down and we were greeted with lobster there on our first night! Watch the birds in a morning/ Dont leave your breakfast unless you have finished or the birds will help themselfs!!! But it is open plan and this can't be helped. The pool was beautiful - if a bit hot!!! The weather was in the high 90's so again this can't be helped!!! We spent alot of time on the amazing beach which had a slight breeze.!! We warned, dont leave your towel on a sunbed around the pool to reserve a sunbed - leave a book, t-shirt etc instead. We had one stolen on the first morning while at our welcome meeting!!! Make sure you get a $5 taxi into Playa Del Carmen some evenings!! It is very lively with lots of bars and shops. Go to Carlos and Charlies and a bit of fun!! But dont sit to close the the DJ if you aren't going to join in the games!!!! Anyone who likes Diesel clothes will have to go to the shop on Fifth Ave. I got some great jeans for \u00a340!!! Its so cheap!!! There is also a shop selling Clinique makeup about a third cheaper than backhome!!!! We only did one trip - Xel-Ha which i recommend. But take mossie spray!!! And do the all inclusive package its worth it!!! The fish are huge!!! And i mean huge. Best snorkling is near the floating bridge!!!! Back the the hotel - People on other reviews have moaned about he booze been watered down, it is fairly weak from the beach bar but who wants to be drunk at 9.00 in a morning? The lobby bars serve strong cocktails etc with plenty of top shelf brands - Jim Bream, Barcardi, Pernod etc!!! Thje staff are fantastic - always cleaning and making sure the classes are taken away from the pool and beach areas. You can get served from your unbed, but he beach is big so this wont be more tha 2 or 3 times a day, but the bars and only a few strides away!!!! We also where lucky enough to see a huge group of monkeys with a baby in the trees and on some balconies behind the water polo pool!!! We will most certainly be returning to this hotel as it has everything we what for a brilliant holiday. Whoever is going wont be dissappointed.

After reading many reviews, we went with an open mind. We were pleasantly surprised, and in fact cant wait to book a return trip. Here is a breakdown: Check in: This was a quick and easy process. We were greeted and given a welcome cocktail. At check-in, you also receive your room keys, towel keys and general information packet. A bellhop brought our bags to the room. Room: Extremely clean, central air conditioning in room with ceiling fan. At times so cold we had to turn it down. Fridge was provided and filled with beer, soda and bottled water. The fridge temp could have been cooler, but there are ice machines on every floor. We had a lovely balcony which had clothesline to hang wet suits. Bed was firm, but we slept well every night - we were so exhausted. Bathroom: very clean, plenty of towels, soap, shampoo, lotion. Shower had nice pressure and always had hot water. Hair dryer could have been better, but it worked out well. If you are particular with the hair dryer that you use, I would recommend bringing your own. Cleaning service: Room/bathroom fully cleaned each day, and they do it quickly and early if you prefer - just use the door hang tags. We tipped the maid $3/day, and our fridge was filled every day, rather than every second day. We also found our room with a towel art display on the bed each day. We had 1 problem with our toilet, and asked for a plunger, and had one within 5 minutes. Food: We dined at the Japanese restaurant and it was excellent. We went on a waiting list for the steak house, but were only given our second choice and returned to the Japanese restraunt. The buffet that is available each day has something for everyone. They mix it up a bit, but still offer the basic standards of pizza, nachos, etc. For breakfast you can have an omelet any way you prefer, or your choice of eggs. They have a very large variety of cereals, yogurts, fruits, breads, muffins, etc. If you are a late sleeper, there is a continental breakfast available until noon. For lunch, you can dine at the buffet, or there are three options by the beach and pool. By the pool areas there are areas where you can have a variety of items. One is open until 3 and the other until 5. By the beach there is a smaller beach grilll area that serves fresh grilled items - hamburgers, hot dogs, potato wedges, etc. You can have ice cream any time of day, and many flavors to select from. Also, every meal you can have some type of dessert - there is a huge variety - too many to list. Drinks: you can knock yourself out with trying all the drinks. If you want it stronger, just ask.. We tried the Mojito - refreshing on a hot day. They also have a nice selection of coffees. Pool/beach: the pool and beach are both beautiful. The pool was warmer and the hot tub cooler. We had no problem getting a lounge chair and could have fresh towels throughout the day. The beach was very beautful, water clean. At the towel hut, they have umbrellas available. A waitress is running around and if you call out to her she will bring you a drink. I would suggest bringing a float for the pool/ocean. This will make your time in the water so much better and relaxing. They sell them there but are very expensive. Off the beach are nice, clean outdoor showers with cool, refreshing water. You can also have ice cream on the beach or pool which is a nice treat. Palapos are very popular, taken first, but we manageed to get one during the course of each day. The beach was the highlight of trip. Tipping: Though no tipping required, this is a nice gesture. The staff is very accomodating to begin with, but even a dollar here and there goes a long way, and they will show their appreciation. Spa/Gym/Water activities: We used the kayaks, spouse played tennis with pro, I used the gym. Spa has nice hot and cold tubs for relaxation. Many extra services, but you have to pay for them. Entertainment: Good shows, and Stars staff does nice job getting everyone involved. Spouse played darts, pingpong, bocce, and all were very fun. Tours: We did not do any tours as we were only there for 4 nights. Shopping: there is a small selection of stores withing 10 minutes of hotel that you can walk to. We also took $5 taxi ride to 5th avenue stores. We did not like this as store owners badgering us to purchase items and come into stores. Clientel: Very nice, and one woman who was a frequenter gave us very good info on facilities, and nearby attractions. Everyone was very nice and helped each other. Guests from all over the globe and everyone seemed to have a nice time. Grounds: Well maintained, jungle like with walkway. We spotted 3 monkeys, but there are also birds, newts, cute burro-type animals, and iguanas.

What can i say, it far surpassed our expectations. The hotel was beautiful. the grounds and the beach area were maintained to a high standard. The food was second to none and because of the very high standard of cleanliness and food hygeine none of us had tummy problems. The children thought it was wonderful to order non alcholic cocktails all day and they loved the ice-creams from the beach ice-cream parlour. Our room was tastefully decorated with aircon and fan the only grumble is that we have two children of 12,10 who had to share a double bed as there were two double beds in our room. It would have been much nicer if there were ajoining rooms or two bedroom suites. they fought the first night so we got the hotel to make up the sofa as a bed which they were happy to do thus stopping some of the bickering. We couldn't get over the staff they all smile and say Hola even the men who constantly clean and maintain the resort. We avoided the evening show on the first few nights as we didn't think it was our thing but after watching one show we were hooked. the entertainment staff are very tallented and amusing. they finished work every night at midnight only to be back on the beach chatting and organising beach games.by 9,30 the next morning, on the beach you can use the catamarans and the kayaks free of charge, although you do have to take a lesson which they charge you 39$ for but well worth at you can take them out when ever for an hour at a time. My husband and my son both went diving which they said was fantastic. My husband who is a qualified diver went on a seperate deep dive and saw turtles and manta rays. We recomend Xal-Ha for a day out although a little pricey well worth it. It is a natural inlet where the sea water meets the fresh water in this beautiful lagoon. they supply you with snorkling equipment or you can float down the rver on inflatabe rings (we did both) the fish are amazing Groupers,tuna and parrot fish 3ft long. We swam with dolphins at Dolphineus which was breath taking and the best place in mexico to do this as they only put you in groups of six. we wre lucky and only had the four of us in our group with up to 3 dolphins during the 50 minute experience. we bought the dvd and the photos they take of you this cost us \u00a3100 but again very high quality.

The only thing which got my 4 year old to leave was that our cat was waiting at home - even Grandma, Grandpa, her friends and her toys weren't enough!!! We were a party of eight - two separate families (one parent and three children, one parent and two children, and an extra teenager thrown in). This is long but I hope worth it: PROPERTY: Playacar is kind of a cross between a gated community in South Florida (with lots of palm trees, neat streets, a large golf course, and small condo/attached houses complexes) and the strip in Vegas (lots of big hotels one after the other - just no neon). The Tucan/Quetzal is located next to the RIU and Gala on a beautiful stretch of beach. Cozumel can be seen in the distance, especially at night when the lights make it easier to see. The hotel itself was beautiful - immaculate grounds with someone constantly cleaning, sweeping, or painting something. At the kids shows in the evening one of the maids seemed to appear out of nowhere every 10 minutes to sweep up spilt popcorn (I wish I had her to clean up after them at home!!!). The jungle area in the middle is very dense; I've read reports that it was thicker before the hurricane last fall but if so it must have been almost impenetrable, because on the winding jungle paths it's easy to lose sight of the surrounding hotel buildings. There are animals everywhere - the birds seem to treat the open-air lobby as their turf; we saw peacocks and cranes strolling through as if they were on vacation. We saw a monkey one morning while eating breakfast but they might hang out more on the Quetzal side (a deep ridge creates more jungle area on that side of the property). There are no elevators but the rooms at the lobby end almost open into the lobby and the outer paths are smooth and level rather than the uneven, winding jungle paths; we did see people in wheelchairs who did not appear to have mobility problems in the public areas of the hotel. ROOMS: We had two rooms next to each other but not connecting - I e-mailed the hotel prior and they gave me everything I asked for (second floor, interior facing, close to the beach). The room could fit five in a pinch but felt cramped when we actually had to sleep that way one night. Of course, we weren't in the room very much so it really wasn't that big a deal. The minibar is included, which meant I wasn't constantly reminding the kids to stay out of it (that of course meant they left it completely alone!). There was lots of water provided - both in 20 oz. bottles and a gallon jug. The floors are a polished stone which makes wipe-outs very easy - watch out after showering and with small children who are learning to walk or think running in circles is a great time. The beds are hard but after being out in the sun all day we all fell asleep the minute our heads hit the pillows. The 11 year old insisted the couch/day bed was more comfortable. There are no bathtubs but a nice large walk-in shower; the showerhead is removable and can be easily used to hose down the little ones. The AC and fan can keep it nice and cool but when you open the patio/balcony door the AC turns off so make sure you close it ALL the way. Be careful with the keys - the internal memory in my digital camera kept wiping out the magnetic access and I had to keep going up to the front desk to get new ones until I kept my room keys and camera apart. Also, I think the outlets also have some sort of engery-saving feature because my camera batteries took much longer to charge than at home; that's easily solved by just making sure you re-charge them at night. AMENITIES: The main pool is very large - the shallow end by the beach is very active and the deeper end by the kiddie pool is quieter. The deep end is about 5 and a half feet and the steps leading into it do not go all the way to the bottom but drop off suddenly. If you have small children there is a smaller shallow area on that end of the pool but my four year old liked the larger area better because it did not slope down as sharply. The adult pool/swim-up bar is small and can get noisy at about 5 PM but was never that crowded. There are little \"tables and benches\" away from the main bar if you don't want to sit on a barstool. The activity pool seemed the quietest, except during the times that the Star Friends arranged water polo. There is a jacuzzi but it's located right in the middle of the main pool (my kids called it \"Hot Tub Island\"). It's not very big or very hot and is usually full of kids. Floats are allowed which is very nice but bring your own - they are very expensive in the hotel shop. I thought I had perfected the art of beach/pool chair hunting (as a naturally early riser I was always out there by 7 AM) but I must say I was bested in my quest for a beach bed palapa (which are larger and have their own steps leading down into the pool); they looked very cool but even getting up at 6:00 I was never able to score one. Be warned if you are a late riser - chairs in prime places (like near the restaurants, bathrooms, and immediately next to the pool) go very early. There was some turn-over of chairs but not much that I could see. There was a \"beach party\" with paealla and really nice sangria one day but other than that there didn't seem to be any organized activities taking place on the beach. The palapas and umbrellas handed out by the towel guy were a necessity this time of year. The water in both the pool and the beach could get very warm - almost too warm in the pool - but that's to be expected. You did feel cooler after you got out. I didn't try the spa services or the tennis courts, and there is also an air rifle range on the property which I hadn't seen mentioned anywhere. ACTIVITIES: There always seemed to be something going on during the day - water aerobics, the free scuba lessons (kids 8 and up with an adult - although the teenager in our group did it with my 8 year old with me watching from the side), stretching and yoga in the clubhouse behind the Marimba restaurant, spanish \"lessons\" in the Uximal restaurant, etc. - all the usually activities you generally expect in an all-inclusive. One day the vendors came and set up a couple of tables poolside; that set the teenage girl in our group's heart a flutter - to shop poolside! There is a henna \"tattoo\" guy and a table where you can paint your own ceramics in the pool area, but they are extra and expensive. The other adult in our group took one of the kids out in a kayak and (none of us being particularly athletic) said it was really nice. Two of the kids (9 and 11) did the tandem parasailing over at the RIU - not too expensive and they rode a jet-ski out to the boat so they got two things in one! The 6 and 8 year old did the banana boat ride through the hotel; average price but the ride seemed to last a good while and they enjoyed it. KID'S CLUB ACTIVITIES: There were kids all over the place and the kids club seemed to attract a fair amount of involvement. My kids spent a lot of time there; I didn't see them doing many activities other than swimming in the pool - but if you asked them they'd say they had a great time there. They will take the kids to lunch and then do a movie from 2 to 3 PM every day, so it's nice for them to have a break from the sun and allows for a kid-free meal at least once a day. They did some art activities in the morning, played darts one day, pool games with prizes, and did a nature walk through the jungle where they saw lots of monkeys. I didn't like that they sometimes seemed a bit loose regarding the kids walking in and out of the program - even my four year old did it one day (which I was unhappy about). But I made sure to tell the staff after that to please not release them without someone coming to get them and it didn't happen again. The kids all seemed to like the staff who ran the program; overall I was underwhelmed by the Kid's Club facility and activities during the day after having experienced other programs at other hotels. The evening activities for the kids were much better than average, however. One night they did a mini-show complete with choreography and rather elaborate costumes, another night it was a pinata, an acrobatic troupe (geared more for European tastes than American sensibilities - nothing really risque but not what many parents in the US would consider entertainment for young children), and a talent show. They did the usual group games as well. There was no children's night in the disco as they sometimes have in other hotels but the kids did routinely run up to the bar in the theatre for popcorn and drinks. The child-sized chairs and tables set up in the front were a nice touch and the kids really loved them. EVENING ENTERTAINMENT: We went to all the shows. Many were the standard, rather hokey, game show, audience participation type ones which are common at AI's. A couple of the kids in our group liked the \"Mr. Iberostar\" competition and the Iberogrammy's but I found them almost painful to sit through. The one which was very good was the Mexican Folklore show which showed many traditional Mexican dances. The dancers really were fabulous - not the Ballet Folklorico in Mexico City (which I've seen both in Mexico City and on tour) but quite good considering the venue. The girls loved the swishing dresses and how the men tied the bright red sashes into ribbons with their feet. One featured swishing skirts while dancing with lighted candles on their heads - that was impressive. The Broadway night would have been better if they had allowed the dancers to use the actual recordings rather than have live singers but the finale really was something not to be missed (\"The Lion King\" with dancers on stilts and in elaborate costumes like in the actual show). All in all not a bad way to kill an evening, but watch the board to see what nights to plan a late dinner or go off property. FOOD: You can literally eat 24 hours a day but you do need to be careful regarding food safety in the heat (use the same rules you'd use at a Fourth of July BBQ and you'll be fine). We ate dinner at the steakhouse, tropical, and Japanese; if you're travelling with kids DEFINITELY go to the Japanese. They all loved the fancy twirling and presentation of the hibachi chef; the food was good quality, especially the vegetables tempura - at home that same meal would have set us back quite a pretty penny I can tell you and there it was included. The buffets are good - don't go expecting haute cuisine, but there is enough for even the pickiest eater to find something. The green tomatillo sauce is out of this world - I'm going through serious withdrawal! The kids kept running up for the limitless ice creams but stick to the soft serve you can find behind the bars at the Uxmail and Marimba rather that the \"hard\" ice cream at the beach bar (which is usually anything but - the freezer is opened so often the ice cream melts very quickly). They make fairly good mohitos but don't expect a full-scale wine cellar. The sangria was very good. The kids loved going up and ordering their \"drinks\" - strawberry margaritas, daquiris, pina coladas, etc. - especially at night at the theatre. With a teenager I was concerned about underage drinking but we didn't have any problems. I didn't notice any other underage kids drunk either. The last night of our stay they did ask her if she wanted her pina colada at dinner with or withour alcohol but I gave her permission to have one with. She didn't really do too much running about on her own (by her own choice) so I don't know what would have gone on if she was alone. OFF PROPERTY: Plaza Playacar is the small shopping plaza about 5 minutes walk away from the hotel - easy even with small kids. It's very intentionally quaint (kind of like the rest of Playacar) and the prices are better than those of the vendors who come to the hotel or the hotel shop. It's a nice evening stroll. Playa del Carmen is within walking distance but we took a cab because of the heat. Got the kids hair braided there and the tattoos for MUCH less than on property. It's pretty and quaint in the tourist area by the ferry terminal but we didn't spend much time there because it was just too hot. We went on one full-day excursion to Tulum/Xel-Ha which we set up through the hotel's office. The price was fairly steep ($84 per adult, $67 per kid over 5) but better than what we were quoted by our tour company. Tulum was beautiful but again - the heat was intense. Xel-Ha was really fabulous - even the four year old (who is not really a swimmer but will put her head under water) had a great time in her life-vest and snorkle mask looking at all the fish. It's worth a full day rather than a half. The all-inclusive option is really the only way to go; the food is otherwise so expensive that it's not worth paying as you go. We didn't do Xcaret (which is closer to the hotel) because we felt that we would be overwhelmed by the size and trying to do too much. OVERALL: Iberostar in general and the Tucan/Quetzal in particular seems to be great for families of all sizes and ages. We saw some couples there, but with the number of kids running around it's not really a spot for romance no matter how lush and tropically beautiful it is. There was at least one wedding taking place and I'd say it's a good place for that - but the happy couple should then take off for an adults-only resort and leave their extended families behind to enjoy the Tucan. If you are looking for the \"real Mexico\", look elsewhere, because it's not here - but if you want a clean, safe, beautiful resort where you can relax with your kids, this is a great place.", "Date": "August 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Thetford, Norfolk, UK", "Title": "\u201cOur wedding at the Tucan - gemma.barrett@tesco.net, NORFOLK UK\u201d", "Author": "Tilly01", "ReviewID": "UR5727002", "Content": "Our party of 24 travelled to the Tucan 15th-29th August for the wedding of my husband and I. We booked the hotel in March 2005 and chose it purley because of the fantastic reviews we read on tripadvisor. We could go on forever telling you about our experience, but instaed we'll just pick out a few good and bad pointers for anyone lloking to travel there soon... CHECKING IN: A bit crazy because there were so many of us! The hotel had mixed up people in their rooms (like putting my dad in with my uncle! Not a good combination!) After all the confusion though it was sorted no probs and the receptionists were very helpful. THE WEDDING: We'd spent 18 months planning our wedding on the beach and composed our own CD of personal songs to play during the ceremony. My advise to anyone planning to do this also is to request a runthrough of the music in the rehersal the day before. This wasn't offered to us, and we ended up having 2 songs repeated, one song played that we didn't even ask for, and it was slurred, and the most important song to us, they ignored. This for us, spoilt our ceremony. If you have a large party as we did, we'd also say to ask for a seating plan for the meal afterwards. This, wasn't offered to us, and my husband and I spent 20 minutes organsing the everyone. We felt that this should have been done prior to our arrival, by the co-ordiantor. Because we didn't get into eat until 7pm, and we weren't out of the restaurant by 8.30, we were asked to leave to make room for the next sitting of hotel guests. We did complain to the Manager about how our day was spoilt and he did his best to compensate for it. They were truely apologetic for what had happened on our special day. THE HOTEL, GROUNDS and FOOD: Fantastic, fantastic, fantastic! The only warning I would give to anyone travelling to mexico in general, is BE CAREFUL ON THE MARBLE. It is very popular for flooring EVERYWHERE, and they don't seem to consider the safety aspects of it. It looks lovely, but when it gets wet around by the pool, its VERY DANGEROUS. My family went to Dolphin Discovery yesterday and my mum slipped on the marble, landed on her back and was knocked unconscious. She was lucky, as her accident could have been a lot worse. TRIPS: Marks out of 10 Captain Hook Pirates Night - 10/10 (Great entertainment and value) Speedboating through the mangroves - 10/10 (Fab snorkelling and value) Bar Hopper into Cancun - 12/10 (A must do! Coco Bongos is something out of this world!) Wet and Wild - 3/10 (Only 4 slides, had done the park in 1 hour!) Dolphin Discovery - 10/10 (so I was told!) UPSET TUMMIES: Half of the people we travelled with got upset bellies with stomach cramps. we couldn't decide what caused it, but Immodium, Ibruprophen and Resolve were the saviours of the holiday - take plenty! That's all of my rambling done. I hope it's been helpful? If anyone want's to ask me any questions, feel free!

We have stayed at Iberostar Paraiso Del Mar and although the service is a tad bit slower at the Tucan this property is excellent. Food was very good considering the buffet caters to a wide variety of tastes. Breakfast is your best bet if american, eggs made to order and other traditional breakfast fare. We ate at the steakhouse 2 times and it was very good. The beef has a different taste than american beef but is very good. Steak or chicken comes with bake potato (small) and a small ear of corn along with bread and appetizer buffet. Beach at the Tucan was excellent with sandy bottom and few rocks. There was a shortage of beach umbrellas when we first arrived but the resort quickly received more umbrellas and did not seem to be an issue by the end of our stay. Beds are hard but we expected this and packed a egg crate which did help. Although the bed seems uncomfortable at first I actually slept better than at home. Liquor variety is more limted than at the Paraiso Del Mar but bartenders are very good and quick. I did not see a single European tip but many americans seemed to do so liberally. It is much appreciated and deserved. The average employee at the resort is making 10 bucks a day. You can exchange dollars for 5 peso coins (50 cents) to spread the wealth. There were a few louder New Yorkers who generally seem to give the Europeans the impression you read about in the reviews. This was mainly isolated to the adult pool bar and not in the family pool and beach areas. There is lots of topless sunbathers so beware if this offends you. The dive shop manager (american) was not very friendly and seemed to be more interested in proving his prowess rather than concentrating on recommending dives. I asked the workers what dives they recommended and they pushed all the dives. The dive operations, although the same company , was much better at the Del Mar. All boats and kayaks seem to be in good working order with little wait. Seemed to be several different Parasail operators and they walk the beach at different times looking for interested parties. The prices are negotiable. They start at around 60 dollars but feel a good price would be around 50 dollars as compared to what I have seen at other resorts. Pool isvery nice and clean but warm during this time of year but that is expected this time of year. Rooms were excellent and cleaning by staff was adequate although cleaned at different times each day. The shows here at the Tucan were very good and the entertainment staff really tries hard and it shows.

We stayed for 5 nights and truly loved every minute. ARRIVAL/CHECK IN: We booked our vacation through Apple Vacations. They did a great job and were very organized. They had a shuttle pick us up at the airport and the ride to the hotel was about 45 minutes. Upon arrival, check-in was a breeze. Check-in was not until 3pm, but we arrived around 10am and our room was all ready for us. ROOM: The rooms were very nice and kept clean by the maid. We didn't find the beds to be too uncomfortable, but we were so exhausted by the end of the night, I don't think we would have noticed. The mini-bar was included, and was stocked with soda, beer, and water every other day. You can request more if you'd like. Before our stay, we let the hotel know that it was our honeymoon trip, and on our first day, a staff member delivered a bowl of fruit and a bottle of wine to our room. Also, the maid decorated our room daily with flower petals on the bed and pretty towel art. We also received Iberostar T-shirts. Although it was hot outside, the rooms were kept very cool and comfortable. FOOD and DRINKS: My husband is a picky eater and I love a huge variety and we were both satisfied. We ate at the buffets for most meals and found most of the food to be quite good. My husband had a burger at the outdoor buffet and said it was the best he's ever had. Since we stayed for 5 nights, we were able to eat dinner at 2 a'la carte restaurants. We chose the Mexican one and the Italian one. Mexican was just okay. It is not like the mexican food we have here in the states. There were no burritos or nachos or things like that. The Italian one was pretty good though. Room service is also included and we ordered it one time. Our food arrived promptly and was very good. Between us we tried almost every food at the buffets and neither of us got sick. There are bars throughout the resort and we were never without a drink. If they aren't strong enough, just ask for a double. POOL and BEACH: The main pool was huge and very clean and nice. The water was not very cold, but that's the way I like it. Unfortunately children have taken over the hot tub in the center of the pool, so it is no longer hot but actually cooler than the pool. There was also another pool for pool sports that had basketball hoops mounted on the sides. We didn't get in this pool but it looked fun. The adults-only pool bar was also very nice and for the most part, the adults-only rule was heavily enforced by the bartenders, which was nice. The beach was beautiful and clean. The waters were clear and warm. Although it is not allowed, people go out early and reserve chairs by the beach and pool with towels. Even so, it was fairly easy to find a chair throughout the day. If you can't find one though, I have an easy solution: Move someone's towels and sit there. If people can't follow the rules then too bad. WILDLIFE: The wildlife at the resort was amazing. There were wild monkeys, flamingos, anoles, iguanas, parrots, little brown furry guys called rock cavys, and lots of birds. The inside of the resort is also full of ponds with fish. And to the people who say these ponds smell like a sewer: The entire country of Mexico smells like a sewer. You get used to it. STAFF: Everybody who worked at the resort was wonderful, friendly, and attentive. We did not encounter one unpleasant employee the entire time. ENTERTAINMENT: The entertainment group, called Star Friends, held various activities throughout the day, including different kinds of sports, games, areobics, bingo, and dancing. They also put on a show each night, which we never made it to because we were so tired at the end of the night, we just wanted to relax in our room. They have a night club which opens at 10:30pm which we also never made it too. To conclude, we had a fantastic time at this resort and are looking forward to one day going back.

After a 10hr flight and 50min transfer we were not disappointed the faciilities and cleanliness was second to none. The room was mayan style design, I have stayed in better furnished rooms in other 5 star accomodations and was slightly disappointed with this. My other gripe was there was no bath only a shower, it was however a very large shower. We had some wonderful creations of various animals/birds made out of towels which was very welcoming upon our return to the cleaned room. The staff around the hotel always smiled and always gave a greeting which made the stay all the more welcoming. we overlooked some of the pool from block 11 on the 3rd floor little bit noisy but it was OK. If you require a very quiet stay and use the room alot then request a room at the back end of reception which i was advised to be extremely quiet. The only staff that i found unwelcoming and rude on occasions was at the reception. Now to the food - This was by far the best food i have had at any hotel. Waiter service was great could not do enough for you. The only place where we received a bad service was at the Italian. I would recommend visiting all the other restaurants. The jungle area added something different. Great to see wildlife, Iguanas, South American Agouti (rodent) birds and of course monkeys. all in all a great hotel just the usual niggly areas that could easily be improved upon by Iberostar. We also had the option of a free upgrade to the finish our last night at the Paraiso Lindo in a junior suite so decided to take them up on the offer. Now then there is Luxury and there is Paraiso Lindo - what a fabulous place to go. It was by a cut above the Tucan in all departments, we are now considering returning to the Lindo.

The food was excellent, in our opinion and by the middle of the week I was actually sick of eating. The service was superb. These people work really hard.

The drinks at the hotel were a little weak but try tipping the bartender, he'll remember what you order and he'll get very heavy handed with the alcohol. And they do deserve the tips.

We have stayed in an Iberostar in Riviera Maya before and it was extremely similar. Best Day was our connection from airport to hotel and although they made us wait a while they were organized for the most part. The hotel is beatiful. The rooms are large, each with a balcony. The beds are indeed hard, but they are comfortable and we had no problems sleeping. The pool is huge, although it is extremely warm. In fact, we were surprised to find out that the \"hot\" tub was actually colder than the pool. We got up at 7 am to get a spot at the pool. Most of the chairs are taken by about 8 o clock. The beach is like a postcard---even better than the last time. The water is clear, beatiful, and perfect temperature. You can rent an umbrella to stick into the sand between your chairs, which I highly recommend as the sun can get a tad brutal. Now onto the food. We only got 1 guaranteed reservation because we stayed 4 nights so we foolishly chose the Italian restaurant. The food was horrible and it was likely the cause of me being sick for a whole uncomfortable night in the bathroom. We put ourselves on wait lists for each other night and got into them almost every night (but didnt attend due to excursions planned). The buffet is good, but try not to overdo it as it will impair your ability to drink. Service is great, staff is VERY friendly and attentive. We got a ton of room service one night and it was quick and everything was delicious. If you would like American food for a change, go with room service (especially if you have kids). The last night we bought our way into the steak house. If you slip them 5-10 dollars they will let you in, contrary to what the guest relations woman says. We heard of that trick, and it worked. The Steakhouse is the best, and something to definitely not miss. They give you a bloomin' onion (good for those Outback fans), and the steak is great. We recommend Xcaret for an excursion. It is 88 dollars for an all day/night affair. Although the show is highly rated it gets very old and drags on for a few hours with the same song and dance, different costumes. Take a 5 dollar cab to Playa del Carmen shops and have a drink at Senor Frog's (it is very fun and the view is unbelievable). Bring one dollar bills, as they can get you very far.

We returned from a fortnight stay in Mexico on August 13th 2006. We stayed at an Iberostar in The Dom Rep last year and couldn`t praise it highly enough, so we thought we`d play safe and use the Iberostar Tucan in Mexico this year. We used trip advisor to back up our ideas and booked based on the fantastic reviews it received! What can have gone so badly wrong in a year? On first impressions the hotel was everything we expected, clean looking, smiling staff, lots a space around the pool. Our first week was great, we made some fantastic new friends in the seperate adult only pool bar and had some really great, drunken afternoons too! The buffets left bit to be desired, not great choice and food often only luke warm. None of the food was covered and often the local birds helped themselves from the counter- so watch out for the beak marks! The Al A Carte restuarants were better, especially the Italian and Japenese, but we were unable to book any additional nights on top of our 6-booking allocation(unlike the one in Dom Rep where we ate in A la Carte`s most evenings, having no problem to re-book additional nights!) Our nightmare began towards the end of the first week when both myself and my husband fell ill with acute diarrhoea and severe stomach cramps. Now we are not virgins of the Carribbean and most holidays we have had a couple of uncomfortable days, popping Imodium, but this was very different! It was a case of not being more than 2mins from a tiolet, because once those stomach cramps kicked in you knew you had to run-fast! In fact, after eating, within 10/15 mins, you were running to the tiolet! On the 2nd day of being ill, my husband then began vomiting severley, every 15 mins, between rushing to the loo. This continued for 15 hours when the vomiting stopped but the diarrhoea continued. Now there is nothing better than illness to draw people together, and we found ourselves continually hearing other families stories of illness, in fact, those not ill were in the minority! eg a party of 16 from Coventry- 14 were ill, a family of 6 from Fulham-5 were ill, and so it went on. A number of families also reported their children suffering form ear infections after swimming in the pool. On my 4th day of being ill I began passing blood and to cut a long story short, spent the next 2 days in hospital on intrevenus drip for rehydration, anti-biotics and pain killers! Following blood samples they detected an abdominal bacterial infection- great! After speaking to the rep upon discharge from hospital, she admitted that the hotel was under investigation from Health and Safety, due to the high number of guests that had fallen ill. Remarkably staff presence increased ten fold over the last few days of our holiday! Icecream lollies were being distributed around the pool, at the steak restaurant you could also select lobster(not available before!), chefs were cooking vast amounts of fresh food at the buffets and were coming around to tables to chat to the guests. I only hope that they find the outbreak and clear this mess up; what could have potentially been a fantastic holiday in a superbly set out hotel, turned into a nightmare due to general lack of hygiene! I am still waiitng for a response from the Travel Agents as to the outcome of the investigation.", "Date": "August 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cHad a beautiful beach wedding!\u201d", "Author": "BeachWedding2006", "ReviewID": "UR5649052", "Content": "My husband and I were married at the Iberostar Tucan and everything was perfect.

The hotel rooms are nice and large and set within a carved out area of the Jungle. There are loads of giant iguanas and Aguties roaming about the place (guinea pig type creatures). We even saw a large Mexican Badger hopping along the beach. Check out the Howler Monkies making a racket in the morning. The hotel is split into two areas and this caused us some concern but when you get there you will see that it is all just one big hotel with two receptions and two large buffet restaurants. Food was great and we never tired of it. I am really fussy with my food but i enjoyed most of it. We never got ill. If you have never been on an All Inclusive holiday then you will think this is the Bees Knees and love every minute of it. If you have been on a few then i would guess that it is better than most and will suprise you. The beach was lovely and the sea very choppy but as warm as a bath. The fish were the size of small dogs and you could see stingray and other weird things just in the shallows. We were amazed at the amount and variety of animals and insects in Mexico. Mexico is more exotic than we had first thought. The only downfall is the Trips....they are a rip off. We went in April and just found that the rep or the company has charged us \u00a3400.00 extra on our credit cards three months later. This may be a genuine mistake but you never know. It's something we could do without having to sort out. The trip to the Xel-Ha and Toluum (mayan ruins) was too hot for us and the adventure park had no shade...we burnt and came up in prickly heat rash which took a few days to go. I would really reccommend this hotel as it is the best in the area or go to the paradiso rio de oro in Cuba. Far better than Sandals and more to do than Maldives. If you get a chance to do a twin tour then do as we regretted not doing it. We bought loads of silver stuff over there. The prices are geared towards the Americans but you can really haggle.

They certainly have a different standard than Americans. We spoke with a Brit who loved everything about the place (while were standing in line to get dinner reservations.... for 30 min). We were shocked... he pointed out our standards as Americans were high. List of bad: Food is pig slop at best, and I am not kidding. Same stuff every day. You can only book 2 reservations for a 6 night stay at the Hotel's \"nice\" 4 resturaunts. We did the Japanese and the Mexican, which were ok. You have to get up by 6am to go down and reserve a decient pool side cabana.... by 10 am you wont even get a chair in the sun. The beds were hard, there was no box spring. Just a hard mattress on a concrete slab. The fish pond around the lobby and resturaunts smells like a sewer and looks like one too. Good: Service was good. Drinks were ok, they did have some name brand alcohol. Quite a few activities and a nightly show, which was ok. Grounds and wildlife were good, not great but good. The pool was nice and of course the ocean was great. The beach does have some seaweed and some rocks just off shore. Beware Americans, this is a 2 1/2 star hotel at best.

The dive centre staff were excellent -my husband undertook an open water course and really enjoyed himself. The hotel room was excellent and comfortable especially in times of need- i was ill for five days due to sickness ,diarrhea and stomach cramps. Couldn't eat much after that. Too expensive to see doctor but chemist was helpful in the town. Food poisioning? We went on three excursions- dolphin swin, Xel-ha and Coba / myan Village.

We only managed to eat in three of the restuarants-Japenesse, steak house and Mexican. The Japenesse was the most interesting but i wouldn't really say that they were ala carte. The buffet restuarant was great to start with but got a bit boring in the end. My husband enjoyed the room service. We felt that the hotel was lacking in evening entertaiment. The bars were very comfortable, but there was no outside bar in the evening to sit outside and enjoy the fresh air. We would have really loved to have sat somewhere quiet and enjoy the beach setting in the evening. There was a show every night but we felt that it was like butlins! Most nights we were back in our room by 10pm. The wildlife in the hotel was amazing and we enjoyed watching the monkeys and lizards. There was no phone card telephone in the Hotel so it meant walking into town when we needed to phone home. We really enjoyed sitting on the beach and the view. We couldn't sit by the pool as there was never no sun beds as they were all reserved.

I must say we had a great time and wished we were still there! I\u2019m a very picky person and this resort impressed me completely right from the start. This hotel is very well maintained from lobby right to through the beach area. The rooms were clean and the bathroom was a very comfortable size. LOVE the shower! The food was a little bland for my taste buds but there is such a variety of food you can always find something to enjoy to eat. We eat at 3 of the restaurants and found the Tropical the most enjoyable to us (love seafood and shellfish) the Japanese was also very good. To be totally honest my finance did get sick 2 days into our visit but we walked down to the pharmacy down the road (very safe) and bought some med\u2019s and nip that right in the butt. Was it from the food, water or weather who knows but it wasn\u2019t going to get the best of our time there. The night time entertainment was ok some nights were diffidently better than others. Will recommend the folk dance evening. Lots of costumes and colors. You can see the staff really try to do their best to make you feel welcome by sitting and introducing themselves during breakfast and having some small conversation. For the animal lovers there are many animals walking around the resort. From birds to monkeys so bring plenty of batteries for your camera. The drinks are weak but I always asked to make them to make the cocktails stronger and that wasn\u2019t a problem at all. Tips were so appreciated and were worth giving. The service was always excellent regardless. We also went on two excursions which were Coba and Tulum/Xel-Ha (2 in one all inclusive) very interesting trips on both Coba and Tulum. If you enjoy history this was great. A bit pricy but worth it. We really learn so much. Xel-Ha was also a great place this is something they call their waterpark. You can snorkel while you go down the river which was amazing. It started to rain so badly we couldn\u2019t truly enjoy the whole event but on a clear sun day it has to be fantastic! We spent most of our time at the beach which was very nice plenty of lounge chairs you can always find a spot. If you want to hide away from the sun you can always get an umbrella. The water was always a good temp but beware of the rocks.We went under and picked up a cement block??? The sand was nice and soft. We didn\u2019t stay at the pool area much of the time which is massively big but the water was warm maybe not as refreshing to some people but to us it was good. If you buy floats for the pool you will be spending about $15.00 for one so kept that in mind. Didn\u2019t make it to the swim up bar because it was under repairs for a few days. But seems nice as well. This was a great vacation and would absolutely return to this resort without hesitation. I would only make one change and book for a long stay. I want to thank all the people for giving their fee back because it made my decision on choosing the Iberostar Tucan.

Super hotel!\u201d", "Author": "jen353", "ReviewID": "UR5617286", "Content": "My boyfriend and I stayed at the Tucan for two weeks from the 1st August. I got so much info from this site that I feel it is my duty to write a review of the hotel, even though I know I will be repeating some of what others have said - sorry! Here goes: PUBLIC AREAS Beautiful! Every area of this hotel (both sides) has been carefully planned, from the winding paths in the jungle area, to the Mayan artifacts scattered around. It's especially pretty at night when all lit up. As mentioned - be aware of slippery floors. We found the hotel (both sides) to be of a perfect size, easy to walk to the different areas without getting lost - but big enough not to get caught in crowds. ROOM We emailed the hotel prior to our visit to request a room facing in towards the resort, possibly facing the pool, on the third floor and, again if possible, with a king size bed. Amazingly every request was met but one. We were on the third floor in building 14 with the king bed, but rather than facing the pool we were overlooking some of the jungle area. This however proved to be a wonderful location for us. We could see different wildlife from our balcony, and we seemed to be half way between the two ends of the resort so no walk was ever too long. At night we could hear the entertainment from our room but we did not find it too loud and were always able to fall asleep whilst it was going on. A very light sleeper could struggle however. In terms of the room itself, it met our needs perfectly. We found it spacious for the two of us, and found it had every thing we needed. The shower was very spacious and on most days the man who cleaned the room left us wonderful towel models. I know others have mentioned problems with hard beds, weak air conditioning and fridges but we really had all three just right for us in our room. It could be that we were lucky with the room, or it could be that it was just right for our own expectations - who knows! Someone mentioned about the lack of a full length mirror - to get round this I used to walk outside the room a little down the hallway where there was this fire hose thing covered in a mirror like surface. It was a perfect full length mirror for me and none of the other guests ever caught me looking! POOL/BEACH Both lovely as others have mentioned. We would usulally visit these areas late afternoon and were always able to find two beds but there were more free on the beach than around the pool at the times we were looking. On the couple of occassions that we wandered down around 10ish - almost all beds around the pool were gone. We tried the free scuba trial in the pool - it was fun and happens twice a day am and pm. Make sure you eat plenty of ice cream from the pool bar. It is served from 11am and there are many lovely flavours. You can have it in a cone or in a cup. We saw quite a few people drinking and eating ice cream in the main pool - I did find this off putting because of possible spillages and the odd straw floating around but that is just my personal opinion. FOOD Staying two weeks meant we could visit the speciality restaurants 5 times. We made a reservation for each of the five with no problems. I prefered the Steak house in terms of the food quality (fillet steak - very nice!), and the Japanese because of the entertainment factor (the chef cooks infront of you). We liked the food in the buffet restaurants also and did not find the food repetitive because we varried where we ate each day. For example, if we were eating out for lunch, we would eat dinner in the buffet. We tried to avoid eating lunch and dinner in the buffet restaurants on the same day - and this worked for us. Again this could be down to personal preferences but we were never to hot in any of the restaurants, apart from in the Japanese because of the heat from the cooking. I would recommend this hotel to familes and couples who are looking for a laid back vacation with friendly staff and lots going on. I would not recommend it to you if you want to be away from children and the song 'hey baby' for a week or two!

We thought this particular building was great, as it was very close to the pool and beach. By far the best part of our vacation was our all day excursion with Edventure Tours [-----------------------------------------------------------]. I basically came across numerous reviews online regarding this man Eddie and everyone raved about his tour. I checked out his website and emailed him and we set up our tour for 15 people. Having completely set this up over the internet, it really could have gone either way, but it was definitley one of the best tours we have ever done. He lets you create your own tour based on what you'd most like to see. A van came(with a very nice driver who was with us all day and kept an eye on our valuables) to pick us all up promptly at 10am. We began with zip lining over the jungle, then on to snorkeling through underwater caves (cenotes), then we went snorkeling with sea turtles and then ended with snorkeling in a lagoon. Each stop was fabulous and as a guide, Eddie was excellent. He even dropped us off at a local restaurant on the beach for lunch, as well as, provided soda and beer all day long w/no charge. Everyone had a great time and we would HIGHLY recommend his tour. He provides wet suits and snorkeling gear as well. It was relatively inexpensive-I think we paid about $65 each for the entire day including the van! We found the Tucan to be very nice and loved how they came around each day with a different animal to get your picture taken with! The beach was really nice and there was no seaweed at all. The service everywhere was great and we made an effort to tip very well, everywhere we went. We noticed that not everyone was tipping and thought that was too bad. Take plenty of $1's and tip!! The only negative part of our trip was that a few of us got sick. Two of us in particular, got really sick, and we are not sure from what, as we thought we were being careful. We heard from many others both at the resort and at the airport who got quite sick as well. I think, because of this fact alone, I would not return to Mexico, even though the Tucan was fabulous.

The property is unique and romantic, the jungle section allows for many isolated little areas, but is not so spacious that it takes forever to walk from one side to the other. Food was consistantly very good, if not slightly bland. Found the steakhouse to be the best of the a la cartes. The pool is vast for the property size, and even during peak times of the day it didn't feel crowded. The beach is absolutely spectacular; sandy and spacious with wonderfully warm blue tropical water. The island of Cozumel a few miles off the coast helps keep the waves and currents down, making for nice swimming and wading condiitons. Finally, Tucan's biggest selling point to me was the service provided. Every employee we encountered, front \"front line\" employees like bar tenders and servers to \"behind the scenes\" types like reoair crews and the like were exceedingly polite and helpful.

I would rate this hotel slightly above average, mainly due to it's higher price, and a few room problems. Otherwise, it would be excellent. I would not recommend this hotel in summer due to the AC issues. PRO's and CON's PROS: ------- * Very helpful and friendly staff, unusual for an all inclusive one would think. * Very clean facilities * Great food - dinner buffets the best. Breakfast #2, lunches weren't that great. (Hotdogs, hamburgers mainly, and other pasta stuff). * Great and fast room service, 30mins tops * Beautiful pool area * Nice on-site resturaunts, but only 2 guaranteed reservations at the nicer ones. Buffet was very good at night however. * Good access to beach facilities * Beds firm, but we slept fine CONS: ------- * Rooms NOT well cooled, AC's are way UNDERPOWERED. The temp in the room hovered from 25-26C most of the day and night. Many guests complained about this thru out the hotel. That's 77-78F and most folks don't like it this warm at night, esp. if you have small kiddies. Wonder if these guys ever heard of FREON.? Air was weak and not that cold. * Sodas at lunch had little flavor and were watered down. * The mixed drinks could have been better at times also, seemed a bit weak. But, I'm sure I could have asked them to make them stronger, as the staff was truly great. * Nightly shows were cheasy, few entertainers, but to be expected most likely. They were pro's however. We only watched one after the first night. * It felt crowed in late July to us. Nonetheless, you could usually get space at the pool and beach, esp in late afternoons with no problems. * TONS of seaweed on the beaches, no matter where you go. Must be a summer thing ?? Not hotel fault, but not that beautiful to see in JULY. Anyone else bothered by this. ? In general, I might return to this hotel, but definitely not in the summer.

I am soooooo thankful that I selected this resort! We will never forget our trip! The resort is beautiful! The staff is absolutely wonderful! Yes, the beds are a bit hard, but we slept fine. We enjoyed the variety of food and places to eat! We were never thirsty or far from a place to get a drink. The pool is huge and there are plenty of places to sit. Like all pools in any resort or hotels the best locations are going to go early. We never had difficulty finding a good spot. There are half a dozen very large and comfortable huts around the pool that are fabulous. We recommend that you get up early (6:00 am) and claim one of them. We spent the entire day relaxing and enjoying the beautiful paradise. It was worth getting up early!!! The beach is also beautiful and very close to the pool and eating area. The evening entertainment was okay! Do not go expecting a Broadway production! They work very hard to entertain you and provide you with a relaxing and fun evening. They are wonderful with the kids too! What impressed us the most was the hard working staff! Especially the wait staff and bar tenders. We were disappointed that we did not see many people giving them tips. We gave a few dollars at every meal and always gave anyone that brought us a drink a dollar. Even wet dollars at the pool bar are appreciated! We enjoyed extra special attention because we let them know in a practical way how much we appreciated their wonderful service. Plan on bringing a lot of $1 bills. We never exchanged money. We only brought small bills (1's, 5's and 10's). Many places will give you change in American money if you ask.

I spent months reading reviews of all inclusives in Playa del Carmen and Iberostar Tucan was always rated highly. Still not being sure if I made a good decision, I booked our vacation from July 9th - July 16th there. Trust me when I say, THIS PLACE IS FANTASTIC! No regrets here. A vacation or holiday will only be as good as you make it. I read so many of these reviews that I was already prepared that it would be hot and muggy weather, hard beds, early morning races to reserve lounge chairs by the pool, mediocre food, and no brand named liquor. So, my family and I discussed this before we got there. Yes the weather is hot and muggy in July. We just stayed in the water (pool and ocean) most of the time and it didn't bother us at all. In fact, it's good to sweat out all those impurities. The beds were definitely firm. After a day of fun in the sun and perhaps a little libation, we were so tired the beds didn't bother us at all. Again, this was expected. I was usually the first one down at the pool at 6:30am to reserve our lounge chairs. Yes, the facility has a policy that you can't do that but we did anyways (so does everyone else). I would read a book in peace and quiet or take a nap there by the pool. I saw available chairs as late as 9am. Everyone has a different take on the food. Like everyone else, we really enjoyed the variety of the buffet. We did eat at the Japanese, Italian, and Steak House restaurants. By far, the Steak House was the best. The food was good and we all ate throughout the whole day...on vacation you can do that. The liquor was fine. They do make the drinks a little weak, but all you have to do is ask for your drink extra strong and they take care of you. We all parasailed ($40) per person, ATV Quads through the jungle ($60) per person, horseback riding ($60) per person, and Catamaran Snorkeling ($40) per person. We kept ourselves busy having fun. Isn't that what it's supposed to be? We especially enjoyed going into 5th street in Playa Del Carmen. Senior Frogs and Carlos & Charlie's rocked and we had a great time. I definitely recommend going to 5th street if you are in Playa Del Carmen. It's a fun experience. Overall, our vacation was as close to perfect as it could be. As a family, we accepted the fact that not everything was going to exactly perfect, and we enjoyed ourselves. You cannot go wrong with spending your hard earned money going to this resort. I'm sure you will love it. Just keep in mind that there are many families there with kids of all ages, so for a romantic getaway, I would suggest looking elsewhere.

Day beds were already reserved between 6 and 7 every morning. Try to get one at least once. They are very comfortable and a great place to do some reading or just people watch. The beach was cleaned every day and there was always someone patroling the area for liter. The beach and pool chairs with cover are gone by 8 or 9. All it takes to hold them is 1 towel over the bottom of 2 chairs. I was one of the few people who actually physically stayed at my reserved areas. The wife would wander down around 10.

We travelled from the Uk so we were very tired after our 10+ hour flight. Our check-in was easy and our bellboy took our cases to our rooms.

Most of our previous holidays have been in Europe and they were good but we have never received the high standard we got at the Tucan. We can honestly say there was not one thing we did not enjoy, well maybe the sunburn.... beware the sun is strong!!! We recommend the Bonsai resturant where they cook in front of you,we enjoyed it so much that we visited this resturant twice. Book the al-a-carte resturants as soon as you can they are popular so get booked up, which is understandable. We spent most of our two weeks relaxing and enjoying the resort but did try the ATV and Speedboats, they were great fun. Towards the end of our stay we went to the 'Captain Hook' cruise and meal evening in Cancun.

A bit about us (for context): we are from Washington DC, mid-30s, no children and fairly easy to please when it comes to travel/accommodations. (We\u2019re not exactly the most uptight duo.) We had never been to Playa del Carmen before; we went on the recommendation of our agent at Liberty Travel. In a nutshell, I honestly could not have asked for anything more out of this trip. The Tucan is fantastic. Just a gorgeous resort in such a unique setting (jungle! monkeys! wild birds! brown furry things of unknown origin!) Check-in was a breeze. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Our third floor room was lovely\u2014just the right size with a large bathroom and great balcony. (We were visited by a monkey while having pre-dinner cocktails one evening. Sadly, he declined our invite to join us.) By the way, yes the beds are a bit on the hard side but by no means are they uncomfortable. The Tucan is a big resort but it never felt huge. It takes only a few minutes to walk everywhere you want to be. The pool is delightful\u2014the pool bar is fine but does get crowded. The highlight is the beach. Just breathtakingly gorgeous. Clean sand and crystal clear water. We absolutely lived at the beach. We usually hit the sand by 10:30 AM or so and never had a problem getting a chair or an umbrella. The chairs by the pool did fill up quickly but that largely seemed due to families with many children. Some other quick thoughts: - The food at the restaurants was fine. We did the Asian, the Steakhouse and the Mediterranean. Nothing bowled us over but nothing was horrible, either. The regular buffet did just fine. And truth be told, the only food I was concerned with that week was the fruit placed on the rim of my drink. - In the evening, the bar near the entrance of the resort was a great place to relax and meet people (hello to the lovely couple from Liverpool & all our other British friends!) - Believe what everyone says and ignore the weather forecasts. It rained once on our second day there for about two hours. Rain was forecast for the rest of the week and not another drop fell. - The tipping question. Full disclosure\u2014we tend to be over-tippers. I tipped our housekeeping between 3-5 pesos every day and our bartenders a couple of pesos or two on every other round. The tips always seemed appreciated. We absolutely would stay there again and have been recommending it to anyone who asks. I have attached a link to my blog (I hope this is OK to do!) should any readers wish to see photos of the resort (and, well\u2026of us. Kindly forgive the pasty city-dweller look). http://wegotbeets.blogspot.com/ Thanks.", "Date": "July 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fairhope, Alabama", "Title": "\u201cOur Family had the best time, I shouldn't have worried!\u201d", "Author": "Mindy77", "ReviewID": "UR5447348", "Content": "Trip advisor is a great tool to help find the best resort! I am glad that when searching for a resort in Playa, I booked with this Wonderful resort. I truly based my judgement on doing so by the amount of positive comments this resort had. My husband and I brought our three kids, ages 9, 13 and 16. We stayed for 7 days. I have been all over the world and stayed at many 5 star hotels and have to say the staff here was outstanding. I got better service here than the Ritz in Peurto Rico. I was disapointed to see not many people tipping, I know here in the states Americans are used to tipping for everything, but I only saw a few Americans tip as well. The maids, bartenders and wait staff really do appreciate the tips and it's not that I believe you get better service for tipping, I just think that if you have the money to travel what is a few extra dollars going to well deserved individuals. Enough said on that, now on the resort and travel. We booked through Cheap Carribean , which is nice since they offer travel insurance. We had no problem finding our way through the men outside the airport luggage terminal and found the man we were searching for holding a sign with Cheap Carribean on it. We then traveled for 35 minutes in an airconditioned van straight to our resort. Upon checking in we waited and had lunch while our room was getting cleaned and ready which worked out perfectly for us. We were in 2042 which is a presidential suite. I took pictures on my camera so you can see the difference between it and the regular rooms. I also took pictures of the mattress as goofy as it sounds, but I was really worried about how everyone said the bed was hard, I was imagining a mattress like ones you find in a camper. This is not the case, it is firm, just like the Sealy Ultra firm mattresses, so if that will bug you then you might want to reconsider staying here....but it didn't bother me one bit, I love down feather beds, but after a day at the beach it just felt good to be in a bed even if it's firm. The rooms were clean and I didn't see any bugs. In fact, the were spraying pesticides in all the buildings when I was there, we had them wait on spraying our room until we left since we were bug free. Which brings up another subject, the maids and janitorial staff do not speak English, which means they can't read any notes asking for additional waters or so forth. So either brush up on your spanish or write some phrases down to take with you, otherwise you will have to find a translator. My HS spanish is not great and trying to tell them not to spray for bugs in our room was very humorous for them I'm sure. The Dive shop is great here (Dressell Diver's), if you don't have your dive card and/or have not gone on a dive in a year they will want you to do a quick review in the pool. This is best, since it is for you and your diving buddy's safety. We went on the Cozumel Dive/Snorkel trip and I snorkled with my daughter since she can't dive yet. It is very long for young kids, and during the 3 dives you can snorkel or choose to snorkel 2 times then stay at the Iberostar in Cozumel after lunch while they do the 3rd dive. That is what I opted to do so she could swim in their pool and go to the beach there. The 3 dives were okay, my husband/2 sons did them and pretty much got to see the same stuff I did snorkeling such as turtles, stingray, eagleray, yellow jack, tarpin and of course a barracuda. The turtle dive was nice which they did on their first day with Marco and Andy, they got to see numerous huge sea turtles on this drift dive. My daughter did for 250 US DLR the pool one-on-one child with instructor intro to scuba which she absolutely loved. If you book your stay before Sept. you can snorkel with Whale sharks that are migrating. For those of you who are not familiar with these gentle giants they are harmless but the size of a school bus. We did not do this, as you leave at 0530 in the morning and don't return until 1930 hours. And it is a 3 hour boat ride north of Cozumel. If you have never gone diving they offer for free a trial dive in their pool, which is a cheap way to see if you even like scuba. The staff is PADI certified and they are extremely helpful. The Spa is very nice and the hot stone massage by far is the best. Jet Skiing was okay, but their are many sail boats, canoes and then you have the parasailing boats to contend with, so maybe somewhere else where it isn't so busy or maybe an slower time of the day than when we went which was 1000 it would be better. The swim with the dolphins is worth your time if you have ever wanted to do this, we chose to do the one that has only 5 people in the group, Delphinus Dolphin Discover, word of advise if your a girl wear a one piece swim suit!! No one ever said anything, but it happened to all of the 10 girls in 3 of the groups we were losing our bottoms during the foot push. So you are trying to pull them up while the dolphin is pushing you through the water. Not anything you want to be worrying about when you have a dolphin swimming under you at full speed! And as far as the food, well since I have teenager boys who eat all the time, the inclusive trip was definitly worth it, they could go about their own business and I wasn't being hit up for money all the time. My suggestion is that for breakfast and/or lunch, it is fine for a buffett.. even for 7 days, but we like to break it up during the evening and go down to 5th street and eat at La Parilla's, Carlos and Charlies, Karen's and then go back to the resort for a night cap. Not only is it good for a change, but to also see the Mariachi bands that walk the streets and the culture all around. We were there during their election day and it was neat for our children to see their process of voting. Something we would have missed staying just on the resort property. Don't worry so much about the ala carte dinners, you can reserve on-line. As far as the pool and beach papayla's, well I say shame on anyone who leaves towles and shoes out the night before to \"reserve\" their place. I even think it is ridiculus for those who come out in the crack of dawn to do this. When my family wanted to be at the pool, I got up and I reserved my chair by sitting in it. It was annoying to see that people saved chairs when I saw many older individuals or families with little babies who needed the shade more than they did. To see these older people or families walking around the pool looking for a place to sit and instead finding chairs with hats, shoes and towels on them, not any people... people who even after 2 hours were not using their chairs nor have they even come to check on their stuff was just plain wrong. I guess it would be nice if people were more considerate of others. Following the advice of other's on staking claim to your spot at the pool is selfish if your not even using these chairs during the morning hours, or your going off to lunch or the beach for a few hours and especially if your going to be in the pool all day on a raft or just reserving chairs for your kids that are playing in the pool all day-\"just in case they might want them\". I can't blame this on just my fellow Americans as I saw EVERYONE doing this, and putting items out to reserve chairs is the only advise I really disagree upon when reading trip advisor. There are plenty of chairs to go around beach/pool. If only people wouldn't reserve what they don't need. I just hope the resort will start the practice of picking up these unattended (10 US DLR) towles or personal items and sticking them in the lost or found, since no one is there to claim them. Maybe then we wouldn't have this problem. With the Iberostar Tucan/Quentzel you won't be disapointed, it is great and well worth going!", "Date": "July 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Antonio", "Title": "\u201cWhat a great week!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5446762", "Content": "I just returned home from one week staying at the Tucan.

Some things I liked-- the rooms were comfortable and very clean every day (not one bug in sight), loved the towel art, the staff was very friendly, seeing animals on the grounds, the food and drinks were yummy, took a fun day trip snorkeling, the beach at night was so lovely and peaceful-- breezy, cool, wonderful. Every time we asked for anything from the front desk, it was delivered right away. Very helpful. Some things I wish had been a little different-- I only saw monkeys once, and carried my camera around all week hoping to catch them again! The restaurants are truly uncomfortable they are so hot (obviously I'm talking about hte ones with no ac)-- they have fans but the air just sits there. It's breezy outside, but in the restaurant, wow it is hot. You really do have to claim your space on the beach or by the pool. There were times when the resort felt very crowded to me. You have to make reservations in the formal restaurants and you can only go to three all week- they were usually booked and we only ended up getting a reservation at one of them. (The Caribbean- it was good but hot.) I wish the pool was a little cooler. Most of these things are to be expected in summer in Mexico, so they wouldn't keep me from returning to this resort.

What a WONDERFUL resort, we just loved it there. CHECK IN: Arrived at 11:00am got our room at 12:00 noon, Gloria at the front desk was great. ROOM: Very very clean, and just LOVED the shower. The only thing that I think that should be inproved was the mini fridge wasn't cold enough. Other than that the room was great, and the location was great too. We stay in building 13 right by the pool. POOL/BEACH: Pool was very big which we loved, but just alittle too warm for me. The beach was fabulous and the water was very refreshing and clear. Lot and lots of chairs on the beach, and if you can't get a shaded area you can get a unbrella from the towell guys. FOOD: From reading some reviews I was nervous about eating at the buffet, but let me tell you it was GREAT. Lots of food to choose from, never got sick once. We tried 3 out of 5 alacart restaurants: mexican, Italian and steak house. Italian and steak house was our favorite, we went twice to both. GROUNDS: Kudos to the workers outside, we always saw them cleaning, sweeping,`painting and it was sooo hot and they worked really hard. The jungle is agreat touch to the resort, we saw all the animals except the monkeys (my husband was sooo disappointed). STAR FRIENDS: Which are the entertainment crew. What wonderful people, they work really hard as well from 10:00am to 5:00 then from 8:00pm to 12:30am, everyday. The shows at night are alittle better than a school play and the make everyone laugh and enjoy them selves. All in all we had a awesome honeymoon and would go back in a heart beat.

We couldn't believe the changes there from when we last went 3 years ago. Its a nice place to wander round and do the shops. We went to Xcaret which was lovely, the show in the evening was definately worth seeing. We also went to Coba, and visited a Mayan village - amazing how these people live.

What a trip!!! I have absolutely no regrets over this vacation, except that our vacation is over. We booked through Liberty Travel and everything went very smoothly. Our Olympus rep, Gustavo, was very helpful and always available in the lobby for questions. Pools -- very warm and not very refreshing, but beautiful. Since I was out every morning taking pictures of the sunrise and reserving a palapa (yes, I know you aren't supposed to do that, but you can't get one if you wait until 9:00 or 10:00 and the sun was soooo intense), I always saw many people working on the pools; i.e., cleaning the pools, testing the water, etc. The pools do get pretty full of sand, but what do you expect being just a few steps from the ocean!!! Rooms -- very clean and cute towel art left on the beds every day. No bugs in sight for the 8 days we were there (didn't open the two bottles of Off we brought with us). We were in building 12 on the Tucan side. Just a few steps to either the pool or beach and a beautiful winding path through the jungle to the lobby or the buffet restaurant. Restaurants -- the buffet was adequate. We really enjoyed breakfast in the main buffet and the buffet out by the pool was great for lunch. We ate at the Japanese, Steak and Italian restaurants. The Japanese was wonderful, the Steak and Italian were ok. My kids loved ordering room service (chicken nuggets and fries) -- large portions and very quickly delivered (usually in 15-20 minutes). Star Friends -- I've never seen a nicer group of people. They work incredibly hard. All of the hotel staff always had a smile on their face and a greeting of \"Hola\" for us. The evening shows and games were always entertaining. Animals -- my son was intent on catching a lizard (thank goodness it never happened). We really enjoyed the monkeys (a baby monkey came down a tree literally 5 feet in front of us), hearing the roosters and peacocks, staying out of the way of the huge iguanas, and watching the funny-looking rodents. What an atmosphere -- the jungle and the ocean!!! Excursions -- the kids swam with dolphins, manatees, sting rays and sea lions at Dolphin Discovery in Puerto Aventuras. It was very pricey but worth it when you see the smiles on the DVDs and pictures that we purchased. We also went to 5th Avenue, but had much more fun haggling with the vendors, and winning, over prices right in the hotel on a couple of evenings by the main buffet.

The beach always has plenty of chairs and their is waiters and waitresses on the beach!!! Food- I always stay at all-inclusive so i'm used to the food. I think the food here was very good. There is such a varitiy that even the pickiest eaters are fine. My son has milk allergies and the hotel and resturants worked so closely with us. They would greet us everynight and let us know what he could and couldnot eat. This to me was one of the best parts of our vacation because it took away most of my fear about him eating something and getting very sick in a strange country. Rooms-Our rooms were very nice. They kept them clean and stocked the frig. everyday. we did leave a few dollars for the maids everyday. Hotel- I think it was a perfect size not to big not to small. There was a jungle in the middle and for the 1st 4 days we never saw one monkey! But, on the fifth day they were all over the balcony. This was a big highlight for us all. They were so cute and some were big and some were small. The Shows- the shows are put on by the star friends. I think most of them were pretty funny.

Wife and I plus our 4 kids...ages 14, 11, 6, and almost 2. Here are my thoughts on this friendly, fun, excellent place: Travel: We went through Apple, and the coordination, flight, bus, and check-in were all easy. No problems. Prepare for about 60 to 90 min on the bus b/t the airport and the resort. Accomodations: Clean, stocked, good maid service (we tipped about 3-5 dollars/day...drink the bottled water. There was a day bed in our rooms and we let a child sleep there. We had no problems with insects. Bathrooms were clean. They are basically like little condos or apartments, 3 stories, all easy distance to beach, pool, dining, etc. The animals lend a fun touch for the kids. Water: The beach is terrific. Pool is huge and warm. Zero-depth for toddlers and small kids. Food: The buffet is good. Sure, it's not 4 star cuisine, but with 1000+ people to feed, I don't expect it. The food is acceptable, and the huge variety at every meal make up for it. Plenty of choices for kids. We only ate at one restaurant, the Japanese one, which was okay. Heard not-so-good things about some of the others. If you're there for only a few days, the buffet is fine. Friendliness: Staff is gracious, eager to please. It seemed everyone spoke English, although I had fun using my Spanish at times. The guests seemed to be mostly from the US, especially the families. The honeymooners and other couples had a little more national variety...the topless sunbathers gave that away. Activities: Plenty to do. Our small kids enjoyed the nightly \"mini-disco\"/variety show. We took a snorkeling trip with Mayan Adventure, which was lots of fun...bring insect repellent! Would definitely stay there again.

We had a room that overlooked the sea and pool, that is a miracle. all the years I have requested a sea/pool view at different hotels, and never got one, this year I had the two. The rooms were kept spotless, clean linen and towels everyday, and a lovely towel decoration and choccies left on your pillow. We went on the \"swim with dolphins\" trip, which was out of this world, that has been my dream for years, but don't buy the DVD, it doesn't work even if they say they have converted it to European format, and at $59, it's a rip off. But that is nothing to do with the Tucan, so this is not a complaint, just a gripe with Dolphin Discovery. I agree with most comments about the cocktails, I think i could drink 10 of them and still be sober, but the Gin and Tonic nearly knocked my head off! The beds were hard, but i found them comfortable, and was ready for bed after a long day basking in glorious sunshine, or speed boating, snorkelling, swimming with dolphins etc! Away from the hotel, if you want to purchase gifts for home, I suggest you get your bartering head on, as I felt very intimidated in the shops, as there are no prices on anything, the Mexicans love to gamble with you, and I just couldn't do this, which was sad, because I saw a lot of things I wanted to buy, but didn't have the nerve to stand there and bargain with them.

With two children 7 and 12 , one wanted to be in the pool and the oldest always wanted to be at the beach. The beach bar was nice, because we could enjoy adult bevergages and the kids could order virgin drinks. There was also a seperate pool where the staff and guest played water polo and water volleyball. The beach was big and very beautiful. I always felt very safe on the beach and in the resort. We watch over our kids very close, but they soon made friends and we felt very secure at the resort to let them roam and have fun. The people working at the Tucan were an absolute delight.

Our room was clean and located close to the pool and beach. We were traveling with another couple with young children and we specifically asked for rooms close together and convenient to the children's pool. They honored my request. I emailed a week in advance with the request and suggest others needing special room requests do the same because the front desk staff do not assign the rooms, another department does that and they can not change it without going through a supervisor. The service was good. I suggest tipping favorite bartenders and waitresses. The buffet places were never crowded and food was good and a very good selection to choose. Our favorite ala carte rest. was the Japanese place. I suggest booking your ala carte the day you arrive because they do fill up early. The beach was clean and the water was warm and calm on most days. The pool was huge and the water felt great. The activites staff tend to have the activites on one end of the pool. If you want peace and quiet the pool is large enough for you to be on the other end of it and away from all the noise. The reason we choose Playa del Carmen this year is first of all we wanted a change as we have been to Cancun before. The second reason was that we wanted to get away from the teenage crowd in Cancun. I guess I am getting old, but my idea of a good time is not watching a bunch of teenagers get drunk and stagger around. I thought we were getting away from all of that. On our third day at the Tucan a group of teenagers arrived. They were loud and it seemed they use the 'F' word at least one time in every sentence. It is a shame these kids didn't know any better than to shout and curse around young children. The resort was large enough to stay clear of what we so endearlingly referred to as \"The Texans.\" They were the only young group at the resort and their presence was known to everyone.

This hotel is amazing and it did not dissapoint us one bit. We traveled with First Choice and the flight was great even after 10hours!!! We landed at Cancun airpot, going through immigration was pleasent enough with lots of smiles rather than interigation you get when you arrive in America. We were directed to outside airport where our rep was waiting in a small area surounded by mexican men trying to grab your cases so you can tip them to take your luggage, my husband had to prise his hand of his case. Dont bother with them as the coach is only a meter away! It took around an hour to arrive at Tucan we were the second dropoff all the hotels in Playacar are pretty much next to each other. The Tucan has a grand entrance with a guard and barrier at front. We drove to the front lobby and the whole coach gasped with amazement. Wow what an enterance, the lobby is open plan with massive statues of mayans and amazon parrotts with a grand reception. CHECK IN: About 12 or so people arrived to check in, i've never checked in so quickly before. We were lined up along the reception desk and our forms were all ready so we could all sign at once and be told together about the Tucan. We were told we could leave our luggage at reception and the bellboys would bring it to us. We decided to wheel our cases to our rooms ourself save on tipping!! ROOMS: Again WOW, Big spacious rooms, air conditioned well with a ceiling fan. We had 2 double beds, which at first was a bit of a dissapointment being married but soon was a big blessing as I could keep the covers all to myself!! The beds are firm but I loved them slept like a baby everynight my husband is a big bloke and he enjoyed the firmness to. The bathroom has the best walk in shower EVER. Its like a wet room really with 2 shower heads one is fixed to the wall the other is detatchable, this is great for us girls if you want a shower without getting your hair wet and helps when shaving your legs! The room also had a mini bar stocked with bottled water, cans of Sprite, Fanta, Diet Coca Cola and Coca Cola, Fizzy water and Bottled Beer. This was stocked up most days for us it also came in handy to keep our after sun cool. The rooms were made everyday for us and there was always a towel animal waiting on our return the maidman also cleared our stuff up too bless him! WARNING! There are no drawers and they give you hangers but they are big wooden ones with no hooks so you cant hung up dresses or skirts so bring some hooky hangers!! TUCAN: The hotel has 2 sides that meet at the MASSIVE pool. You can use both sides for eats and drinks. There is a jungle walkway between them to the pool full of Peacocks, funny birds. Monkeys, Flamingos, Tortoises, Parrotts and Iguanas!!! We loved the wildlife all animals were looked after well. The pool is always busy but plenty of chairs, they are quite packed closely together. We prefered the beach to laze on but only 2 steps away from pool if we fancyed a dip there. On the beach they have a few Palm Palapa's if they are taken there are 1000's of beds and you can borrow umberellas from the towel hut free! And you can borrow towels everyday from Towel Hut so no need to take towels!! FOOD: Yummy bring elastic waistbands!! The buffet is amazing with fresh salads, pastas, chips, meat, roast potatos, veg,fajitas etc etc etc lots of fruit and cakes and desserts too!! Sometimes we went up twice if not 3 times for more as so delicious. You also get 6 sittings at a la carte with F. Choice we went to the Italian twice as yummy, Steak house twice as yummy too and Mexican this was ok! The italian had lasagne, carbonara, veal, ravioli all waitor service. Steak house had Rib Eye, Sirloin, BBQ Chicken, BBQ Ribs again waitor service and Mexican had Beef Tacos, Special Tacos. The best was Italian my husband got 2 main courses as he enjoyed the carbonara so much!! DRINKS: The beer is a local XX brand, my hubbie didnt really like it but put up with it. There were cocktails a plenty. There is a menu but you can ask for pretty much anything. My faves Pina Colada, Coco Loco, Margarita, Banand Daquiri, Chi Chi (Pina colada with vodka & Strawberry) Conga with vodka. Most of the cocktails were quite weak on alcohol but they tasted good and you could have loads of em!! They had Smirnoff vodka if you wanted strong! You also get coca cola on tap which is great. There are 3 main bars we used the lobby bar and beach bar and beach buffet bar, oh yeah also the fantastic Pool bar. The pool bar is a seperate pool you have 3 sections with tables and chairs in the water, this is great and can be quite noisy with the Americans! TRIPS: First Choices excersions are really pricey so we hired our owm car and saved a fortune!! We visited Tulum, Coba and Xel-Ha. To enter Coba and Tulum is only about $4 each \u00a32! Coba is brilliant we had a guided tour and climbed over 100 steps to top of temple, We decided to go here rather than Chichen Itza as you cannot climb Chitchen anymore. We also swam in cenotes by Coba to. XEL-HA is AMAZING. It cost about $39 basic enterance or $69 All inclusive which gives you snorkeling gear, lockers, towels, food and drinks and ice-cream. We had the basic but next time worth All Inc. Its basically a massive clear lagoon with huge fish you can swim within. I'm not a strong swimmer but the give you massive rubber rings to sit in which you can lean on and look through as they are clear, good if you dont like snorkelling. You also get free life jackets if you want so you be lazy and float along!! Its such a clean well organised park you can swim with dolphins here and go in a ocean dive thing where you wear a submersablwe helmet and able to walk on sea floor!!!! These are extra but well worth it! LOCATION: Tucan is 5 min walk to PlayaCar shops, Its a complex with a few souviner shops pleasent enough, We walked to Playa Del Carmen one day took about 30 mins to walk but we were only strolling and there are GORGEOUS houses to look at on the way. Playa Del Carmen is $5 by taxi each way we only walked once!! Playa Del Carmen is HUGE. 5th avenue took us ages to walk along we did'nt even reach the end as our feet hurt so bad! There are 1000's of shops and bars and restaurants. We liked the Swing Bar which had swings instead of stools and Senor Frogs by the beach! MONEY: You can use dollars or Mexican Peso's to only worry about one currency i would take mexican pesos as they are exepted EVERYWHERE and this is normally what you get change in even if you give dollars. We loved the Tucan and are so tempted to book for next year!!!!", "Date": "June 23, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Des Moines, Iowa", "Title": "\u201cTrue Paradise!!\u201d", "Author": "kalepet", "ReviewID": "UR5362830", "Content": "Before booking our vacation to Mexico we read numerous reviews on trip advisor. We found the information to be very helpful with deciding where to stay. The recommendations of the Iberostar Tucan all seemed to be good except for a few. My husband and I (both in our late 20's) stayed at the Tucan from June 10th-17th. The following is a run down of our experience. Prior to departing for Mexico, I emailed Iberostar to put in a request for a room close to the pool and ocean. We were very pleased with the location of our room. We stayed in the 1200 building. We requested a king size bed and that is what we got. The room was ready for us when we arrived (which was at 12pm.) I guess most rooms are not ready until late in the day so we were very happy to be able to check in right away. Gloria (at the front desk) spoke good english and was very kind. Everything was easy from the start. My husband and I speak a little spanish. I wish I had learned a few more phrases prior to our vacation. It would have made communication with the locals (and the majority of the hotel staff) a little easier. Rooms- The beds are hard. I tried to bounce on one and was unsuccessful. We were so tired at the end of the day that the stiff bed didn't bother us. My husband and I drink a lot of water. Only four bottles are supplied each day. We tipped the housekeeper approx 3-5 dollars a day. We left little notes requesting additional water. Most days we would have a fridge full of water upon returning from the beach. Our room was ready for us everyday before noon. It is true that the fridges don't keep the beverages cold. For us it didn't matter. A little piece of advice. In the evening the door is opened to the roof of all of the buildings. You get a great view of the hotel, ocean and surrounding areas. Very beautiful. Food- Book your ala carte restrauants right away. You can always try to change or cancel at a later time. We ate at the Jappenese (Bonsi) restrauant and the Italian. Both were pretty good. We were unable to find a day or time to accomodiate us for the Mexican restrauant. The buffets were also good (no air conditioning, but it stayed fairly cool.) We stayed at the Tucan side but found the atmosphere of the Quetsal side more pleasing. It seemed to be less busy and not as many people. It was a nice balance. The breakfast buffet is your best bet. Always a large selection. I am not a breakfast eater but had to change my ways during the trip. I kind of got tired of the snack bar food and evening buffet food. Overall, it was good and a nice variety. The staff at the restrauants are professional and try hard to please you. Bars- I agree with one of the previous reviews about the pool bar being kind of gross. It is a fun, party atmosphere. It gets pretty full around 3-6pm. It is a nice way to meet people and ask questions. We met some great people while at the pool bar. I guess it is a personal preference. The beach bar is awsome. Very close to the beach. We tipped generously at the bars. You do not have to tip but it is a nice gesture. One of the bartenders named \"Rafeal\" (beach bar) was awsome. I would tip one dollar for each drink. I ordered a lot of daquari's. He would fill my straw with Tequila each time I tipped. Beach- All I can say is that it is amazing. We could always get a chair (anytime of day.) You can check out an umbrealls from the towel building. It was nice to have the option of shade. The water is so beautiful. Pool- The only pool we went into was the pool bar. All of our other time was spent on the beach. Other helpful tips- 1. Do not bring your digital camera parasailing. They bring you out on a jet ski to the boat that you parasail from. You may get wet. That is all I will comment on that. 2. If you lose your wallet while in Mexico, ask the front desk of the hotel if they have a representative to help you file the paperwork and locate the buildings to do so. The \"tourist information buildings\" staff mainly spanish speaking employees. This can make things a little complicated if you do not speak the language. 3. Carry small bills while traveling. I would recommend twenty dollar bills or smaller. Many of the cab drivers and locals do not have change for large bills. Overall, we would stay at this hotel again in a heart beat. We hope to travel to Playa again in the future and when we do we will stay at the Iberostar Tucan.", "Date": "June 19, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Surrey, England", "Title": "\u201c*****************Absolutely Fantastic!!!!!******************\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5360290", "Content": "We've just got back from a 2 week stay at the Tucan and had an absolutely amazing time, we could not fault the holiday AT ALL.

If you get a chance to go on the Speed Boat Tour, do it, it was so much fun and gets you off the resort for half a day and you get to see quite a lot of Cancun and you actually get to drive the boats round the mangroves and out at sea which is so much fun. There was so much choice for food in the buffet, some nights it was hard to decide what to eat! All the restaurants are nice, especially the steak house, where you can have a proper fillet steak and sit down and get served. The animals are amazing to see wondering around, lots of great photo opportunities! I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a relaxing retreat, away from the hustle and bustle of Cancun and all the huge high storey hotels. We met some really nice people and made some good friends. One couple we got talking to had been back to the Tucan 13 times!!!! They had stayed at all the Iberostars and said this one was the best.

That surprised us but the Tucan side beachside lunch restaurant had an extra salad bar the other side did not so keep that in mind. If you go to the spa for a massage, look closely at the books, there is one of the VIP spa services binder that has a page the others do not. It lists combo packs you can buy that offer you great savings - for instance I got a relaxing 50 min massage coupled with a 30 min after sun treeatment for 110.00 dollars. That was 80 minutes total. Mu husband spent 155.00 for an 80 min hot stone massage. The best activity was Chichen-ha , the zip lines, It was great fun but you do not need to wear sneakers - just some kind of sandlas that have an ankle strap. That was the second time we went there, and to the Tucan, and really enjoyed this activity. Isla de Muerjes looks pretty sad - it was beaten up by the hurrican pretty bad. The trip there was not worth the time away from your resort. The resort offered better food and amenities. Wouldn't do that again. Our room was always clean and any requests like two coffees, or more water, were always obliged. I left a couple of dollars a day on our vanity with a note for Housekeeping and never had a problem.

We were traveling with a family group of 9 including our three kids (18, 14 & 10). We found that the hotel suited our needs perfectly. There was always something to do. We ate breakfast everyday in the buffet and there was always something to choose from even for our picky breakfast eaters. They were always satisified. As far as lunch goes, the grill at the beach was perfect. There were always burgers and hot dogs as well as chips with your choise of Salsa, guacamole or Queso along with various other selections and then you could top it off with ice cream from the ice cream bar. We had dinner every night but the last one in the buffet simply because we did not want to be tied to any specific plans. There was plenty to choose from and no one left hungry. The steak house was great. All nine of us were pleased with our dinners, even the vegitarian in the bunch found plenty to eat. We never had trouble getting a drink either at a bar or on the beach. We would also sit in the lobby in the evenings after dinner and there was always someone coming around and taking orders. Just a few dollar bills are a great incentive for attention We only made two excursions, one to Chichen Itza and one to swim with the dolphins. Both were great. The trip to Chichen Itza was all day and I highly reccommend that you take a couple of bottles of water with you. There is no place to purchase any there except at the entrance and it was extremly hot. However, in spite of the heat, all three kids say that this was their favorite thing. There were always activities going on somewhere and our kids made some friends by participating and then it was even more fun for them to have someone to go along. The girls enjoyed learning to snorkel and even there was little marine life at the beach they still had a great time looking for some. The beach volleyball was also well run and the activites people did a great job of keeping this under control and entertaining. Our room was very nice, a great size and was always clean and cool. We had little towel sculptures on the bed everyday which the 10 year old thought was just the best. Always fresh towels and plenty of soap and shampoo. ( the hair dryer was a little weak but worked). We were in building 12 which is convenient to the beach and pool but something of a hike to the lobby. I did notice, as another review stated, numerous cigerette butts and straws in the sand. There is no excuse for that because there is an ash can about every 20 yard around the beach. I saw several people, mosly women I have to admit, heading down to the water with a cigerette in hand only to reach down and put them out in the sand just before they spalshed into the water. They are porbably the same people that thow their butts out the car window! All in all I would say that the Tucan was perfect for us and we would definatly return if a Mexican vacation is ever on the itenerary again.

Take this review for what it is worth. If you are a first timer, I would have a list for your travel agent or contact the resort directly so you know what to expect. Better yet, talk to someone who has already been there. From all the guests who we talked to, they thought that the Iberostar Toucan was great compared to others they had been to in the same price range. Posiitves: Beautiful place, clean, food was decent if you picked and choosed and my kids (10 and 13) loved all the activites and entertainment. The nightly shows were a lttle goofy for our tastes, but the kids loved them and we took that time to take walks on the beach and hang out at one of the lobby bars. Staff was courtesous and helpful. Beach was larger than most and the pool was big enough to have room for all. When we were there, there were plenty of chairs but we had to lay claim to the special thatched huts at midnight the night before (put out towels and a baseball hat that was missing the next day). Negs: I only drink wine and was extremely disappointed in the ones they had. Only a table red and white and they were extremely bad (really, really bad). It would have been nice to have a few extra choices (even to pay for). The other liquor was not anywhere near rack or top shelf unless you asked for it. Even then, it wasn't at all of the bars. Smirnoff was the best vodka and Cuervo the best tequila and hard to find. If I were a drinker, I would have been disappointed in the amount of liquor being poured per drink. I saw several people request \"doubles\" and still getting no more than a shot in 16 0z tumbler. If you like weak, frozen drinks, this was your place. If you like a nice stiff drink with a decent liquor, bring and make your own. The waiters were always very agressive at getting rid of your near-empty plates and drinks. This got to be pretty iritating. You could only take a bike out if it was with one of the guided tours. Disappointing. My wife and I looked forward to taking a few rides on our own, when we wanted to. Also, bikes were beat or hard to ride (get an air compressor for the tires). We took two tours, one to Tulum and the other to snorkel. Both were enjoyable but overpriced for the experience. It took more time for the bus to drive to each hotel to pick people up than to actually do the acitivty. For the all-day snorkeling tour, we probably spent and total of 2 1/2 to 3 hours of actual time in the water and 3-4 hours in the van. We were picked up at 9:00 am and back by 2:30. Not a full day to me. Question before you book. Playa Del Carma was interesting but you get tired of everyone calling you to their shops, restaurants etc... Its really neat for about 10 minutes and then it starts getting annoying. Watch out for the timeshare guys. If someone is being too friendly, you don't want to talk to them. They will follow you down the street. Next time, we would probably stay away from town, just because it is so irritating (Playa Del Carma Visitors Bureau, take note). Extra activities on the beach were there such as jet skis and parasailing. Pretty expensive, based on what we have paid for in other places (even in the US). Bring plenty of cash or visit an ATM down the road. Places like this did not take credit cards. Also, the ferry to Cozumel only took cash (about $25.00 per round trip), so be ready. Also, vendors and stores were happy to take your dollars, but only give you change in Pesos. Tell them you don't want that before you make the transaction. If I did not have kids, I would probably try one of the all adult only resorts. Maybe the food, drinks and entertainment would be more grown-up. This was a nice family vacation and I would recommend it just as that and nothing more.

Just returned several hours ago and feel I must give my opinion on this hotel. We had 7 people in 3 rooms and we actually stayed on the Quetzal side even tho we booked with Apple. I emailed a building request a month in advance but did not get the building I requested. I have to disagree with all the wonderful rave reviews on this hotel. Last trip ro Riviera Maya we stayed at the Barcelo Maya and we all preferred this hotel to Quetzal. The first few days things were OK but it seems like once we filled out the survey card at dinner one nite, things went downhill. Out of 7 people, 4 of us got sick. Not exactly sure of the cause but we all felt fine until the 3rd day of our trip after eating at the Italian restaurant. Two of the three room keys did not work out of the clear blue on two different days and it's a hike to the lobby in a bathing suit to get the problem corrected. The worst part was the bugs. If you have a bug phobia definitely book a different hotel. I realize the jungle atmosphere is the attraction and we enjoyed the critters outside of our room but not inside. One room had the little ant-like bugs all over the day bed and dresser area. The worst part was on the last nite when my husband noticed a cockroach crawling on the wall. It was huge! Needless to say we left a light on after that and later on, my husband woke up and swatted something off his neck. Sure enough, another cockroach. If it wasn't for the fact we were leaving the next morning, I defintely would have requested another room. It was gross. We shoved a towel in the crack under the door thinking this might help but I still found another roach (at least this one was dead) on the bathroom floor in the morning and another live one stuck in the towel under the door. The air conditioning didn't cool very well in my room and there was water dripping from the ceiling and a musty smell and mildew around the light where the leak was. The staff did work very hard but I have to say the front desk people were not very friendly. The staff cleaning the rooms were more friendly. The Star Friends work very hard and yes, the shows are cheesy but they make a great attempt at keeping everyone entertained. Breakfast at the buffet was the best. Dinner buffet had a large selection but the Japanese restaurant was the best. Beach was nice but sand had a lot of sharp rocks so be careful walking barefoot. Also there seemed to be a lot of straws, butts, and other garbage in the sand. There were others who had visited this hotel in the past who commented that this hotel is not what is was a couple years back. I am not a high maintenance room service kind of person but maybe due the the rave reviews I read here, I expected much better. If you are a couple traveling alone, don't be surprised to be awakend by screaming children in the same building. Could just be the parents were stupid and left the door open with a kid screaming at 6 am. Also be very careful while walking on the slippery marble floors. My husband walked out of our room and turned the corner and slipped right in a puddle of water that had spread across the whole floor. The staff did clean it up very quickly I must say.

I would like to add a few of my perceptions of the resort from the point-of-view of a single mom traveling with a teenage son. As a military member, I have traveled around the world, with and without my son. I/we have stayed at hotels ranging from small European hostels to 5 star resorts in the Middle East. I think I can put up with just about any discomfort, except being treatly rudely and poorly by the staff. Unfortunately, that is what happened at the Iberostar Tucan. But first, the positives: We absolutely adored the physical aspects of the resort: the pool and beach were absolutely beautiful. We only went on a few outside excursions (Xcaret and Tulum) as we wanted to spend as much time as possible just hanging out pool-side and beach-side. The food was great for a teenage boy--he never got tired of anything! We especially enjoyed the \"jungle\" area between the Tucan and the Quetzal; I could spend hours watching the Tucan and the Flamingos! The housekeeping staff were great; quickly fixing any problems with the room and respecting the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign. On the downside: I made clear to the resort beforehand that we were a mother-son combo, NOT a Mr. and Mrs. Despite this, we were given a room with a King bed. My son (6 foot, 5 inches tall) was relegated to the sofa--not incredibly comfortable for him. We asked on arrival to move, but were told the resort was full. We then asked for sheets and a blanket for the sofa; we finally received one sheet on the fourth night. He ended up sleeping wrapped up in the bedspread from my bed. As a single woman, I distinctly noticed the lack of service in the restaraunts and bars. The waiters rarely offered us additional drinks, and making eye-contact with a waiter in order to make a drink request was an exercise in futility. I did notice that tables with adult males present had no such problems. Except for beer, I could not even tell there was any alcohol in any of my bar drinks. The guy at the pool-side towel place was totally rude unless you were a teenage girl in a bikini. I routinely saw him handing out \"free\" towels to younger women, but we had to pay a $10 charge when someone stole my son's towel. Make sure you guard your stuff at the pool and beach; some people seem to think your personal float, swim goggles, or snorkel/masks are theirs for the taking. My main complaint, however, is for the staff at the front desk. Rude, unhelpful, and downright spiteful are just a few of the words I can attribute to them. Examples: I sustained a minor injury one day, and went to the front desk to request several band-aids (I tripped and essentially tore-off my big toenail). My foot covered in blood, I was told by the guy at reception that they did not have any bandages, and that I \"should go to the store and buy them\" myself. I could barely walk, much less go into town ($10 taxi ride round-trip). The doctor at the resort was very rude, and I walked out of the on-site clinic without care. The only person concerned and helpful was the Apple Representative, who offered to go into town to purchase bandaging supplies for me. Lesson: bring a small first aid kit or face spending lots of time and money for simple supplies. At check-out, I was told that we owed the resort $10 for the towel that was stolen at the pool. The staff member became very belligerent when I at first refused to pay. I asked to speak to the manager/supervisor, but was told he \"was too busy to talk to me.\" I never did get to speak to someone in charge, despite waiting in the lobby for over an hour. So essentially, for the cost of several bandaids and a cheap towel, the resort lost a potential repeat customer. All in all, it was a beautiful resort and my son enjoyed himself immensely--that was the purpose of the trip, so I guess mission accomplished. However, I WOULD NOT recommend this resort to single moms or single women traveling without an adult male in their group.

It was infinitely better, and made all the difference! Our main complaint, however, was that the service DIDN'T COMPARE to any of the other resorts we've stayed in. NOT EVEN CLOSE. The activities staff seemed to be especially good, but the service otherwise was perfunctory and a touch glib. Also, we'd never stayed anywhere where the restaurants weren't air-conditioned, and that took some getting used to. Some nights we rushed through dinner as my husband couldn't stand the humidity. We took some rather nice clothes for dinner, but never used them, because of the heat in the restaurants. Some of the specialty restaurants were AC'd, but eating in the AC'd Japanese reestaurant, which was pretty good, was the most unpleasantly hot eating experience of all. After a few days, we decided to just go with the flow. Our room was wonderful, the food was actually quite good, the work-out room had free weights and was comfortable, and the pool and beach were fantastic. The only disappointment was the service, as I've said. The wait staff came across as a harried, unhappy bunch. We realize now that the staff is probably treated better or paid better at the Riu's, because they seem genuinely delighted to be there. Would we go back? Probably not. But a nice place nonetheless.

Stayed there for 7 nites. I must say that this hotel is beautiful. Has great landscaping, great pool, really cool lobby, and an awesome beach. There is a little jungle where you can see wildlife everyday! Iguanas, other lizards, peacocks, birds, ducks, monkeys, wild boars, wild roosters and hens, flamingos, turtles, and swans! The room itself is standard. Very need and clean. Everything you want in a room. The only thing I really wanted was a bathtub. They only had showers in their rooms unless you get the presidential suite. Food - I must say I expected more from the food. Alot of people say it's great. I just didn't see it. Everything was pretty much mass production. Buffets every day. I guess that's what you get from All-inclusive. However, alot of it was not good at all. I really wanted some quality mexican food but did not get it there. You're better off going out to 5th ave in downtown and eating a Karen's or something. The only great part of it was that it hotel food was FREE! The ice cream near the beach/pool was also great. Awesome selection. Beach - For those beach lovers!!! This place has a very beautiful beach. Nice sand, pretty clean expect for the smokers out there who litter. Hardly any seaweed. And a great open view of the ocean with the clear turquoise water shining. They have plenty of beach chairs for everyone and you can get your own umbrella each day from the towel area. Service - For such a great hotel, we didn't get great service. Maybe b/c this place is alot bigger. Not sure but the staff was hit or miss. Many of the ones who coordinated activities were great. However, I wasn't pleased with the waiters from the buffet restaurants or our room maid. We always had something missing the next day. Whether it be shampoo, towels, replenishment of water.....We'd call room service and they'd bring anything we wanted immediately, but we shouldn't have to right? Activities - Please make sure you do not go to the Ruins (Chichin Itza) This is highly overrated. All you do is bake in the sun and walk to death. The quality of the ruins is nothing to be amazed abt. You want to see great artwork from stones, go to China and see the great wall or something. Instead, try Xcarat which is an awesome park for everyone. Also, there are plenty of snorkeling sites. Depending on your preference. And we did an ATV tour by Jungle Jim. That was pretty fun. Last, there is always downtown. 5th ave has tons of shops and restaurants. Gotta stop by at least once. As for the hotel itself, there are dance classes, bike tours, jungle tours, water sports, beach sports, and much more. Ok, by now i hope you have an idea if you want to go or not. Overall, I'd reccommend this hotel to families, big groups, and maybe honeymooners. It's really beautiful once again and the location is nice.

We were in the Tucan in Block 18 which is well away from the beach, but it is quiet and that is what we asked for. We couldn't have had a better room. The wildlife was amazing, there were peacocks, parrots, monkeys, flamingoes, swans, iguanas, chickens and a funny looking rodent which goes by the name of Cereke and looks a bit like a very large guinea pig. The food was excellent and there were 5 speciality restaurants including Mexcian, Japanese, Steak, Italian and Tropical, although we preferred to eat at the sumptuous buffet most nights. The pool was to die for. It was very large and was never crowded although there seemed to be many groups of Americans there who sat around the steps of the pool all day. The hotel staff were all very friendly and could not do enough to look after us and make our stay a memorable one. There was plenty of sporty entertainment during the day and also entertainment in the evening. The only thing which really did annoy us was the fact that many guests reserved beds around the pool when there were notices everywhere telling people not to do this. There were always beds available even at 9 o'clock in the morning. If you wanted a palapa you had to be up at 6 o'clock in the morning.

Honestly, not everything was great but somethings were fabulous. This is our story... We had 2 regular rooms and 1 junior suite booked. I had emailed ahead to request that all the rooms be in the same building (near beach/pool) and we would forfeit the suite, if need be, to get this request. Upon check-in we were given 1 junior suite and the PRESIDENTIAL SUITE!!! This was a 4 room mansion with 2 large balconies including outdoor jacuzzi, 3 bathrooms and a small kitchen!!! All facing the ocean, I might add.That's a fabulous part. HOWEVER! Shortly after staying in the suite, we clearly noticed a sewer smell. It was a smell that was all over the resort. My problem wasn\"t with the smell (who knows why or how it was happening) but it took several hours of waiting and many more phone calls to get someones attention to correct it. Let's just say that the maintenance man in the grounds got to know all of us VERY VERY WELL. He was very nice but I can't say the same for the front desk people. Maid service was great...there everyday in a timely manner and did a good job. We tipped her a dollar a day for everyperson in the room. The beach and pool area was one of the prettiest we have ever seen!!! The water is a beautiful shade of aqua, no rocks, very little seaweed, shallow enough to walk quite a distance and we even got a waitress to deliver drinks to us (tipping really helps here). But, the beach chairs are thee most uncomfortable I've ever had. We all commentted on this. Was glad to leave those things behind when we left. The food...was...just okay. I knew going into this trip that it probably wasn't gonna be great, and it wasn't. The specialty resturants were fair (japanese & steak house). Honestly, the steak house reminded me of Ponderosa in America. But the service was very good. The drinks were great, a wide variety, not too strong but that was fine with us. Some bartenders were much better than others. Find the ones you like and stick with them. We didn't do any of the activities so can't comment on that. The entertainment was just fair. If I had to compare their entertainment to one on a cruise ship, the cruise would win without even trying. If we were disappointed about anything, it would have been this. in our opinion, It just wasn't that good. We found that their wasn't alot to do there at night. The disco was mostly empty, most of the night. The people that work there, for the most part, all all very friendly and accommodating. The common areas of the resort are very clean and well maintained. Misc. things we noticed, the chips and salsa/gaucamole are really good. As is the marinaded chicken at the grill during the day. The pina colada's are great. Overall, I'd say it was a positive experience. Yeah, we're glad we went there but next year ...we're gonna try something else. P.S. In America, we're use to smoking sections or NO smoking areas. This does not exist here. Smokers are EVERYWHERE. We didn't see alot of families. Mostly couples and many are from europe.

It\u2019s a beautiful resort and we really enjoyed our stay. There are a lot of well thought out reviews here on tripadvisor, I\u2019ll try to provide a different perspective about the experience. I would like to point out that the Iberostar Quetzal and Tucan are the exact same facility. The resort has two sides that are mirror images of one another. It doesn\u2019t make sense that Quetzal is rated lower than the Tucan, they are exactly the same. Timing: We went in mid-May, an excellent time to take a vacation PDC. Yes, we pulled our son from school for a week, but we do that most years. Mid May is between the party crowds of spring break and summer crowds and heat. The resort was not very crowded and the atmosphere was very relaxed. I read a rant from someone who visited during spring break and complained that there were too many college kids partying at a beach resort and he went on to single out Americans. This makes as much sense as going to Bavaria during October fest and complaining that the Germans are a bunch of drunks. For the price of a hotel in Daytona a college student can fly to PDC and stay in an incredible all inclusive resort with all the food and booze included in one price. Where would you go if you were a college student on spring break? Spring breakers may not always be pretty, but it is a right of passage for college students throughout the world. We wouldn\u2019t go to Daytona during spring break, nor would we go to a location like Cancun or PDC. Facility: I don\u2019t recall anyone writing a bad review about the resort itself, it is beautiful. The jungle setting in the middle of the resort was a real adventure for our boy; he was constantly exploring the resort. But the resort layout has an ancillary benefit. The resort is wider and more spread out than the other resorts we visited, therefore, the beach front is wider. Walking the beach you\u2019ll notice that the Iberostar beach is wider and less crowded than the Riu resorts north of the facility. The Riu beach front also shares with the other Riu resort across the road, they were noticeably more crowded. The Iberostar has large thatch umbrellas all around the pool and on the beach so there is plenty of shade. The Riu has umbrellas around the pool, but they are not as large and not as many and they don\u2019t have any on the beach. Iberostar\u2019s swim up bar is completely separate from the main pool and it sits isolated in a little valley. It was lively at times but it doesn\u2019t dominate the pool area. I\u2019m not trying to pick on Riu, those facilities are also beautiful and they have a good reputation. Food: We found two extremes about the food reviews on Tripadvisor; it\u2019s either the best food ever or it was the most horrid garbage ever served; it is neither. Food is relative to the individual and reading other peoples thoughts of what constitutes good or bad food doesn\u2019t work for us. You need to understand what you\u2019re buying into; this is an all inclusive resort that at peak times serves about a thousand people at each meal. This isn\u2019t the Cloisters or an upscale Scottsdale golf resort that costs 3 times or more than a PDC resort. Even the theme restaurants can\u2019t make every entr\u00e9e and side individually prepared for each guest; they\u2019d have to double or triple their rates to work at that scale. Much of the food is prepared ahead of time, some of it is good, some is very good, and some is pretty bad. If it will ruin your vacation if every meal isn\u2019t upscale and perfect you should reconsider you destination, you\u2019re unlikely to find what you\u2019re looking for in PDC. If you keep an open mind you\u2019ll eat very well and the vast majority will love the food. Rooms: Rooms were fine, nothing super special, but not bad either. We found the rooms very quiet and that is very important to us. We had neighbors with two girls but we never heard a sound. We insisted on a top floor so we can\u2019t speak to sounds of people walking or thumping around. You can hear the outside noise such as the peacocks, and roasters (yes roasters) and other birds. If you\u2019re a light sleeper you may stir in the morning hours when the wildlife gets going. We were in building 11 down by the beach, that is a quiet location, but walking around I think most buildings would be fine. There is a little noise from the evening entertainment, but it\u2019s just for short periods where the music might get loud as the show goes on, by 10PM it\u2019s over. Staff: The people working at the facility did an excellent job and work extremely hard. We had some issues, but it\u2019s not worth hashing it out here. Things happen; if something isn\u2019t quite right you should be able to get it worked out. Smile and don\u2019t let it ruin your vacation. We saw very few people tipping. The resort employees\u2019 work very hard and we felt that tipping was appropriate. I\u2019m a very generous tipper and over the course of the week we probably tipped about what we paid for taxis too/from the airport. You don\u2019t have to tip everyone or for every service or drink you receive, but if you keep a handful of 10 Peso coins they\u2019ll go a long way. Consider that you spend a few thousand on a vacation; it shouldn\u2019t break you to show a little generosity to those that wait on you hand and foot. Overall it was a great vacation and we really loved the Iberostar Tucan. We especially loved the people; they take great pride in the resort and PDC.

This was our first visit to the IB* Tucan but not our first vacation to the Riviera Maya. We have been vacationing in the Yucatan Peninsula for the past ten years, mostly Cancun but some visits south of Cancun and this vacation is at the top of our list. We flew scheduled air via Continental and the flights, both ways, were on time and hassle free. We used Funjet for our room reservations and Funjet was a joy to work with. We arrived at the IB* Quetzal and we were greeted by the bell man. We made our dinner reservations when we arrived. Guest Services are a great group of people and made making reservations a snap. We found if we had any needs ; directions, dining hours etc.. Guest Services were always there to help us out. We had requested , by e mail, a specific type of room and we were assigned a beautiful room in building 21, close to the beach. One problem with the room, which had nothing to do with IB*, was; our room abutted the Riu Yucatan property and there was loud music emanating from the Riu Yucatan's disco from 11:30 PM to 2:00 AM. I mean; this music was LOUD. It wasn't that distant drone one could fall off to sleep to. I could hear every word of every song as if the speakers were on our balcony. I called down to the front desk and a very considerate and kind young lady, from reception, understood the situation and apologized for the noise. Here in lies the attitude of the IB* Tucan. She was apologizing because of her concern for us. She and Iberostar have absolutely no control over the complete disregard by Riu of their neighboring guests. The next day, the front desk manager and her staff alleviated the problem and provided us with a similar room on the Tucan side. As far as the rooms are concerned; clean, dry and well maintained with a great walk in shower.The front desk at the IB* Tucan are very professional but at the same time, very personable and their guests are their first priority. If we had any concerns the front desk took care of the situation, pronto. With thier help , the rest of our vacation was perfect. We are pretty much beach bums and rarely used the pool. The beach is very nice and the water was great. No Sea Lice problems for us and did not hear of any. We were always able to find a palapa (I'm an early riser) and one day I even found one at noontime. The first few days had red flags flying but we were still able to go into the water. The rest of our trip had yellow flags and there were a lot of people enjoying the beautiful Caribbean Sea. We did notice people reserving palapas at the pool moreso than on the beach. During our stay the same people would spread three floats over nine chairs, next to the towel hut. A new twist to the towel game. Since we are beach bums it was no skin off our noses but I'm sure some people took notice. The towel hut opens at 8:00 AM. and closes at 7:00PM The grounds crew do a great job of keeping the resort clean and well manicured. The setting of the resort is beautiful.Although the resort was close to 100% occupancy , it never seemed crowded at any time of the day or night and this includes the restauants and the buffets. We ate at four a la carte restaurants: Japanese, Mexican, Tropical and the La Marimba Steak House . The food was very good and the service was also very good.We did tip and the tips were appreciated. We also enjoyed both buffets which had plenty of choices. We pretty much tried eveything, from soup to nuts, and never had any intenstinal problems.At any time of the day or night a snack can be found. We used only bottled water for everything from the coffee maker to brushing our teeth. We are not alcohol drinkers so I cannot comment on the drinks. One caution ; the coke machine at the Tropical restaurant probably needs to be replaced. During our stay they worked on it a couple of times but the mix is nasty. The Coke at the bar in the Tropical was fine. When we got our drinks, for the beach , we would get them at the La Marimba and the mix was fine. There is drink service on the beach. The Entertainment team is excellent. I have read some of the reports on T/A and people would say the entertainment was cheesey or less than Vegas. I guess Carlos Santana and Gloria Estefan were busy the week we were staying there ??? Go figure ! Let me say, I know my music and the band at this resort is very good. They could play anywhere , at any time. The director of the Entertainment team and his co-workers do a great job putting things together. A couple of times, on my afternoon walks, I would stop by and watch the dancers and singers rehearse and they work very hard and it shows in their performances.. My wife and I found the shows to be entertaining, and the children were always incorporated at the beginning of the show. All the shows were family oriented and were done tastefully. The animation staff worked hard around the pool with aerobics , horseshoes, darts and other daily activities. A nice touch was the Star Friends, would sit down and have lunch with the guests at the La Marimba. It gives them a chance to know their guests and vice versa. We met a lot of great people from around the world albeit ; Great Britain, Holland, Germany and of course the good ol' USA. We all had the same goal ; to relax and enjoy our holidays ! This was our second stay at an Iberostar and we can see the Iberostar philosophy is ; family. Everything is geared to the family doing things together. Some folks prefer couples only or adults only and that is great. For my wife and I , we enjoy relaxing and watching the families interact. In nine days we never saw any obnoxios drunken behavior and that was a welcome change from Cancun. For anyone who has vacationed at The IB* Punta Cana/Dominicana would find the IB* Tucan/Quetzal are very much the same. Although we found the service at the IB* Domincana very good; we would have to say the IB* Tucan is a notch above. If you are looking for a great family vacation, then the Iberostar Tucan/Quetzal is the place.

We are all in our late 40s and early 50s and were looking forward to a very relaxing hoilday without family--just ourselves to think of for a change. We weren't disappointed. I had done a lot of research before booking the Tucan, looking for the best setting for what we wanted. It was perfect. We loved the jungle in the center of the property. Although it is clearly a controlled environment, it seemed like we were in the wild with monkeys in the trees and iguanas everywhere--and those little rabbity looking animals who are shy but very cute and appealing and always around. The ocean at the Tucan is the most beautiful tourquoise color and the beach is sandy --unlike some of the other resorts we heard about where there is seaweed and rocks and the swimming is not good. The Tucan beach is perfect for swimming. The pool is also huge and picturesque and we had no trouble getting lounges at either the pool of the beach. We also found the rooms and service to be great. The food was OK--not anything to write home about, there were many choices so we were happy. We especially enjoyed the Italian resturant. The resort is spacious, but not so big as to require a shuttle. Nothing is very far away. We took the Tulum/ Xel Ha excursion which was fun. We didn't see a lot of fish at XelHa. Actually we took the snorkling excursion for one and a half hours from the Tucan and saw many more fish. It cost $26 if you pay in cash and they take you along the coast for about 15 minutes to a beautiful reef. The guide knows where the fish are and where the reef is most beautiful and takes you there. We bought our underwater cameras at Sam's Club in the States--two for $15--down there they are $15 to $20 each so get them before you go. It was just long enough for us, but they also have longer excursions available. The resort is very close to Playa del Carmen where we went to shop. I would advise people to take cash as you get a better deal if you pay in US dollars. Plus it's easier to get your purchase at the lowest price it you show them the cash.

Ladies - BRING YOUR OWN BLOW DRYER - the one in the room doesn't get the job done if you have medium to long hair. Plenty of shampoo, soap and drinks (beer, soda and water). NO hair conditioner so bring some. A/C worked great but we never used it, we opened our balcony door and the constant breeze was perfect. POOL - Never used but it is beautiful, huge and clean. People reserve chairs as early as 5-6 a.m. with towels. There is a swim up bar pool, the large pool and a smaller pool for aqua volleyball/basketball. BEACH - The best. Never had trouble getting lounge chairs or a comfortable spot. If you want a palapa/hut for shade you must get up early and break the rules by putting your towel on the chairs. My favorite part is the beach, if you are a beach person you will love it. This is why I never even got in the pool. Good walking or relaxing beach. Beach is clean, water is clear and there are waves for fun. During a 7 night stay we had one day with red flags - which was a blast for use because we love waves. Beach is topless. Not a rowdy resort at all, which is what we were looking for (35 and 32 yr. old hubby and wife), not too many kids and the ones that were there we never really saw because they tend to be at the pool. Would absolutely return and recommend to friends and family.", "Date": "May 17, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding for Families!!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5076184", "Content": "We just returned from a 6 night trip at the Iberostar Tucan / Quetzal and was very impressed.

Not only was that a great thing for the kids, but the kids club staff and the nightly kids shows were so much fun. My kids are still singing the songs. They even have a kiddie disco every night. My children did go to the kids club one day and loved it...they had a blast. Besides all the fun for the kids, my husband and I had a great time. The pool was nice, food was great, the service was fast and friendly and the shows were very entertaining. The staff at Iberostar Tucan/Quetzal were unbelievable.

We were a group of 6 ( 3 couples). Let me start by saying the area is beautiful. Beach is absolutely goregous. There is a jungle feel to the resort. Lots of wildlife like agunas, peacocks,and geckos that roam freely. ( Monkeys are on the Quetzel side.) The rooms are kept spotless. Grounds are kept meticulously clean. The staff for housekeeping, groundskeeping, and restuarant areas do a great job. The front desk staff are not quite as dedicated to keeping you happy. We had several problems from checking in, to getting messages,and not receiving a lost bag that our taxi cab driver turned in. When asked about our transportation to the airport, we were told that they are not responsible for knowing if or when you will be picked up. Which means you have to make all the arrangements from the hotel phone(which will cost you). We did several excursions. A cataraman cruise, Tulum, and X-Caret. All were lots of fun and worth doing. If you are going to Cozumel be warned that the ferry does not leave every hour on the hour from the island to Playa Del Carmen. We took the cataraman snokeling tour (Fury) and barely made the last ferry back to Playa Del Carmen. Buy your tickets for one-way only. If not, you may get stuck waiting for the ferry company that you bought your round trip ticket with. The food on the resort was kinda hit or miss. It is best to eat when the food is first put out on the buffets. The reservation only resturants are not the best. We ate at the Japenese, Tropical, and the Steak House. Each were only average and not worth rushing an excursion or tour for. There were several resturants in Playa Del Carmen that we thought were very good and are worth the taxi cab fare ($10 round trip). Los Rancheros, Blue Lobster, and LaBarillo. 5 th St is not to be missed. I thought it had a slight Bourbon St.feel to it. Lots of fun, especially if you are in a group. Prices for souvenirs are competative a t Playacar, which is a short walk from the resort. Lets face it, vacation is what you make it. With the right attitude you can make the worst place on the planet a trip to paradise. With that said, I think our group made the best of an average resort. We did not let the resort's short comings ruin our vacation. Do not stay on the resort for your whole trip. Get out and enjoy the beautiful area you have traveled so far to visit.

We all had a great time, the food was great - breakfast, lunch and the evening meals in the buffet, although don't expect genuine Mexican food or even Tex-Mex but make sure you use your full allowance of a la carte reservations (the Japanese is a great experience and the Carribean is pretty good). Don't get too excited about the non-existant kids club, it really is pretty lame, but if the kids enjoy the pool, you can keep an eye on them and the club probably isn't really even necessary - it also felt a safe place for the kids. The daily entertainment around the pool is pretty naff (the men seem to like dancing around dressed as women - but harmless!) so you can have a little laugh to yourself! The beach really is beautiful and would say it is probably the part of the beach along that strectch of Playacar. Also try and get a room overlooking the pool or gardens rather than the hotel next door ( we asked after one night) and there really is no difference between the Tucan and Quetzal (you can inter-mingle). On our last night, we were offered a one night's stay at the Iberostar Maya, which we enjoyed (it had a lazy river and you felt the kids were contained) although the food was not a patch on the Tucan.

We stayed for 5 nights and had a wonderful time. We decided to go to this hotel because our travel agent raved about it and now I know why!!! Arrival: We didn't have any complaints about getting through customs or getting to the hotel. We were through the airport and on our way in about 25 minutes. When we arrived at the hotel our room was ready and they even honored the request I made by e mail to have a room by the pool/beach. Room: We stayerd in room 1226. Perfect location. We had a view of the pool/jungle area. The room was kept spotless. We tipped the maid 2 dollars a day and she did a great job. She refilled our mini bar everyday with soda, water and beer. The shower is great. It is made from stone and has excellent water pressure. The beds are very hard but it actually didn't bother us at all. The T.V. is mostly in spanish but you could always find something in english to watch. Pool/Beach: The pool is gigantic! You can lay on a raft and not be bothered for hours. We purchased one from the hotel gift shop and it was very pricey. Bring your own. The hotel does have a strict policy on reserving chairs/grass huts. They even give you a paper about upon checking in. Every morning by 7:30 am most of the chairs were reserved! We ended up having to reserve chairs because otherwise we would never get a spot. The beach is beautiful. The water couldn't be any more blue. There are a bunch of topless people on the beach so if you are uncomfortable with that it isn't the place to go! Excursions: We decided to go horseback riding after it was recommended by Olympus Tours. What a horrible experience!!! The horses are very tempermental and do not want to be riden. My horse ended up \"laying down\" on me and throwing me off into the sand. I saw at least 4 people experience the same thing. If you are not an experienced rider I do not suggest going! Food: We are both not picky eaters and did find something to eat at every meal. The buffet is very boring! They serve the same food everyday. But if you don't mind eating chicken, burgers, fries, nachos, and salads then you will be fine. Breakfast had a huge variety of all types of food. We ate at the hibachi, mexican, and steakhouse restaurants. The hibachi was good but very salty. They try very hard to do tricks and make it fun. The mexican was good as well. A lot to choose fun as well as a buffet for salads and other authentic foods. The steakhouse was my least favorite. They try to duplicate \"Outback\" and it doesn't compare. They serve a blooming onion which was very tasty. My husband and myself both orderd filet and when it came it was covered in butter which we didn't care for. Desserts were lame. In america you can always find a good slice of cheescake. We did venture into town twice. It is a five dollar cab ride each way. They have nice shops and restaurants. We ate at a little place right on the strip. I will warn you that the restaurant managers swarm you on the street and try to push you into their restaurant by offering free drink cards etc... Read them carefully because we ended up getting burned because the card had to be presented before ordering. We spent $55.00 on two entrees and a few drinks. You can definitly find gifts to bring home. They are much cheaper than the gift shop which is very pricey for everything (candy or chips are $2.00-4.00 each!) The area is very safe and we didn't have any problems. Overall we had a wonderful time and are planning to go back next year with our two small children. The jungle is great if you have kids. They willl love it. Animals just roam all around and don't seem to bother anyone. We had a family of monkeys right outside our room on a tree 10 feet away!

We chose this hotel based on the reviews we read on this website and everyone who called it paradise was spot on. Flight from England was very long (10.5 hours) but First Choice planes are really comfortable so it didn't bother us at all. Our room was really spacious and was kept spotless for the 2 weeks we were there. The whole resort was gorgeous! In the jungle bit in the middle you could still see some damage done by the hurricane but I'm sure that will be cleared up soon as there were always people working on it planting new stuff etc. The pool area was kept immaculate by the staff. One guy in particular worked harder than everyone else. I don't know his name we just called him Speedy!!! There is waitress service at your sunbed which took some getting used to for me as I'm not used to being looked after so much on holiday. Food is fantastic. The buffet has a really wide range of food even the fussiest of eater will be able to find something they like. Only downside people might find is they generally have the same stuff on for breakfast and lunch. Try the a la carte restaurants. We did the steakhouse twice, the mexican twice, the italians and the tropical. They were all gorgeous! Mexican and Steakhouse were our faves. Beach was lush but trying to get into the sea over the waves was a challenge. It is highly amusing watching people getting knocked off their feet (although not so funny when it happens to yourself and you lose your bikini top!) The entertainment on a night is good. The Star Friends work hard all day and right up until late at night and do a fantastic job. They are all lovely and friendly and put you under no pressure to join in if you don't want to.

We had a great vacation and the weather was perfect. The trip was booked through our local travel agency who used Apple Vacations and we chose the Iberostar Tucan. When we got there they booked us into the Quetzal. Same place but other side of hotel. You can read other reviews that describe the beautiful hotel so I will just give you some other tidbits of advice. EXCURSIONS: We went to the full day Mayan Adventure, which took us to Coba to climb the ruins, visit the Mayan communities, zipline over water and climb through jungle, swim in a cenote, canoe and other adventure type activities. It was perfect for the teenagers with us as well as the adults. I would not recommend it for anyone who cannot walk 1/2 mile or who is not in good physical shape. It requires going up rocky paths and other activities that require balance and agility. We booked it through the Apple rep at the hotel and everyone had a great time. We left hotel at 7 am and returned at 5:30 pm after stopping at local shop for a shot of Tequilla. We did a second excursion to Xel-Ha. It is a wonderful park for snorkeling. I would recommend getting the all inclusive admission. We booked through the hotel for $ 74.00 per person included transportation and food and drink and admission to park. A must see! Great snorkeling and you can also swim with dolphins for $ 115.00 additional (about 45 minutes in water with dolphins) This requires reservation. Sunscreen is not allowed in park but they will hold your sunscreen and give you biodegradable sunscreen to use whil in park. (this can be done at the information booth as you walk in. Go early to this amazing place. NIGHTLY ENTERTAINMENT BY STAR FRIENDS AT IBEROSTAR: Bad, boring and should be improved. I guess you should sit through one of the 9:30pm shows to judge for yourself. We attended two of them and only stayed because we thought \" this has to get better at some point.\" But it never did and so we were in bed by 10:30 most nights and up early to enjoy the beach. FOOD AND DRINKS: Food was good. Lots of variety at the main buffets and good lunches down by the beach. Great hamburgers and fries. We drank the water served with meals and noone suffered any distress. We ate at the Japanese restaurant and Steakhouse. Both were good but I liked the Italian the best. Make your reservation on day 1 of your stay. The bars opened early for drinks and although they were weak, you could always have as many as wanted. The beer on tap is good. Frozen drinks good too. The seafood buffet, held one night, was a dissappointment. It was just the regular buffet with lugostinos added. I would have enjoyed passing on this to eat in a reservation restaurant. BASICALLY, the hotel is very neat and clean. We hung a few dollars from the shelf of our in room mini bar. That got it stocked every day instead of every 2 day. Tips do help. I would advise bringing at least $25.00 in ones to use as tips. Also, while you won't be spending any money at the hotel for anything you should realize that you will be spending between $70-100 per person, per excursion. But we thought the excursions were well worth it and would do them again! Also, bring SUNSCREEN with you. To purchase in the hotel lobby was very expensive!

The hotel is located next to the Riu Yukatan 2nd from the end of a strip of top hotels which all back onto the beach.Two receptions, Tucan & quetzal(ketsal) Both have shops and cocktail bars. Ladies will love a champange cocktail at 11am, one or two more at 5pm and maybe another after your meal. Men, strictly Tequila or rum. We stayed in the 1100,s block. Our room was inward facing so we had views of the pool and sea. Best part about the room was the shower. We tipped our maid $1 every day and we had a different towel sculpture and petals on the bed waiting for us each day when we returned. All the staff really work hard to make your stay special. The jungle is situated between Tucan and Quetzal and has pathways criscrossing it.It has been thinned out by the huricanes but there are monkeys high up, iguanas, peacocks (noisy) flamingoes and other strange animals. you need anti mossie spray on arms and legs if you cross it at night. Restuarants, 3 buffet style open air with a good selection (real cornflakes) plus a lunch time bbq. The one downside was that at breakfast and lunch birds swoop in low past you like the dambusters, so don't leave food unattended or they will fly of with it. There are 5 al'carte restaurants and you can pre book 5 sittings in a fortnight (do this 1st day). When they run out on the morning of your evening meal you can go on the reserve list of whatever restuarant you want to eat in. We did this twice and got in both times. Japanese twice (food cooked in front of you) Steakhouse twice (the american real deal)Italian twice (great entertainment) Mexican once (great night) Didn't go to the saefood one. Take a few dollars for tips. Wine is included with all meals, this is not always the case at some all inclusive. Week one was round the pool, temp mid 30's so pool water was just right. Not to busy so no real problem getting a sunbed but people do ignore the don't reserve sunbed signs. Adult swim up bar for the serious drinker/posers and kiddies pool with sunbeds always available. Week two was on the beach. Temp high 30's. It was american easter vacation so lets just say that 7am was the best time of day on the beach, especially if you wanted a pallapa for shade. Lots going on from mid morning to 5pm around beach area. More cocktails served to your sunbed. There are designated swim areas and a lifeguard in watchtower who operates a safe to swim flag system. Padi diving lessons and Hobi Catamaran lessons which have extra charge. I did the Hobi lesson with Manuel then went off sailing with my wife. You can sail one hour a day free. Trips. Went to Tulum, half day, one for the culture vultures, take water. Xel Ha (Shel Ha) You need all day to see most of this fantastic park. All you need is ID for snorkel hire and waterproof camera, Plus money for extras such as sea trek, photos or gift shops. check if food/drink is included when booking. We did the sea trek (Underwater with diving helmet) Not for the nervy type. If you are the dolphin swim is a safer bet booked in advance. We also did cliff jumping and floated down the lazy river in a tube. Don't miss this one if you like adventure. PS use biodegradable sun screen. Finanly all I can say is we walked up and down the beach and this hotel has the best spot.

Returned from my third trip in March and I'll tell you it just gets better. The staff is excellent - professionals that know what service with a smile means - and it's for real. Like to eat - this is the place to go - 6 different restaurants including steak house, italian, mexican, japanese, carribean, and buffet. Like a cocktail - mini bar in your room, pool bar (no kids), beach bar (ice cream for the kiddies) with service to your sun lounger, lobby bar, disco - I'm dizzy. Want to sail, jet ski, para-sail, scuba the beach offers it all. This property is huge, actually two hotels in one. On one side it's the Tucan other side it's the Queztal - they mirror each other with a natural jungle in the middle full of exotic birds, monkeys, and the odd little cat like animals. You get more than a bang for your buck at this hotel. Adults, teens, and yes kids will love it!! Don't be afraid of going during spring break the weather is fantastic and the crazies are up in Cancun. Summer is very hot and you'll deal with the possiblity of a hurricane. Go before June and it's great especially for all of us from the northern climates that want sun by St. Patty's day! What a blast it was to be there on St. Patty's day weekend. If you go to this area of Mexico do yourself a favor and stay here - you'll love it and be hooked. Imagine being remembered by some of the staff a year after my last stay and I'm not a trouble maker!

We were celebrating our 10th anniversary, and went without our children. We booked through a local travel agent with Apple Vacations and everything was very smooth, from the airport, to the shuttle to the resort, to the information at the resort, to the return bus to Cancun and the flight back, it was flawless! Before we booked this resort, I did extensive research on the area and the different resorts there, and largely attributable to the information on this site, I picked the Tucan and am very glad I did! We arrived at the resort at about 10:30 am and were told that our room would not be ready for an hour and a half, to come back then (they went ahead and gave us our armbands that entitled us to food/drinks). We put on our bathing suits, and self-toured the facility, before returning to the lobby bar for a drink while waiting for our room. We had requested an oceanfront room a week before via e-mail and were told those were sold out, but they would try to get us an oceanview room, which they did. We were in building 11, which was right behind the towelhut. When we checked back at 12:00, our room was ready. We were given our keys and information and headed off to our room to officially start our vacation. The food was great and there was enough variety that you could certainly have something different every time. Granted, they put out basically the same items daily, but there was so much of it that we didn't need to duplicate. We also ate at the Japanese and the Italian restaurants which were also good! One of the best \"perks\" of this resort was discovered the day we went to Cozumel. We were able to go to the Iberostar Cozumel, ckeck-in, and get arm bands as guests for the day, which entitled us to all food, drinks, facilities, etc. It was very nice to have that as an option. The beach at the Tucan was marvelous!! White sand, blue water, drinks, ice cream, etc. We also enjoyed the pool bar, the theatre, and the discotech. The beds were hard (we are used to an extremely soft matress cover), but by the time it was time to go to bed, it did not matter. We were so tired from a full day of relaxation, we went right to sleep (we did not even request a foam pad).

I carefully read many reviews prior to booking and don't really understand what the few negative comments were about. We were well taken care of from start to finish, the rooms and facility were lovely, the ambience and jungle feel were relaxed and fun. We booked with Apple vacations and they were excellent-helpful and well organized. I read a number of complaints about the food and I don't get it. I am a excellent cook of just about every cuisine and I thought the food was very good considering the number of guests the hotel has to accommodate. We especially enjoyed our early breakfasts by the pool.The buffets were varied and fresh and by the end of the week, I just became more selective-as my husband found out, you don't have to try every single thing. The specialty restaurants were fine though the Japanese food was a little salty. We attributed that to our chef who was a little heavy handed with the soy sauce. Everything else was good to great and, best of all, I did not have to cook any of it. The drinks were fine, not strong unless you requested it which, in my opinion, was good because people don't need to get falling down drunk- that is our culture not the Mexican culture. I was very impressed with the activities for the kids although mine are grown. The kids were well engaged and not all over the place. Since I am a school administrator I really needed the break. Overall, we had the best time with lots to do including a couple of excursions for variety which were also well organized.

They set up everything from ping-pong tournaments, volley ball games, waterpolo games, contests in the pool, and even just plain old simple \"keep-away\". The staff really makes you feel welcomed and makes sure that your stay is as pleasent as possible. The food there was great also. It is the same thing almost every single day but if you like the food then its good. I have heard many people complain about the food but I thought the food was great, I mean who wouldnt like a buffet every single day for breakfast, lunch, and dinner? My family and I did not do any of the reserved restaurants. They have a seafood, steak, and Japanese restaurants that you have to make reservations but there is a dress code and I heard that it is hard to get early times for reservations. I have 2 younger siblings, 15 and 13 years old and we were all fine just eating at the buffet every night because you can just go right in and eat!. I would have to say that any where you go in Mexico there WILL be bed bugs. You can not say that it is a problem because the staff don't keep the rooms clean, it is something you will find any where you will go. A lot of the people I met told me they got bed bug bites and I have to say that I was a victim as well. But they seemeed to only have gotten my legs, and it was not somethign that was that big of a deal. I thought the hotel was just as fantastic as it was the past 2 times that I have gone and I am sad to say that this third time will be my last becasue I will be going off to college, but I would love to go back again sometime!!!! The iberostar tucan has been my favorite place for vacation and I would not go to any other place!!!. The weather was nice and you can see a lot of monkeys.! I was actually walking through the forest and all the monkeys walked right past me, some even stopped. They were practically a foot away from me it was awesome!!!! I'd say that this place is a great place for any one that just wants to get away and relax and have few drinks!. If you want something totally insanely fancy go to the Riu Palace, but my sister went there and still says that the Iberostar was more laid back. Plus, the hotel is right on the beach right by the pool. I know at the other hotels you had to walk a long way from the beach to the pool. At the iberostar everything is close. It is all inclusive and they just redid a new bar by the beach with ice cream.. yumm.

There is a long check-in line up. Had at least an hour wait after we checked in. VIP service did not shorten the wait -VIP travellers had to arrive at the same time as us. - Headphones on airplane cost $3, and the movie was a kids show \"Dreamer\". - The Airplane bar ran out of beer. - Upon arrival in Cancun, our shuttle bus to the airport terminal, from the plane, broke down. We were happy with how they handled this: there was a quick replacement, and they informed us what was happening. - Everything was on time on our way to our resort, on our return to the USA we had a 2 hour delay at the Cancun airport. Add this to the fact that you arrive at the airport 2 hours early for an on-time flight, and you can understand why people were grumpy (we were all waiting for 4 hrs). - The bus that took us from the airport to the resort was clean, air conditioned, and equipped with a toilet. Our TNT representative, had a list of all travellers going to the resort, and made sure we were all on the bus before it left. This took 45 minutes. The TNT representative sold Coronas on the way to the resort, $3 a bottle. - Upon arrival at the resort we found there was only one check-in employee at the resort counter to handle our whole bus load of people! Luckily, we were first in line. - We brought only carry-on luggage, so we were the first at every line-up. However, the people who had to wait for their luggage found themselves at the back of very long, and time-consuming lines. - We were served with welcome drinks upon arrival. - We got no orientation upon arrival at the hotel. If you needed anything else from the front desk (ex, you wanted to change rooms), it would be a long wait because the one guy had to do everything. - We got a very nice, clean, spacious room with a balcony. Building 15 is in a very good location. - We were close to the Night Entertainment hall, which had a show every night from 8-11pm. It wasn't overly loud, we were able to sleep with the show going on. Plus, it must have been quieter here than close to the disco tech which only closes at 3am. - Beds were hard but very comfortable. - Food: Okay. Not much vegetarian choice. Good service in all the restaurants, dirty plates cleared quickly, and drinks always full. - Desserts: Not very impressive. They look delicious, but don't taste very good. (We found the Tiramisu quite good) - Minibar only contains beer, water and softdrinks. - Mostly families and older couples at the resort. Not many single people from 20-40yrs old. - The beach and pool were clean and gorgeous. The resort employees were constantly cleaning up and offering to bring drinks over. The beach sand was nice and there were no rocks or weeds in the water at all. You could walk in both directions on the beach for a good mile or more. - The weather was great the whole week we were there. No rain and temperatures in the low 80s every day. - People reserve seats under the palapas on the beach by 7am. We found this problem was worse at the beginning of the week. We always found a good spot to sit by the pool or on the beach. - The one hour snorkeling tour offered at the resort is very good. It's a perfect amount of time for beginners and for people looking for a leisurely swim. Guide points out special fish. - Roosters crow in the middle of the night, and early morning (as well as at various times throughout the day) outside of the hotel room. They wander the grounds and we tended to hear them crowing at 4AM every morning. - Look for the monkeys in late afternoon. Overall the vacation was relaxing and satisfactory.

Not knowing which resort to try (there are so many!), I relied heavily on TripAdvisor reviews. I worried over each nagative review. Silly. Hotel Location: The hotel is located in the gated community of Playacar. In our opinion, this was the best resort area because beacuse it was well-maintained and convenient to PDC. Hotel Appearance: BEAUTIFUL! Landscaping and all-over look of the hotel was much more lush and charming than both neighbors, which were either \"castles\" or swimming in concrete. The Tucan is VERY clean, and feels and looks like a Mexican resort should. We all agreed we made the right choice - hands down. Rooms: We were out by 7:00 or 7:30 each morning, and our room was clean by 8:30 or 9:00 - every day. Beds are very firm. My husband and I didn't care for them, but our 11 year old daughter loved them! Shower was large, great water pressure & hot! We sent the hotel an e-mail with our building and third floor preference and got exactly what we asked for on arrival. We were in Bldg. 12 which was a perfect location for the beach, pool and Uxmal Restaurant/Bar. Beach: BEAUTIFUL! Water is clear where you can see your feet on the bottom. Palapas were great. Jet skis and parasailing just to the left. We took travel mugs as some suggested and were glad we did. Jesus at the Uxmal bar was the best!! Remembered us and what we liked to drink every day. Our 11 year old loved his \"virgin Pink Panthers!!\" She also liked getting ice cream cones on the beach. Pool: Impressive. Very true about people reserving chairs. We chose getting a seat at the beach every morning, as even getting up at 7:00 or 7:30 -- most, if not all, of the \"good\" pool seats were taken. Not a big deal - when ready for the pool, put your things in the cubicles between the swim-up bar and the pool entrance and enjoy! Food: Very good, especially after reading some of the reviews. We took Pepto, Immodium, and Pepcid and needed none of it. You could try something new at the buffets each day and not eat the same thing for at least a week. Maybe some reviewers are too picky! Japanese restaurant was entertaining and good. Service: OUTSTANDING. Cannot say anything bad about anyone, anywhere. Always a smile with a tip or without - and we always tipped. They deserve it, whether it's an all-inclusive or not. Humored us with our Spanish learned many years ago. Helpful, gracious, friendly. Outside the Hotel: Venturing into PDC is a blast. Dinner at Yaxche was WONDERFUL. Alux, the restaurant in a cave, was neat. We booked the Fat Cat tour online, but were told on the day of pick-up that the boat was in for maintenance. Again, not a big deal - we went to Xel-Ha instead and had a great time snorkeling, tubing, etc. Misc.: Never used the bug spray. Massage by the pool - AWESOME. One note, though: check the activities schedule before you pick a time -- about 40 minutes into mine, the music turned club-techno for the water aerobics! No problem - it was a great, deep, massage and I was on vacation. On several occasions we witnessed people throw little tantrums over the most minor of things. Based on our observations, if you do not enjoy your time at the Tucan, you probably deserve it. The Tucan provides a lovely background for your vacation, and the rest is what you make of it. We will definitely return to Mexico and would like to try other areas or resorts -- but the Tucan makes it very hard not to want to go right back!!

We did an extensive amount of research prior to our trip and kept reading positive reviews about the Tucan and decided it was worthwhile - we were not disappointed. My wife and I have stayed at the El Dorado Royale in the RM, a few trips to Cancun and a few trips to Isla Mujures by ourselves but this was the first trip with our 8 and 11 year old kids.. We rented a car at the airport (highly recommended if you're making day trips) and drove down to the resort where we were checked in within 5 minutes. Just to be clear, there is absolutely no difference in the Tucan and the Quetzal. They are a single resort with two separate sides and lobby\u2019s \u2013 they share the pool, stage, beach, etc. ROOM - Our room was located in building 11 on the third floor just as I had requested in an email earlier in the week to the guest relations representative Catalina. The rooms are the usual size with two double beds and a \"sofa\" bed built in to the wall. This worked great for our family and allowed my wife and me to have a bed and each of the kids with their own. You've probably read about how hard the mattresses are - that is true but not unusual in Latin America (I've experienced the same phenomenon in the Dominican Republic and Cuba). We had a partial view of the beach and a full view of the pool. On the Tucan side building 10 is the beachfront building that only has Junior Suites \u2013 not sure how much more they run but Catalina told me they were all reserved by Apple Vacations for their clients \u2013 so if you book through Apple you might be able to upgrade? Buildings 12 and up are situated away from the beach beginning with building 12. There is a jungle area between the pool/beach and the lobby area that includes monkeys, peacocks, and several little badger looking creatures and iguanas (lots of these) and various birds that roam freely through the area and even onto your room patio. My only caution would be try not to book rooms in the buildings adjacent to the jungle unless you are an early riser. FOOD - Once you arrive you'll need to make reservations at one of the 5 a la carte restaurants - we selected the Japanese (highly recommended) and the traditional Mexican. I heard a few nice comments about both the steakhouse and the Italian restaurants but didn't hear anything about the seafood restaurant. They typically allot you half the number of nights of your stay in the a la carte restaurants, the other half you are expected to eat at the buffet. The buffet food was good, hot, and fresh and included a different \"carving board\" each night. The first night we had grilled Mahi Mahi that tasted like it swam in the ocean that day - the next night was pulled pork night - very good. POOL - Yes, you need to pick up your towels and reserve a spot at the pool early if you want the best location. There are about 7 \"Palapa Beds\" around the pool but those are highly sought after - you might consider waking up and walking down to reserve a spot at first light. If you're like us and enjoy a nice relaxing vacation and don't get stressed out about stuff like this take your time, the pool is huge and there is plenty of room to spare. BEACH \u2013 The same routine if you want the best location under a palapa. There are always available lounge chairs, but the shady areas fill up fast. We never had a problem finding a nice area to chill out. The beach in front of the hotel is very wide and there is only one resort to the south with a very long stretch of undeveloped beach if you want to get away from it all. To the north are several resorts including the Viva Wyndham, Riu Playacar, Riu Palace, etc. but the beach in front of the Tucan was the best for us. ENTERTAINMENT \u2013 I wish I could go into great detail on this topic but since we never could stay awake past 9:30 we didn\u2019t experience much of the nightly entertainment. The one exception was the Magician from Argentina \u2013 he was very good (better than we were expecting for an AI). There is also a disco that opens at 10:30 and closes at 3:00. DRINKS \u2013 My only disappointment was the lack of bottled beer. There are taps of Dos Equis all over the place which is nice, but having a nice cold bottle (or even a can) would have been great. The bartenders are nice and fun and will make just about whatever you want if you ask. There are top shelf brands of Scotch, Vodka, Bourbon, etc but make sure you ask first or you\u2019ll end up a with a drink made with MR BOURBON, etc. My kids now have an appreciation for Pina Coladas Sin Alcohol and can\u2019t get enough of them. Overall I would highly recommend the Tucan to anyone with kids or an extended family. It\u2019s very clean and safe and has a beautiful beach and pool area. If my wife and I were traveling by ourselves we probably would opt for one of the Adult only resorts simply to get away from the kids and have some grown up time.

Myself and my partner have been checking trip advisor regularly for the last few months and were impressed by all the positive reviews but the hotel still far exceeded our expectations in every way. The best bits: -Everywhere was extremely clean and tidy -The staff were very friendly. In fact, all the locals we met around the area seemed to actually like tourists. -The facilities were amazing with a well equiped gym, lots of bars and restaurants to chose from, a theatre and disco, spa, spacious rooms, shops in the lobby and beautiful grounds -The beach and pool areas were impressive. -There was a wide variety of food at the buffet. I just don't understand how people could say the food is repetitive. There were lots of different types of salads, some vegetarian dishes, traditional fajitas with a selection of fillings, pasta dishes, chips, potatoes, different selections of vegetables, cold meats and cheeses, different meat and fish dishes, pizzas, burgers, a carvery with different joints each night and a large selection of desserts. Perhaps the problem was that there was so much to choose from every night that people found it repetitive. You could also get food all day from two restaurants down by the beach and pool if you didn't fancy walking up to the buffet. -The jungle setting and all the wildlife was brilliant. I think that's what made the hotel stand out so much from anywhere else I've been. It felt like you were very much amongst nature but at the same time the grounds were so well maintained and beautiful. We often saw flamingos, swans, tucans, parrots, strange rat/bunny type things, peacocks, lizards and of course the monkeys. -The rooms had air conditioning and ceiling fans so it was always cool at night despite the boiling weather outside. I could carry on for ages talking about all the positive things about this hotel as it was so impressive. The bad(?) bits: The only negative things I can come up with were that people reserved sunbeds so it was impossible to get one after 8am and topless sunbathing was not allowed around the pool (no one seemed to mind on the beach though). The most annoying thing about the sun-bed issue is that some people would reserve beds at the crack of dawn and then not be seen anywhere near them all day! The a la carte restaurants weren't as good as I'd expected but I think it's because the standard of food at the buffet restaurant was so high that the a la carte restaurants didn't seem that much better. I've never understood before how people can go back to the same hotel year after year when there are so many places to visit in the world but for the Tucan I'd make an exception.

(We are both 23 years old) The main reason we stayed there was because of the great reviews that it got, so I feel the need to return the favor and post one my self! The Tucan was more than we could have ever expected. . Everything was amazing, the staff especially. We became pretty close with a few of them. The beaches are beautiful! Like many have said, definitely walk south. There is only one hotel south of the Tucan on the stretch of beach. Then it becomes very secluded with just beach and jungle (Bring a camera). There is always something for every age group to do from Volleyball, to dance classes, to water polo on the resort. As far as the food goes, it does get very repetitive. I recommend reserving an a la carte restaurant every night. (make sure that you do this the first day there) You will be put on the wait list, but usually will be accepted. Its definately worth a try! The Japanese steak house was by far the best food we had all week long. The rooms are very nice and clean. I love the shower! The rooms go from buildings 1000 to I think 16000. The 1600 (or higher numbers) are farther away from the beach and pool, but closer to the dining areas. There is so much wildlife throughout the resort. One morning we woke up to a family of 7 monkeys on our balcony swinging from the thatched roof. It was so neat! The nightly entertainment is really good. Definitely watch it. The nightclub at the resort is fun for a bit. We went into playa del carmen (5th avenue) one day and one night. It is a beautiful city with tons of shops. It is definitely a tourist attraction but still fun to go to. We went back to party in town one night and went to the Blue Parrott and Mambo caf\u00e9. The Blue Parrott has a dance floor right on the sand by the water and there are a lot of younger people there. Mambo caf\u00e9 is more of a local salsa club. Both were very fun. Overall, we could not have asked for more with this vacation. I actually cried as our bus pulled away from the resort heading for our departure to the airport.

We had studied TRIPADVISOR ( best!) for months previously. Anyways, resort was everything it was touted to be: rooms were large , wonderful, and yes, beds were HARD. But funnily enough, we slept well on those hard beds, so no real problem. Staff were nice. Food was just o.k. We had noticed before, in reading the reviews, that people said food was repetitious , etc. Well, sorry, but when I read the reviews, I thought these people were hard to please. But then I found that they are right! Food IS boring. AND, the worst sin for me, OFTEN luke warm. We were at Iberostar Costa Dorada last year and the food was more plentiful, better variety, and the staff were friendlier, more attentive , and the food was hot! Staff at Iberostar Tucan are NOT as friendly and we had a woman at the entrance to our dinner area, who was positively without personality whatsoever. Do Iberostar management not check these people out? A completely different experience from the Costa Dorada. After we were there last year, we thought there was no where to be but Iberostar. Now we know we were fooloish!The beach at Tucan was over-rated. Red flag was up almost whole time we were there. Worth your life to go in! I am a beach person, so this alone put me off. Yes, they had a lovely pool. But as many have said, there is this stupid game with reserving pool chairs and taking off which unfortunately many play so the pool holds little charm for me. By the way, the hotel does NOTHING about this selfish , childish game people play. Anyways, never again. I would go back to D.R.

The Iberostar \"Star Friends\" just as friendly and helpful as can be..It was really neat to go back and see as many familiar faces from last year to this year.

The beach was much more crowded than others around..there is not privacy on the beach as you are only several feet away from the next group...even at the farthest end of the beach we were still stacked on top of each other... All I can say is the other travelors were RUDE! How many chairs does one family/couple need? I was amazed at how rude people were about saving chairs in the shade and at the same time using the chairs in the sun! This just wasnt 1 or 2 families but many many couples and families alike.

We saw a porcupine while we were walking to the club one night. I did not like people coming up to me on the beach and trying to sell me stuff. I saw one of the men who were trying to sell their jewelry steal somebody's camera and take off running down the beach. It is a great place to take your family. It is a european chain so there are a lot of speedos and topless women (of all ages). I did not feel comfortable going topless in front of children, even though it did not seem to phase them. The staff were all wonderful. The room was clean and decorated nicely. The landscaping was done nicely. My mini bar was well stocked everyday and beach towels were always available. The shows were really good. I also loved the location. This hotel is just a few minutes from Play Del Carmen. This town is awesome, they have cute little shops and you can catch a connecting ferry to Cozumel. If you decide to go to Cozumel make sure you take the ferry that looks like a catamaran, it is only a 20 minute ride. I heard the other ferry takes 40 minutes to get across. There are two pools, they are both nice. The adult only pool is off to the side and shaded, so it was very cold. My only complaint is that you cannot swim in the pool in the evening. My sister and I wanted to swim around 8:00 p.m. and the staff made us get out of the pool. Overall we had an excellent time. I would definitely stay here again.

We stayed in block 12, which had a limited view of the sea, and was very quiet, with easy access to the pool. The room was spotless, with the minibar always filled - towel animals every day and even petals and chocolates on our bed on a couple of evenings! I agree with other reviews that the sunbed reserving is a nightmare - were were up early every morning to get the beds we wanted, even on the beach, so they really need a better system there. The resort surroundings are fantastic, with loads of animals and we even had a family of monkeys living in the trees outside our room. The beach is really clean and the sea is so blue. The food was really good, even in the buffet and even though we stayed for two weeks, we never struggled for choice and I am a really fussy eater. We sampled all the restaurants with the best being the Japanese - but all of them were really good. If you want a relaxing holiday, you cannot chose better - there is food and drink available constantly, the entertainment is there 24 hours if you need it, but the Star Friends will leave you alone if you do not want to participate. There is a small shoping centre outside of the resort, about a 10 minute walk away, which has souveniers and a small chemist, but you need to go into Playa del Carmen for anything else, but this is very touristy, but OK for a day out.

Our vacation exceeded our expectations. We loved the blend of the wildlife, jungle, and beach at the resort. The hotel staff were very friendly and hospitable, from check-in to check-out. We stayed in building #16 that was close to the buffet and lobby areas. If noise is a problem for you, I suggest bringing ear plugs to block out the wildlife noise in the early AM hours and to block out the music from the nightly shows that lasts until 11:00 PM. I always sleep with ear plugs while traveling, so it wasn't a problem for me. Yes, you do need to get to the pool and beach fairly early in the AM, especially to get a shady spot, but that was fine with is. The pool area is very nice. Remember to turn in your pool towel at the end of the day for a fresh one since the towel office doesn't open until 9:00 AM. And the beach is WOW! We heard that it doubled in width since hurricane Wilma. For us, this was the best beach lounging environment we've been to--white sand, lots of shade or sun, and lots of chairs. For a 4-night stay you're guaranteed 1 night dining at the specialty restarants. However, for the other nights we asked to be placed on a wait list and received the restarants of our choice, but we had to dine at 8:30 or 9:00 PM. That was okay... Overall, the Japanese Restarant had the best food. We gave the food a B rating compared to cruise-ship dining. The drinks were average. For excursions, we booked a Royal Dolphin Swim with Dolphin Discovery at home before our trip (via the internet for a discount). Swimming with the Dolphins was worth every penny!!! And of course we had to purchase the photos and DVD, it's a chance in a lifetime. We booked a tour to Chichen Itza with Roberto, the Apple Rep at the resort. This is an all day event. From 7:15 AM pickup until 7:00 PM return. It was worth it!!!! If you're into history of the Mayan culture and like archaeology, this tour is for you.

We were 2 families with 3 children ages 7,7,10. Considering the resort was sold out and it was spring break for a lot of Canada, the resort never felt really crowded. The kids loved the beach and the food and want to go back next year. They didn't use the kids club but the activities they offered were plentiful to keep the younger ones busy, probably not great for anyone over 8. Everything positive that has been posted about this hotel is true and the negatives, well you just can't please everyone, some people would find something to complain about staying in the White House I'm sure. Yes the beds were hard but we were so busy during the day that we could have slept on the floor without problems! We stayed in building 11 on the 3rd floor which had a partial view of the ocean and a great view of the pool and jungle. We were never disturbed by any noises from inside or outside the buildings and most nights we were in bed by 10pm exhausted. I emailed the hotel 1 week prior and got the building I requested as well as rooms next door to each other. I also enquired about doing a nice dinner for my husbands birthday so they made a reservation prior to my arrival and offered a birthday cake for $35 (didn't take the cake). The water that is supplied in the mini fridge is just small individual bottles but we enquired at the front desk and within a 1/2 hour we had gallon jugs outside of our rooms, suggest doing this as you go through a lot of water. We had 3 a la carte dinners Mexican, Steak, Japanese. All were good but I liked the Steak and Japanese the best. Recommend the Japanese for the entertainment value as well as the food. The Steak restaurant was great, they have a salad bar and appetizer buffet before your main meal. Our group ordered the Tenderloin and the back ribs both of which were wonderful. The Mexican was good but very similar food choices to what you can get every night at the buffet. Thursday nights seem to be the easiest to get reservations as all the a la cartes seemed to be less full that night, but do make all of your reservations as soon as you can (9-12 & 4-8 is when the reservation desk is open. We had no problems with the service anywhere in the hotel or on the beach. Yes it did take Teresa some time after she took our drink order on the beach to return with the drinks but its a long walk back to the bar in that sand, she never wrote anything down and always retured with 8-10 drinks on her tray every one of them right! Our return transfer to the airport wasn't picking us up till 4pm so we arranged to keep our rooms till 3pm ($10/hr extra charge)rather than use the hospitality suite which is offered free of charge. It worked well for us and were able to enjoy every minute of our last day. I would recommend doing this, its so much more relaxing.

I will just list my observations and comments, to shorten this review. The resort is spotless The employees always are happy and very helpful. I would recommend a room on the 3rd floor, facing the inside of the resort. Outside faces the neighboring resort. The beds are very firm, we didnt mind, but some we met did. The food is abundant, take a little of everything that looks interesting to you, you can always go back for more. This is mexican cooking, so it is likely not everything will be your favorite. Thursday night is seafood night at the buffet, and saturday night is the mexican night at the buffet. try to schedule your reservations for the other restaurants around these nights. They are very good. Plenty of lounge chairs by the beach, but you will need to get up early, by 9, to reserve your seats by the pool. We went on the Coba half day tour through Apple and felt it was well worth it. $5 cab ride to 5th avenue. Go to front desk and they will call a cab for you Overall, excellent resort, super friendly employees, the only negative were certain guests from a certain european country (F) that have no concern for anyone but themselves. The food lines,if any, are short and move quickly, but this one group will bump you, push you and barge in to get there food. Many Europeans that we met were embarrased by the actions of these few.

The positives: 1. I am amazed at how hard the staff works! Especially the wait staff...they were actually running! One staff member that I noticed was there to seat people for every meal, every day for the entire seven days that I was there. I can not say enough about how amazing the service was. My water glass was constantly being filled by the servers, not once was it empty. 2. The pool was HUGE, and there were different water depths which was nice (I spent my time at the 4.5 foot area :). 3. I thought the food was quite good. The food that did get a bit old by the end of the week was the buffet by the pool. It's good for snacks if you don't feel like going to the main one, but chances are you'll still be full from the amazing breakfast and just wait until dinner. 4. The check in and out was very efficient. 5. The beach was hot and pretty, and always lots of spots. 6. The animals. I saw 'runnies' (rat bunnies), peacocks, and tons of other things every day...really cool. The negatives: 1. The lizards in my room. Apparently this is common and there is an extention to reach a staff member in case of this. He was there to get rid of it within ten minutes, but I still had a tough time sleeping after that...eww. 2. The NOISE I don't think it matters where you are in the resort. I was in one of the buildings farthest away from the theatre, and the bass shook the room from 9:30 until about 11 every night. To give you perspective, I'm 21 and was exhausted from the sun at 10...normally I'd be up quite late. 3. The towel game. The reception hands out a paper saying that reserving chairs around the pool is not permitted. After the first day of not getting a chair at 9am, I figured.. can't beat em, join em. If you want the good chairs, get out there around 7. If you just want A chair, before ten is good for sun spots. Oh, and keep the blue towel with you because the hut that hands them out doesn't open until 9ish. 4. My BIGGEST complaint was the private vendors that had spots within the resort. They set themselves up in an area where you HAVE to walk by in order to get to the buffet or theatre. They speak to you the same way that you are spoken to in Playa Del Carmen (which isn't pleasent). I tried on a necklace and decided not to buy it. Oh, and he whispered some pretty vulgar comments in my ear. For the rest of the trip when he saw me he made sure everyone was aware that I would not ever buy anything. It wasn't nice having to walk by him every day, but I refused to acknowledge him and that seemed to work. Also, the vendors by the pool were quite rude. I don't understand why anyone would want to pay 20 US dollars to paint the small mexican hat ash tray that they were trying to sell me. Price was not negotiable...not that it was worth over 1 dollar. I would have tipped...oh well. 5. The people who go around the pool with monkeys and tucans asking if you want your picture taken with the animal. I will say no once, but after the fifth or sixth time, I'm not happy about it. 6. THEY DO NOT HAVE CORONA...they call it Double X, and sometimes try to pass it off as real beer. Overall, the resort was OKAY. I've found the main theme of Mexico (this time) to be really harrassing. I can understand when you leave the resort, but I'm on vacation and don't want to be asked something (literally) five times before you go away. The majority of people there were over 50 and young couples with children. I only saw a few teenagers. The resort seemed to have a lot of activities (diving, water aerobics, etc), however, I was there for a break and decided to sit them out. Would I go back? hmm maybe if it was on sale and I seriously needed a vacation. There are a lot of other places I would go before going back to Mexico.

Hopefully I can reciprocate by offering some guidance to others who might be considering a stay at this wonderful resort. Most everything that I read was accurate, so I don't want to be too repetitious (which is difficult for me). Therefore, without going into too much detail, the resort is pristine, rooms are kept very clean, hurricane damage is no longer an issue, the food is fresh and nobody became ill, plenty of purified water was available, it does rain, the staff are great (and were wonderful with our 2 young children), and the level of organization and professionalism was unexpected and very good. Also, we were never approached about timeshare. On the other hand, the animals do make some noise early in the morning, the buffet food (while plentiful, good and fresh) was predictable, and the resort is big so there is plenty of walking required (difficult with young children). It was also tough to get an early morning cup of fresh coffee without some walking, and with winding cobbled paths and no lids for the disposable cups it was hard work to carry one back to the room for my wife without spilling. Cofeemakers are available in the room, but I prefer fresh ground coffee. I was primarily concerned about keeping the children happy. The kids club exists, but our children preferred to spend time with us at the beach and the pool so it was not an issue. I think this is a great resort for families, but if I was going on honeymoon I would probably consider other options. That having been said, the many singles and couples seemed to be having a great time. We wondered what the \"guaranteed ocean view\" meant with respect to the junior suites. Our concerns were not warranted. It means that you are facing the ocean and practically on the beach, so it's very much guaranteed. I did not check any other rooms, but the suite was comfortable and spacious enough for us (including a crib that we requested). However, for children accustomed to bathing, the shower only option resulted in a few tears. As for choosing between the Quetzal and Tucan, as others have said, they are the same resort basically bifurcated in the middle with duplicated amenities on each side and a huge common pool. Guests have access to both sides, but because the resort is so big that is neither a positive or a negative. By planning the resort like this, the overall feel is that you are at a smaller resort that feels just right. However, after booking at the Tucan and being placed at the Quetzal side, we asked to move because the Quetzal's junior suites are near what seemed to be a noisy public beach - we never went back to that area so I'm not sure. The manager facilitated our move immediately and without any problems. The only real negative is the restaurant system. It's a hassle, and frankly the restaurants are ok but nothing special. We could only get reservations at the Japanese and Island/seafood restuarants because the early meal times get booked quickly. While the food was fresh and healthful, it was nothing to get excited about. The Japanese restaurant reminded me of Benihana. Being from New York, we are spoilt with great food, and habachi cooking and chef tricks are not my favorite. But we didn't choose this resort for the food, and if you are looking for great food experiences then all-inclusives are probably not the right call. However, there are great restaurants in the trendy town that is a quick $5 cab ride away. Cabs are constantly available. We booked through Liberty Travel, and our package included transportation to and from the airport by Olympus Travel (who were very organized and reliable). Unfortunately, Cancun airport is overburdened so be prepared for some chaos on arrival and departure. I would highly recommend the resort, and especially enjoyed the composition of the guests who seemed to be mainly from the U.S. and Europe (in close to equal shares), with a fair representation from South America as well. This was an added attraction for us, since U.S. hotel chains can be quite one-dimensional.

I'm a nature and animal lover and their presence at the resort truly made for a rewarding experience. It was awesome to share a stone path with the roosters, iguanas, and peacocks. Every morning I awoke to the parrots singing or the rooster crowing....what a great way to be roused from sleep!! The staff at the hotel, especially Bernardo at reception, really know how to treat their guests. I was happy to utilize and improve on my Spanish skills with the resort staff.

The first week it was my husband and I, our two children ages 3 and 5 and my mom and her husband. The second week it was just my family of four. We have stayed at the Tucan before in the Feb of 2004. In Feb of 2005 we spent two weeks at the Lindo. Now my review........ this is an Iberostar resort so keep in mind when you are going it really is top of the chain for AI's in Mexico. That being said, the service at the resort was nothing like it had been two years ago. We commented to it to staff and were told that all of the energetic, great staff moved up to the Lindo and the Maya as they get paid more there. The Tucan service was not even close to what we had at the Lindo or on our previous visit. The buffet had changed for one thing, it was much more repetitive with far less themes and options. They used to have different live music being played almost nightly as well as other entertainment to go along with the varied themes. Breakfast had the same food everyday. They used to vary it up more, sometimes making homemade fresh donuts of churrios sometimes fresh french toast. The hurricane has left the resort with a bug problem. This is the first time we have been to the area and experienced a lot of Mosquitos. Take your spray and if you room backs into the jungle keep your door closed. The cleanliness of the resort this time was a big turn off for us. The childrens pool, kids club, theatre and washrooms used to get cleaned a couple of times a day and you would always see people around doing this, this time we just saw one person doing everything, too much work for one. The adult pool bar is gross, don't even bother. One of the staff members told us that the water is gross and they have to overtreat it with chemicals due to the fact that so many people spend a lot of time in there and forget to get out to use the bathrooms!!! They don't drain the water, they slowly take out a bit refill it and put in chemicals. He said if you want to be in there you might as well sit in a toilet. I am sure this is the case however at any swim up bar pools. My biggest complaint this time however is not with the resort it is will people and there disgusting behavior at AI's. The buffets serve hundreds of people a day, people, please use a little etiquette!!! Use a Plate for you food. We often saw people walk in, grab food with there hands, pizza, burgers and use there hands to stand there and eat it. Do not eat in the buffets while you walk around getting your food. I can't tell you how many people I saw eating off there plates while the waited on other food. Often, they would proceed to lick their fingers, then grab the tongs and grab something else! Gross!!!!!! Sometimes it felt that we were eating amounst a bunch of animals. The amount of people that went into the restaraunt for lunch closest to the pools and beach without a shirt or shoes with terrible. If you read the info the resort gives you shirts and shoes are expected in all restaraunts. Common sense I would have thought! I guess on the positive side the disgusting behavior helped me loose my appetite and hence not gain a pound over the two weeks. Back to my review, if you want excellent service, cleanliness, and amazing food, visit the Lindo or Maya. If you want a good vacation, for a little less, the Tucan is an option. We have gone twice but won't be returning. Finally, we stayed in the Ocean view Jr. Suite........well worth the upgrade.

Breakfasts are generally the same, but just about everything you would want for breakfast is there, so pci something new each day! We ate at the Mexican and Steak house and great meals each time.

We agonized over where to go, using Trip Advisor as our \"bible\" reading review after review on all the places we were considering. Ultimately, we settled on the Ibertostar Tucan because of the overwhelmingly positive reviews and it did not dissapoint. The good reviews are right on and what is said about the facilities, property, beach, staff etc. are accurate. We truly thought it was paradise and just the respite we needed from the cold New England weather. If you read through the reviews, others have done an excellent job of covering the beauty of the property, gorgeous beach, friendly staff, quality of service, variety of food and comments on the a la carte restaurants (recommend Japanese and Italian). A few things we thought worth mentioning that we didn't see addressed in other reviews: bring plenty of US dollars as most everything at the beach/pool is cash only (e.g. parasailing, pool massage, painting pottery, henna tattoos). The hotel \"says\" that reserving chairs at the pool and huts at the beach is not allowed, but it is a reality so get out early and stake your place at the pool or the beach - everyone does it and it is witnessed by being out there early and seeing chairs vacant for hours with towels on them. Along with this, if you can't get a hut on the beach (for some shade) get an umbrella early too as they did run out several days we were there. There may be signs posted inconspicuously on the beach huts saying \"no topless\" but woman do go topless so beware if you are with children. Everyone says the weather is gorgous and when it is, it truly is. Not one person mentioned rain, however, it does rain (hard) and can thunderstorm and cloud up within minutes. We had a couple of days like this - clear blue sky in the morning and anytime between Noon and 3pm storm clouds move in and chase everyone off the beach. It can rain for up to several hours on and off, but usually clears up and the fantastic weather returns. If you go on a charter flight and have a destination rep, use his/her knowledge - they know the lay of the land and can be a wealth of information on anything you need to know (e.g. tipping, bartering with vendors, excursions, shopping, etc). This has nothing to do with the resort or vacation area in general, but be prepared for the Cancun airport - it was chaos when we arrived on a Saturday with so many flights landing and there's no organization or communication relative to where to get your bags, and then navigating out of the baggage area - it was a grid lock of people. Leaving was not much different as there were three flights leaving from the same gate at the same time, no one giving instructions so just a lot of weary travelers qued up in long lines that didn't move.

We went parasailing for $40 and snorkeling for $26 at the resort. The air rifle shooting was also fun (free). We also went to XCaret which I thought was rather expensive and not that great. The cave snorkeling was cool at XCaret, but overall, I thought Xel Ha was more fun (We visited Xel Ha 5 years ago.) There are all kinds of birds on the resort and monkeys too. The monkeys got on our balcony and were a bit scary. We visited Barcelo Mayan Beach resort 5 years ago, and the place couldn't hold a candle to this one. The Italian restaurant was good. I'd recommend the steak. The Mexican restaurant was also good. The Japanese restaurant was fine, but it's the same as on most other resorts. The mojitos were wonderful- made with fresh mint. I'll definitely return to this resort!!", "Date": "February 23, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Alberta, Canada", "Title": "\u201c4th time a charm!\u201d", "Author": "cmhomik", "ReviewID": "UR4496953", "Content": "I returned on Feb.6, 2006 from a 2 week vacation in the Mayan Riviera, staying at the Iberostar Tucan, in the resort town of Playacar.

Most meals were the typical large resort \"big buffet style\". Sure there is plenty of food but it is no better than a Lubys. The resort is huge and with the mentality to go along with it.

My wife and I were married in England and having witnessed first hand a few weddings on the beach whilst we were over there I can only say I am so glad we didnt get married in Mexico as we had considered it. The thought of other guests gazing at you from their sun loungers whilst you exchange vows didnt do it for us, especially having seen the parasailers hover very closely over one poor bride and groom who must have been absolutely mortified to look up to see to large backsides appear above them in a parachute as they were about to declare themselves wed. This aside the hotel itself was excellent, the staff were courteous and extremely friendly throughout from the moment you arrive to your departure from reception to bar staff, bell boys and star friends nothing is too much trouble. There are 5 restaurants in our opinion the Mexican was the best, the Tacos are just superb, best washed down with a Sombrero shuffle from the waiter. For the uninitiated this is a straight Tequila whilst wearing a Sombrero hat having your head shaken to chants of Tequila, T equila a special moment for a photo opportunity too! There is also the Steak House and Tropical restaurant which double up as palapa bars during the day. Shame they blocked off the outside of them at night as what this place was missing was a beachside romantic feel. There is the Japanese where the food again is excellent and a real experience seeing them do the slow cooking in front of you, albeit because of the seating not the most romantic as you are sat in groups next to each other. The buffet was extremely varied for lunch and breakfast although it did tend to get a bit repetitive and a tad bland at times, on the whole though we could not really fault the food nor service. The all inclusive really does apply here unlike some resorts we have been to where there are restrictions and time limits, even room service which we used a few times to break the nights up a bit. The rooms are very clean but basic i thought for a 5 star hotel and my wife tells me not the best for storage space. This hotel is very very active with lots going on and i would suggest ideal for families and not honeymooners looking for seclusion because there isnt any! Some of the trips are worth doing Chichen Itza gives you a taste of Mexico outside of the very Americanized tourist resort of Playa Del Carmen which unfortunately offers little of real Mexico. As a result of this tours are popular and we found them generally more expensive than most other places in the world for similar excursions. I found this a little distasteful when the tour guides and drivers are understandably canvassing for tips when the tour operators and travel companies are making so much money which it seems is not being passed on to the staff. The Dolphins trip cost $139 for what constituted an hour at best. Worth it for the experience but then another $65 for your one photo and dvd souvenir leaves a bit of a bad taste knowing the drivers and staff are paid peanuts. Mexican people are poor and the tour operators are making a killing over there exploiting profit opprotunities to the maximum by paying their staff extremely low wages at the same time as charging extremely high prices for tours. In my opinion this is opportunism and the predominantly american tourist base is seen as rich pickings and perhaps more accustomed to the tipping culture than in the UK. We met an awful lot of people on our trip and it was a truly fantastic and memorable experience that will stay with us always despite not being the best choice for honeymoon. A few hellos, Jesse and Larry from Michigan you didnt get my best Ping Pong i hope you know that i will be better prepared next time should we meet again.

My husband and myself travelled with our 17 year old daughter. We booked our trip through Signature Vacations, and we all had a wonderful time. The transfer from the airport to the resort was a small 12 passenger van, and we were kept waiting in the van at the airport for about 45 minutes with another couple. We understood that the driver was waiting for more people that were on his transfer list, but they never did show, and eventually we left. Not a huge deal, but after a long flight, we just wanted to get to the resort. The resort itself was just as we expected it to be. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The bathroom was a little small, but the shower was large with lots of hot water, and good water pressure. The bathrooms do have hairdryers, but ours only blew cold air at one speed - turbo! If you are fussy about hairdryers, I would recommend that you take your own. We were in room 2448 on the Quezal side, third floor facing the RUI next door. It was fine, plus we usually had a great show put on by the monkeys in the trees outside of our balcony each afternoon! It is a large resort, but the walk to get anywhere is very pleasant. Both the beach and the pool areas were lovely. Lots of chairs and shade in most locations. The pool was a little on the chilly side, but very refeshing once you were in it. The ocean temperature was slightly warmer, but if you have small children be aware that the waves can be pretty strong on windy days. The food was for the most part very good. People need to remember that this is a large resort, feeding many mouths, while trying to cater to many different tastes. This is not 5-star dining! We found that the food was fresh and plentiful, but after 2 weeks it did get a little boring. Our daughter is a vegetarian, and my husband has a specific food allergy. When we mentioned this to the serving staff at the a la carte restaraunts, they were always happy to accomodate us. I just read a recent post where the writer said they were not able to get breakfast before an early check out at 7 am. We were able to get a full breakfast in the Quetzal main buffet each morning starting at 6:30 am. The same buffet is also open till the wee hours for late-night food and snacks. There is always something to eat somewhere. As mentioned on this site many times before, the staff are truly fantastic. We tipped generously for all services received, although it is not expected, nor does it change the level of service, it is without a doubt appreciated. The staff all put in very long hours, and go out of their way to ensure that everyone has an enjoyable stay. The Starfriends were very entertaining and personable, and the evening shows were fun to watch after dinner. We had a couple of very minor issues with our room, but they were fixed immediately. The \"turbo\" hairdryer and the light in the shower both stopped working on the same day. We made a quick call to the front desk before dinner, and when we returned both were working perfectly. They also repaired the loose lock on the patio door, although we didn't mention it to them. We all agreed that it was a wonderful 2 week vacation, and we would definitely return for another 2 weeks next year! We will also recommend this resort to our family and friends, as we could not imagine how anyone COULD NOT have an enjoyable stay at the Iberostar Tucan/Queztal.", "Date": "February 13, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alaska", "Title": "\u201cGreat place- but plan on spending more money on extras\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4455680", "Content": "We just returned from a week at the Tucan. (Feb 3-10th) I chose the Tucan based on the reviews I read. The Tucan is indeed a wonderful place to stay- the grounds were wonderful, the staff was very friendly and the beach was beautiful. However if you want to sit by the pool better get their early as the chairs are ususally taken /reserved by 11:00 am. The food was not the best I have had but pretty good. My 17 year old son loved the buffets. If you go - make sure to make reservations for the specialty retaurants as soon as you get there. You can only reserve 3 days at a time -so don't do what I did and reserve for the end of the week. Steak house was great food and absolutely loved the service at the Italian restaurant. My 9 year old daughter loved all the animals roaming the grounds- and would like to just walk around to see them. The kids place was basically for children much younger than my daughter so she opted not to participate. If you have children 6 or younger it looks like a great place. My son and I played beach volleyball almost every morning and had a blast. The staff are great at organizing activities for the guests. We decided to opt out of the tour that the hotel offered to Chichenitza as it was pricey. Instead we opted to go to town and took the bus to the ruins for $34.00 a piece. If you choose to go this route- take a sweater as the bus is chilly- we were all cold by the time we got there (3 1/2 hour drive). Checheitza if definitely worth the ride- it is a must see. The only complaint I have- for a all- inclusive resort I think they could of included more extras. In order to use the wind surf board you had to take a lesson ($39.00 hr)unless you demonstrate you know how. If you want to go snorkling you need to sign on for a tour or walk quite a distance to a small reef. There is only a beach in front of the resort. Plus all the tours were pricey- between $77.00 - over $100 per person. But if money is not a big factor for you I would definitely recommend some of the trips they offer.

Great staff, lots of good food, beautiful pool, beach, surrounding area. No complaints. So here's some things no one else has mentioned but you might want to know about. The Tucan and the Quetzel are two halves of the same hotel. They share the pool, spa, nightclub and restaurants but have separate lobbies. From what we could tell, they are the same and it shouldn't matter which side your room is on. We arrived late afternoon in time for early dinner and it was a welcome way to end a day of traveling from New York. The beds have very firm mattresses which we loved, but some may need to get used to. Our kids joked about them at first but we all slept well each night. Bottled water is supplied in your room fridge along with soda and beer. The first day, to ease ourselves into the serenity of the place we went to the Spa for his and hers 90 minutes of massage therapy. Quiet, very clean, soft music and scented air surrounded us as we melted into the gentle but firm hands of two of the most experienced and professional therapists we ever had. If you've never had a professional massage, this is a great place to try it. If you've had one before, you won't be disappointed. It was a great way to start our first day of vacation. Our room was close to the lobby and the jungle walk down to the beach was such a nice way to get around. The Quetzel walk is very different from the Tucan walkway, so be sure you walk both of them during your trip or you will miss the flamingos, turtle and peacocks. The monkeys stay up in the trees and are fun to watch. Ladies, plan to wear flats or low heels! The lovely walkways are paved with rocky stones that are fine for sneakers, sandals and flipflops. Here's a tip I discovered the end of our week: if you must wear heels to the restaurants or near the beach, there are flat paved walkways on the outside perimeter of the hotel Tucan and Quetzel that you can use to walk safely at least part of the way. We took a bicycle ride into town one afternoon. Our guide, Luigi from Mexico City, was careful to get us across roads into town and sensitive to the riding abilities of our small group. It wasn't long before we got to Playa del Carmen's 5th Avenue, a long street with a mix of high to low end retailers. It was a good way to get a sense of the town and we came back the next day by cab to shop for a couple of hours. There's a new group of shops just a couple of blocks within walking distance of the hotel too. A half day Tulum Express tour was worth the trip. We had a tour guide for a half hour and then got to walk amid some of the ruins for 45 minutes. I wish I could thank every one of the friendly, hard working staff personally.

Every staff member went out of their way to say Hola, and to ensure you had everything you needed. Apple Vacations gave this resort 5 golden apples, the gold representing exceptional service. I have to say that I agree. The Star Friends went out of their way to try to involve everyone in activities, but didn't push if one were to decline. There were always waitresses on the beach taking drink orders, but we were always close enough to the bar that we just made the short trek ourselves. We attended 2 of the a la carte restaurants - the steak house, and the Italian restaurant. Both were wonderful. I thought the buffets were just fine. In fact, I loved the fact that one could get pancakes/french toast/waffles for breakfast, in addition to the eggs, etc. We didn't find the buffets too repetitive. The lunches offered in the pool/beach areas were very good, but of course because they were grilling, they pretty much offered the same fare everyday. The hamburgers were great! We ate lunch at the buffet on the Quetzel side once, and that was very good as well. Because this was a much needed vacation, we simply chose to spend all of our time at the beach, and didn't opt for any outside excursions. The stretch of beach where the hotel is situated is probably one of the nicest in the area. The wildlife inside the resort was a nice treat, too, although we never did see any of the monkeys. We saw the flamingos, the roosters, the parrots in the lobby, the peacocks (they even fanned out their tails for us), turtles, lizards, etc. I found the prices in the hotel giftshops to be quite reasonable. The rooms were very nice, and were always cleaned thoroughly. The public washrooms were also very clean. All in all, we definitely agree with Apple's 5 golden apples rating.

We were Married on January 14th, 2006 at the Tucan. We had 37 people with our group. The hotel took care of giving every single guest an itinerary as they checked in for the week's activities with no problem. We scheduled an extra dinner for all of our guests at the japanese restaurant, which the food was fantastic. We had a rehearsal and a dinner friday evening at the Steakhouse, again the food was very very good. The day of the wedding I had my hair done at the spa, they have a book with styles to chose from, the stylists for hair spoke very good english and they did a great job with mine and my maid of honors' hair. The flowers which I had designed and didn't see the finished product until the day of the wedding were just beautiful. They were delivered on time and to my room personally by Mariella and her assistant Mark. They picked myself and my girls up at the room and drove us to the ceremony site across the resort. We brought extra cd's of music we wanted for the ceremony, which the dj did a great job with, and played everything in the order it was requested. The judge for the ceremony spoke in spanish and Mariella translated. We had the champagne toast wich was poured and ready as we walked back through the arch at the end of the ceremony. Of course we had a ton of pictures taken and a video. About pictures, the photos turned out very well, and the photographers were very good at moving things along. The next day our pictures were ready as well as our dvd. One thing I must mention, they will put together your album for you, and it will be 5x7 prints. We had stated that we would get the smaller package, but when we showed up they had 80 pictures in the album already, and an additional ten from the cocktail party, which we liked better than some of the ones in the album. This was a bit tricky, and we felt a little taken advantage of when we left. They got us right after the wedding, and although I did want extra pictures, I didn't expect that many, and to take them out of the book they put them in would have been impossible to do at the time. It was also not possible to just buy the negatives, which they charge 3.30 us each. So we spent much more than we had allowed for. They put the pictures in the book with just a little dot of adhesive right in the middle, so the corners are free to get bent, and the spot in the middle is permanent sticky tape, so when you take them out to reinforce them you ruin the original album. Also, the 5x7 size is very difficult to find another album that is nice that holds a lot of pictures both horizontally and vertically. I suggest putting them in yourself with photo mounting supplies, I also scanned mine when I got back home at Sam's club so I can blow them up and so I have a back up disc of our photos. Just tell them a family member took them for you. Don't get me wrong, the quality was very good, and they did turn out pretty, we felt scammed into buying much more though. The dvd was actually pretty good, if you want your ceremony music in the background you will have to provide it, otherwise they will dub in whatever they think during some of the video. After photos we splurged and thew a cocktail party with an open bar and a mariachi band. It was held by the tropical restaurant over looking the ocean and it was beautiful. I brought extra decorations and margarita mix favors and Mariella did a great job putting it together they way we wanted. Then we went to a confrence room for a private reception. It was worth every single penny. We had one of the gala dinner menus and added the open bar for three hours. The tables were set with formal place settings and floral arrangements on each table. We had also given place cards to Mariella and there was a seperate table for them, then guests went to find there tables, which were numbered by sea shells instead of normal numbers. The seashells we in the flower arrangements for us, done by the florist. We also brought sand dollar cookies and one was placed at each place setting.We chose the grouper and filet menu, the food was actually the best I have ever had at any reception I have ever been to. We were served appitizers at our seats, also a lobster bisque with salmon ravioli, first the gouper then the filet, each had side items with them, and the dinner also included a dessert. Our cake was a two tier vanilla with fesh strawberries slices in between the layers, with a white chocolate foundant icing. They did a simple decoration for us with rose petals cascading down the cake. The cake actually tasted fantastic, so good that we wanted more the next day. They will put the leftover cake in the main buffet refridg and you just talk to the manager the next day and they will serve you the cake! What service! Our guests were greeted at the entrance of the reception with a welcome margarita, served by one of the staff, not just sitting on the table waiting for us, the table was also decorated. The DJ was very good, the music was loud enough and the dance floor was plenty big enough for about thirty people to dance on. We brought a cd of various dinner music, as well as dance music we wanted played during the reception. The DJ did great and even asked us to make copies of our cd's for future use! Mariella was with us the entire day and also the night before with our rehearsal and dinner. She was just fantastic to work with, when she said goodbye that night I was actually sad, she was so helpful and worked so hard to help our day be perfect. I can honestly say that the resort did a fantastic job, and exceeded my expectations. It was more than I could have dreamed it to be. If you are considering having your wedding there, the quality is fantastic, great service, they only do one wedding a day, which is great and more personal than a wedding factory, your not rushed and they will do anything you ask them. We went all out for our guests with lots of extras and a ton of extra requests, the resort didn't fail us once. From the front desk staff to the servers, the florist, the DJ, and Mariella and Mark it was all perfect. The resort itself was beautiful, the pool was large and clean everyday, we thought the food was very good, and so were the drinks, they will make you anything you ask for. We ate at the buffet one night, the japanese the mexican, the steakhouse, and thought our meals at all of them were just great, the house wines were bad either. We had a suite with an ocean view, a corner room,#2032, and it was beautiful, worth the extra space if you need it for dresses and bridesmaids, otherwise the regular size rooms were just fine.

At the end of the week I was getting a little full of the slushie cream drinks (everything has pina colada mix in it), and Leo at the pool bar made a purple drink to die for.

Favorite alacarte restaurants - the Mexican place was great, good food and entertainment. The Japanese was awesome, 32 of us went together to that one and they put on quite a show! The wedding banquet was in the steakhouse, but I had salmon. The salmon was wonderful, and the wedding cake was scrumptious. Playacar is pretty cool, it's like a little hotel village with many big resorts. A few shops in the middle of Playacar had everything you would find in Playa del Carmen so we didn't even go to Playa del Carmen. We did one tour to Cancun on the Friday night - a pirate ship steak & lobster dinner cruise. This was a fun time, though it says the eating areas are air conditioned and ours wasn't. Good food though. If you are prone to sea sickness, just make sure you eat upstairs instead of staying down below. Otherwise, the ride was smooth and quite entertaining.

We have also travelled to other resorts in Cuba, Dominican Republic, Florida etc. Anyway, about the Tucan. We were very happy with this resort. Beach: Beautiful white sand and lots of chairs available. The ocean was a bit rough when we were there but it didn't stop us from swimming. Only a few local walk by vendors and they were more interseting than a problem. Room: Very clean and plenty of towels. We were in a building (number 11) very close to the pool/beach area. We don't go on vacation to spend it in the room so what can I say. Lots of drinks in the fridge but the bar wasn't far away and I'd rather be outside. Staff: All very friendly. We always tipped the maid, waiters and bar tenders. They work very hard to please everyone. We had no problems at all. Pool: Very big and clean. I'm not much of a pool guy because I like the beach and ocean. Can do the pool thing any place. My kids did get me into the pool though and it wasn't nearly as cold as I expected! Food: I'm not much of a gourmet cuisine critic. I didn't have to cook or clean for a week. There was a great variety and we did the specialty restaurants so what can I say.......the food was just fine as far as I'm concerned. Shows: Great for the kids and entertainment for the adults and kids. The Star Friends work hard all day and then continue to put on a show for the guests. If you want local \"big name\" professionals I'm sure you could find some in town. We were just fine with hanging out, relaxing and having fun. (much more fun than TV for the week). Outside activities: We ran along the main street just outside our resort gate in the morning. It was great as there were sidewalks. Traffic wasn't bad anyway. We visited Xel-Ha and did the COBA jungle tour and enjoyed both. Scuba: My wife and I are active divers and wanted to get a dive or two in on this trip. There is a dive store on site. I spoke to the staff there who were all very friendly and great to talk with. As the ocean was quite rough we never made it out. There were a number of calm days while we were there but of course those were the days we had paid for our off site tours! There's always next year.

For reference, we are professionals in our late 20s. We have been to Playa before, but this was our first AI experience. Overall, we really enjoyed the resort although the weather could have been nicer (3 rainy days and 2 windy days). We booked through Apple tours and were happy with the charter flight and transportation to the hotel (as well as the price). Location- Second to last resort on south end of Playacar, near the Rius and Gala. Room- We were in buliding 1500, located mid-resort across from the entertainment palapa and the rooster hangout, making it noisy at night. Building 1000 was located on the beach. Room was simple and the bed was firm but comfortable. Fridge with soda, water and beer restocked daily. Good maid service and quick room service (sandwiches in 15 minutes). Food- Not gourmet, but enjoyable. We are healthy eaters and found there were options for us (but with all the other great food we went off our diets a few days). We ate at the beach palapa for breakfast and lunch. Lunch was grilled meat, pizza, salad, soups. There is also the option to have a more elaborate breakfast and lunch at the buffet, but I hated to leave the beach. Our favorite specialty rest. was Japanese(hibachi and sushi), followed by Mexican and then the steakhouse. You are given 3 reservations per 7 nights, but you can go on a waiting list for extra nights (we were able to get an extra Sat. night at the Japanese). The house wines and champagne are better than I expected. Beach and pool- Plenty of lounge chairs in the shade. Nice beach. The hot tub at the pool was not hot! We never made it to the swim up bar (usually too cold), but there was always lots of laughter coming from there. Activities- A lot to choose from. I did the salsa and step classes...they are only 30 min. long, though they were fun. Fiance played futbol. We worked out almost daily at the gym (treadmill, eliptical, stairmaster, bikes plus weights). Tennis courts looked nice. Entertainment- Star friends were fun. Shows were cheesy, but we liked the audience participation ones. We had fun at the nightclub, but they usually played American music rather than salsa. Town- $5 taxi each way. Chic and international, if you can believe it. We love Yaxche, the Mayan restaurant. The massages at Itza spa were wonderful. Overall, we liked the resort. Personally, I more enjoyed the seclusion of the smaller resort we stayed at last year, Las Palapas, located walking distance to town (north of town)...which somehow was a less expensive trip, even with nightly dinners out in the town.

We cannot understand how this hotel received an above average rating. We are in our mid 30s and have traveled around the world based upon Tripadvisor reviews and have never been disappointed until this trip. This hotel is nothing more than a 2 or 3* hotel. I will start with the positive. STAFF: The staff is exceptionally friendly, warm, attentive and cheerful. Some of the nicest personalities in hotel staff that we have encountered. ROOMS:The rooms were very clean. The maid did an excellent job each and every day. The bed was comfortable. There are blackout curtains. There were plenty of fresh towels and toilet paper. The TV worked well. Movies were available to rent (if one wanted). The lobby is very pretty. The large pool is tremendous and pretty. The beach is stunning and well-kept. (Though many adult hotel guests feed the seagulls - right in the middle of where everyone is relaxing about on the beach! We witnessed different adults doing this every day) Now the negatives: FOOD: We would never stay at an Iberostar Hotel again for the reason that the food was truly awful. Yes, there was a large selection and an unlimited quantity, but it was of very, very poor quality. If you appreciate fine dining, this place is NOT for you. (For example, the restaurant that was considered \"the best\" was a Benihana-style place where the \"chef\" cooks \"Japanese-style\" in front of you.) It appears that everything at the hotel is frozen food that has been defrosted and reheated, including pizza, hamburgers, chicken hot dogs, etc. The orange juice and other juices have large quantities of water added to them. I guess this is to decrease the cost of pure juice. The breads lack flavor. They are obviously not homemade. It was basically food that I had at camp as a kid. We were shocked and truly disappointed. One night, we \"ate\" at the Italian restaurant. The pasta was overcooked, the meat in the lasagna was of low quality, and the sauce was worse than Prego. I could not believe that it was possible to mess up a lasagna! While the \"Italian pastries\" looked very pretty, they too had no flavor and were simply stale. The jello was in an almost completely liquid state. We left hungry because the food was just horrible. If you live in a major metropolitan area or if you simply appreciate quality food, this is not the hotel for you! DRINKS: Barely any alcohol whatsoever- even when we asked for \"extra\" and tipped! Low end alcohol. While plenty of beer on tap, it was surprisingly of poor quality too. We couldn't even pay for better quality if we wanted - they just didn't offer it. ROOMS: Very basic rooms with foam cushions on the chairs. While they had internet access to check email from the TV, it took an extraordinarily long time to process everything. I can only compare it to dial-up in the late 90s. \"SWIM-UP BAR\" POOL: Aside from the fact that it is a separate small pool, it was humorously disgusting. It appeared dirty. It did not help that the people who were there each (and every) day looked like the middle age alcoholics that you find in seedy bars (ie missing teeth or very yellowed teeth, heavy smokers, trashy mouths, etc). It was a sight to see - from afar! STAFF: This is not actually a negative, but simply a surprise. The hotel is highly promoted and advertised in English speaking countries. However, most of the staff have a very limited English vocabulary. As the hotel is located in a Spanish speaking country, it was not disturbing in any way, just surprising and unusual. In most large hotel chains, we have often found that the hotel staff members spoke excellent English. Despite the \"glowing\" reviews, this is only a 2-3* resort geared towards people who generally frequent fast food establishments and/or basic chain restaurants.", "Date": "January 31, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Medford Lakes, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cBest Hotel in Playacar\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4399033", "Content": "I absolutly love iberostar tucan.

Overall, we found the resort to be beautiful (despite the damage to the jungle which was no biggie) and our daughter loved all of the animals (monkeys, tucan, flamingos, roosters, etc.). The rooms: The first night we were in building 25 on the Quetzal side because of an issue with our reservation and this building was about halfway between the pool and main buffet restaurant. The second night we moved to building 12 on the Tucan side and were a lot closer to the pool/beach area. Would highly recommend to families with small children that you either stay in buildings 10-13 on the Tucan side or the equivalent on the Quetzal side or you will be walking a long way to the beach/pool with all of your gear. Note to parents of small children - the rooms have wonderful large showers but no bathtubs. We tipped our housekeeper about 20 pesos per day and were greeted with towel animals, balloon animals, and many other special touches each day. The location: Be prepared to walk a lot regardless - wherever your room is since the beach and the lobby/main buffet restaurant are a decent walk - although the jungle makes it fun/interesting. The hotel is about a 5-10 minute walk to a small shopping plaza within Playacar and an equivalent taxi ride to 5th Avenue (downtown Playa del Carmen) and both were fun. The hotel is about a 45 minute ride from the airport. The food: The food was fine but got old by about day 5. We agreed this was probably because they were trying to have something for everyone (there were people there from all around the world) but a few nights the fajitas looked like meats from the previous nights re-done. We ate at the Mexican restaurant and the Japanese restaurant and enjoyed both. The pool/beach: Absolutely beautiful. Huge beach with lots of white sand, crystal clear water, and plenty of chairs. The pool was a little chilly but to be expected in late January when the evenings are cooler. We had no problems getting chairs at the pool at any time. Overall we felt it was good value for the price we paid.

The employees are smiling and helpful: no bad attitude here. Plenty of opportunities to meet new people or be left alone, it's your choice. Resort is ideally designed with a central pathway surrounded by a mini jungle of strutting peacocks, ducks, swans and toucans so as you walk from pool to main lobby you are entertained by the local birds and swirling fountains.

Actually, our reservations were for the Tucan, but our room was technically on the Quetzal side of the resort. The two sides are identical and you can use all the facilities on the property. Room - We had an oceanfront junior suite. The room was clean, but smaller than we had expected. It paled in comparison to the junior suite at Cap Juluca, but that's a different class of resort. The bathroom was also rather cramped, but the shower was large. The water pressure was good in the shower. Although the minibar was to be refilled every other day, it never was, but we could've called to get service if we needed to. Food - We ate at the buffet two nights, the steakhouse (Marimba) one night and the japanese restaurant (Bonsai) the other night. The steakhouse was disappointing. I had the ribeye (1/2 inch thick) and my wife had the filet. Both were very well done despite our request for medium. Bonsai was very good. The food was prepared in front of you (like Benihana) and was very tasty. Our cook wasn't as entertaining as some of the other chefs, but the food was delicious. The buffet was hit and miss. Most of the meats were cooked through, but some of the items were very tasty. The presentation of the buffet was very nice. The breakfast buffet was very good at the main restaurant, mediocre at the pool restaurants. One more note on food, their hamburger/hotdog buns were awful, and since that was the mainstay of their lunch buffet, lunch was disappointing. We never went to the main restaurant for lunch. Pool - The pool was beautiful and very clean, but rather cold. The hot tub was only a couple of degrees warmer than the pool. The poolside drink service was quick, and there are enough bars poolside that getting a drink was very easy. The drinks were not strong, but simply asking for more liquor in a drink solved that problem. Their were plenty of chairs poolside, but many people ignored the signs about reserving chairs. Their were a lot of european tourists there, and I don't know if they didn't get the word on the danger of smoking, but they all seemed to smoke... and we're not big fans of smoking. Beach - The beach was clean and thier were plenty of chairs and umbrellas available. Topless sunbathing is permitted on the beach and their were a few takers. Again, the drink service on the beach was good. Entertainment - we didn't go to any of the shows. The resort itself was very clean.

Service --------- The best thing about the resort was not the facilities, location or the food - but the service. The service is totally exceptional - the best we have ever experienced. The star friends, bartenders, waiters and the rest of the staff are very friendy. Customer Satisfaction is their top priority. They never say \"No\" to anything :) They will try to fulfil your request - as long as its a reasonable one :) - or at least they will go the extra mile to try to resolve your issue. Food ------ Food is very good and the quality and variety is good too. To be honest, we got a bit bored with the buffets and tried 4 out of the 5 a la carte restaurants. Our order of preference was Grill, Japanese, Italian and then Mexican. We looked at the tropical menu and instead did the Grill one Twice. Entertainment ------------- Overall very entertaining and funny. A few shows were a bit cheezy - but even they feel funny if you have a few drinks with it. Kids ----- It was full of Kids. Lots of activities. Staff is great with kids. Lost to do. My daughter loved the pools and the beach and the kids shows. Baby Sitter service was very reliable - we sneaked to the Disco while our daughter was sleeping. Rooms ------ Very clean. Try to get a room at the end of the resort near the main pool and the beach. We got very lucky as during check-in I requested one as my wife is pregnant and I was with a 2 year old. The girl on the reception went out of the way and did her best. Value ------ Worth every penny. Excellent value. Recommended Cocktail --------------------- - Mojito's made by Luis at the beach Bar. Pool and Beach --------------- - Lots of Pools with a great location. - Bar Service at the Beach - you cant go wrong - Motorized and Other water sports Theme Songs ------------ \"Dale palla\" and \"Hey baby\" are the theme songs - very catchy and good to dance to every night. Tips ----- Tip the staff in dollars - they deserve it and will appreciate it. Trips ------ We did 2 half day trips to Tulum and 5th Avenue. These are a must to get the most of your trip. Tulum was quite an experience and 5th Avenue is great for shopping. Post-Wilma ---------- I could not tell the difference apart from 2 things - a few rooms were being worked on the Quetzal area and the jungle's vegetation and palm trees are effected - they will grow with time. So if you are looking for a place to relax and are looking for exceptional service - the Iberostar Tucan is the place for you. Have a nice trip !!

We've been to other all inclusives, and feel this is one of the best. The size is perfect, not too big where you need a trolley to get to the pool, big enough to provide new vistas each day. Has a jungle theme with natural vegetation, animals everywhere, thatched roofs, waterfalls. The service is so awesome, we were consistently treated like visiting celebrities. We never lacked for anything, our room was beautiful, bar service great, restuarant staff well trained and always pleasant. Be sure to walk over to Playacar for local shopping, then take a taxi ($5 dollars) to Playa Del Carmen for world class shopping along with streets of vendors ready to haggle for those 'bargains'. Then take the ferry from there to Cozumel, the boat ride alone is worth it. ($10 each way, 30 minutes). We also toured Tulum, closer than Chichen Itza, there's shopping there also. Highly recommend the5 hour Catamaran ride. That was the best part of our whole vacation; they fed us, took us snorkeling on a reef, and we saw the sun set while sailing with dolphins jumping along side the boat. Tip your maid $2/day, the wait staff if you want to. The Star Friends will keep you entertained all day long, ending with a nightly show (corny, funny, be sure to volunteer for the guest participation!)

I can\u2019t imaging being in USA during hurricane. (US workers would not risk there union membership and save us). I will not repeat good stories about how wonderful Tucan was before Wilma. I will tell you what happened during and after Wilma. So on Thursday slid a piece of paper under our door and said to move to a second or third floor and put our mattress over our windows until the storm was over. However since our room was in building second to the water we had a choice ether to evacuate to DISCO that served as a shelter or to move to another room that was occupied by a women from Canada. We have chose a women- and it was a wise decision. Nobody excepted that we had to stay in the rooms from Thursday at 6pm until Sunday morning. We were told to go to bathroom and spend the night there. We put the beds up to the windows to help stop the windows smashing in. But stories from DISCO were so much horrifying: roof was liking, people were horrified. But we were extremely grateful to the whole staff for how they handled everything. During the worst of the storm, they were still bringing us food, juice, and fruit. (With a smile on their face, no less). Sunday morning they opened the buffet. They did the best they could with water and electricity, considering they were running on a generator. There are were no erosion of the beach. In fact, Wilma deposited much more sand on the beach, so we were enjoying extra 5 days (by the way Hotel did not charge us for extra stay). The worst I can say about those 5 days after Wilma was the fact we did not know when we will be back home. Tuesday, 2 days after hurricane, Europeans started to leave us to Merida- 6 our drive. And it was very depressing for us US citizens. People from US could go to airport only with a boarding pass that we could get in some Mexican college about one hour drive from Cancun Airport. And as you can imaging that bottle neck effect where about 30K people trying to get to Airport with only one terminal and one runway working 6 hours a day. I did not want to stay in line for 12 hours so I got ticket from Mexican Airline where only 3-5 people stayed in line. So we left Tucan at 11 am Friday to Mexico City and then arrived back from the Iberostar Tucan late Friday night after surviving Hurricane Wilma.

I went on holiday with a group of 19 as a wedding party (a lucky wedding party as marriage took place day before wilma) our group was a mixture of young and old and truly there was something special for all ages. On arrival we were instantly more than impressed with hotel and our room which was on the quetzal side, we quickly unpacked and made our way to the pool, which was very large always clean and had many parts that were child friendly, at first the place seems vast but after finding your feet it becomes a lot easier to find your way around, the walk through the jungle path to the pool/beach is really nice and the kids loved the monkeys (yes i know post wilma the vegetation took a battering,but on the bright side the monkeys were far more easier to see. Think autumn jungle??) The beach was lovely, which never seemed over crowded, the beach was actually nicer post wilma. due to hurricane we only managed two speciality restaurants the italian and the japenese the service and food were excellent in both, but the japensese was really special you must give it a go. The food in the buffet was also excellent and had a very large choice with steak, chicken breasts, shrimp, carverys etc etc even the most pickiest eaters will find something. i found breakfast was also very good with made to order omelettes and hot fresh pancakes and waffles. The one thing i would say about this hotel is that the level of service was the best i have ever experienced, in the restaurants, the bars at the pool, the staff were always happy to help and always worked with a smile before during and after wilma, i suggest you take a large amount of dollar bills with you for tipping but dont get me wrong there is no need to tip the level of service was always top notch tipping or not, but believe me you WILL want to reward the staff for the excellent service you receive. other highlights were the swim up bar (and yes people do get out to use the toilet???) the shows were also very good and were in the conference centre advantage being that it was lovely and air-conditioned, the kids club was good but only aimed at under 7. A big thank you to all the staff and workers who led us through the hurricane and worked so hard afterwards. DO NOT have any doubts about going to this hotel post wilma apart from the vegetation you will not know a hurricane had hit this hotel as so many things had been fixed, replaced prior us being evacuated to dom.rep to the occidental allegro and that was a different story altogether!

We were on the 3rd floor and remained in our room. However we did get flooding in the room 2 nites and everyone on the floor worked to help everyone keep the rooms emptied of water and the drains in the halls open and on the roof.

He visited with the staff and any quests who wished to meet him. The downtown area was also quickly getting repairs and ATM's and banks back up as well as the shops. The hotel had done a fantastic job. Even the steak house was back open and the Japanese restaurants. For us and many the most stressful part was the waiting for know when we could fly out.

Unfortunately Wilma destroyed everything that was endearing about the resort. The jungle was thinned out by Hurricane Emily earlier in the season. Wilma finished the job. The buildings suffered little damage compared to the lanscape. The beach was great even after the Hurricane. There was a lot of debris, but the staff worked hard to clean it up. They were busy cleaning and repairing roofs the day after the storm. They opened the Tulum buffet and tried to make us feel as normal as possible. I have nothing but good things to say about the Tucan Staff. Some of them actually risked their own safety to bring us food during the Hurricane. I don't know many people that would do that!

The resort is beautiful with a large variety of wildlife (monkeys, peacocks, capybaras, iguanas, and turtles to name a few) making their home in the lush jungle. My niece and nephew would have loved it. The food at the buffet was exceptional. I am a very picky eater and I always found something that would suit me.

We only went to 2 al la carte restaurants and we were not overly impressed. The beach was spectacular! We would spend most of our day at the beach. Even though we arrived early enough to get a palappa, I preferred to get an umbrella and move closer to the water. The water was awesome and because of the hurricane, the waves were powerful. I actually enjoyed being thrashed about by the waves. The pool was nice but I am an ocean person. However, I still made sure to take a dip in the pool at least once a day. The adult pool bar seemed like a good idea, but we decided not to use it. When you think of it, these people were drinking all day long and no one was going to the bathroom. It\u2019s quite apparent that they must have been taking leaks right in the pool. I can only hope that the resort is using high dosages of chlorine. The bar at the beach was where we got most of our drinks. Also, the restaurant closest to the beach was great for an afternoon snack and beverage. We went on one excursion to Chichen Itza. Just so you know, it is a 3 hour ride to get there. It was nice and swimming in the cenote was fun but if I had known that we would be spending 6 hours in a van, I would have passed. During the hurricane, we were lucky enough to not have to be evacuated. The staff risked their lives to bring us food and water. We could not have been in a better situation. As soon as the storm passed (after sitting on top of the Yucatan Peninsula for more than 2 days!) the hotel worked quickly on getting things back to normal. If we ever go back to Mexico(definitely not during hurricane season), I would not even think of giving another resort our business.

I just had to add an article praising the staff and management of the hotel during the difficlut times we had over the last week or so - they were magnificent! We arrived on the 14th October, and were very impressed with the hotel complex, good beach, good pool, plenty of bars and restuarants, all a very high standard. With waiter/waitress service - even on the beach! Well, that's our priorities covered... Unfortunately, 5 days into the holiday an univited guest appeared on the horizon - Hurricane Wilma. The hotel was prepared for the inevitable event, and all guests were moved to safe areas for the three days. During this time, those staff that volounteered to stay (the majority of them) looked after all of us, and even managed to deliver food and drinks to our rooms (where we had taken refuge) during the hurricane - and even managed a smile and a song as they did so! We eventually got out of our rooms on Sunday, and were able to see the damage to the hotel and the local area - we just thanked ourselves that we had chosen the Iberostar Tucan. It held up very well compared to most other hotel complexes, to the point where we would have been happy to complete our holiday for the rest of the week is it could have been possible. Once the bad weather has passed, the staff began to very quickly get the hotel back up and running with minimal disruption to guests, making sure the main buffet restuarant was back online 24 hours a day, and providing access to all rooms and the beach as a priority. Unfortunately, the Mexican infrastructure did not fare well, affecting main power and water supplies, so the hotel was forced to close within a week or so as the hotels own stored supplies would only provide for this. We had to leave on Wednesday morning, and return to the UK via Dominican Republic (although gaining 2 days there en route). Fantastic hotel, great staff/service, in my view, pick of the resorts in the Playacar area - as we did get to look around many of the other hotels. I would recommend a visit here, but have to add that with the recent climate changes, we should all consider a safer time of year. Dave.

The Tucan is fantastic! The hotel lobby and reception area are extremely clear and have an \"out in the open\" feeling without you acutally feeling exposed. The grounds (before the hurricane) were excellent and full of wildlife. They have monkeys living in the grounds aswell as flamingos (Queztal side), peacocks and other glorious animals. There are two normal buffet restaurants (which serve an excellent selection of food, if with a slightly american flavour to it) and five speciality restaurants (however I did not get to try this due to Wilma). I would recommend that if you eat in a buffet restaurant, that you chose the one on the Queztal side, merely for the fact that it has its own waterfall and swans! Although it is worth pointing out that the food is the same whichever side you chose. The rooms are a decent size and kept extremely clean by the staff (it is adivisable to leave the odd 100 peso tip here and there) and the minibar is kept topped up. The only thing really wrong with the rooms is that the beds are very hard and there are no British TV channels (mainly american) but you probably won't want to spend too much time in your room anyway! The pool is massive and is very nice and warm, disappointly the pool bar is in a seperate pool next to the main one, but is also very nice and well laid out. The beach location is excellent which leads me to which block you should be asking for. Ask for block 11 on the first floor! It is close to the pool, the beach and two of the speciality restaurants. The main buffet restaurant is only a short walk away and will help you keep some of the weight you will be gaining off! All of the buffet staff were very friendly and kept topping up our drinks and I don;t have a bad word to say about any of them.... Even after the hurricane, they were busy fixing the hotel and made sure our stay was as comfortable as possible. My only criticism.... they weren't preparing for a hurrican as big as Wilma even though there were plenty of warnings on CNN, however, they recovered magnificantly. Would I go again? Of course I would, but not in the hurricane season.... The only other thing to say is that there is literally nothing to do outside of the hotel of a night time unless you take a cab down to fifth avenue, however I didn;t get a chance to visit it and was quite happy with the hotel facilities", "Date": "October 28, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia, USA", "Title": "\u201cTucan - Great as ever\u201d", "Author": "BobATL", "ReviewID": "UR4055102", "Content": "We thoroughly enjoyed our 2nd stay at the Tucan October 15-19. We visited last June for 11 days with our family of four and my wife suggested we return without the kids for her birthday. We enjoyed the experience without kids as much as we did with the whole family. Not having younger children to watch, we spent more time on the beach than previously (rather than the pool). Both the beach and the pool are very enjoyable. The sand is white, the water is beautiful and the people are friendly. This time of year, it is no problem to get a spot at the pool or beach. You had to \"reserve\" a chair first thing when we were there in June. We did go back to the pool every day this trip to watch the water aerobics and sing \"Delapalla\" and \"Hey Baby\". What we enjoy about the Tucan: - The service with a smile, every employee is happy to attend to your needs and give you a friendly \"Hola\" as they walk by. - The Starfriends, they really make the stay enjoyable, they work long days and are the heartbeat of the resort. Sure, the shows are not world class, but the do a great job keeping you entertained. - The activities, my wife enjoyed yoga each day and we both had a number of massages by the pool. When the kids were here, we also took out the catamarans and the sea kayaks. - We didn't need it this time, but the Kids Club is great. Our 4 and 7 year olds loved going back each day. - The international crowd. There is a nice mix of Europeans, Americans and some Latin Americans. This makes for meeting a lot of interesting people from all over. - The town of Playa. 5th Avenue has great shopping and excellent places to hang out for cocktails & people watching. - The grounds - From the monkeys in the trees to the well kept grounds, always clean beach and pool area to the beauty of the lobbies and walkways. - The deal \u2013 The price to value ratio is excellent for this resort. We can afford to pay more, but I struggle to find a reason I should. The food is generally very good, but the buffets can get a little old during a long stay. Go into town for a change of pace, with the rates you pay at the Tucan, you can afford to eat off property a few times. I have to say that they were a little late to make a big deal out of the Hurricane. We left the Wednesday before it hit and the only sign of the hurricane was a bulletin from Thomas Cook Travel in German warning of the impending Hurricane. I am not sure if your travel agency or the resort are really responsible for getting the info out. It did not impact us, as we got out on time.

Since these are the only two places I have been (both All Inclusives), I will do my comparison. To be honest, I liked the Palladium much better. My biggest complaint was the food. I thought the food at Palladium was much better. I also didn't like the fact that the buffets were open air. The thought of all the food sitting out in the 95 degree heat for hours made my uneasy. There was no way to get away from the heat other than going to your room. The pool buffets did not have wait serivice at the Tucan. At the Palladium you would sit downa and someone would come over to get your drink order, then the food was in air conditioning, but you still got to sit outside. I loved that set up! Maybe it was teh time of year, I don't know. The maid service was supurb at the Tucan and the Palladium as was the service in general. The entertainment at night was a lot better at the Palladium. The shows at Tucan were very \"cheesey\". Although I will have to say they had some very GOOD LOOKING dancers at the Tucan. Bernardo especially, Phew! Since it was a girls trip, we didn't leave the resort so I cannot comment on any excursions. We never went into town either. We always felt safe though. The drinks were very good and plenty at both the Tucan and Palladium. I would not say the drinks were weak, we definitely felt the alcohol that night and, unfortunatley, the next morning! We ordered room service twice and it was just ok. The deserts rocked though! My husgand and I are going back to the new Palladium White Sands resort that opens in December of this year, in March with other family and friends.

We all had a fantastic time. The resort is beautiful and there are so many activities I don't think anyone could ever be bored there. I'll list my review to cut it short as I could write ten pages about our wonderful visit! Cancun Airport: Take note, after you get your bags just walk out the door to get your ride to the hotel. Be warned that there are tons of salespeople trying to get your attention to get a 'ride' to the hotel. They are only trying to sell you something. Playacar: The resort is inside a gated community called 'Playacar'. It is very beautiful inside this area. There are homes and resorts located in here. I tried to find out how many hotels and I got different answers from locals, so I'm guessing between 10-15 resorts. There is a nice outdoor mall and a pretty golf course on the premises. We all felt very comfortable walking around the area at night. The Tucan Grounds: The landscaping is gorgeous. I can only imagine how beautiful it must have been before the hurricane hit a few months back. There is evidence of jungle damage, but you have to look hard to see it. There are wonderful animals to see everywhere you go. There is always staff around constantly cleaning. Everything sparkles. The Pool: It is very big and pretty. The temperature is a little on the warm side. It always looked nice and clean. It's big enough to swim around or play a game of ball with another person. I took an aerobics class one day in the pool, and all of the attendees had a blast. The staff try hard to make all the activities fun. To get a lounge chair you should get there before the afternoon. People have staked most of the chairs by then. The Beach: Was beautiful. It isn't huge, but it's so gorgeous that it makes up for lack of area. The water was crystal clear blue. The sand was kept very clean. Some straws and cig butts in there, but staff was out every morning picking these items up with their hands. There were plenty of loungers. We never had a problem getting a place to sit for the day. We got an umbrella everyday from the towel hut. Drinks: The frozen drinks were a little weak. Just ask for a double and it comes back perfect! Food: We liked the buffet best. The specialty restaurants that we tried were fine, but the buffet had a good selection of food so we were always content finding something to eat. We only saw one themed night at the buffet, it was Thursday Seafood night and that's when they serve lobster tails. Rooms: They were comfortable and nice. The maid we had kept our room spotless. Our friends said their's was always immaculate too. We had towel art every day...so did they. We had a fantastic view from our room, 1246. There's a little balcony (I think) in every room that consists of a small table and two chairs. You should try to get a room that faces into the resort as it's a much better view from all the buildings. The Staff: Were so very nice. Always smiling, and hard workers. We made two special friends there, Rosalino and Rosario. We wish them the best of luck in the future!!! The Shows: Were fun. Yes, they were corny and don't expect Broadway or West End quality, but they were entertaining and it was nice to have a silly laugh at the end of a wonderful day in the hot sun! Playa Del Carmen: Can be fun. We ended up calling it Pester Del Carmen because the store workers get very annoying trying to get you inside. That was on 5th Ave. We spent most of our time by the beach. There are some really fun restaurants and bars to go to there. Tours: We went to Xel-Ha, Speedboating, ATV'ing and to Tulum. They were all great places. One thing I would change is not go to Xel-Ha for a complete day. It started out fun but became a very long day being there from 9-5. You can't leave when you want because you're at the mercy of a coach. Unless something bad happens to you, or you are extremely picky, or you are a well seasoned 'AI' person, I don't see how you could possibly have a bad time here or even complain about it. The Tucan was a blast, we had a wonderful time. Have fun!!! Any questions? I'll be happy to answer what I can.

For those of you reading this and wondering whether or not to book this hotel please do. The grounds are wonderful, so many animals just wandering around. The beach is imaculate. We never had a bad meal during our stay, we ate in all five of the restaurants and both buffets (also sampled the room service on a couple of occasions). Our rep said during our welcome meeting on the first day that you could even get sprouts for breakfast and it was true, so much choice and so little time. Of the restaurants our favorite was the japanese, even if your not keen on japanese food you have to give it a go just to experience it. I have to say that I was a little disappointed with the mexican, I felt that there menu was lacking a little although the food was lovely. The rooms are quite big and thankfully air-conditioned, we did get towel art and chocolates but not everyday. The shower is absolutely huge!!!!. All the staff were fantastic could not do enough for you. The star friends are entertaining but you can keep out of there way if you want to. While we were there the theatre was out of use, so all the evening entertainment was held in the conference centre. We only really went to a couple of shows in the evening because of this, often we stayed by the pool tables instead. Finally if you are looking at this as a possable wedding destination, do it!!!!!!. Mariela (the wedding co-ordinator) was great. We had a choice of venue for the wedding either the beach, the jungle or by the flamingo pool. We opted for the beach, and although there was a bit of a crowd gathered, it was fantastic. The hotels photo shop provided the photographers and the photos were lovely. I hope this helps anyone planning there holiday at the tucan.", "Date": "October 2, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Louis, MO USA", "Title": "\u201cfantastic!\u201d", "Author": "Kenny&Diane", "ReviewID": "UR3983755", "Content": "I cannot say enough about this resort.

The other all -inclusives that we have stayed at in recent years are the Wyndham Rose Hall in MOBay, and Allegro in Turks and Caicos. Using these resorts as a benchmark, here is my opinion of the Tucan. PROS: Airport experience-quick and thorough Food -very good. Lobster buffet on Thurs. was delicious and plentiful. We ate at Japanese (fair), Mexican (very good), Tropical (very good), Steakhouse (very good). We appreciated eating in an air conditioned restaurant because it was VERY HOT! (It's summer in Mexico, no surprise there!) Pool- beautiful even though my family didn't swim in it Ocean- beautiful teal, green and aqua colors. Not as beautiful as the beach at Turks and Caicos, though! Staff- Very friendly...one of the reasons I would go back. I emailed the resort right after hurricane in July and was promptlyand honestly given answers to my concerns about the condition of the property. Also, asked for rooms close to the beach and received them. Room-clean and comfortable. Never slept better at a hotel...even with its firm mattress. Grounds- spectacular & unique. You would not have known that a hurricane had gone through one month before. Even my eldest son commented that the grounds were the most beautiful he has ever seen for a resort and he has been to other Caribe Islands and Hawaii. Bars- convenient beach and grill bars (day) & relaxing lobby bar (night) CONS: Beach- VERY CROWDED. Inconsiderate Europeans (surprise! not Americans) shouting at their kids, talking very loudly & smoking in our faces while we were trying to relax under the palapas. \"Reserving\" lounges under the palapas AND surfside. (4 people taking 8 chairs). Lots of topless women and \"speedo\" -wearing men. Material for conversation and laughs! Entertainment- very cheesy. Reminded us of skits that my sons performed at Boy Scout meetings. The only redeeming factor was that the convention center was air conditioned. Gym- very poor equipment. My sons walked in and walked right out. Too bad! They could have used the exercise after all the eating and drinking they did. :) So could I! We would love to revisit the Tucan in the future, but want to try other beaches of the Caribbean first. We would definitely stay at another Iberostar and are looking into staying at one of the Iberostars in the Dominican Republic next summer.

I'll give them the benefit of the doubt due to the temp location, but if fifty people a night stayed for the show that was a lot. The food was wonderful in every location we ate, and even though we weren't going to eat at the Japanese restaurant I'm glad we did.

The eliptical machines will only allow you to use it for 11 minutes at a time, bring gloves because the weights are full of rust, etc. We started running off the property, and it is 1.5 miles from the gates to the town of Playa Del Carmen, which is a nice round trip run.

The Japanese restaurant had great food, but was too noisy for a Japanese restaurant. Mexican, Italian, Steakhouse were good. Seafood restaurant wasn't so good as the others.

You can do everything: beach volley, water polo, scuba diving, aquagym, parasailing, jet sky, one time there was a dancing contest right in the beach, you can play lots of tradicional mexican games, etc. The beach is beautiful, with the cleanest water that I've ever seen. The pool it's ok. It's a shame that the pool bar is separeted from the main pool. The thing that I liked the most, besides from the beach voley, was the disco, being me a 15 year-old boy. Lots of people in the disco, two bars, cool dancefloor. The DJ was quite bad, because he usually puts hip-hop and Beegees in a space of 10 minutes. The animation team was superb! All of them very kind and polite, don't any dificults at all on talking in english. Some of them are mexican, but there are brazilians, argentinians, etc. It was a great team indeed. There was only one thing that I didn't like on that team. There was one guy that only caried about entertaining the female crowd, making husbands and boyfriends annoyed.

The beach and pools are amazing even if you don't get there early there are enough chairs and you can get an umbrella from the towel person for free just have to ask and sign it out. This is a major bonus for only one day did we get a hut on the beach. The food is fine, you will not starve but don't get excited either.

The animals are in abundance monkeys, peacocks, acoutis and an array of birds and other wild life that after a few days you sadly take for granted. You also take for granted the spectacular pool area and the breathtaking sea. The beach is clean and never jam packed and has a fantastic breeze. Prime spots at beach and pool may be reserved early but you can always find a spot. The speciality restraunts were great and the buffets were consistantly 1st class. Loads of choice and great quality. Drinks as well were excellent, from great cocktails and chapagne to suprisingly good beer and wicked tequilla based shots and slammers, room service was included and very quick what ever time you rang.

The staff need a special mention, from maids and cleaners barstaff to reception and The infamous Star friends all do a magnificent job, all very helpful and so so friendly.

Jesus, Lois, Luigi Betty and Vicky to mention but a few were all a class act. I cannot really fault the hotel you will have a great time here. The only downside for us and many others were the occasional groups that could not behave. A Russian group who gate crashed an American wedding bash at the night club which ended in a fight, we felt so sorry for the poor bride and party, and the arrogance of some of the other Russian guests who let there poorly behaved children run a mock. Finally an English group on the day of their wedding all drunk, swearing then scrapping infront of kids etc pulling off their shirts and diving into bushes (jackass style) causing damage and having no thought for others.

It was a beautiful resort.

We would have needed 2 and the total would have been 160.00 Taxi's are waiting at the airpot that would have been a big savings. When we arrived at the hotel about 45 min later. we were greeted with drinks It was wonderful After check in we went to our room Building 11 It was overlooking the pool and part of the beach. Had I been able to pick a building that would have been it. It was very hot and we needed to be in water most of the time. It was great to walk out of our room and get into the pool. There was no noise at night and our rooms were very comfortable. I had requested a non smoking room there were ashtrays in the room but I can honestly say it did not smell of smoke and I am neurotic about smelling smoke. We loved the beach but if you want a chair you need to get there early people started reserving chairs before 6 AM. There was plenty to do. But it is not all included. My only other all inclusive experience was Sandals where Everything is included but not here. Snorkling, scuba, Jet ski's bananna boats are all extra. The walk to the buffet is nice every morning we walked up by 8AM and we were able to see monkey's each day. As well as peacocks.roosters.chickens and very large iguanas the kids loved it!!! None of the animals came too close and it didn't scare the kids or me at all. We were guarenteed 2 dinner reservations and we were able to add a third with no problem for the time we wanted. The Steakhouse was everyone's favorite. The italian was ok Pasta is overcooked even in the buffet as well as the restaurant. The Japanese was fun. My son dropped his glass and cut his hand Glass remained in his hand and we were taken to the doctor who is on site immediatly without even asking. The Doctor spoke clear English and was extremly nice to my son and me. The glass was removed the wound was cleaned and we were taken back to the restaurant. She did not even make us pay. Dr fees are not included but she said it was no big deal and off we went. that was a relief. We took two excursions, One was the ATV 2 hour tour. It was nice and safe!!! After the tour we were able to swim in the senote. That was by far the best part it was very hot and to jump into water that was 65 degrees was great. By the way the pool at the resort as well as the ocean feels like a bath tub. The other tour was from the resort for the local snorkling trip. That was ok there was not too much to see but if it's your first time I think you will enjoy it. If your an avid snorkeler do a different tour.

We booked with my girlfriend who is an Apple agent one month before we actually left for our vacation. We were booked in Tucan, but ended up staying in Quetzal. There is no difference. Got off the plane and through immigration, tipped a guy who took our bags and directed us to our Apple rep. waiting for us and put us in our van and took us to our hotel. Tipped the driver, tipped the guy who took our bags to our room. Most definitely take at least $50 in ones to tip. Tipped our roomkeeper $2/day and he left it spotless, Vicente was awesome. Snacks - brought snacks for us on the plane, excursions and for the trip home. Mosquitoes - got bit on my ankles a bit, nothing too crazy, just put some bug stuff there, i didn't so it's my own fault. I didn't see one scorpion or taranchala while I was there either. Meds - brought all necessary meds in original containers and mixed to save room, no one even bothered to check it. I did bring Pepto, thank God I did. Both of us only had stomach \"issues\" for a half day during our stay. Water shoes - Didn't even need them where we went. Only place we could have IF we decided not to rent the flippers at Xcaret would be to snorkel through the caves. Might need them for the inlets/lagoons if it bugs you. Insulated cups - only if you must drink in the water/on the beach. Hairdryers - they are in the room, but don't fit a diffuser too well. Ironing Board - call to the front desk, they will bring you one. Shopping - surprisingly, little gifts in their giftshop were cheaper than shopping Playa Del Carmen. Playa Del Carmen wasn't that fun to shop, people hassling you and I hate to haggle. Playacar shopping was better, but you still had to haggle prices, but at least they will tell you, last price so you aren't there all day. Tulum was decent. Snorkels - we brought our own and saved some money that way, especially at Xcaret. Room Ammenities - There is filled shower gel and shampoo dispers in the shower; stocked mini-refridge to help yourself; room service until 11pm. Definitely book your restaurant reservations when you get there. Sounds silly, but we found it hard to even get in and waited too late. We like to hang out at the beach until 7 or so we always choose later reservations. We did have a hard time finding chairs some days so it's not a bad idea to claim yours. If you plan to swim with the dolphins at Xcaret ($115/person), try to book it online and don't worry about what the activities are at the resort and if you'll miss something (that is what I did). They typically have the same activities every day, same times, except for Kids Club. They sometimes do special stuff for the evening kids program. Sunday is the kids performance for CATS and that is really cool to watch. Star Friends are awesome; somewhat eyecandy as well. I've been to Club Meds and they have GO's. Star Friends are better, way more personable and if you have kids, they are fantastic. I'm very skepticle about who watches my child and they were very caring. You can come and go as you please with your child throughout the day so if you want to do water aerobics and salsa lessons, you can put your kid in Kids Club for an hour and eat lunch with them if you want. Nightime shows were usually very entertaining. Great dancing and very professional. I can only imagine how much better it would still be if it was in their theatre that is under construction. Broadway shows was one of the best performances. Bring your video cameras for sure. Tulum was great. We booked an excursion with Apple since it was $42/each way by taxi. The excursion was $50/person, you got a guided tour, air conditioned vehicle, ice cold water and trolley ride to the entrance and you didn't have to wait in a hot line. For the bit extra, it was worth it to us. BRING YOUR BATHING SUIT OR YOU WILL BE TICKED!!! It's rated the 2nd most beautiful beach in the world so don't miss out! Great photo ops. It's hot, so bring a hat, wear tennis shoes and your bathing suit under your clothes. No bathroom by the beach. Don't use the bathrooms once you enter Tulum, wait till the train/trolley drops you off at the entrance and use those...and they are free. We did the coconut thing up front for $2. You drink the water and they chop up the cocunt after to eat. Cool experience. My daughter is taking it to school for show and tell. Xcaret was cool. Long day. It's geared towards kids somewhat, great photo ops, check out the food before you sit down. There was a buffet there and some of the food was COMPLETELY covered in flies, you might want to bring your snacks. Hammocks were great and swimming in the lagoons were a good experience. You'll need water shoes there. YOU HAVE TO STAY FOR THE NIGHTLY SHOW. It's awesome. If you have the money to blow, get the dinner with it, otherwise, there are food stands. If you are going to see cool fish with the underground river snorkeling, you'll be disappointed. It's more to see the caves. We saw a handful of cool fish and were a bit bummed. Xel-Ha is what we'll do next time as well as Cozumel. Cozumel was a bit of a tax drive and decided to research it more and do that next time as well. If you are going with someone like Apple, make sure you know when your van is departing to fly back. We missed ours and had a miscommunication; ended up paying $42 for a taxi to the airport. Food is decent. You will get sick of buffet and be grateful for the restaurants. Now that I'm home, I would do anything to eat their buffet if it meant I could be on the beach or adult pool!:) Grounds are beautiful, cool animals roaming about. It's like a zoo. The monkeys are great to watch. We liked getting up with our coffee and sitting on our porch watching the monkeys. There is topless sunbathing on the beach, not in the pool area. Just a fair warning. I loved it, you can't do that at home in the Great Lakes so I took great advantage of it. We cannot wait to get back there. We were told by returning vacationers how much the hurricane Emily did damage and it wasn't as beautiful. We couldn't tell and can only imagine how awesome it must be when it's at it's best!

Food is good and plentiful. Large variety of food choices in the buffets. The ala carte restaurants are okay, nothing special, however the steak house was very good. Unfortunately, the steak house is not air-conditioned and it was extremely hot and humid. It does not cool down much at night in August, the weather is very hot and sticky.

The shows at night are not very good, so if you are looking for great nightlife (they do have a samll disco) or good entertainment, this is not the place for you. The pool area and beach are really beautiful. The one problem we encountered was that chairs are \"reserved\" very early in the morning. If you get down to the pool/beach at 9:00 am, good luck getting a chair, especially one in the shade. There are many chairs and a lot of shade, but people would go down early in the morning and \"reserve\" them by putting their towels etc on them. Then, they wouldn't show up at the pool for several hours. It was the only was to get a chair and unfortunately, we had to do this as well in order to get a place to sit by the pool. The location of the hotel is very good. You can walk to a small marketplace in Playacar that sells local souvenoirs (silver jewelry, some small pottery, other items). The walk is about 1/4 mile from the hotel. Or, you can take a taxi for $5 (US) into Playa Del Carmen (5th Avenue) and walk around there, where there is a ton of shopping and is great fun.

From the moment the taxi dropped us off, we were treated very well. We were surprised to get an incredibly gorgeous oceanfront room. (if you go, get into the 2000 bldg. 2031 was our room!). Our room has a balcony overlooking the beach and ocean and a nice sitting area, the only issue is the one you've probably read in all these reviews...the bed is waaaaaaaaaaaaay too hard! But you are so relaxed spending time there, you can easily nap away. There are 2 buffets and 5 restaurants, we ate at the steakhouse, the mexican hacienda and the japanese hibachi restaurants. All 3 were excellent, very comprable to anything we'd eat in the states. The filet I had at the steakhouse on our last night was INCREDIBLE!!! You only get a certain number of reservations...if you have only 3, do these 3. The buffets were good too, the only issue being when it was too hot, it was very hard to enjoy the buffets since they are all outdoors. Although there are lots of ceiling fans, sometimes the ambience of being outdoors isn't worth the heat, makes it less enjoyable. The ocean was warm, plenty of watersports to enjoy, and plenty of beach to roam on or lay out it. The pool is huge, very warm and very spacious. I especially liked the pool bar with the waterfall. The water temp. was always slightly colder than the pool which made it incredibly refreshing on those hot days. And of course the service was first rate. Most of mexico's tourist spots are know for customer service and the iberostar is no different. Every single worker said hi to us and offered their help and were very quick to respond to every need. From the bartenders to the room service to the hotel maids, their friendliness made for an even better trip! (i'm sure the tips I left them didn't hurt) I can't wait to go there with some other couples, that would be the only thing to make our trip better. We made a few trips and tours, to the pyramids, to swim with the dolphins, etc. Remember, at Iberostar, you are only a 5 minute taxi ride from Playa Del Carmen which is also the best way to get to Cozumel, so really you have the best of all worlds.

We arrived on the 15th July to the most glorious hotel. Despite being allocated incorrect rooms, the recepitonist promised that this would be resolved the following day. That evening we enjoyed a lovely evening in one of the buffet bars, followed by drinks in the entertainment area and foyer bars. On Saturday 16th we spent the entire day on the beach, we found beds easily our two teenage children loved the sea, it was safe for swimming and my husband and I enjoyed the comforts of the beach bars. Our promised rooms never actually came to fruition primarily because when we returned to our rooms a 'note' had been left informing us that Hurricane Emily was on route and it was very likely that it would be a direct hit the following day. We enjoyed another evening enjoying the hotels amenities whilst a clear up process was well under way. On Sunday we were evacuated to another room which wasn;t a problem, to give credit where it is due, the hotel did a fine job of clearing everywhere with little or no disruption to their guests. Having been told we were unable to come out of our allocated rooms we waited for Emily to hit. And she did, it was quite probably the most terrifying few hours, espeically when we were called and told to relcoate to the bathroom. Four of squeezed into the bathroom and shower was some experience. The following morning we woke and went to view the damage, and it was quite horrific, the beautiful gardens and walk ways had been damage by falling debris, the beach was written off, the beautiful pool was now a mirky grey colour and remained so for the rest of our holiday. The hotel staff really did their best to get things back and running but unfortunately we never had the full use of ALL the PAID for amenities again, which was hugely disappointing given that it had cost us \u00a3700 per day for the four of us to stay at the Iberostar. We didn;t enjoy full use of all the Restuarants agan, as they were closed due to the damage, the pool as previously mentioned was not in use for the rest of the holiday, the tennis courts were damaged and not used again, the gym re opened on our last day, the entertainment hall was a write off but the hotel entertainment staff did a fab job of entertaining their guests in the disco. For the remaining 4 days you heard the constant sound of chain saws and the stench from the clean up process in parts was not pleasant. On arrivial I would have said that this was the best hotel, however due to the unfortuante circumstances of Emily the hotel I feel although doing their best struggled to retain some sort of normaility. Other hotels along the same stretch of beach had all of their water sports availalbe. To end on a positve note, the hotel was beautiful. we ate in the Mexican, Japonese & Steak house and both buffet bars and the food was just yummy.

Even though we were 24hrs delayed due to a technical fault in the aircraft; the reception staff made us feel welcome as soon as we had set foot in the hotel. They were so friendly and provided us with all the info we needed, we also got greeted by a waitress who served us with fruit juice! Beach: We didn't go on the beach that often, but whenever we did the scene was magnificent! What more could you ask for than crystal clear turquoise waters and a spotlessly clean beach. You could lie there all day, and you didn't have to even get up to get a drink because there were waitresses 'patrolling' the beach ready to serve you. And i don't think i ever saw them not smiling! Pool: The pools were great. The sunbeds surrounding them were so relaxing, although you do have to get up fairly early to 'bag a bed'. I recommend you get there for about 8:30am, stay 30mins and then go for breakfast. There were also daily activities organised by 'star friends' who tried to get as many people involved. My mum and I had a go at Aqua Fit on the 2nd day, and never missed a day after that! Food: The buffet was truly amazing! I have never travelled all inclusive before and i can't wait to do it again! There was so much variety on offer, and it changed every day. Plus they often had a theme night which was quite interesting. The al a carte restaurants were good aswell, we visited the Italian (3 times!), the steakhouse and my parents went to the tropical, while i opted for a buffet meal. Trips: We went on 3 trips, chichen itza, swim with the dolphins and the catamaran. Chichen Itza was an experience and it was interesting to here the history behind it but the day did go on for a bit. The dolphins were amazing! i would recommend to anybody. The catamaran really was value for money, we got taken to a deserted part of Isla Mujeres where we were given lunch. And then we got taken round the side and were given free time. For 3 days worth of tanning, its a definate highlight of the holiday. Entertainment: The Star Friends team were such hardworkers, they worked 12hr days and still had the time to do a show/gameshow each night then go onto the disco until 3am! They were so friendly and their main aim was to make sure every guest had the best holiday they could ask for. They got to know you personally and they would eat lunch with you at the grill during the day. If they are reading this; hello berni, marcos, luigi, steven, fabios and Ana laura! Hurricane Emily: We unfortunatly experienced Hurricane Emily this year - a 4/5 hurricane! But i can only praise the hotel and its staff (including star friends) for their organisation. We were put into the discotec building, with roughly 250 other people. We were all kept well informed by the leader and provided with food. After being in there 17hrs, we were told that it was safe to go outside and have breakfast. The cleaners worked exceptionally hard for the next day and the reception was spotless by 7am. The buffet was even open by 10am. The pool was taped off for a few days but i heard that it was cleaned and ready for use 3 days after! I would definatly shout out to all the people who haven't made up their mind about the hotel yet, because this definatly is the place to be, its true paradise! If Andy and Nat from near Cardiff, Michelle and Mike Patrisca read this - Hiya, i hope you had a great time and contact me on my email address!

In all, we had an excellent vacation and I would highly recommend the resort to both groups and families. For couples/honeymooners, I might prefer an adult only atomosphere (like a Sandals) because there are a lot of kids and groups of couples and families, but this is a personal preference. Resort after Hurricane Emily: It is sad to see the downed trees and beat-up foilage, but in all, you would not know a Category 4 Hurricane had passed through. The small amount of damage to the palapas (thatched roofs) was almost completely fixed by the time we left. The open-air theatre remains closed and all shows take place in the convention rooms (air conditioned!). Oh yes, and as many have wondered, the beach is still quite large and it is very clean. Rooms: Building 12 on the Tucan side is highly recommended. I sent an email to the resort a week before our arrival to request this block, and it was accommodated. The 11, 12 & 13 blocks are near the pool, beach, towels and breakfast buffet. As far as the rooms go, they are pretty standard rooms, but I would say above-average bathrooms with ample marble showers (big enough for two). The room was well cleaned by the maid and the mini-bar was stocked everyday. Food: The buffets were \"ok\" -- it seemed liked the exact same things were offered for lunch and dinner everyday. Luckily, we were able to get 3 confirmed reservations at restaraunts and one \"stand by\". I will admit I was pretty peeved about the whole reservation game, but when stuck at the buffets, I could always find something to eat. In order of preference, I recommend the Mexican, Japanese, Italian and Tropical (we were unable to try the Steakhouse). We also ate downtown one night at the Yaxche (on 8th, just West of 5th). The dinner was awesome and I would recommend. We also went to the Blue Parrot bar/lounge (on recommendation). It was said to be an \"institution\" in PDC, but I found it more like a rave. It got too crowded late night (w/ the wrong kind of crowd), they had a small selection of beer and the music was excessively loud. Pool/Beach: Unbelievable! Crystal clear water, wonderful beach and pool area. We checked out other hotels up and down the strip and it seemed the Tucan/Queztal has the most character and options (shade, palapas, chairs, tables, etc.). There is also a fairly decent dive shop with free snorkeling and kayaking. Banana boats rides were extra, but definitely worth it -- we had so much fun! I almost forgot to mention the pool bar -- awesome. It did get a little rowdy at times, but luckily it was off the main pool and rather large so it did not bother those guests who did not want to partake. Side Trips: We had such a nice time at the resort, that we only went on one trip. Our Mayan Adventure was arranged through the Apple Vacations rep in the lobby. For $69 a person (group rate for 8) we spent from 8:30 am - 5:00 pm snorkeling in a beautiful lagoon near Akumal, swimming/snorkeling in an enclosed cenote (cave) with stalagamites, and jumping off cliffs into open cenotes. Very scenic and beautiful -- yet tiring. I would not recommend this to families with younger children or those who cannot get around easily. 5th Avenue in downtown PDC is worth venturing to if only for the sights and sounds ($5 taxi from Tucan). Entertainment: We made our own entertainment most nights. The shows were a bit cheesy (great for the kids), but we never really stuck around. Mascara (the disco) was a nice air conditioned lounge to hang out in until about 10:30, then the whole scene changes. Music, lights and fog starts (a good time some nights) and the place comes alive. My only major complaint was the awful parents who let their kids come. I mean young kids (4-12)! This is a club at late hours serving alcohol (sometimes too much to some individuals) -- I found this disturbing. What I would remember to bring next time: - bug spray and candles (not a huge problem, but nice to have) - floaties/rafts (the hotel doesn't have any and you have to buy them from the gift shop) - insulated mugs (the sun melts your frozen drinks in minutes) - $1s for tipping (if you choose) - Tums (I felt a little queasy sometimes; however, it was most likely from eating off the resort) Again, overall a great resort (seemed to be the nicest beach/pool in the immediate area). The location was ideal given its proximity to downtown PDC and short distance from Cancun airport", "Date": "August 12, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Relaxing Week\u201d", "Author": "MrsBicep", "ReviewID": "UR3754203", "Content": "We just returned from a week at the Tucan in Mexico.

We had originally reserved a room on the Tucan side, but they ended up booking everyone in the wedding group on the Quetzal side. I was a little concerned at first, but quickly realized that both sides are exactly the same. My in-laws had reserved an ocean view Junior Suite and we were given a room about two buildings away from them near the pool. Many of the others from the wedding group were staying in or near our building too. I really enjoyed the location of our building (#22) because it was really close to the pool, beach, and snack buffets. It\u2019s a bit of a walk to the main restaurants, lobby area, and disco, but it\u2019s real easy if you take the outside sidewalks rather than the jungle path. The jungle path is nice for viewing all the pretty birds and interesting animals, but it can be a little rough if you aren\u2019t in the right shows! We aren\u2019t normally big on the all-inclusive thing, but this place does about as good of a job as they can. The drinks are plentiful and in decent sized cups. They will give you call brand liquor if you ask for it. The beer selection was pretty limited. I think it was just Dos XX. The breakfast buffet was the best food of the day; those omelets can\u2019t be beet! The dinner buffet was pretty good as far as buffets go, although I\u2019m not a big fan of them in general. We ate at the Italian restaurant for the rehearsal dinner and the steakhouse for the wedding reception. I can\u2019t say I was blown away by either one; however, we were given limited menu choices since we were part of a group. Maybe other items from the menu would have been better. To be fair, my husband loved his steak at the steak house. We also had dinner at the Mexican restaurant on our last night. It was really good and the margaritas were tasty. The appetizer, salad, and desert bars at all the restaurants are quite good too. The rooms are pretty basic hotel rooms, but clean, comfortable, and well air-conditioned. We didn\u2019t go on our deck much because of the heat and mosquitoes. Screen doors would have been a bonus. They keep a mini-bar in your room stocked with complementary beer, water, and sodas, which is a nice touch. I just wish it had some liquor too! The pool area is huge and lovely, although the water a bit too warm, almost like bath water. The swim up bar was a better temperature, but too shallow and rather crowded. The beach is absolutely beautiful, almost picture perfect. The water is an unbelievable color blue, the perfect temperature, and calm enough to swim in comfortably. It drops off pretty quick after you step in, so you don\u2019t have to go out far to swim at all. I think that could be the result of erosion from Hurricane Ivan last year. I hear all the beaches in the area are much smaller than they were before the hurricane. The wedding was one of the most beautiful weddings we\u2019ve ever witnessed. The resort did a great job of making sure everything went smoothly for them. This was a great place to spend a few days celebrating the wedding with family. My only complaint, if any, is that they only allow one guaranteed restaurant reservation for a four-night stay and they counted the rehearsal dinner as that one reservation. We were still able to get one more reservation through luck on the waiting list, but they don\u2019t tell you if you\u2019re in or not until 6:00 the day of your reservation, which sort of leaves you hanging if you want to make any plans for that day/night. Their towel policy is also a bit strict. They issue a \u201ctowel card\u201d to each person. You have to turn in the card to receive a towel and then you get it back when you return the towel. You are charged $10 per card that is not turned back in at checkout. Sure enough, someone stole one of our towels off of a lounge chair! It had only been there for ten minutes. We had to fill out an \u201cofficial\u201d report at the front desk in order to get a new towel card without paying the ten bucks. It was pretty funny reading some of the other reports on the chart, describing \u201chow, where, and when\u201d their towel disappeared. Overall, I found the IB Tucan/Quetzal to be a really good value for the money, as far as All-Inclusive resorts are concerned. I\u2019d especially recommend it for groups and weddings. This is a place where you can really relax and not worry about anything (except maybe a looming hurricane). Lucky for us, we just happened to be heading down to Belize the day before Hurricane Emily was set to arrive! It\u2019s my understanding that the resort suffered some damage but was back up and running pretty quickly.", "Date": "August 7, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver", "Title": "\u201cNot what we expected\u201d", "Author": "mimidoll", "ReviewID": "UR3741788", "Content": "Our family of 4 stayed at the Tucan for 2 weeks in July/05. We had previously stayed at an Iberostar in the Dominican Republic and were expecting a similar experience. We were very dissapointed with the size of the swimming pool, deck areas and the beach in porportion to the number of guests. The lounge chairs are crammed tightly together under palapas that run the perimiter of the pools, it felt claustrophobic. The pool deck area is not large enough. We had to reserve our chairs by 8:30am beach or pool. The hotel was at full capacity the entire 2 weeks we were there,, who would have thought in the heat of July? We wound up sitting near the beach showers as there we could pull the chairs away a bit from the others. The beach was a bit better but still just jam packed with beach chairs and people. I just took a look at a photo of the beach that a guest submitted after the hurricane and the beach looks empty but this was not the case. I felt like I was somewhere in Europe where the beaches are very crowded. The pool is shared by Tucan and Queztal and it was always full of people. Not the cleanest either, I guess with so many guests. I have travlled to many parts Puerto Vallarta, Cabo, Cancun, Cuba, D.R. Hawaii etc and have never felt so crowded at a resort. The swim up bar was very weird, it's a small pool separated from the big pool with fake rocks and water that was kind of murky. It was popular though because of the shade. Kids club, only our 7 year old daughter went and she was one of the older kids. Our 10 year old son wouldnt go but did play soccer everyday. The food was good not great. The Mexican dishes were my favourite. Hated the jungle in the middle, it was dark and dingy, I guess I'm not into that kind of nature. I prefer the green type not the rotting foiliage that was part of the jungle floor and had a pungent smell. The staff were excellent, very accomodating.

We stayed there for our 25th Anniversary in August 2003 and on request by email we asked for the same building, room from our previous visit. This was allocated but they gave us the room next door and as returning guests, we had a bowl of fruit on arrival and also we were given 2 Mexico T-Shirts. We raved so much about our last visit to friends of ours that they booked and came with us this time. They agreed that the Hotel, staff and the mexican people really made our holiday even better, due to their never ending happy smiling attitudes and long hard work to ensure we all enjoyed our holiday. The Hotel and the surrounding areas were absolutely gorgeous and it is a real shame that Hurricane Emily done the damage it did, but I am sure the staff and their helpers will soon have it back to the way it was. We have all agreed we will be back again as this was the most relaxing, enjoyable 2 weeks we have all ever experienced. We went on 5 different trips and they were all excellent in their own unique way. Chichen Itza for the history and views from the top of the Main Pyramid. Yet again the guide was so informative about the Mayan History and the facts are amazing. It was a long day but as we stopped off at a Cenotes for a swim and Lunch in the morning and again stopped off on the way back the day remained interesting. We went to Xel Ha for the day and it was raining in the morning, but you dont go to Xel Ha unless you are gonna get wet, so we still enjoyed the Lazy River floating down in the rain. The snorkelling was fantastic and the variety of fish around the park is great. We watched the Dolphins, Ate in 1 of the many Restuarants, again the food was of a great choice and plentiful and we all like our food. We went to Xcaret and took a taxi both ways, which was only $12 each way and after walking around the sites and using the revolving viewing tower, we went for a swim down the Underground river and that was so cool after the heat of the walks etc. We stopped off at various parts of the park and again they all have their own reason for everyone to enjoy. We done our own route around the site and stopped off as and when we wanted too. We stayed all day and went to the Evening Show which started at 7.00pm but if you want a good seat and view then you need to go to the Theatre about an hour earlier as there is so much to see on the way up to the Theatre by the local entertainers that you do not want to miss the opportunity to get your photos taken with them all in their Mayan Outfits and listen to their singing and music. The Evening show was really amazing and should not be missed. The show finishes at 9.00pm so not too late for the kids either. The colours and variety of National Dress were beautiful and the entertainment value is brilliant. We also booked to go on the Pirate Ships out of Cancun at night and this again was a good choice and very entertaining. The 2 wives loved the good looking Pirate off the Red ship but unlucky for them we were on the Green ship. The food, drink and singing were all cheery and typical of a Pirates way of life in those days. Very Loud but very good at getting everyone involved and again we all had a great time. Our final trip was on my wife Carol's Birthday and she chose to go Quad Biking or ATV's as they are known locally. This was the first time any of us had ever been on these and they were brilliant, mad, fast and fun. The look on all our faces said everything especially when we came to the end of the ride and one of the Instructors asked my wife if she wanted to round again and we all turned round and jumped back on another bike. We all had individual bikes but you can go in pairs. The track takes about 45 mins to get round and can get you very muddy, so if you are thinking of going to this take some old clothes as we all ditched ours at the end, including the trainers. Getting back to the Hotel Tucan and yet again we cannot praise the staff high enough in all their respective areas, Buffet,Bars,Beach, Pool, Rooms and Restuarants. We all had an excellent time and a wee tip every now and then helps in a big way. They deserve the extra tips as they all work so hard and we have all decided we will be going back again and hopefully the party will be bigger next time, with more and more of our friends listening to us go on and on about this Hotel and everyone that helped us enjoy it. Sorry this is a long report but I could write a book about our visits and if anyone has any questions, then please write and ask me. I hope there are no more Hurricanes or anything else to damage the PDC areas or the local people as it is such a fantastic holiday resort and I am sure you have all read different reports to back this. I am writing this at work so do not have access to our 780 photos of this trip but I will add some at a later date Thanks and see you again soon, Alex,Carol, Jim and Wendy.

I must say from the moment that we arrived I was not happy with the resort. For starters, we arrived at 7pm on June 1 and were warmly greeted by a female by the name of Laura. Laura was very friendly and welcoming as she explained to me and my partner that the resort had messed up our reservation. Instead of having the ocean front suite that we had payed for, we were instead going to have to spend the first night in a standard room. Needless to say, I was disappointed with this. All I wanted was a nice suite with a great view of the ocean to relax. Unfortunately, my very first night was not going to accommodate my wish. For our inconvenience, Laura offered to give us ONE free massage from the spa. Well, one massage for TWO people seemed like a silly idea to me...But, who am I...Just the customer. So, my partner and I trudged through the winding paths to building 21(I believe) in the sweltering heat lugging our bags. When we arrived at our building we could not find our room because it was so dark in the building. I suppose that the lights are on timers, however it was now past dark and the lights had not yet come on. We find our room and promptly drop our luggage. It was senseless to unpack since we would just be moving in the morning anyway. I headed to the bathroom to take a shower as it had been a very long and hot day of visiting the Mayan ruins. As I open the bathroom door, it slams into the toilet. Yes, the toilet sits just behind the bathroom door, perhaps this is standard in European resorts, I don't know, but I found it quite uncomfortable. I take a shower, and decide to change into some comfortable clothes. Unfortunately, my clothes are still in the suitcase, because as I mentioned before it was senseless to unpack and have to repack in the morning. So, I grabbed some shorts and a shirt. They of course need ironing after having been jammed in my suitcase all day. I search the room for the iron and ironing board. To my dismay, there are no such items in the room. I'm not surprised, just annoyed. Next, I decide to get a drink from the mini fridge that is tackily placed beneath the counter and behind some unattractive shutter doors. I grab a beer and immediately notice that the beer and all of the items in the fridge are room temperature. Not a cold beverage to be found in this fridge. Perhaps Europeans like their beverages room temperature, however I prefer mine well chilled. What is the sense of a fridge if it is not turned on or at least turned on to a cool setting?? Finally, we decide to go to the buffet to grab a bite and hopefully a cold drink. The buffet is ok. I personally thought all of the food tasted the same. Bland... However, I survived dinner and decided to call it a night. The next morning, thursday, June 2, we were moved to our ocean front suite. The size of the room and the view are much better, however that is where the amenities stopped. We still have the very small bathroom with the toilet directly behind the door. However, this time we have a shower that sprays water from the top of the coupling where the shower head and pipe meet each other. This was not huge deal except for the fact that when the water shot up on the ceiling it ran the length of the ceiling and dripped down on the counter getting all of my personal items wet. Annoying, but not a catastrophe in and of itself. Also the bathroom was so small that it promptly caused the mirrors to steam up. Fortunately there was a wall mounted blow dryer in the bathroom. I attempted to use the blow dryer to clear the steam, however when I did the hose pulled out of the wall. Oh well, I tried.... Thursday at the pool was relatively uneventful. The pool was gorgeous, the ocean was wonderful and the pool side staff were very friendly and accommodating. Prior to dinner thursday night I got out the iron and ironing board in the suite to press some clothes for the evening. I managed to get the ironing board erected, though it is much shorter than a standard board. It barely came up to my waist and made ironing bent over rather uncomfortable. I filled the iron with water and began to steam my clothes. Or at least tried. The steam was not working at first. However a large burst of, what appeared to be, crystallized hard water shot out of the iron onto my clothes. It caused white stains on my pants. I assume there had been water left in the iron that had dried and hardened over time. Oh well, those things happen. I finished ironing and attempted to close up the ironing board. Well, the board would not close. My partner and I both tried to lower the board to no avail. We actually turned it upside down and tried to close it that way. In doing so, we bent the legs and then decided to just leave it alone. The ironing board spent the remainder of our stay as a permanent fixture in the middle of our room. Dinner that night was another bland experience, but I suppose when cooking buffets for so many folks, bland is the only option. After dinner I decided to head back to the room to read and relax. My friends stayed out and went to a show and the disco tech. After another shower I layed on the sofa to read around 8:30pm. I'm not reading very long when the power goes out and leaves me in complete darkness. I stumbled to my feet and attempted to find my way to the door. On the way, I tripped over the ironing board...Remember, it wouldn't collapse and is now a permanent fixture in the middle of our room. I make it to the door and find that the outside lights are still on, however the lights in my room are off. Within a couple of minutes the lights come back on. No harm done, just inconvenient. Friday I decided to go to the spa for the complimentary massage. If you recall from above this was the massage that we were granted for our inconvenience. After making a call to our travel agent to complain the Iberostar \"graciously\" offered us two massages instead of the original one. So at 3pm on Friday June 3 I head off to the spa. I am greeted by Daniel the masseur. He leads me into a very darkened room, actually too dark. I couldn't see a thing, much less find the counter to place my clothes once I got undressed. Daniel returned and began a very erratic massage. It was a technique I have never felt in my life. Now, I must say that I get professional massages twice per month here in the US and I had never had one quite as UN relaxing as this. After about 10 minutes, Daniel gets into a rhythm and the massage actually became more relaxing. It was still the worst I have ever experienced overall. Oh well, it was free I suppose. Friday night my partner and I head out for another bland meal at the buffet. At this point, I had had a few cocktails and opted to just eat a salad for dinner. After dinner we saw a show and then went to the disco tech. Overall it was a good night and we went to bed at 1:30am. Saturday morning June 4 at 7:20am we are awakened by the sound of our smoke detector. It is blaring over our heads as we lay in bed. We get up, scramble for some clothes and head to the door. As I reach the front door I am hit in the face by dripping water and I am now standing in a puddle of water. The overhead AC unit is leaking from the ceiling. We step outside and see a maid at the storage closet just outside our room. She speaks no English and is of no help to us. No other alarms appear to be going off, only ours. So we make our way down to our friends' room to use their phone to call the front desk. Their phone is dead and will not work. So, the 4 of us now are walking around in our pj's looking for assistance. We see some workers just below the balcony of our building and we implore their assistance. Unfortunately, they speak no English either. We find a security guard and drag him back to our room. After pointing and trying to communicate with him, he spoke no English either,he finally got on his radio and called for assistance. 40 minutes later, maintenance arrived with a ladder. The maintenance man placed his dirty ladder on my bed and then stepped onto the bed with muddy boots. He ripped the smoke detector from the ceiling causing sparks to fly across my bed. Once the smoke detector was shut off he promptly left. Now what....Well nothing. No one came to clean up the muddy bed, no one fixed the leaky the AC unit at my front door, and it is now 8:20am. I have been up for an hour, still in my pj's, still tired, and now I have a filthy bed and a puddle of water at my front door. I promptly get on the phone and call the x3200 and ask for Laura. As you may recall, Laura was the helpful young lady who checked us in on June 1st. I was told that Laura would be at 9am. So, I threw on some clothes and started the long trudge through the hot jungle to the front desk to voice my concerns and complaints about my muddy bed, wet floor, and disruptive service. When I arrived at the front desk I was greeted by Arnando Torres. Arnando informed me that Laura would be in momentarily. So, I decided to sit and wait for her. At 9:10am, I still had not seen any signs of Laura at the front desk so I inquired about her whereabouts. The young lady that I was now speaking to informed me that Laura would not be in until 3pm that afternoon. I explained to her that I had been told by 2 separate individuals that Laura would be in at 9am. She confirmed that was not accurate information. Arnando now approached us and asked how he may be of assistance. Needless to say, I was more than annoyed at this point. I explained to Arnando my concerns and complaints. He readily told me that someone would be sent to my room to make my bed and fix the AC. I asked Arnando how they would accommodate my inconvenience. He told me that would be up to the manager. I then asked, \"who is the manager?\". He replied, \"Simon.\" I asked, \"where is Simon?\" He replied, \"she will be here shortly and I would have to wait.\" I informed Arnando that I had waited long enough and that I wanted to speak to a manager immediately. Arnando headed off reluctantly to find Simon. They returned together after a few minutes at which time Simon asked me how she could help me. Again, I explained the problems that had occurred that morning and that I was not happy with the service, disruptions, inconvenience, and lack of customer service. At this point a Mr. Sanchez arrives. He is apparently the resort manager. (I may have his name wrong, but Sanchez is what comes to mind.) I again, explain to Mr. Sanchez my discontent. He asked me how he could accommodate me. I told him that I wanted the following items for myself and my friends as we have all been inconvenience at this point: 1) Reservations for 4 at the Steak House for that evening 2) Massages, manicures, pedicures and facials for all 4 of us. He promptly agreed, shook my hand and went on his way. I was left to arrange all of the details with Simon. Simon on 3 occasions made reference to my \"wife\". I corrected her and informed her that I did not have a wife I have a partner. She apologized for her ignorance and heterosexism in assuming that I had a wife. Simon told me that my room would be cleaned and changed promptly. The AC would be repaired, my dinner reservation coupon would be delivered to my room as would my spa coupons. She told me that my friends would have to come to the front desk to make their spa appointments separately for times that were convenient for them. I was satisfied at this point. When I returned to my room I found it clean and orderly, except the AC unit was still dripping water. Within 30 minutes a maintenance person arrived to fix the leak. My partner and I decided to go to the pool and leave maintenance to their task. I stayed at the pool until 1:30 pm and then decided to go to my room, shower, take a nap, and get prepared for my 3pm facial appointment. At 2pm there is a knock at the door. I get up from my nap to find a maid, and 2 males carrying a king size mattress. I asked them what they wanted, but of course, none of them could speak English. After staring at each other for a few moments and not being able to communicate effectively, they left. When I stepped back inside my room I noticed a note laying on the floor. It was from Arnando Torres and stated that I needed to come to the front desk to pick up my spa coupons. Well, if Arnando could have a note delivered to my room, why didn't he have the spa coupons delivered as well?? Perhaps that would have made too much sense or perhaps they thought I enjoyed the long hike back and forth to the front desk. Nonetheless, I called Arnando and asked him why 3 people were just at my door with a mattress?? Arnando had no answer for this question. He stated that they were attempting to provide me with \"best service\", because I reported that my bed was wet. I had ever reported that my bed was wet. I reported that maintenance walked on it, however that issue had been resolved hours ago. \"Best service\" would have been to stop disturbing me in my room for nonesense. At 2:30pm, I, as well as one of my friends, head to the front desk to get the spa coupons. My friend and her partner were staying an additional week at the resort. My partner and I were scheduled to leave on Sunday June 5. Anyway, me and my friend arrive at the desk and are greeted by Arnando. He hands me my spa coupons and asked that I sign them. I have a coupon for 1 massage, 1 facial, 1 pedicure, and 1 manicure. My friend has the same. Obviously there was a mistake because there were supposed to be 4 coupons for each of these services. I attempt to explain to Arnando that there is a mistake. That I had made arrangements with Simon and Mr. Sanchez at 9:25am in regard to these issues. Arnando tells me that I will have to wait to speak with Simon. Apparently, Simon is on her lunch break at 2:45pm. I again inform Arnando that I would not wait and that he should find the management. Arnando, again reluctantly, leaves to find a manager. 10 minutes later Arnando reappears and informs us that the manager wants to see us in his office. Arnando escorts us to the managers office. I graciously greet Mr. Sanchez and shake his hand. He had been most accommodating earlier that morning. I was sure Arnando must have made a mistake with our coupons. Mr. Sanchez shook my hand, however was much less friendly than he had been previously that day. He informed me that we were not going to get the services that we had earlier agreed upon. He went so far as to state that we had never agreed to such. Needless to say, I was shocked to by this turn of events. Mr. Sanchez said I was more than welcome to write a formal complaint, however he was not going to provide me with the previously agreed upon services. Well, at this point I let my anger take control of me. I told Mr. Sanchez exactly what I thought of his hotel, the poor services, inconvenience, disruptions, and the fact that he is nothing but a liar and obviously a homophobe. As I stated previously Mr. Sanchez was very gracious and friendly to me in the morning. However, now he was not friendly at all. The only thing I can think of is that Simon had infomred Mr. Sanchez that I have a PARTNER and not a WIFE. I stormed out of his office after throwing the coupons on the floor. At this point the only thing I wanted was a plane back to the US. I had had it with the Iberostar Resort. I retreated to my room where I planned to stay until my driver arrived Sunday morning to take me out of this hell hole. Well, I suppose, to show the continued incompetence of the resort I received the following calls at the following times that evening: At 5pm the front desk called to check on my soiled bed. At 7:30pm, the maintenance desk called to check on the leaky ac unit, and t 9:15pm I received another call in regards to replacing my mattress. Also, at 9pm the power again went out in my room. On Sunday June 5, we departed the Iberostar Tucan Playa Del Carmen Mexico and I can honestly assure you that I will never return nor will I ever recommend that resort to anyone that I am even remotely affiliated with. The resort and the management are a disgrace.", "Date": "August 1, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Louis", "Title": "\u201cBetter than I imagined!!!

We were some of the first new guests to arrive after Emily. All of the grounds are in working order including the beatiful and enormous beach and pools. The hotel is located inside of a gated community called playacar. Playacar butts right up against the south side of Playa del Carmen. Playacar contains several other resorts including Tucan/Quetzal, RIU Palace, RIU Tequila, Gala, and the Grand Maya. Playacar is much cleaner, safer, and less hectic than Playa del Carman. The rooms were quite nice with marble floors and stone walls. The shower is large and made of stone. Every room has a balcony or patio (for first floor rooms). The complex is divided into several smaller buildings that house the guest rooms. Each building is three stories and holds 24 rooms. Each room has a programmable safe, which we found absolutely indespsible. We tipped our maid about $3-$5 USD each day and were assured to be given plenty of water, beer, and soda. Only complaint, the bed is a little hard but after a full day it doesnt make a difference. We ate at the Japanese, Mexican, and Steakhouse a la carte restaurants. The Japanese was very delicious with sushi and then hibachi style grill that you are seated around as the chef performs fancy grill work. The Mexican restaurant was a little different from most mexican food that one might eat in the U.S., but nonetheless it was also quite good. It would probably fall between a three and four star restaurant. The steakhouse was a little less than impressive. The meat was of decent quality but the presentation was odd. Corn on the cobb was dipped in nacho cheese on the entre plates and baked potatoes were a little off as well. The rib eye and the tenderloin (filet) was pretty tasty though. The beach was the hilight of the trip as the Tucan/Quetzal seems to have on e of the larger beaches from Akumal to Playa del Carmen. If you like to snorkel, I suggest you bring your own. While the non motorized water sports are free, guests are only allowed to use a snorkel, kiyak, catamaran, or windsurf each for about an hour a day. I suppose they do this to ensure that everyone who wants to can have a chance at it. The bars are wonderful as the bartenders are very friendly and quick to make almost any drink. Dont spend to much time in the pool bar though, you might regret it. There are bars everywhere, but you'll get the best made drinks at the main lobby bar. Its a good place to meet friends before or after dinner. The Disco is the latest open bar and its a pretty fun atmosphere. Our last day there we got massages and were blown away by how nice the experience was...We were in the same room, with ambient lighting and nice ocean soundscapes playing in the background. You can also get massages near the main pool in view of the ocean. Highly recommended. All in the all, the Tucan is an incredible resort and we are already planning our next trip back to the same.", "Date": "July 31, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "PRESTON ENGLAND", "Title": "\u201cfantastic hotel\u201d", "Author": "BUGSI", "ReviewID": "UR3723330", "Content": "Stayed at the tucan from july 13th until 27th first few days wonderful food fantastic star friends entertaining and friendly staff cant do enough to help always smiling ... then \"EMILY\" hit us with a bang.......

The follow day after the hurrican every staff member got busy in cleaning up the place and tried their very best to please everyone due to some rooms being flooded. By the following day you would think there was no hurrican as we were able to go to the beach and most of everything got cleaned up. The service you get at this hotel is the best service I ever received at any other hotels I visited. I travel a lot and this hotel is my favorite. The location, the beauty of the resort excellent. The food is terrific here. We went to their a la carte Mexican restaurant, and just amazing. The rooms here are very spacious, always very clean as the maids are very fast in cleaning up each room. For me vacation is not only the resort on how nice it is, but most important is the service we will receive and the food if it is any good, and if anyone is not sure to book their vacation here, please have no doubt this will be a great vacation for you as the service and food top notch.

Our vacations usually consist of a visit to a condo in North Carolina or Florida, so this was a different experience for everyone. My kids are usually bored by the middle of the week and do nothing but sit and watch TV in the room. They didn't repeat this habit at the Tucan ! Our room was located on the 2nd floor in Building 15, facing the outside path around the resort. If and when we return, I will request the same room--great AC, and very quiet. Also, was steps away from the morning buffet breakfast and also a short walk from the evening entertainment. Since it did rain a few days during our week stay, I was glad to be located closer to food, lobby, etc. If it does rain, just go to the lobby and ask for an umbrella to use until the sun shines again ! We made our dinner reservations for 3 of the restaurants immediately after receiving our room number. We ate at the Mexican, Italian, and Steakhouse. The Steakhouse, which is actually located in the poolside palapala, was my favorite. Your waiter even greets you with a Blooming Onion appetizer ! My kids seemed to enjoy the buffets more---my daughter had french fries for breakfast, lunch, and dinner ! My husband would always scope out a beach and pool spot for us early in the morning. Otherwise, it was impossible to find a spot by mid-morning. The beach was excellent---so clean and the water was so blue and calm. We took a couple of blow-up pool floats with us to use in both the pool and at the beach. Make sure to put your name in marker on your mats, as some unattended kids sometimes just grab a mat off of a chair and run off to use it. One afternoon the Ice Cream Lady provided us with yummy icecream sandwiches while we were in the pool ! The soft serve ice cream at the beach bar was the perfect 4pm treat ! My kids loved the tropical drinks, however, I think they did still put tequilla in my son's drinks a couple of times, even though he asked for no alcohol and had a white wrist band. The Star Friends were more than just the evening entertainers---they really wanted to make sure that every part of your vacation was perfect ! The best part of the evening entertainment was the Audience participation portions..soooo funny !! The Friends even sang Happy Birthday to my daughter on her birthday !! Our room was always spotless...we received towel art every day, along with turndown service and chocolates. We also received a fruit basket in our room an hour after our arrival. The only downside was the mosquitos---we all received more bites than we could count ! We even used Cutter mosquito wipes in the evening, but we should have used them all day long instead. It would probably be a good idea to get the Weather Channel added to the TV lineup, as it was hard to get reports of the hurricane/tropical storm info that was occuring during our stay. My son enjoyed all of the new friends he met from Brazil, Italy, England, and Canada that he met at the daily water polo, basketball and soccer games. We did take a taxi to Playa Del Carmen on the one rainy afternoon. Had lots of fun trying to get some good deals on souvenirs ! We can't wait to return next year. My daugher is even trying to talk some of her friends and parents into joining us !

Not for food snobs like me.\u201d", "Author": "ChicagoJerry1379", "ReviewID": "UR3654993", "Content": "Rooms - We stayed in Building 13. We didn't get the ocean view room we requested as we were honeymooners but we did get rooms facing the outside which are much quieter and recommended. Also, we were supposed to get the honeymoon package but they conveniently forgot about that. We ended up getting it after we called front desk. Only once did we get woken up to loud entertainment or loud drunk people. The room was always clean and had excellent AC, fridge, and a comfortable (but slightly hard) bed. The room was too dark. I think the jungle and the palapa grass hanging over makes it very hard for the sun to get in. Paper delivered daily. The room was not cleaned consistently in terms of time. We tipped good, one day we tipped $5 which we thought was generous. The fridge was kept stocked. Beach - It was awesome. You need to get there early to reserve an optimal spot. There is a policy now to not allow people to reserve spaces by throwing personal items but this was sadly not enforced. For us honeymooners who don't like to come out a the crack of down we had to march around for a while to finally find a spot on the beach. The water in front of the beach can be very dangerous. Yield to the colors of the swimming flag and only swim when lifeguard is on duty. There was also beach waitress service if you were farther away from the bars which was nice. Food - The buffett lacked quality (maybe this was just me) they had too much fajitas, vegetables, salsas, pizza, hamburges, fries, hotdogs, etc. Not exactly what I would like to taste here in mexico. I can get that food great in Chicago. Maybe its just me but frankly I thought the Buffett was not very good and I would rather see quality over quantity. I am very suprised at all the rave reviews because I also thought the restaurants were nothing special as well. And whats the deal with the reservation policy. Every restaurant was \"supposedly\" sold out on any given night yet there were always plenty of tables left open. I think the hotel is skimping on the al la carte restaurants. But having said all that I am food snob and for those who enjoy plenty of food this is the place for you. Drinks - were as specified. If you wanted specific alcohol or quantity, request and tip accordigly. From what I saw, it was an amazing to see all the drinking and people behaving themselves. Truly amazing. Maybe it was because the majority of people were Europeans and they know how to behave themselves and drink, unlike most americans who drink to get drunk. Entertainment / Activities - We only attended two nights of the main entertainment and found it cheesy. Kids and europeans seemed to love it. I think my dislike of the shows had to due with culture differences with humour. We didn't partake in activities except for scuba diving and kayaking. There seemed to be a lot of things for kids to do so this place is more for kids/fmilies and less for couples. But if you can leave with them (and for thos most part the kids were pretty calm) it was worth the savings. Other resort seemed to charge a 25% premium just to not have them around! Overall - for what we paid we got what was coming to us. If I had to do it again not sure if this is the place, since the food was not good, but you can't beat the price. Misc - When it rains the bugs in this place are unbearible. We had a tropical depression the first 2 days and rains the last two days and the bugs were keeping everyone in their rooms (along with the rain) I don't think the hotel can spray any chemicals as it may harm the environments. But of course the weather is out of the hotels grasp, but they should look into environmentally safe ways of ridding the bugs all over the place.", "Date": "July 10, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cAll you need to know about the Iberostar Tucan\u201d", "Author": "beach77031", "ReviewID": "UR3654384", "Content": "Ok, my husband and I finally made it to our Mexican vacation. We arrived at the hotel to find a very beautiful hotel. The hotel is divided in to 2 seperate sides: Quetzal and Tucan. We stayed on the Tucan side and loved it. Something that was a surprise to our friends (but not to us) is that a lot of the hotel is open-air and the air conditioning is found mostly in your rooms. They did not know that they would be hot for most of their trip. It didn't bother us because there is a nice breeze and ceiling fans everywhere. The hotel is huge and there is a lot of walking. At first we were not too happy, but when you eat so much you feel great having to walk it off. The jungle path is uneven, so be careful. The hotel has a very open space with lots of marble so if your feet are wet make sure you walk slowly. Our room was in building 10 which is the last building before you get to the beach. The building numbers start at the beach and work their way up. So the higher the number the closer you are to the lobby and farther away from the beach. Rooms: Were fine - more than enough. We did book a jr. suite because those are the rooms with ocean view and that's what we wanted. Don't risk it by booking a regular room. Also, send an email to the hotel before you arrive letting them who you are and requesting again your room type. Ususally, they more attention to those who send an email. We got a fruit basket in our room when we arrived!! Some people said that the rooms smelled, but it's just the humidity and ocean air. Just run the a/c and ceiling fan and it's no big deal. Other reveiwers complained about the floors being dirty, but you just can't escape sand on the floor. You track it in after the maid cleans and she sweeps it the next day and then you track it in again. Oh well!! We didn't tip the maid, but we were always very nice to her and said hello when we saw her. I think they just really appreciate guests being nice to them. She always cleaned the room spotless and made towel art and put chocolates on the bed. Food: At the hotel was average, but what do you expect when they have to cook for 700 rooms and guests from around the world? The food wasn't gourmet, but we were definitely stuffed after each meal. :) We ate at the Japanese restaurant (good sushi), the Steakhouse (not great, but I'm from Texas and I'm spoiled), and the Tropical restaurant (good fish stick appetizers). Men can also get away with wearing khaki shorts with a collared shirt and belt. We never had any problems and he also wore flip flops to every meal. Alcohol: If you like something specific, you may want to bring it. My husband drinks Crown Royale and the hotel didn't have it. He was very disappointed to know that they didn't have Jack Daniels or Maker's Mark either. They had Canadian Club LTD (?). Not good. I ended up having to go in to Playa to buy a bottle with a slight mark up in price. The hotel uses lower level brands and for some people it's ok, and others prefer to drink what they are used to. I loved the pina coladas because they use real pineapple juice . . . . so yummy!! My husband did fall in love with the Adelita (it's a pink frozen drink). There is a bar everywhere you turn. Beach/Pool: Never got in the pool. The beach is the most awesome thing you have ever seen. The water is cool so it's perfect for cooling down while you lay out in the sun. Before you go to breakfast, head to the beach and set up the towels and umbrella (both of which you get at the towel hut and the umbrellas get handed out fast). When you get done with breakfast your spot is waiting for you. The breeze off of the ocean makes the mid-90s temperature seem like the 80s. Fabulous!! Besides how can you beat looking out at the BLUE ocean watching parasails and boats go by? Watch out for topless europeans! Not all of them are nice to look at! :) If you tip your beach waitress, she'll be your best friend and keep bringing you drinks!! We tipped her $5 for the day and she always brought us a drink when she came around. Entertainment: Star Friends are great at keeping the hotel busy and lots of fun. The nightly show is entertaining, but don't expect a Vegas show. These people work 12 hour days. The disco was a bit of a nightmare. All the teenagers go and get drunk. It's one thing to have a bunch of drunk adults, but to have a bunch of 15 & 16 year olds running around drunk is a whole other thing. They have no experience with alcohol and go completely unmonitored. The hotel is not allowed to serve anyone with a white armband (minors under the age of 18), yet all the kids at the disco had white armbands and were still getting served. All the bartender would say was \"oh well\". Not a good answer. Parents: please keep track of your kids and keep them under control before something bad happens! Drinking age is 18 - let's stick to that!! Do you really want your 15 or 16 year old dancing with someone in their 30's who has been drinking as well?? Just so you know: the hotel is located in Playacar. Playacar is like a gated community of hotels. When you drive in there is a golf course and shopping plaza and then lots of villas that are being built. Then all the hotels are located next to each other on the beach. It was a really cool place. To get to Playa, you take a 10 minute (at the most) taxi that costs $5 from the hotel and when you are done in Playa you just flag another taxi (they are everywhere). We loved our trip and can't wait to go back. We may try another hotel (maybe one that's adults only), but if we don't we would most certainly go back to the Iberostar. A word to the wise: Playa Del Carmen/Playacar are for those escaping the hustle and bustle of Cancun. It's for relaxing. If you want to party hard - then go to Cancun. It's a little inconvienent to get to Cancun from Playacar, so make sure you book your vacation accordingly. :)", "Date": "July 10, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cJuly 3rd 2005 - We had a very enjoyable Vacation\u201d", "Author": "marduggan", "ReviewID": "UR3637551", "Content": "This was our 1st visit to the Playa Del Carmen-Playacar area. My wife and I have been to Cancun on two other occasions (Hotel Zone) and wanted to stay at an \u201cAI\u201d considering we brought along two 18yr old teenage boys. The commute from the airport to the hotel was approximately 50mins that included dropping off 2 sets of guests at other resorts. The check-in process went smoothly and to our delight we were upgraded to the Presidential Suite on the 3rd floor in Building #10 with an oceanfront view. The room was only fantastic. It was approximately 1500sq ft. consisting of a huge living area, Master Bedroom with a King bed, Master Bathroom, 2nd bedroom with 2 double beds and separate bath and to top it off it had a Hot-tub on the deck. My vacation couldn\u2019t have started any better. We gladly tipped our maid for keeping the room spotless throughout our stay. BUFFET RESTAURANTS \u2013 We tried all of the Buffet style restaurants and the food was good and had plenty of variety to suit all tastes. You won\u2019t be disappointed. A-LA-CARTE RESTAURANTS \u2013 We tried the Italian and Steakhouse and both were good. Long Pants needed for the Italian. BARS \u2013 Not top of the line liquor but if you\u2019re mixing it in a cocktail it really doesn\u2019t matter. ENTERTAINMENT \u2013 We attended two \u201cStar\u201d shows and the both were entertaining. It\u2019s no Vegas ! POOLS \u2013 Spend no time at the pool but they were crowded all the time I passed them. It was too hot there! BEACH \u2013 I spent every day at the beach. The temperature was about 10 degrees cooler that at the pools and the ocean breeze was fantastic. The ocean was crystal clear. The beach was a little tight and had a 30degree slope to the ocean but it very nice to lie around under the Tiki-huts or coconut trees. Getting a shady spot later in the morning could be a problem but you could always sign out for a beach umbrella if you needed one. Also, you could order your drinks from the beach side cocktail waitress service. They were always smiling and happy to get what you needed. We gladly tipped them for the convenience. FITNESS CLUB \u2013 I used the fitness center almost every day and found the facilities adequate. I worked out around 8:30am and there was always a piece of equipment available to use. TENNIS COURTS \u2013 There were 2 courts. I played tennis one day on them. They were easy to book time on. SOCCER COURT \u2013 This was a converted Tennis court with goals. My son played a few times on them with some of his new friends. BEACH VOLLEYBALL \u2013 They were 3 set times that organized games took place. Anyone could join in and the Star Friends were the referees. Everyone including my son and his friend had a blast. NITECLUB \u2013 My son and his friend closed the place down every night they were there. They said they had fun every night the. They music was varied but mostly local \u2013 techno according to them. GROUNDS \u2013 The layout of the resort was great. It did take some time getting used to the \u201cJungle\u201d paths. I saw plenty of people including myself trip and fall on them. (They should reconsider repaving them) The Jungle foliage together with the numerous animals made it very unusual and relaxing. We did get to see some monkeys in the trees but I didn\u2019t stick around to get to know them by name. \u2013 Just Kidding. STAFF \u2013 I could honestly say that they were the nicest staff I\u2019ve encountered at any hotel or resort I\u2019ve been to. They always greeted you with a smile and were happy to meet your wishes. They\u2019re very engaging when we spoke to them. I don\u2019t have great Spanish but I was happy to put my 2 cents worth in when I had the opportunity. TIPPING \u2013 I never felt pressured to tip at any time but I did so gladly for the service I was given. I tipped a few dollars for breakfast and the evening meal and occasionally to the Bar staff whenever we got drinks. I tipped the beach waitress and my room maid. Keep in mind that in Europe tipping is the exception \u2013 not the rule \u2013 So there was never any pressure to tip to receive good service. There are a lot of Europeans at the resort which adds to the variety of the place. PLAYA DEL CARMAN \u2013 Take a taxi - 46 Pecos each way to Playa Del Carman \u2013 Great Shops and Restaurants. We ate a Senior Frogs \u2013 not very good and expensive \u2013 I could have saved my money on that meal. HOTEL ZONE \u2013 Taxis ride 450 Pecos each way - to Cancun Shopping Zone. 1 hour by Taxi. CURRENCY \u2013 Everyone takes US Dollars and will sometimes give you dollars back in change. FINAL THOUGHTS - This would be a great place for a Family Reunion. No pressure regarding who pays for what and the variety of the food and rinks would suit all Tastes.

We were joined by 34 of our friends and family. Here are the details of the hotel. 1. Hotel grounds: The hotel is set in a massive jungle environment where there are tons of wild animals running all over. It is really cool. You may even get to see the monkeys. The hotel is beautiful and clean and ALL the staff was so nice. You literally cannot walk by anyone without them saying Hola! The grounds are very expansive, so be prepared to walk a lot. We didn't find this to be a problem at all. We stayed in building 12, which was great because it is right next to the pool and pretty close to the ocean. I would try to make sure not to stay in any building after 13. Several of our guests, however, stayed in buildings 18 and 19 and they had no complaints at all. We actually thought the Quetzal side was a little prettier. 5 out of 5 stars. 2. Rooms: The rooms are nice, nothing too fancy, and they are clean. The rooms will be cleaned daily only if you hang a card from the door handle stating that you want it to be cleaned. They stock the refrigerator with several bottles of water and beer and soda, and they also stock a 1 gallon bottle of water for brushing your teeth, etc. You can't drink the bathroom water. The staff will be more than happy to give you as much of anything you want. The beds are rock hard, but I couldn't believe how well we slept. Apparently the beds are hard at most of the hotels, including the other two we have stayed at. The rooms get 4 out 5 stars. 3. Pool: The pool is a very large, lagoon style. The hotels in Mexico do not heat or cool the pools, so during the summer they get really warm. It was still refreshing though. There are a lot of lounge chairs around the pool and plenty of places to tan or get lots of shade. The beds tend to fill up a bit, so get there relatively early and reserve your space. There are no floaties at the pool, so I recommend bringing some type of flotation device. We gave floaties to all the guests and everyone loved them. They came in handy. There is a separate pool with a bar in it, which was great because it kept the kids out. The bar pool is actually a little cooler (temperature) than the main pool, which was nice. 5 out of 5 stars. 4. Beach: The beach is fantastic! There are a million lounge chairs. Sometimes the beach would get absolutely packed, but we never had a problem finding spots. The ocean is amazing. Very sandy and warm and clear. 5 out of 5 stars. 5. Restaurants: Make reservations as early as possible because they do fill up quickly. a. Buffet: Very good! I couldn't believe all the selections. I'm not a buffet lover in any way, but this was very surprising. I would have been happy to eat there almost every night. 5 out of 5 stars. b. Steak house: Good! The steak was very good, but some others had salmon, which they didn't care for that much. Very good appetizer and salad bar. 4 out of 5 stars. c. Mexican: Very good! 4 1/2 out of 5 stars. d. Tropical: Awful! Do not waste time going there. Nobody liked their meals. 0 out of 5 stars. e. Japanese: Didn't go, but heard it was great. 6. Bars: There aren't that many bars, but there are enough. The hotel pretty much only carries Dos Equis for beer. The liquors are generally not top shelp brands, but there are some options. Each bar will have a list of what they have. There will be some on the menu that you won't see on the shelf, so look at the list. That's how I found my Don Julio tequila. Everyone seemed to enjoy all the drinks, which doesn't always happen at the all-inclusives. I've been to 3 others that had nothing but rot-gut alcohol. Not the case here at all. And they'll make your drinks as strong as you want. 4 out of 5 stars. 7. Entertainment: Not too bad. Nightly shows or bands. There is a night club that was surprisingly fun. 3 1/2 out of 5 stars. 8. Wedding: For those of you getting married, this is the place to be. From the moment you arrive at the hotel the wedding coordinator is on top of things. Mariella really keeps you informed. The wedding planning takes about a half hour. They had great stuff to choose from. You have a choice of a more Mexican theme (we chose this, and it was great), or more traditional white. The beach setting is very pretty and very nicely done. Lots of flowers and pretty decor. The ocean is the backdrop, which is amazing. We later stayed at the Secrets Excellence and saw a wedding and it wasn't nearly as nice as the Tucan. It rained on our wedding day, so we had to have ours under cover. Again, it was also very beautiful. Flowers lining the aisle. Mariella is very organized. She tells you everything you need to know. There is no stress at all. It's hard to imagine it being any better. 5 out of 5 stars. 9. Wedding photographer: She is o.k. at best. She missed some very obvious pics, like the bride walking down the aisle, but we were generally happy with the way they turned out. We didn't hire the videographer. 3 out of 5 stars. 10. Misc.: After the Tucan, my wife and I stayed at Secrets excellence. Great resort, definitely first class. Beach and water don't compare to Tucan. I'll be doing a review very shortly. We have also stayed at the Moon Palace, which we enjoyed, but once again is not even in the same league as the Tucan. The Tucan is a great hotel. It's a $5 taxi ride to 5th avenue in Playa, which is a blast. The staff is great. It is best to do some tipping. You don't have to do much. Just bring about $150 in singles and use those for tipping. They really appreciate it. They make only $5 per day. We would definitely go back.

We flew there from Colorado with our daughter, son-in-law and grandson, only to meet our Mexican daughter, son-in-law and two granddaughters. You see, 26 years ago we hosted a little girl from Mexico through a student foreign exchange program - this is our Mexican daughter. The reservationist made it even more of a happier occasion for all of us as she knew the reason for our trip down there, and placed all three of our families in the same building; it was more than wonderful! Our grandson turned 9 while we were there and the chef, literally outdid himself in making the birthday cake our daughter had ordered for him, fantastic. The group of young people who are with the children everyday go above and beyond their normal duties with all the activities they offer for the kids who stay there and made our grandson's birthday party a memory he will treasure the rest of his life. From the time we checked in at the front desk, we knew we would have a grand time. The ambience that surrounded us was of that which made you feel like you were in a very warm, loving, environment. The lobby was beautiful. The live birds in the lobby were gorgeous and the gift shops welcoming with very good prices I may add. The valets were more than helpful, the maids who took care of our rooms were excellent, the restaurants and buffets had the freshest of foods and the selections were overwhelming. The drinks poured freely not only in the restaurants, but the bar areas, the beach, and everywhere and anywhere you were thirsty; there was always someone there to serve you. Our rooms were very colorfully done in blue and yellow; this had such a very soothing effect. Each room had a beautiful patio which, in our cases, looked out toward a jungle environment. We were very lucky one morning to have 3 wild spider monkeys in the trees outside our patio that were feeding on little berries in the trees. This is not a zoo...it was real, right before our eyes. There were many agouti, iguanas, peacocks, turtles, flamingos, roosters, Toucans, Parrots, Cranes, different varieties of fish, and many other little critters making this an ideal place for the kids....and for us adults too. We loved viewing all of these animals we were living with for our whole week (which was way to short a time to be there) sharing their environment with ours. The resort offered activities for everyone every day. At night a different show was offered at a big nightclub area and the performances, whether it was dancing, singing, acting, or just a \"one on one\" with the audience, was spectacular. Before the show, there was a time for the children as well. This usually started at 8:15 p.m. and kids got to dance, play interactive games and they had a ball. Imagine a group of children from 2 to 13 years of age from all over the world, all together on one big stage having the time of their life. What fun to be at a resort that includes your children and grandchildren and know, that the people who are in charge of this particular activity are superior in what they do. I think what David and I admired most about the whole resort was the cleanliness...not a speck of dirt to be found. The staff is so efficient, the people there just made you feel like you are at home and although there are hundreds of other people there as well, you are important and you are treated like family. I could go on and on about how much we loved this resort....but I think you will know it, after you read this.

The heat from the ground and the lack of air circulation from the folage made our room so humid the sheets were damp at night. The staff would come in daily and spray room freshener to take away the musty smell. This also provides a situation for the bugs to thrive. We stayed in building 17, second floor facing away from the jungle last year and didn't have any complaints. You will truely enjoy your visit to the Tucan, however know that even as a return guest your total satisfaction is not their concern. If you don't return somebody will be there to take your place. That is the attidue the workers have towards you. We will be returning to Mexico, but I think we will be finding another hotel.", "Date": "June 28, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ca.", "Title": "\u201cReturning soon\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3613020", "Content": "!

I remember that everything was fantastic, the food drinks,they keep the better booze under the counter at all the bars, don't be afraid to ask for it, the entertainment was fun and we all got involved. Took many excursions, Xel Ha, Chic chen itsa,Xcaret,Cozumel,Chichen Ha, and the underground cenote tour, all are fantastic. So it's good to hear that all the reviews are positve still.

I loved eating at the retaurant and seeing a waterfall just a few feet way. The landscaping and wildlife really made this resort stand out. The steak house was our favorite a la cart restaurant. BE SURE TO TIP WAITERS AND WAITRESSES not just bartenders. They depend on these tips. However, the buffet at the main restaurant rocked and I normally don't like buffets. However, the food was so fresh. They were constantly preparing more food right before you and replenising the buffet. We got spoiled sampling several different dishes each meal and each ended up gaining about 3 pounds in 5 days and we are picky eaters. Thursday is seafood night at the buffet. Take time to note the beautiful fruit carvings, etc. They are picture worthy. DRESS CODE: Yes, I was aware of the dress code for dinner but be aware there is a dress code for even the main restaurant as well. Granted it is much more lax but we got turned away twice because it changes for each meal. Lunch: simply no beach wear (If you want to eat in your swim suit you'll have to do it at the beach side restaurant.) Supper: No tank tops for men Obviously, the a la cart restaurants have more restrictions. You'll get an info packet which details this when you arrive, but we were so anxious to eat and get on the beach we put on our suits and went to the restaurant without reading it first. ROOMS: Fine We loved the oversized shower and self-programable safe. Not much for dressers but lots of shelving in the closet. Towel art! Fridge, coffee maker, etc. For this resort you may want to consider an ocean view room. Otherwise it is a little hike to the beach and hard to look out and judge the weather through the jungle. Pack a clock! ENTERTAINMENT: The quality varies from night to night. Sometimes it's just silly like for Ms. Iberostar night, but the Broadway show ROCKS!!! I wish we would have known that. We showed up late and missed 1/2 of the show. The show starts around 9:45 officially. They call it the BIG SHOW. However, entertainment of a smaller scale preceeds that. BEACH: Very nice especially if you walk down the beach and compare it to some which have sand bags, etc. They even take your drink orders on the farthest point of the beach which is somewhat unusual. DRINKS: Good. Not strong but we don't like them strong. Anyone who wanted it strong got it strong simply by asking. Wide selection of tropcial drinks but only 2 types of beer and neither were good and we like various Mexican beers. Therefore, my husband did NOT want me to pack an insulted mug for him thinking he would drink beer but then drank tropical drinks and wished he had the mug to keep his drink cold. OVERALL: WE WOULD GO BACK The Star Friends (night show) was a big plus for us. Great service Good value for what we got POOLS: WOW!! You'll love them. ONE more massive than you can imagine w/ zero entry at some points for the kids. A kiddie pool, a bar pool w/ waterfall, and extra pool with b ball hoops COMPLAINTS: our key didn't work and they gave us a new key without ever confirming our names or anything which is very dangerous!! Be sure to use your safe! Europeans were VERY rude cutting in line, bumping into us, etc and never saying sorry or excuse me and when we said something like sorry or excuse me to them they wouldn't respond at all. The staff wasn't very fluent in English. They could answer basic questions but not really have a conversation for the most part and then the guests speak so many different languages that it wasn't easy talking with them either. COMPARING TO CANCUN: We liked this 10 times better than Cancun. It is more beautiful and more laid back with less of an emphasis on getting drunk. People enjoy drinks instead of slam shots. It is better for families. We miss the buses in Cancun. What a deal and people in Cancun spoke better English. I would NOT go back to Cancun, however, and will return to Riviera Maya.", "Date": "June 24, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newport Pagnell, Bucks", "Title": "\u201cFantastic honeymoon!!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3557671", "Content": "Have just returned from the Iberostar Tucan with my new wife after spending our honeymoon there for two weeks from 30th May to 13th June . We had read the many glowing reviews from this site and were not disappointed in any aspect of our stay. After a long flight we were checked into our room very quickly and efficiently , we had a junior suite on the tucan side near the lobby which suited us with no complaints. The room was immaculate and kept that way throughout, beds are harder as mentioned in other reviews but not uncomfortably so. The maid stocked our mini bar everyday and we got towel art on a few occasions. There was a small problem with our sliding door not locking when we first arrived but after a call to reception this was solved promptly within the hour. The same can be said for a leaky sink we noticed a few days into our stay. The hotel and grounds are beautiful, we were lucky wnough to see the monkeys on numerous occasions and couldnt believe how much noise they make for such relatively small animals, we even saw a few baby monkeys in the trees aswell. On one occasion we saw a small boy taking a photo of a monkey, when he tried to the monkey covered his face with his hand, might have been a coincidence but funny all the same. We managed to get a good picture of one of the monkeys which is included with the review. The pool is enormous and also very warm , we werent the earliest of risers (on honeymoon ;) ) so it wasnt always easy to get a poolside lounger but there was always somewhere available to chill out. The swim up bar is a little cooler than the main pool, if you step from one into the other it is like getting into a warm bath. We ate at four out of the five speciality restaurants during our stay. All were good in particular the japanese that we were a little wary of having seen the menu but was delicious and an enjoyable experience to see the food cooked in front of you. The buffet meals were always enjoyable and had an enormous variety , the waiters would keep you fully supplied with water throughout also. the entertainment in the evening was a very high standard from the star friends who work so hard throughout the whole day. We found each show to be of a good quality and not \"amateurish\" as stated in other reviews. Admittedly i am not used to high profile vegas shows either but what we saw was first class. The bar staff are brilliant and you always get served quickly they work so fast. Keep your eye out for Alberto , hes a top man!!!

We arrived at the hotel at around one o'clock in the afternoon. They greeted us with a drink, (nice touch) and our room was ready. We had requested a room in building 1100 or 1200 on the third floor. They gave us room 1246, a corner room overlooking the pool and jungle pathway. It was very nice and clean. When we emailed for the room, I also mentioned that we would be celebrating our anniversary and recieved a very nice fruit basket. I thought the beds were a little hard, but comfortable and slept like a baby. They stocked our refrigerator every day. There was a coffee pot in our room which was great and we always had a towel animal or flower pedals and chocolate on our bed. We did tip the maid 2-3 dollars a day. The pool was beautiful but only used it once, we like the beach better, there was always a breeze by the beach. We did not go down early to save a palapa and usually got there around 10:00 and had no problem getting one. But we stayed at either end of the property where it was less crowded. We rented ski-doos twice, 55.00 for half an hour which goes quick. Lots of fun! Don't put off renting the ski-doos, catamarans, or para-sailing because some of the days that have the red flags up they close the whole thing down because of the rough surf. They are located on the quetzal side. The first nice day do it. They were closed four days out of seven when we were there. We thought the food was great. We ate at the Steak house, Italian, Japanese and the Mexican. Make your reservations the first day there. We could have gotten more al a cartes but we were busy doing other things those days. The buffet was ok, Different things to eat each night. The Thursday night we were there they had Lobster. You can eat all you want, they were good but the butter that you dip it in wasn't. The Japanese restaurant you have to use chopsticks, no silverware in sight. But that made it lots of fun learning to use them. The shows at night were ok, Those starkids work very hard and put on a very nice show, plus they are working all day. Always with a smile on the their faces. We never made it to the disco which opened after the shows. The sun and sand really tires you out. The jungle was really cool, we got to see the monkeys almost everyday, lots of agoutis, chicken, peacocks, and I got to see hummingbirds outside my balcany most mornings. Which thrilled me cause I try to get them at home and they rarely come. We didn't do many outings, went on the Fat Cat Catamaran one day, and a fishing trip another. We also went to Playa Del Carmen one night. It was just too hot to do to much else. There is a little shopping center down the road from the Tucan where we bought some gifts and made our phone calls. Our cell phones did not work down there. Those are the closest phone booths to use which was a pain. If you call from the room it is $5.00 to connect and $5.00 per minute. But you can call collect and that cost a few pesos. Haven't received my phone bill yet to see how much that cost us. But had kids at home to check in with so we had to do it. We will definitely go back to this resort and take the kids with us next time.", "Date": "June 15, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Annapolis, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cWonderful and relaxing again!!!!\u201d", "Author": "bugsyginger", "ReviewID": "UR3551500", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Tucan last year in June 2004. We loved it so much that we went again this year. We took my mother, 2 aunts and 1 uncle. We had a wonderful time again. We all booked our rooms far in advance, and booked the Junior Suites. This added expense was well worth it, and when we go back again next year, we will be doing the same thing. The rooms are the only oceanview room, located adjecent to the beach (obviously), pool and daytime eating areas. We would find lounge chairs each day down by the shallow end of the pool, because this is where all the activities and action take place during the day. The Water Volleyball, Water Aerobics, Daily water dancing step aerobics and games were so much fun. Your on vacation, you need to let loose a little and enjoy these activities, even if you are normally reserved, which I am, but I am so glad I participated. The bar tenders, pool side servers, food servers, clean up crew, and room maid service and oh yes my favoirites the Activities Crew all work very hard to make your vacation wonderful. They conduct fun activities for all ages during the day, and then entertain you at night. If you do not have a good time at the Tucan, then you have just decided not to. The food is very good. I find that they have a large selection on their buffet each night. The Japanese Steak House was fun, however was the only place I found the waitresses to be a little rude. We ate at the steakhouse, this was good, and at the Tropical also good. We make a very big effort to talk with people from all over, so many interesting lives and places that I have never seen. We try to get to know the staff, they are very good people working very hard, which I personally find a little humbling. Great Place, Beautiful beach, Great staff, Good Food, what is not to love? Lastly, I know this is an all inclusive but we feel honored to tip those who work so hard for us all week, we are blessed and like my favorite movie said it Pay It Forward!!!

Eventually got through and collected our luggage. We found our transfer bus straight away and were the first of 3 couples to be collected. We dropped one couple at the Lindo and finally we made it to the Tucan. Check-in Check in was really fast and Laura (at front desk) is a sweetheart. I was a little worried about being put on the Quetzal side (due to the construction at the Yucatan hotel next door) but luckily I got exactly what I wanted which was a junior suite on the Tucan side ground floor room 1006. We were given a fruit cocktail drink which was greatly appreciated. We then proceeded to the reservations desk to make a couple of reservations for that week. We were told we would have 5 but they were kind enough to give us 6. We walked through the jungle to our suite and were lucky enough to see the monkeys. Apparently they don\u2019t appear that often. The room; I have to agree that the smell of must in the room is very overpowering I am sure this is due to the humidity and the air conditioner probably plays a factor in the in this too. After about 3 days it wasn\u2019t so bad and after a week it was either gone or we just didn\u2019t notice it anymore. The room was fine the bathroom was very dark and a little dated but all in all it ok. Apparently the mini bar is restocked every second day but ours was filled everyday along with fresh towels and fresh bed linen. We saw weddings almost every day in front of our room. Which was rather sweet they tend to be scheduled for 5pm and last approximately 30 mins. We received a basket of fruit and a fresh flower arrangement upon arrival in our room. There were also slippers and dressing gowns. We had towel art everyday and received chocolates on our pillows a couple of times. Yes we tipped 2 USD every day we also left a bottle of champagne for the cleaning staff that we received from a wedding party. The beach: The beach has changed dramatically since we were last there, out if the 14 days we had a red flag every day bar one when it was yellow. If you wish to get good sun loungers you really do have to be down at the beach by 8am. Towards the end of the second week it was not only difficult to get beds under palyapso\u2019s it was actually difficult to find beds full stop as the hotel was 100% occupied so yes it was VERY crammed on the beach and you were literally on top of other people. The beach apparently changes every couple of days there was a storm a week or so before we arrived that headed for Cuba before it did too much damage it did however decrease the beach again. IMPO the beach at the Riu Palace is the best followed by the Gala. There are ample sun loungers and all spread out from each other still leaving loads of space on the beach. The water appeared to be a little calmer there too. We managed to jet ski and take the catamaran out but it was rather dangerous and we saw a couple turn over. Nonetheless the beach was lovely just a little crowded The Pool: I\u2019m a beach bum so I was only in the pool once. It was like a warm bath and there is very little to no breeze there so I opted for the beach instead. One thing I was surprised about were the volume of mosquito\u2019s I must have been bitten about 30 times. I used Autan Mosquito repellent but was still eaten alive by them we also had a plug in repellent in our room. On the second day after we had killed about 10 in our room we asked reception if they could spray the room with something they said they would, not sure if they did and if so it didn\u2019t make much difference. I was also bitten by what the Mexicans call a \u201cTabano\u201d which is yellow and about the size of a dragon fly these are usually found on the beach some people are immune and some unfortunates like me can have an allergic reaction which makes the effected are swell grotesquely. At first I had what appeared to be a tennis ball growing from my arm just above my wrist which later spread all the way to my elbow. I visited the doctor on the Quetzal side who gave me a steroid cream and some anti allergy pills the swelling eventually disappeared a day after we arrived home. Restaurants My favourite a la carte restaurants were the Steak House and the Japanese. I wasn\u2019t too fond of the buffet but that\u2019s just me. The pool bar was a great place to meet new people and boy did we meet lots of great people here. The lobby bar is also a good place to hang out and the disco on the Quetzal side is good fun especially if you go with a large crowd of people. Outside of hotel: We were in PDC 4 times we ate there a couple of times and went to Senior Frogs and the Blue Parrot we also did our gift shopping there. We took the ferry over to Cozumel to swim with the dolphins the ferry cost 16 USD & the dolphin discovery 125 USD. Well worth it. My husband played golf on two of the days this was rather expensive at 150 USD per day. He thoroughly enjoyed it and said the course was beautiful. The weather was very mixed in the second week it was cloudy almost every day with light rain showers now and again. We also had a tropical storm on the Tuesday before we left which left PDC roads flooded this started at about 6pm and continued till appropriately 2:30am. Spa Girls fon\u2019t forget to treat yourself to a massage at the spa just to the right of the lobby. Summary: All in all this hotel is great the staff are very efficient and very friendly the food is good and it is perfectly situated with regards to accessibility to PDC. We wanted relaxation as well as fun and we got both. I would have no problems recommending this hotel to families and young people However it is not for the elderly or those with limited mobility as it is a huge resort and has some very slippery and uneven surfaces.

Our names were on a list and we gave the attendent with Olympus our travel voucher and he in turn gave us a return trip voucher. We waited 10 minutes and were transported by van to the tucan along with a few other people. We were the first to be dropped off and loved what we saw. We arrived at 1 PM and checked in. We were told that the room would not be ready until 3 PM but were invited to eat lunch and use the facilities until the room was ready. We ate at the buffet restaurant on the tucan side and then roamed the jungle. Saw the monkeys right away. The kids loved all the wildlife around the complex. Every time you turned around there were peacocks, agoutis and other animals scurrying around the jungle. The pools were great and the beach was spectacular. We are beach people and found that the tucan/quetzel had the nicest beach (not the largest) in the area. The palapas were great and all the palms offered great shade. The beach sloped down so that the chairs in front of you did not block the view of the ocean. Everyone was well behaved and kept to themselves. We are from the USA and did not hear too many people speaking english. Quite an international group of people which we liked. Met some real nice families from England. No one was rude, but most people just kept to themselves. We were put on the Quetzel side in 2500 block. Our room was great and always cleaned to our satisfaction. We probably tipped $150.00 for the week. It is not required and no one had their hand out for tips but I know they were appreciated. The people working their work very hard and always seem to be in good spirits. We found the food to be great and were given 3 a la carte reservations for a one week stay. We ate at the Steakhouse (Great) the Japanese (Great cook) and the Italian (romantic). We had no complaints about food. The grounds were wonderful and always kept clean. We went to 5th avenue one night for my wife to do some shopping. There are many stores and restaurants but I didn't like all the hassling done by each shop owner trying to get you into their establishment. I definately could have done without this venture. We went to chichen itza for the day. Was very hot but great things to see. Went with a private tour company which we highly recommend. Had a driver and a tour guide for the day. Transportation was in a 10 passenger van all for our family of four. It was very hot at the ruins. We paid $85.00/ person for the whole day and the guide and driver were great. You can check them out at ----. We thought it was better than going on a bus tour with a lot of people. Also did the dolphins at wet and wild. It was just OK. The dolphins in our group were not cooperating so the experience wasn't was it should have been. Bought the DVD only to later find that it was another group from the same day. Would not do the wet and wild again. These were the only excursions we went on. Just enjoyed laying out at the beach.

A cenote is an underground cave with water in it. A Mayan medicine man performed a cleansing ritual over us before we could go down there. I don't actually believe the cenote is a passageway to the underworld, but it was cool to be a part of someone else's culture. Everyone was very respectful. We had to get on our hands and knees and crawl through a hole to get into the cenote. Once in, there were steps going down and a beautiful pool of water we were able to swim in. It was my favorite part of the day. After that we got into kayaks and paddled back to our van. We drove back to the village where the Mayan women had prepared us lunch. Lunch was homemade tortillas, salsa, chicken, beef, rice, beans, fruit, and all sorts of yummy things. Alltournative does a good job and all of the water you are served all day is filtered. Try the hibiscus water (it tastes a lot like cranberry juice). After lunch, we were able to do a little bit of shopping and buy pictures from the zipline. (If you want to buy a hammock in Mexico, BUY IT HERE-they are much more beautiful and cheaper than the ones in Playa del Carmen). Next, we drove to Coba, a huge area of Mayan ruins. We were able to ride bicycles (or rent bicycle taxis) to a ruin that is taller than Chichen Itza. It isn't as scary as some ruins and the view lets you see mountains in Belize. Finally, we stopped at the Alltournative store and had tequila shots with our group. It was an amazing day and I hope you book this tour if you want a little adventure. They keep the groups to about 10-12 so you have a fun time meeting the people on your tour. We paid $90 a person and it was totally worth the price.", "Date": "May 28, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "MARYLAND", "Title": "\u201cFantastic\u201d", "Author": "CRISD16507", "ReviewID": "UR3504601", "Content": "Book your trip now.

The Spa was great too. Enjoyed the food no matter where we ate, from the buffet, to the speciality rest. (we tryed Japan., Steak & Mexican) and the grill near the pool. We brought lots of ones, we tipped waiters, bartenders & maid, they really do appreciate it and treat you well. Checkcards are good for purchases, but be aware that you are charged a small fee. There is a little strip shop area about a ten minute walk, that we found had prices just as good as Playa del Carmen. Also has an internet cafe that has good prices on internet connections & phone cards. Lot's to do & see. Or just relax.

I'm 35 years old and went on a long weekend away with my sister, mom and aunt. We had a great time. When originally trying to decide where we should go, we considered lots of places - however, after reading all the reviews here we figured we couldnt lose. If you're driving yourself crazy deciding where to go - go here!! You'll love it. We booked our trip thru Apple Vacations and used an online travel agent (which I had never done before and was a little hesitant about) but he was fantastic (Steve Umsted at Berwick Travel). If you Email him a question - he gets right back to you. All of our paperwork arrived a couple weeks before the trip. All flights, transfers went smoothly! Will definately use them again. Upon check in I told Laura (at the front desk) that I had emailed the resort a couple times requesting buidlings near the beach and pool. After checking availablilty she surprised us and upgraded BOTH our rooms to oceanfront junior suites - we were thrilled! We stayed in building 20 - on the Questzal side (the entire resort feels like one hotel so it REALLY doesnt matter what side you're on), the room was very nice, clean, A/C worked great - we were cold and it was 90 every day! Shower always hot - good pressure (large marble showers/no tub). Mini bar stocked daily with water, soda and beer. We had no problems with the water - as far as getting sick - and met no one there who had. We were provided with robes and slippers (this may be in the \"junior suites\" only), chocolates and flower petals on our pillows each night, and cute towel art daily. We did leave a $4 tip for the maids each morning. As far as the beds are concerned - we slept great - not too hard at all and I like an average bed - have no idea what other people are talking about??! Room had iron/ironing board, hairdryer. They dont supply hair conditioner - so if you use it, be sure to bring some. We also brought a battery operated alarm clock as there is no clock in the room. We did bring lots of $1 bills and tipped the bellboys, bartenders, etc - they were really great - you'll want to tip! (Also if you bring American $ dont bother exchanging it) The beach is absolutely great - nice soft white sand - water had to be 80-85 degrees. Not rough at all when we were there. Just perfect-the water is so blue it looks fake - really! The pool was actually a little warmer than the ocean - 85 degrees, really big. We brought floats - alot of people do and its nice to float around the pool when its so hot! I had read other posts that said the pools were freezing - I think it depends on what time of year you go! We got up early every day and got \"our spots\" at the pool or beach. It did seem that alot of people do - but still didnt seem as though anyone had much trouble getting lounges. The staff did tell us that May thru August is the resorts slow time - so there were no lines for anything - food, bars, etc. The staff is unbelievable - so NICE, friendly, accomodating - it is really fun to try and talk Spanish with them - they TRIED to teach us! Food was good (not fantastic) - but better than other all inclusives we've all been to. We loved the Japanese restaurant, didnt care for the Italian (although the lasagna was good). Breakfast buffet is great - they have everything you could think of. Probably our least favorite buffet was lunch - dinner buffet impressive with ice sculptures, etc. They serve soft-serve ice cream at the beach bars which is yummy! We brought insulated, covered mugs and used them for our drinks while at the beach - the bartenders gladly rinsed them for us and filled them. The \"jungle\" area is neat to walk thru - it basically connects the pool/beach side of the resort to the lobbies/restaurants side - with the room buildings running the entire lengh. We saw the monkeys twice - chasing each other thru the trees! They have parrots, tucans, iguanas (in cages!), flamingos, other cool birds and also some chickens, etc. If you dont like to walk - or have trouble doing so - this probably isnt the resort for you as it is big and there is some walking. The walk from the beach to the lobby - for example - is about 10 minutes and it is a \"bumpy\" walkway - stone/cement. The areas closer to the lobbies/restaurants are surrounded by \"rivers\" and fountains filled with Koi fish. There is a large stage and seating pavillion for the shows - the entertainment was good - the Star Friends really do work hard - but dont expect Las Vegas caliber! We are already planning a trip back - next time I'll bring my husband and 2 boys (4 and 2 years old). There were lots of kids there and all very good (I saw none that seemed to be a problem) - they seem to have a wonderful childrens program (large kiddie pool, playground). And next time I'll go for at least a week - we were sad to leave!

Here is another endorsement for the Tucan. Us: 2 couples, mid forties, professionals, like to have a good time. (We are from California, so keep that in mind) 1) Getting there. Took American, they were very punctual and helpful. Van to Tucan at night, $62.00 clean and air conditioned. Check in uneventful, the Tucan makes a very elegant first impression when walk in the open air lobby. 2) We stayed in bldg. 11, ground floor facing pool. Very quiet, except for kids wearing tap dancing shoes comeing down the stairs every am @ 7:30. It's vacation, sleep in some! 3) Beds are firm, end of story. Why so much discourse over this? 4) Drinks and liquor selection decent. Better booze in main \"event\" bldg. at night. I know these guys lost money on my friend. He does love his Dos Equis. 5) tipping. We tipped $2 for the maid every day, we tipped the bartender, waitresses, and we left money at every meal. Probably more than most people, but these folk are very friendly and we felt they deserved it. Maybe blew $75-$100 during the week this way. 6) We LOVED the jungle walk every day. Always something, monkeys or peacocks. Especially loved the \"bush pigs\". Ok, they're not pigs but more like large slick furred hamsters. Pretty funny. Oh, and look for my favorite iquana just off the path between bldg 11 and the towel hut. He has a hole underneath he hangs out in. 7) Not too many kids when we were there. Maybe half US, the rest a mix of Euro. Americans seemed to behave themselves. The only rude behavior came from some of our NATO allies, they thought themselves quite important. No need to mention more. A special shout out to Phil and friends from Wales. Go Man. U! Arsenault blows. (Also to David from Boston) 8) 5th street somewhat annoying, but go with the flow; the shop owners are pretty friendly. Thought that Cozemul was somewhat cheaper. 9) It is NOT a short walk to town, like I told my friends. My wife and I are runners, so we enjoyed the walk. However, it is a good 20 minutes at a brisk pace. Do it so you can see all the villas for sale. 10) Took Am. Exprss travelers checques. Kind of a pain. Take some for security next time, and the rest cash 11) This is too long, and I left out a lot, oh yeah FOOD. It's not the French Laundry. ( Norcal joint, look it up) However, it is quite adequate. Steakhouse surprisingly good, Japanese also fun, good quantity. E mail me with specific questions if you'd like.

Our arrival went smoothly. Our package included a non-stop transfer from the airport to the hotel. A local came to take our luggage from us, and we let him. He moved us to the front of all the lines and showed us where to go for a tip. This was probably the most stressful part of the stip, but everything went fine. We got to the hotel at about noon or so and were told that no rooms were available. We started to walk away, but were called back saying one room just opened up. We were booked on the Tucan side, but the room was on the Quetzal side. They did not ask us if it was ok to move sides, but the receptionist had been explained to us earlier that they were really one hotel. Therefore, if you can find one cheaper than the other, take it, as they will put you wherever. I had heard about construction on the Quetzal side, and inquired about this. I was told our room faced the opposite way of the construction, so we were fine and took the room. The rooms were very nice, and yes the beds were hard, but we did not have any trouble sleeping. We could hear the construction noise, but it was not a bother as we did not spend much time in the room during the day. One night the constuction noise did last until about 9:30 pm. There were a bunch of birds outside our room, and were actually noisier than the construction. There was almost no difference between the two sides of the hotel. The only difference I noticed is that the Tucan side is more landscaped where the Quetzal side is kept more natural or jungle in appearance. The food was good. We were given 3 guarenteed reservations, but ended up eating in the a la carte 5 nights since we quickly become tired of buffets in general. The beach and pool were both very nice. We never had a problem getting a spot at any time of the day at either spot. A lot of people do reserve chairs early in the morning. We did not feel like doing that and never had a problem. The beach was the nicest in the area with the two neighboring hotels having a similar beach. It did change daily with erosion though, and looked completely different the day we left then the day we arrived. The people/staff were very nice. There were a lot of Americans and Europeans. Also for us Americans who are not as used to it, there is definetly topless bathing on the beach. Each night there is a show that is put on by the staff. Some where funny and good while others were not, but we didn't expect a broadway show.

We stayed for 2 weeks in the Iberostar Tucan/Questzel in Playcar. We flew with First Choice with their new planes which are excellent! We flew Premium class which is even better but the whole plane offers leather seats, seat back entertainment with choice of films, tv, music, games etc. A long flight of 10 hours but worth it. The airport of Cancun can be a hugh hassle with all of the security checks etc, but we were lucky and were in and out very quickly. Again this helps if you fly premium class as the check in etc is much quicker. Transfer time to the resort is about 1 hr and on arrival you arrive in a magnificent marble lobby with fountains etc and get given a welcome cocktail. We stayed in the Tucan side of the hotel in block 16 which is right near the reception lobby and main restaurant. Rooms are spacious, spotlessly clean and the air con is great. Bathrooms have a lovely shower which 2 or 3 people can fit in easily. Beds are firm but very comfy and sleeping was no problem. The only small complaint was that if you have a room near an ice machine, the staff use this every morning at about 7am to collect ice and it is soooo noisy, so no lie in's! The swimming pool is so big and welcoming from the scorching heat but in the afternoon the water can be really warm soemtimes. We never had a real problem getting a sunbed before 10am. The beach and sea is the best I have ever seen. It is powder white sand and clear turquoise sea which again is very welcoming. The beach offers a nice breeze where as the pool area can be too hot between 12 and 4pm. The hotel grounds are amazing and the jungle area beautiful, with peacocks, pheasants, flamingos, monkeys, lizards, and these other animals that resembled a mixture of a squirrel and vole but much bigger. Food is exceptional and there is so much choice. You get 6 visits to the a la carte restaurants in a 2 week stay, but if you go to the a la carte restaurants on any given day and ask if they have any space they will always try and fit you in. We had 8 visits. We went to the Steakhouse 3 times (go for the fillet steak mmm), Italian 3 times, Tropical once and Mexican once. The main buffet restaurant is lovely too, with some dishes the same every night but also a wide variation of meats, fish dishes, specialties etc. There is no way anyone can say that they felt they got bored of the buffet as you can go there every night, have something different and still not try everything. Drinks wise, again they are all free, even glasses of champagne which we had with our meal every night. The cocktails are lovely, try the banana daiquiri or tequilla sunrise. Be careful of too many pina coladas or coco locos as they contain coconut milk ( a natural laxative). Beer was average and was some local brand, not the Corona or Sol I'd hoped for. There were some international brand spirits ie Smirnoff, Gordons Gin, Baileys, etc. I like Jack Daniels but that wasnt available so I had to drink Jim Beam instead. Entertainment: Absolutely fantastic! The Star Friends (animation team) were the best, especially, Anna-Laura, Rosario, Fabio, Carlos and Jesus. They never stop working. Activities are organised throughout the day for guests to participate, ie water polo, volleyball, football, rifle shooting, water aerobics, water games ie lilo racing etc, and many more. Often they perfom dancing shows on the beach too. In the Evening in the main theatre, the kids show is on from 8:15pm until 8:45, then it is often live music until 9:15pm Then was a guest participation game, before the main show starts at circa 9:45pm. These were varied and very good. The Las Vegas show in particular. You could assume that they were professional. Live music again afterwards, then there is a nightclub for anyone wanting to stay out later open until 3am. PLaycar its self offers a small shopping area about 10 mins walk from the hotel selling the usual souvenirs, t shirts etc but PLaya del Carmen is only a 5 min taxi ride away or if you feel like it, a 45 min or so walk. Visit 5th Avenue where you will find many of the same souvenir shops but mixed with designer shops ie Diesel, (much cheaper than at home). Excusions: We went to Chichen Itza, very good, but an exhausting day as its a 3hr bus journey. I probably given the choice now, wouldnt have gone looking back at it. We also did the Catermaran cruise which was nice, a chance to snorkel etc. If you do travel with First Choice, dont do the Monday night fever bar crawel in PLaya del Carman, as its 50 dollers each and they take you to 3 bars, ie Senor Frogs and Carlos and Charlies where you get your free (limited to certain brands) drinks. It is much cheaper to get a taxi there yourself and buy your drinks. That was a big dissapointment. Weather wise, first 10 days were extremly good with hot sunshine and the odd burst of rain in the evening, the last few days also very hot but also very overcast and cloudy. Take plenty of sun lotion! Tips: take plenty of 1 or 5 doller bills and tip cleaners, waiters etc and they appreciate it and really show their appreciaton in the service they provide you. Email the hotel before you go if you want a specific room location etc and they try to accomodate where possible. Use plenty of Mosquito repellent as they little buggers get you every night. My wife had about 30 bites on her legs at one point. Try a Mexican Flag tequila shot.... WOW they absolutely blow your socks off! Finally... Out of all the places we have ever been, this has been the best hotel we have ever stayed in and we will definately return.

We stayed in building 21, loved it, we were away from the jungle and right near the beach where we wanted to be. As far as getting a good spot on the beach as long as you are there by 8:30 you shouldn't have a problem. We did have one and only one problem at the beach, we had gotten chairs at 8am and an older couple came about an hour later and decided to move two chairs on our side of the beach hut and reserve them, which I thought was really rude because if your sitting on the left then the left side is your's and vice versa, the whole point of the hut is to be able to move in and out of the sun, which is up and down. About two hours later their friends showed up and moved their chairs literally on top of my boyfriend and I if you were laying on your stomach you would be looking at their faces. That was extremely rude and inconsiderate. We decided it best to just move our belongings somewhere else and not say anything, but common sense would have told you that was just rude! The food was great, you do get a little tired of the buffet by the last couple of nights but they do a great job at keeping a wide variety of options. And with the different a la carte's it does break it up.

The best thing about the Playacar area (which is gated and very secure) is the way it is set up - - all the hotels (I think there are 5-6) facing the beach and when you go outside your hotel lobby you are in a plaza area with shops at the far end and a golf course. You can walk up the plaza area and enter the city/town of Playa Del Carmen. You won't make a mistake if you pick the Iberostar Tucan for your next vacation.

They do serve alcohol to underage kids & our kids did go to the disco at night. We made it perfectly clear to them it wasn't allowed & were up every night when they returned from the club, we even went with them one night for a while.

I did take our towels out to our spot about 7:30 each morning. We then went to breakfast and then to the beach. The pools are outstanding and the swim up bar is something that you should do at least once if you go. They had a sports pool as well. The weather was beautiful. The resort is beautiful. We had the best time, it was sad to leave. I could go on and on but will stop. The only day trip we did was to Xel-ha to swim with the dolphins and we had a great time there! I also have some information to share about some of the beaches at the other hotels in Playacar. If you are interested or have any questions about Xel-ha or the beaches, you can email me at bball45@iwon.com and I will be happy to answer any questions. If you are thinking about going, do it!

Why we haven't tried the Tucan previously rather than suffering through a myriad of issues with the Gala for the past several years is just crazy! What a terrific place! The hotel is absolutely beautiful - with the Tucan bordering the south side - and the Quetzal bordering the north. The hotels appear similar - though the design differs between a tiki-south-pacific style for the Quetzal, and more of a Mediterranean-style for the Tucan. Both are very nice. Between the two is this incredible mini-jungle with ravines, waterfalls, all kinds of animals including monkeys, flamingos, tucans, parrots, peacocks, and lots of other types and species - most uncaged and living near-naturally within the confines of the area between the hotels. The sounds are terrific...you'd swear you're deep in the wild jungle. The swimming pool is gigantic! I've never seen a bigger pool - anywhere! There's plenty of chairs, but you do need to get an early jump to ge a good one. There's also a separate in-the-pool-bar...which get's bit crowded (and loud), but if you're in to that type of thing, they've got it! Separate water-sport pool, adult pool, etc. There's a boatload of pool - enough to accommodate everyone! Plenty of sun...plenty of shade. Cool stuff! Beach is terrific too. It's not as huge as Gala's, but it's plenty big. Lot's of palapas, lot's of chairs, good beach service - and the drop-off to the water is not that bad. Water is rock-free and great for swimming. Topless report: about 20% at the beach and pretty rare at the pool. Lot's of Euro's...which is a great thing...not only for the topless...but there's something cool about hearing 4-5 different languages being spoken all within an ear shot. The buffet restuarants beat the Gala hands down. Theres just such a great variety of foods - complete with a hand-carved meat selection that served 3 different kinds each night. Service is impeccable - we found the food to be terrific (though the Gala was our standard), and being the buffets overlooked the jungle, the experience really hit on a few different levels - - all equally well for us. The service at the hotel was incredible! Check in was a breeze...10 minutes and we were in our room. The room was standard/nice. Well stocked bar, good air conditioning, nice balcony...all pretty standard. The entire staff at the hotel was just head and shoulders above the Gala - as was the resort itself. They're just on two different levels...Gala is like a Motel 6....IB Tucan is like a Four Seasons. We will be going back to the Tucan - no doubt - before years end. It could not have been a better experience...in any way! Whatta great trip. Whatta great Hotel. What terrific people. I just love it down there - and the IBT just really made all the difference!

Wish we could have stayed longer. We stayed in building 11 which is the second building from the beach and next to the pool. This location is great. Building 10 has jr. suites and an ocean view. I would also recommend buildings 12 and 13 which are located near the beach and pool. The main restaurant is near buildings 15/16. There are a few more buildings near the lobby but I thought they were too far from the beach/pool. The Quetzel side looked just as nice. The grounds surrounding the buildings were beautiful. Many different plants and banana and coconut trees. There is a flat walkway on the outer edge of the resort. I recommend this for travelling around the resort. The path that goes through the jungle is very rough and winding. It appears to be made of poured concrete with 6-12\" rocks, many sticking up slightly out of the concrete. It is also not well lit at night time. The jungle is beautiful though so it's worth taking a walk through it. We did see monkeys, various birds, iquanas and the agoutis, which looks like a large rodent. None of the animals approached us but they were cool to watch. The star friends were so nice and welcoming. They announced the activities and made everyone feel welcome to participate. The beach Volleyball was fun. Fabio (from Brazil) led the stretch and tone classes. It was under a hut so it wasn't too hot. I recommend trying this. Not too easy or hard. My sister-in-law took the bike tour into Playa del Carmen. It took about 1 hour 15 minutes total. She loved it. This is free. Look at the activities schedule. The water was great. I brought an inflatable tube (the dive shop will fill it) and floated in the water. The waves were gentle. It was wonderful. I brought water shoes for the ocean but didn't need them. I hardly saw any shells. The beach is hard to walk on because the area near the water is sloped. We walked anyway but only went about 1/2 mile. The hotel to the right is the Gala which is the last in Playacar. After the Gala is a stretch of empty beach which would be nice but no one seems to be cleaning it. We did see a guard patrolling down there. The buffet was good. Always something interesting. We ate lunch by the pool/beach everyday. They had a good variety. The burgers and grilled chicken were very good. We also loved the gazpacho (cold soup). We went to the steakhouse. The tenderloin was great but I found the salad and dessert selections to be too limited. Also, the steakhouse is outdoors. They just put tableclothes on the Quetzel side beach/pool buffet. The atmosphere is not fancier than the regular buffet. We went to the beach at night and were glad to see that they had security guards at night. Hope you enjoy your trip.

Buffet by the pool was weakest, though did the trick when you don't want to sacrifice too much sun/fun. -Beverages: ask for more alcohol or top shelf brands.

I was surprised at first, but it wasn't really a problem. Blow dryers in the bathroom. No alarm clock in the room but they have wake up calls. TV provides many English speaking stations. Beds are firm but I promise you won't have any problems sleeping like a baby. It actually feels really good. -Beach: excellent, though a bit turbulent the first few days we were there. There is a rather sharp drop off...so most children preferred the pool. Nice secluded beaches a short walk south from the property. We brought a raft and used it in the pool. -Access to town: excellent. Most people neglect to mention that this property is actually located in Playacar, which is a landscaped community just a short distance outside of Playa Del Carmen. Playacar contains an aviary, golf course, many resorts and a small mall. When we were ask to complete the feedback forms, there is really very little we could complain about. The shows were a bit loud and the beats were heard in our rooms until about midnight. The resort does everything they can to accomodate guests. If you have a large group, consider renting a car from the resort and exploring on your own. It is cheaper than an excursion. Another tip for groups: Walkie talkies!

We stayed from 29th March - 6th April. We had such an amazing time I cannot fault this hotel at all. In summary: The Hotel ====== The accommodation was perfect for us. We stayed in block 20 on the Quetzal side (Tucan and Quetzal exactly the same - just mirror one another). We booked an ocean front room and on arrival were given a junior ocean front suite without paying extra. I am guessing this was due to us marrying at the hotel. I have read many reviews from people complaining about the beds at this hotel - I can honestly say this was never a problem for us and we slept soundly every night. I found the rooms and bed very comfortable! The jungle area in and around the hotel is fantastic. It adds a really nice touch when you see peacocks, flamingos, tucans, parrots, monkeys etc etc just wandering around the jungle area. The Beach ======= Well what can i say except pure perfection. It is absolutely stunning and is paradise. A few hotel further down the strip have suffered slight beach erosion but the Tucan had none of this at all (it didn't look like a major problem at other hotels either). Sunbeds are always easy enough to find on the beach even at midday. The volleyball and watersports on the beach were great fun. We played volleyball every morning and afternoon for an hour unless we went on a day trip. The Pool ====== The pool was also fantastic. It is huge and has a jacuzzi in the middle which is fun. It can be lightly warm in the afternoon but this was never a problem as the sea was very cold so if you didn't fancy jumping into freezing water on the beach you can stroll to the pool and still feel refreshed after a swim. People ===== I won't comment too much on the other guests at the hotel as not many of them are friendly or even look at you for a quick hello as they walk past. The Star Friends (hotel entertainers) certainly made up for the other guests lack of interest at being friendly. I cannot say one bad thing about the Star friends - I have never seen a group of people work so hard together to make your holiday perfect. They stay so cheerful even after the 5 hours a night of sleep and one day off a week that they are allowed. The evening entertainment wasn't amazing but again it was very good and the Star Friends work their socks off to make this fun for you. Weddings ====== We got married on 6th Apr at the Tucan and is was perfect. I couldnt ask for more. We did have to have a blood test a few days beforeas one of the legal requirements but this was a breeze. I hate needles and worked it up to be something it wasn't as it was over in seconds. If anyone would like to see any photos to give you an idea then please e-mail me. So overall the hotel was perfect, wedding was perfect and we just can't wait to go back one day to relive such a wonderful holiday. If you want to know more then drop me an email.

The beach was always very crowded and it was nearly impossible to get a chair at the pool unless you went early. I prefer a more secluded beach. The pool cabanas are fun to hang out in (get up early and nab one.) We never saw any monkeys in the jungle there (and we always looked for them). Never had a problem with the Europeans there. Some were loud but hey, we're human and it's ridiculous to stereotype a whole population of people on one incidence...... The Star Friends were fun the first night \"EVERYBODY CLAPPING!\" thats all i have to say. Book any tours down the road at a little shopping area in Playacar, it's much cheaper than booking at the hotel. Our tour to Chichenitza was well worth it, many added bonuses of seeing the life of real Mexico. Xel-ha/Tulum tour was also great! Ladies, be sure to bring nice clothes to wear at night.

The teens in our group went to the shows and disco every night. They were having a blast, meeting new friends from all over the world, dancing and enjoying the freedom. We only discovered towards the end of our stay that they had been drinking every single night. Although they wore white armbands, they were served alcohol easily. Shots were plentiful for all. My son became so intoxicated that his friends had to call the security guards to escort him back to the room. I am not excusing him at all - he has major consequences to deal with - BUT I am saying that if your teen, even as young as 13 or 14, is inclined to drink, they will be able to do so here.

There were three of us in our group. All of us are 27 year old professionals. We had a fabulous time at the Iberostar. Upon arriving until our departure it was a fabulous trip. The staff at the Iberostar are amazing. They are always willing to go the extra mile for you! The Star Friends are great. They work from morning till night, they even go to the Disco every night to liven up the crowd. We only went to the Disco once, as once was enough, too many 18 years olds. I can't say enough about the staff, they truly enjoy their jobs and it shows. Our room was great. We were in building 11 which is one building from the ocean and right by the pool. We had to walk about 25 yards to get to the pool or the beach, that was great. I had requested that building before we went and was pleasantly suprised that our request was honored. So do request a certain building, it can't hurt. Building 10 is right on the beach and building 19 is right next to the lobby. We left our cleaning person $5 the first day and he left us a HUGE jug of water and about 8 bottles of water. He did this every day as we drank all of it every day. He also refilled the sodas we had drank. After the first day we left about $2 a day and the water kept on coming. Believe me, you will need all that water! The pool and the ocean were great. We would move throughout the day from the pool to the beach. We brought our own rafts($2.99 at Target, $12.50 at the shops in playacar) and used them every single day. The last day we gave them away to people who didn't have them, they seemed to be greatful for them! The drinks kept flowing at the pool. The beach was great. I didn't pay attention to smokers or cigarettes on the beach so it must not be as bad as some people claim it to be. BUt the water is like bath water. Its a challenge to swim to the rope and then back. We did it on a red flag day with no problems. Its a great workout, especially after all the food and drinks! We ate lunch everyday at the Palapa on the Tucan side, we thought it was better food. They had a different specialty everyday but they also had burgers/fries/pasta everyday. The three of us liked all the food and had no complaints. The Japanese restraunt was fantastic. We loved it. The food was so good, ask for Sake, they will keep it flowing all night long! The steak house was also good. We had a few bottles of champagne that night, and it was actually very good. The Italian Restaraunt was okay, we really liked the bread. The buffets were very good. Breakfast was our favorite, so many things to choose from. I think I had something different every morning. The coffee was also delicious. The bars are all great. I loved the banana daquiris. They weren't as sweet as the strawberry and were made \"fresh\" not out of a machine. The beer got a little old after a while, but put a lime in it and it is fine. We went to Xel-Ha and enjoyed ourselves. We did snorkeling right in the morning and Dolphins in the afternoon. We booked online before we went then took a taxi straight there. We didn't want to deal with buses or tour companies. I cannot say enough positive things about the Iberostar Tucan.

Both buffett resturants were excellent loads of choice every night. All the ala carte resturants were good except the Tropical wasnt to out taste. The location of the hotel was very central for any trips 40 mins from the airport and about an hour from the ruins. The rooms were spacious and very clean didnt find the beds hard as some of the reviews mentioned. Maids seem to expect $1 a day tip if you dont you dont get the towel art on your bed every night no big deal. Also used the laundry service which was excellent and my husband used the hairdressers which again was excellent. During the two weeks we were at the hotel the weather was perfect hot and sunny everyday with occasional cloud spent most of our time on the beach as there was no breeze by the pool. Bar service on the beach was excellent tip one of the ladies once or twice and they keep coming back all day asking if you want another drink no need to get off the sunbed. Peacocks, iguanas, ducks, flamingos, monkeys and other creatures run free around the hotel we found the facinating. The evening show and daily annimation team were fantastic something going on all day even saw santa on vacation!!! We one of the messing around as the did everyday around 4pm. Watch out for the monkey the like to steal from your balcony. We will be visiting this hotel again could not fault it, only we wont go again when it is the US Spring Break US teenagers were drinking like the world was ending for five days and they were in large groups only supervised by a couple of adults. Very loud and drunk most nights but to be fair the hotel security is very good only have to call them and they remove any noisy teenagers.

This was a great vacation. Here is my review of this hotel. We booked with Signature and flew with Skyservice. Please beware of Skyservice, they will charge passengers for luggage over the limit of 20 kg. They did it in Canada and Mexico. We argued but we had to pay no matter what. The staff (waiter, bartender, repair, maintenance) was extremely friendly. For our group this was the highlight of our trip. We have been to many places before but we feel that this group of employees was the BEST we ever had. They recognized you and made you feel welcomed. They were always smiling. They were going the extra mile to please you. Never had to wait at any bar to get the drinks we ordered. We did not tip every time but it seems that we did. The only exception was with the front desk personnel, the people there seems to forget all of our requests to fix our AC. I had to go five times to the front desk to have our air conditioning fixed in our room. Most of the time they would not log our complaint which seems to be the proper procedure for them\u2026 9 out of 14 days without AC is pathetic. The rooms were comfortable and always clean. The bed is firm but that was a problem. The beach was incredible. It was rough a few days but most days you could use the catamarans safely. The pool was huge and fun but to have a lounge chairs is very difficult. We had to wake up at 5:30 am to get some of the best location around the pool. By 7 am, they were almost all gone. We felt a bit outraged but we had to play the game. The entertainment was fine but not exceptional. We went to very few shows after 2 or 3. We rather went at Playa del Carmen to walk, get food or stroll on 5th avenue. It is always fun to sit at a bar and listen to live music. The food at specialty restaurant was good. We went at the Steak House and Japanese restaurants twice and the Italian. All were good but nothing exceptional. The food at the buffet restaurants was fair to good. Breakfast was probably the one you had the most choice. We almost ate the same things at lunch (fries and chicken). Dinner was the worst. Wine at dinner was the worst I ever had we had to request the wine they serve at the bars to have something a lot better. This would have been the best vacation ever if the food would have been just a bit better. But we did not get sick but we also ate at PDC and did not get sick. I would recommend this resort to others. We may not go back because of the food but for the rest it is excellent.", "Date": "March 22, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "chester springs, pa", "Title": "\u201cGreat vacation - some tips\u201d", "Author": "vinc", "ReviewID": "UR3289159", "Content": "This is a great resort, 2nd time for us, and here are some tips on travel and the hotel: We went from Saturday to Saturday, March 12th to the 19th, 2005. If you can avoid it, DO NOT GO on a Saturday during Spring Break, it will take you 3 hours to clear immigration in Cancun at the airport - tremendous lines. If you have been in the army, you have done your \"hurry up and wait\". No lines on Monday. We left from Phila, the long lines start there about 1-1/2 hours before flight time, with only two agents at the check-in counter. If you live 35 miles from Phila. like we do, stay at the airport Marriot the night before the flight and you don't have to get up at 3 AM to avoid traffic jams for a 7:00 flight. Also the rooms and, believe it or not, the food was good. We booked at the Tucan side of the hotel where we had a great stay 6 months ago, but on arrival, they switched us to the Quetzal. After a 9-hour ordeal (the plane broke -bad starter) and 3 hours in Cancun, I was ready to go ballistic, but they showed us the Quetzal side, and the rooms are identical, the buffets are the same, the buffet restaurant decor is a bit different, so we said o.k. So don't believe it if someone says Quetzal is inferior like I read in a post here- you can also eat in any of the places on either side. Go with the flow. The buffet restaurant areas are really very, very good - different main dishes, Mexican dishes, great appetizers every night. Breakfasts are unbelievable. Lose 8 pounds before you go, and you'll come home even. They also have several theme restaurants on site which you reserve - best make your reservations after breakfast, they fill up. Tried the Mexican special restaurant - very good... The seafood one was not as good...did not try the Japanese (we're in Mexico, right?). This hotel has the BEST, most uncrowded beach. There must have been a big storm recently, because the beach areas of the hotels to the north are washed away and sandbagged to prevent further erosion, so the beach chairs are crammed together and in some cases there is no beach - just sand bags......A word on this beach, however - before breakfast, about 7:30 - 8:00, people start bringing their towels down and \"staking out a claim\" to chairs and thatched huts and returning later, so if you want a particular spot with some shade, you have to do it too. Bring SPF 30 - 45 sun tan lotion. With a breeze it doesn't feel hot, but look around and you will see people with wierd splochy violent red sunburn, cooked crispy. The beach bars seem to specialize in sweet, frozen, blender \"brain freeze\" drinks. If you like margaritas, order it with \"good tequila, not sweet, on the rocks, with a shot (or two) Cuervo on the side\" ( they're not very strong, and you can customize your own), give the bartender a tip, and he will remember how you like it for the rest of the trip. Also try the mojitas (crushed mint leaves, lime, sweet syrup, club soda) \"not sweet, extra rum\". If you have lunch at the beach restaurant, try to get there by 1:00 or not later than 1:30, and the special things they have that day (clams, mussels, whole shrimp, etc. will not be gone. There are snorkel tours taking 3 hours or so, and other things you can sign up for right at the beach, so you don't have to go on the all day tours by olympus, or the other fancy brochure lobby tour agencies if you don't want to shoot the whole day. The Quetzal and Tucan sides of the hotel flank a neat garden, kind of a manicured jungle with \"wild animals\" roaming about. Also in the middle is a \"theatre\", where there are shows nightly. These usually include something for kids ( a Simon-sez dancing routine), followed by a funky audience participation event with a Spanish language non-stop announcer leading a kind of adult musical chairs thing on stage, followed by music of some sort or other. This goes on till 10:30 or so, and if your room is nearby and faces the \"jungle\", you will hear the whumpa-whumpa music and the announcer, but it will eventually stop. One night they had a really good Mexican band. This brings me to another factor of spring break. There is a disco, which goes on till 3:00 AM - good planning put it away from most of the rooms. The kids all go there and start returning to their rooms from 1:30 to 3:30 AM, totally wasted, singing, yelling. They come into the common areas of the buildings, which with hard surfaces and marble floors make great echo chambers and brings out the Jim Morrisons and Dee Snyders in the crowd - you may have to poke your head out and let them know some poeple actually do sleep at night, and they generally will tone down. When we were here last Sept, this did not occur. If you bring any pills with a sugar coating, bring them in a tight container or tiny ants will get in and eat the coating in the course of one night. Go to the town of Playa del Carmen for dinner. It's a $5 taxi ride. Go to Fifth avenue, a pedestrian street - good restaurants, music everywhere, great drinks, fun place. The best area is from say, 6th street up to about 12th street, with the area around 8th and 5th avenue the best. Further north than about 10th it gets more expensive and not as good, below 6th or so, it gets honky tonk and not as good. The best silver we found was actually at the airport, on the way home, so you may not find any bargains in town. Also don't buy silver from the sketchy guys who sell it on the beach. The BEST restaurant is at 8th and 5th avenue, on 8th street (west of 5th), called YAXCHE. Authentic Mayan, great Mexican food don't miss it - they really do a good job. We (4 of us) had appetizers, 2 rounds of excellent drinks, Special Mayan and Mexican main courses, and the total was a bargain $75 USA. GO THERE, you won't be disappointed. In contrast, we ate at a place further up on the left two nights later, on a corner, up a curving flight of stairs with no railing (forget the name) which was positively lousy - somewhat overcooked dinner, one bottle of ok Mexican wine, $130 USA. Check and see if a service charge is added - sometimes you can't even read the check; I think its printed light on purpose. Also as you walk along, hombres will try to get you to eat at their restaurant \"segnor, good food, you no like, you no pay\" Has to be really great or colossally bad. Go to YAXCHE. Sorry if this post sounds like a food critic. Some final travel advice: Bring a bunch of $5 bills. In a country where you tip EVERYBODY for service it is essential. Also, when going to the airport for your return flight, your taxi or van will be met by porters who can help you with your bags. ABSOLUTELY have them help - give them your airline and flight, and the will navigate you through the lines which start who knows where and go to you can't see where - total confusion. We did and the guy zoomed us directly to the security bag searcher guard who zipped us through. I tipped them both. This is really a great hotel, and after exploring the beach further up, I wouldn't go anywhere else. Finally, staff is friendly and tries their best, everything is superbly maintained, 700 total rooms are in smaller buildings, extensively landscaped, so it doesn't seem \"big\", and the pool is clean, huge, free form, well landscaped, and really nice.

We wished we had booked a longer stay. We were in building 17 on the Tucan side. We enjoyed the location because it was close to the main buffets, lobby and stage. One evening it rained and it was good to be close to the main area. Pack an umbrella or two. It also gets dark early and a flashlight is also helpful. The food, service, friendliness and cleanliness was above average. We used only bottled water and also took a Pepto Bismal tablet before every meal (recommended by our Dr.). We did not get sick and ate everything (fresh fruit, ice cream, juices, etc.). The beds were hard, but comfortable. It did not interfere with a good nights sleep as others have indicated. The maid was great and we had no problems with the room. The rooms do not have clocks, so a lighted travel alarm is helpful. The walkway to the pools and beach is quite rough (cement and rock) and slippery when wet.. The jungle surroundings are beautiful and we enjoyed watching the wildlife along the path. We did not see a monkey, but talked to one couple who did. If you have feet problems (I have had ankle spurs) the walkways can be challenging. The pool area and beach have lots of shade huts and there are signs indicating topless bathing is not permitted. The beach area to the left of the resort and the hotels in that area do not have the same policy. We used the catamarans when the ocean was calm, but for the most part just enjoyed relaxing around the pool. The Starfriends organize lots of activities and they are fun to watch. We took a taxi to Playa Del Carman to shop and also walked to the shops in Playacar (very close to the hotel). Be careful regarding the audience participation during the evening shows. We saw one male fall off the stage during an audience participation game when he was blindfolded and asked to walk across the stage to his wife. The Starfriends are very nice and if you do not want to participate they do not pressure you. We saw them eating lunch with the guests and appreciated their positive attitude. We felt very bad for them during the accident on the stage and heard afterwards that they were very upset and sorry about the whole thing. A guest threw a glass at the MC after this happened which was very depressing to the rest of us in the audience. Since we stayed 7 nights we were entitled to 2 ala carte restaurants, but after putting our names on the waiting list we were able to eat in 4 of them. The steakhouse (on the beach) was our favorite, followed by the Japenese. We do not drink and this did not seem to be an issue with the staff. We have stayed at other all-inclusive resorts where the staff seemed offended if you refused their special drinks and alcohol. We booked through jmtravel and Apple, flew out of Detroit and had no problems. One surprise was that the hotel offered promotionals the last two nights we were there and tried to get us to spend the last two nights at their other properties. We didn't do it, but it was a nice offer. The service is exceptional. One night I had an infection and knew the cream that I needed. The receptionist translated it into Spanish, called the pharmacy in town and had it delivered in 20 minutes. It was also cheaper than in the states. I am also extremely allergic to MSG. I asked the hostess in the Japenese restaurant about this (because this is used in most Japenese and Chinese restaurants in the states). She translated it into Spanish, talked to the chef and assured me they did not use it. We took $150 dollars in ones and fives and tipped freely. It is appreciated, but not expected. We found the staff to be very gracious and kind. We saw one guest very upset in the main lobby, pushing his female companion and shouting at the receptionist (not in English) and eveyone was patient with him. I would higly recommend this resort to others.

They were fun and attentive and not at all pushy or intrusive. You can sleep by the pool all day or do aerobics, tennis, salsa lessons, paint pottery, get a massage, work out in the gym and of course drink! The food was good and plentiful. I would have liked a few different things at breakfast (like oatmeal), but the kids loved it. They especially liked the watermelon juice. I liked that I could make my own latte. We had suites in builing 10 and I would highly recommend that. We looked at the beach from our balcony and the pool was right outside out door. The jungle path is fun although we never did see the monkeys. We had a blast at the hibachi restaurant and we liked the steak restaurant very much (even the kids found something to eat) It was pure paradise for 4 very stressed out and overworked New York adults. The kids did some activities with the kidds club, but mostly they played int he pool. I loved water aerobics and we loved singing and dancing to the song \"Dalle Pa'lla\". The kids loved the kids show although after sunning and drinking all day the grown ups didn't make it through more than 2 or 3 of the regular shows. Besides we did have to get up early to get chairs by the pool. We got the same spot at the pool for all 7 days so it really isn't that bad. We were up early to play tennis any way. The Star Friends work really hard as do the wiaters, bartenders, housekeeping staff etc. We tipped everybody (most of the Americans did). They were appreciative but we would have had great service anyway because that is how the Iberostar operates.The Tucan has a very European feel which we loved and everyone was really nice.

Our global impression of the hotel was excellent! The room was very nice, big and comfortable. At reservation, we asked for a room with ocean view but we couldn't get one. However, we could get a room close to the beach. If you want a room with ocean view I would recommend to take a first floor in order to get some privacy... The beach was wonderful but unfortunately we could not enjoy it as much as we planned because of the weather... It rained a little bit every day and it was most of the time cloudy. Because of the weather, we decided to take the diving initiation in the pool. As we really enjoyed it, we did two dives on our last day and by chance the sun came back just when we entered the water. The water was really clear and you could see very far. We really enjoyed our dives, it was really a great experience! I recommend it! We were accompanied by the photographer of the hotel. She took pictures of us under the water and put all the pictures on a cd. The pictures are really great but the price was not so great!!! In general, the food was very good. We always arrived at the buffet rather late in order to have less people and get a nice table for two. We selected this hotel based on the very good reviews and we were not disappointed! The hotel is wonderful and the nature and animals everywhere! it's MAGIC! The only negative point for us was that we would have preferred a smaller hotel, more romantic. But as we really enjoy sport, we selected a bigger hotel with all kinds of sports. I would not say it is the perfect honeymoon resort... As we were really satisfied of the hotel, we just decided to go to Cuba in October 2005 at the Iberostar Tainos (Varadero) which has also great reviews!! The hotel is smaller and more romantic...

In summary we had an amazing time. Our boys were old enough to participate in the kids club so we were able to relax! Every morning we dropped them off at 10:30 for a few hours of crafts, swimming, walks, sand castles, ping-pong, etc. Meanwhile - back on the lounge chair we were left to stare at the ocean in peace! You are allowed to leave the kids till 4pm however we usually picked them up before or just after lunch so that we could spend the afternoon together. The kids club does show movies mid afternoon to allow the kids some down time. The Kids Club is clean, the staff (usually 2 girls) seemed fine and there was anywhere from 3 to 12 kids while we were there, the average age of 6 or 7. I really wanted to comment on this as I found a lot of the reviews had little info on the kids club. Other areas that young kids can enjoy is the pottery painting by the pool (starts at $20 USD), a short walk to Playacar (5 Minutes) to shop for the usual items one buys on holiday, kayaking in tandem kayaks (when the ocean is calm), walks through the hotel jungle looking for animals and of course swimming in the pool. The pool has an area that gradually slopes down, its great for beginner swimmers and there is also a wading pool and a small climbing structure for the kids. There was plenty of food options for all kinds of eaters and don't forget to have your afternoon ice cream cone at the beach bar. Our family stayed on the Quetzal side and found it more cozy and a bit quiter, would ask to be on this side again.

Our review is based on location, beauty, food, service, amenities and safety. The Staff are beyond friendly but not irritating. This resort receives an A+ for Service period! Quick, efficient, friendly and \"aim to please\" are what come to mind when I think of the service. The lobby, jungle on site, birds, waterfalls were a feast for any eye and were so lovely anywhere on the property. This place is cleaned 24/7 too. The color's are inviting, tropical and so relaxing. The pools were were clean, huge and really fantastic. Get there at 6 in the AM if you want to have a chair by the pool but guess what I did not come to Mexico to sit by a pool when I had a vast, warm white sand beach with aqua colored water in front of me. The beach was vast and really terrific. Loved the beach service for drinks too. The buffets included spiny lobster, sushi, smoked salmon, a bunch of local delights served with warm torillas. there was also a carving station, pasta station, veggie station, burger station (try the local food please becuase it was yummie), different starches, fruits, breads...just a world of different cusine. I usually am disappointed with buffets but I did not get sick of them. The breakfast buffet was outstanding because it caters to Europeans and Americans so you have so many things to choose. It was the best bacon we ever ate. There was Serrano Ham and waffles and salads too. The only thing I did not care for was the wines...but the tequila was ohh so good! The rooms were clean and inviting. The beds are firm but I prefer firm over soft..when I say firm I mean the firmest mattress ever..a bit too firm. Water comes out of shower really well (my personal beef with some hotels), plenty of towels and very very clean. Euopean like in that there is an open shower, bottled water and safe in every room and spotless tile floors. The jungle in the center..which you walk through to get to the beach and pool is really special. We are so pleased. What a great value. Leave your nasty disposition behind because you will not need it nor will anyone want to see it. After all your are in paradise here for sure. BTW, we are 40 without kids. We have a blast sking, water sports and are active but we enjoy R&R too. There is plenty to do for couples and family's. We saw people from early 20's to 80 here.

What a wonderful resort! I liked the cuban resort we were at last year, but this resort seemed to exceed my expectations. Food - This is the area that was really top notch. All the food was good, and plenty of it. Each buffet meal had plenty of variety. We went to two ala cartes. The steakhouse tenderloin was done to perfection. I would recommend it. Beach - We walked along the beach to the surrounding hotels, and I think the Iberostar was the nicest. You can only walk about half way to Playa del Carmen as the beach is impassable there. The Iberostar beach was wide and the sand is cool and terrific. The beach was kind of windy most of the days we were there, but that made the ocean fun to be in. We also went parasailing which was good, especially since they can take us both up at the same time. Location - Many of the resorts in the Mayan Riviera are off by themselves. The Iberostar was within 25 minutes walk of town along nice sidewalks and brick like roads. Taxis are readily available at $4 to $5 to Playa del Carman. I think the Iberostar location is great. Playa Del Carman - We spent a night pub hopping in Playa del Carman. There are plenty of people there and there seemed to be security everywhere. Our signature lady said it was very safe and I believe it. There were plenty of nice places to eat and drink in Playa del Carman. Take the time to see 5th avenue. Rooms - Very nice rooms with plenty of bottled water and cervesa in the room fridges. We had a king size bed, and there was a safe in the room if you wanted to store money or valuables. Each room had a deck and it was nice for us Canadians to sit out in the warmth. Ice - I wondered about drinking water and ice during our stay, but all the drinks had plenty of ice (try the miami vice drink) and our party of six had no problems. I think the water is not an issue at this resort. General - The resort is beautiful with marble everywhere and lots of birds. Some saw monkeys but I did not.

It is not the most luxurious hotel, so do not expect the Ritz, but what sets it apart is the quality of the service and the superb setting in the jungle grounds, with monkeys, iguanas, flamingos, peacocks, chickens, turkeys and those 'rat' things ! The rooms are nicely furnished with good power showers and quiet aircon. The bed was firm, but suited us both and there is a room safe included. From our balcony, we could regularly see monkeys and on one occasion, we had one come to visit for 10 minutes or so. We were inside, as they are wild animals. The pool is huge and if you are a swimmer, like me, you can swim uniterrupted for 50m or so. The pool area leads onto the beach, which is white sand and as good as you'll get anywhere in the Carribean. Cozumel is visible in the distance. My wife had 2 poolside massages,($70 each) and said they were the best she'd ever had - well worth the money. I dived with the on-site dive school, Dressel, and the staff there were a great bunch - Sandy and Cassie looked after me in the water admirably. There are some nice local reefs and if you are lucky like me, you'll see sharks. If you've never dived, try the complimentary pool dive, which might lget you hooked. Anyway, back to the hotel. The restaurants were all superb, with 5 bookable a la cartes to choose from. The buffet was so good, we actually cancelled a couple of a la cartes in the second week. There was only one downside, which was the odd American 'wooping and hollering' either by the pool or in the restaurants. I like Americans, I work with them, but why do they have to hold conversations in public places at a volume where everyone has to listen ? The wet bar was always full of loud drunk Americans, so we did not venture there in the whole two weeks ! Anyway, please check out my photos and I'll leave you with only one problem - booking up - this place books up weeks and weeks in advance.

We were in Room 2008, which is in the building closest to the beach. Our view was beautiful and of course our \"commute\" to the beach/pool area was too easy. We couldn't get over the amount of food offered, almost all day and night. One night we ate in the Mexican Ala Carte Restaurant (I had the shrimp which was excellent--it looked like their house special tacos were also good as they were cooked tableside). The other ala carte restaurant we ate in was the Japanese Restaurant--the wooden stools were a little uncomfortable; however, the atmosphere and food was fun, so in the long run, that really didn't matter. If you stay 5 nights or less you are guaranteed 2 ala carte restaurant meals. I must say, however, that the buffet dinners were great and on Thursdays (thanks to someone else's review on this website about the Iberostar) seafood is their special. I had so many lobster tails, they were so good, I was glad I wasn't at an ala carte restaurant. Another night at the buffet they had a Mariachi Band and a clown making balloon animals (although this would be considered a \"kids\" activity--I got a nice balloon flower--:). The drinks were good, not so strong but that is fine, especially when you are laying in the sun all day. At dinner the staff was more than happy to serve you red/white wine during your meal. The kids had a lot to do as there are scheduled activities throughout the day. I was certainly comfortable with them going off on their own to explore. The staff could not have been more professional yet super, super relaxed and friendly. They were the nicest staff I have come across at a resort in a long time. A few general tips regarding Playa del Carmen and the Iberostar: 1. The silver sold on the beach may be plated and not really silver so be careful---bargain well and check what you are buying. We did buy two bracelets knowing they were not real but they were so pretty we really didn't care. 2. The walk from the beach to the lobby(which is beautiful) is on a path through a jungle-ish atmosphere. It is really neat as you are walking with all sorts of wildlife (the sounds are also awesome)--be sure to bring comfortable shoes for walking--some of my heels were a little tough on the feet. 3. The ocean can be a little rough so use caution when swimming (they do have flags up to indicate the surf level). If you are not a very experienced swimmer, you may want to consider swimming in their large, beautiful pool if the surf is up. 4. The pool area will fill up quicker than the beach area regarding lounge chairs; however, we always seemed to find chairs although we may have had to really search for some. 5. Play del Carmen is a real tourist town but fun for a 1/2 of day. You may want to consider a trip to Cozumel (you can use the Iberostar facilities at Cozumel). The ferry takes you right from Playa Del Carmen (a $4.00 cab ride for 4 from the Iberostar to Playa del Carmen).---Just check to see when the cruise ships pull in and avoid visiting on those days to lessen the crowds. --We had a fun lunch at Senor Frogs. 6. We went horsebackriding at a ranch near Cancun (Loma something I believe). I am a very experienced rider so I opted to gallup on the beach. My horse was extremely hard-mouthed and although I was able to stop him, it took quite a lot of 2-armed muscle and boy, we really galluped. Riding bareback into the ocean was also a great, one of a kind experience--we got some great pictures and although the food (lunch) they offered was not great, it was fun. I am glad we did it---the kids loved it and again, we met a lot of great people. 7. The sun is hot, even though there may be overcast, use sunscreen--even on your feet! Although my husband thought the Iberostar might have been a tad too large (there are actually two hotels the Tucan and Quetzel), you still got personalized attention and are amongst a great group of people--both staff and fellow tourists from all over the US and world. We would not hesitate to return to the Iberostar. It was a great family vacation, fun place to go. We would recommend it!

Our Mid-Feb week at the Iberostar was wonderful! I WOULD definitely return. Not that everything was absolutely perfect but it certainly exceeded my expectations. The service is excellent and very friendly. We did tip but towards the end so the tipping did not influence our service. The resort is beautiful and well kept. All the facilities were kept clean and well serviced. It took a little bit of adjustment getting used to seeing a male in the woman's washroom cleaning but they were quick, efficient and discrete. It didn't bother me since the common washrooms were always kept up. I thought the rooms were really nice - marble and terra-cota tile. Our fridge was well stocked, beds and \"towel\" animals nicely made up. We did tip everyday. Remember to bring hair conditioner with you since that is one thing they did not supply. The bed was really hard but that is common with all hotels in Mexico. Sleeping was fine even though I am not usually comfortable on a hard bed. The room had lots of bottled water and we did use this to brush our teeth-just in case. But we drank lots of drinks with ice and also had all the water in the restaurants, dispenser in the pool hut etc and noone had any stomach problems (other than from the tequila). The weather was beautiful the entire week and therefore we spent most of our hotel time at the beach. We had no problem finding any chairs at the beach for >5 people. It was crowded in the middle but I found this refreshing since everyone tended to talk to each other more. The pool was really nice but they did not have enough chairs. Especially if you wanted to move from the beach to the pool later in the afternoon. Some of the pool perimeters have shrubs for a decorative effect but I think they need to open that up to have more chairs. The pool area also had a few palapas which was little beach hut with chair pads etc. They looked enticing for a nice cool afternoon nap but unfortunately, they were always taken with a bunch of kids stuff and all afternoon you NEVER saw anyone in them! It would be nicer if people were more considerate and only used facilities for what they are for - not just to dump their stuff. So I guess overall, I would say the pool area was somewhat tricky but we ended up parking at the beach and if we really wanted to, took a dip in the pool. But we are beach people anyway. The beach was not super wide (again I assume due to previous hurricanes) but there was a good stretch to walk around and no rocks/coral etc to walk into the water. We went to the swim up bar once and had fun but it was cooler since it is a bit shady. And all the people there did seem to leave and come back so I am assuming they did use the proper facilities for the washroom. The water was really clean too. They did close it one day since apparently a drunken \"Brit\" jumped off the water fall! However my experience of this was limited. I would be more cautious about all the kids relieving themselves in the pool rather than these adults. We really like the food and being a group, found the buffets useful since everyone could find SOMETHING they liked to eat. We went to the Mexican and Steak restaurants and really enjoyed those. Always ate lunch under the palapa by the beach. Great natcho chips, salsa and guatamole! The only thing I can compare to in that area is a few years ago, my husband and I went to the Barcelo Maya and I would definitely NOT return there. They did have a beautiful beach and pool area (I do think it was better situated than the Iberostar) BUT we got a lousy room (the patio door wouldn't lock and they made a few false attempts to fix it), the service was terrible (they were slow, didn't care and were actually rude!), the food was so-so to bad (I got sick that time from what I believe was a bad batch of salmon at dinner one night) and the pool area facilities (food, washrooms) were not well kept. The toilets by the pool (which was supposed to service hundreds of people) were always dirty and the toilets plugged! So you can probably see why I was pleasantly surprised by the Iberostar. They had lots of activities if you wanted and the young \"social coordinators\" working there are fantastic. If you are expecting a north american crowd - be forwarned that the ambience is very international- which I found really great (although it was harder to converse). Re: comments about loud Americans-We met lots of wonderful Americans who we loved. But I have to admit that at the show time, there was a group who in their drunken state, insistied on going up on the stage throughout all parts of the show (regardless of whether it was audience participation or not). They thought they were really funny but noone else did (especially with an international audience). It was actually tiresome to have them once again, interupt. And they would grab the microphone etc. I thought the Iberostar people handled them really well. After a couple of nights, I did not bother going to the show (or until later). Later in the week, there was another large group who insisted on having a loud conversation in the lounge while the show is going on! My comment to everyone is - YOU may be on vacation and want to cut loose BUT so is everyone else! Maybe the other 690 people at the resort don't feel like being trapped by your desire to get some attention. Lastly, I only went to the disco once (a night out in Playa del Carmen was fun) but I do see what the other comments are regarding kids. There are times that adults need a break even though the kids at the resort seemed all well behaved. I think there needs to be some areas that are off limits.

(2/12-2/19). WOW. What a great time I had there. The staff was great as everyone previously posted on this website. They were beyond great. I spent lot's of fun moments in the lobby bar and met great friends. The bartenders are wonderful. Say hi to Jeremiahs..and tip them well, because they work hard for you. After reading former reviews I was nervous about the beds and the food with getting sick. The beds were semi hard, but nothing terrible and I am a picky sleeper when it comes to comfort. The food was awesome. The buffet got a little boring, but it was still wonderful food. I stayed away from the lettuce and fruits as was suggested and used the bottle water often with brushing my teeth etc and had no problems. I had plenty of drinks with ice, so there are no worries there. Just use your head and be cautious and you should be fine. The only bad thing I could come up with was maybe the maid service. It didn't seem she changed the sheets and other stuff in the room on a daily basis. We actually had to strip the bed so she got the hint to change them. She didn't replenish the shampoo or...even sometimes the water...so we did have to call the desk on that one. It was not due to her not being happy, because we left her a three dollar tip every day until the one day that we noticed she didn't do anything it seemed, but make the bed. Never replaced glasses used etc. The staff was awesome. Every question and request was fulfilled. The beach was wondeful. We would walk to the right of the resort and have peace and space as every one crowds to the middle of the beach. We were on the line of the next resort near the jet ski rentals. It was worth the extra two minute walk if that. Yes, people do get up at the crack of dawn and put towels..which is ridiculous. We had no problem with chairs where we stayed. We also brought an insulated mug from all you suggesters and yes it was a PLUS to have on the beach. We went into play del carmen probably three or four times. What a great place. If you can deal with the harrassers from the shops you will be fine. There are so many cool bars and restaurants. We ate at the Glass Bar/restaurant for Valentine's day and it was wonderful. We loved the Bourbon St bar too, that was a cool bar to hang out at. We went there a lot, because the entertainment at Iberostar is boring to be blunt. We are both 35 and not dead yet to say the least. We love to meet people have some drinks and laugh a bit. We always hung out at the lobby bar. The people that sit at the bar were festive (us too) and the one's who sat down in the tables were a little stiff or let's say reserved, which is fine for them if that's how they are. I think iberostar needs to have a couple of bars for people who want to sit at tables and drink their champagne and be quiet and content and then have another bar for people who want to talk and laugh. I felt like some times I was annoying the people sitting down. They were mostly from Europe and I am not sure if this is how they \"hang\", but I sometimes felt like they would look at us like we were obnoxious etc...After reading these reviews I told myself I would not fall under the headline \"obnoxious American\" , so I was very conscious of that fact, and I can say that I tried to be friendly by saying hello and smiling. Nine out of ten times I was greeted with a look of don't talk to me from certain foreigners. There is no reason they cannot understand the national hello of a smile and nod...I met people from England and Canada who were great. Any time I would say hello and got an answer back it was mostly from Americans..I guess we get a bad rap for being friendly, which comes across as being obnoxious...who knows and who cares...I felt every time I would laugh and look around, someone would be staring at me like I had two heads..that bothered me a bit. We sat across from a couple from France in the Japanese Restaurant and I smiled and said hello. She just looked at me with a frown, so I was all set with being friendly with her the rest of the evening. I ended up befriending a couple who were both in their seventies and had more spunk than that woman could dream of. Some people need to loosen up a bit. I mean is it so hard to smile? Do they hate me that much for being an American? I was proud to hear on many occasions that the workers there love the Americans because they are the only one's who tipped, so I guess we can't be too bad. Ok, so that was my rant about that subject, because it bothered me from previous posters who complained about obnoxious Americans and I wanted to see for myself if it was that bad. As far as the restaurants go..the Japanese was great and it was my first experience. My only suggestion for you before eating there is have a very very empty stomach, because by the time you leave there you will be stuffed. The italian restaurant and steak house were great too, but the Japanese blew them away. I never went in the pools, because they were always crowded. The pool bar was a dissapointment. Very small and stuck in the middle of the jungle with hardly any sun and YES a poster was correct about the fact that the people \"never\" left to relieve themselves, which is digusting. To add to the bar area, the disco...ugh. Ok am I the only one who feels that parents should not have their seven year old hanging in a smokey bar..with adults past midnight? It's true. Kids hanging in the bar..not just one night..but all three times I was there. Most of the clientele were teenagers getting hammered because the drinking age was 18 with very few adults. I was so bummed that this is how it was at the resort. I don't mind kids, but the iberostar should leave some places for just adults..They would let there kids run up the bar and grab cut fruit from from the trays and slob all over the other fruit next to it. Have some class, geez. Not only did kids do that but so didn't adults. They would pick up a lime..and the put it back..i was appalled at that. Like I said before, they need more places for adults only. It seems more geared towards kids, which is fine if that is what you want. We stayed in buidling 17, which was near the lobby and restaurants. I thought it was great. A little walk to the beach but not bad. The bathroom and shower were spacious, but very little space to put your shampoo etc in the shower..if none at all. Bring an alarm clock as the electricity goes off when you leave the room. Make sure you check to see if the fridge is cold and working as ours was on low. I think that the fridge shuts off too when you leave. We were on the third floor, which was great, because you had no one above you. The morning is tough as you can hear the maids move every piece of furniture in every room of the building..that was annoying. We did not hear any roosters as they were mostly found near buildings 15 and 14 I think. The jungle was cool and the monkeys made a visit to our roof one morning, which was awesome to see them. The place is very very clean. So I guess I had more complaints about the people who visited than the Iberostar itself. Like I said, more bars or hang outs would be a plus, so you can enjoy yourself the way you want too..whether it be a quiet night with a drink or a good time with meeting friends and laughing. Well, I guess I had more to say than I thought. I would consider going back for the it being the Iberostar and a class act.

There are two parts to this resort, with two separate lobbies. We stayed in the Iberostar Quetzel side. Both sides have equal access to all amenities. To say it was wonderful does not do it justice. I traveled with my husband and two other couples, all dear friends. Apart from the grounds, which are stunning, the most pleasant aspect of the resort is its service. Nearly without fail, the staff does everything possible to ensure the guest's comfort and pleasure. Every staff member at every level greets each guest with a friendly smile and warm \"hola\". Entertainment staff provide continual opportunities for activities. For the guest who wants action, there are, among other things, free scuba lessons, Salsa lessons and water aerobics. For a reasonable extra fee, daily excursions are available for snorkeling and scuba. These leave directly from the resort's beach. Other water activities, such as kayaking, parasailing, windsurfing and catamarans are also available, some with fees and some without. Better yet, if all you want to do is lay in the sun (or shade) and read, the staff leaves you alone! (With the acceptable exception that wait staff will come to your lounge chair from time to time to take drink orders) If this is not paradise, what is? Evening activities include a disco, with dancing beginning at about 11 PM. If you are older than 30, it is probably not your style. The music is very fast and hard to dance to. Earlier in the evening the entertainment staff provides skits, audience participation events and miscellaneous shows. This was not my favorite activity, but many people seemed to enjoy it. I preferred sitting in the lobby lounge with my friends talking and playing games. The rooms are set up in two story pods, which span two sides of the central jungle-like grounds from the lobbies to the beach. The grounds have lovely walkways through areas with native trees and many animals, some in their own enclosures. Some of the animals I saw include monkeys, peacocks, swans, a tortoise, spoonbills, flamingoes and, of course, quetzels and tucans. These animals are well taken care of and seem undisturbed by the guests. If you are not an early riser and your room faces on the jungle side, the morning bird calls may be a bit much. I was not on that side, so I don't know if this is hard to adjust to. I stayed in an average, two queen bed room. It was sufficiently spacious, very clean and comfortable. Since this is not a new resort, some mechanical issues arose: two during our 7 night stay. Both were resolved quickly and satisfactorily. Every room appears to have a balcony as well as the usual hotel amenities. My room did not have an alarm clock or radio, but did have a tv and phone. Wake up calls are available. As this is an all inclusive resort, room service is free. I did not use it. The food was plentiful (an understatement) perpetual and good. Separate restaurants are availble by reservation, but the buffet-style, central dining rooms offered everything I ever needed. I tried two of the five reservation-only restaurants. Of these two, the seafood and the mexican, the mexican dominated. The wait staff everywhere were friendly, attentive and fast. I don't know how strong the alcohol in the drinks was, but I had many and I never felt intoxicated. I have yet to decide if this was a good or bad thing. The price for all this, with airfare, was in the neighborhood of $1600/person, through a travel agent. My only regret was that I could not make the hours pass slowly enough!", "Date": "February 18, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Macungie,PA", "Title": "\u201cReally great Hotel - Iberostar Tucan\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3195227", "Content": "Got back from this resort Saturday. I took my 14 and 16 year old kids. When we pulled up to the resort, I thought at a quick glance that the open entrance floor was wet from a storm. As we stepped out, it was a huge beautiful shiny marble entrance. The lobby blew me away. It just gave you that \"Wow\" feeling walking into paridise. It is all open with beautiful flowers, plants, Tucan Birds, wonderful warm colors. A waitress greeted us as we checked in with \"Welcome\" drinks. Staff is very friendly. I love the Mexican people,they are so polite and friendly. The room was very cheery and clean. Loved the stocked mini bar,even had my seltzer water!! The maids did cute things with the rooms and leaving a tip daily is a nice idea. We had a first floor with a cute balcony. We were actually put on the Quaetzel side, whick doesn't really matter. We were close to the pool and beach, which is nice (2200 building). I would hate to have had to walk from the rooms near the lobby to the beach all day. I thought the beds were fine, firm, but we were so tired, it didn't matter, I slept great. We did blow a fuse with a hair dryer and curling iron on together,so don't overload. The beach is so soft and clean near the hotel. I was surprised up the beach near the jungle that there was so much plastic waste that landed on the beach. It was sad to see, makes me worry about all those sea creatures. Never saw so much stuff washed up. This is not near Tucan. They do a great job every day cleaning the beach and arranging the chairs. I loved a spot between the pool and the beach under a thatched hut. Doesn't get any better than that. The waitresses get you drinks on the beach, or it's just as easy to get your own there are so many bars near the pool. The swim up bar was fun, met some nice folks from Minnesota and Canada. I am not a big drinker, but drank alot here. The drinks are not strong unless you ask. They are very friendly and work hard, so I recommencd to tip them. They have pool games which we didn't do. They have aerobics, but I would LOVE to have seen more variety and manybe had some yoga or meditation on the beach in the early morning.(I don't do this at home, but on vacation, it would have been nice to have time to do it). I would recommend to Tucan that they have more \"Island like\" music at the pool/beach. There was very little music. I would have loved a Calypso band doing some Raggae one day. The hot tub is not hot, luke warm at best. The pool is beautiful. They have these cabana type things you can lay on. They have massages near the pool. I'm sorry I didn't get one. 1/2 hour I think was $32.00. Hey your worth it. We kayaked, used catamarans, the water is clear and so blue. Only one day was it a little rough. My daughter and I tried parasailing. I was a little nervous, but it was not scary at all. BIG problem I never expected was, I got really nauseated up there. I could not believe it. Yes, I barfed mid-air. So I recommend dramamine for anyone who is worried. Thing is, I never get sick. I have no idea why it happened except that the water was very choppy.This time of year the mornings and evenings were cool. Need a jacket or sweatshirt. NOTE: They have no washer or dryers, ATM machines at the hotel. Get your cell set up ahead of time to make calls out of country . It is a MAJOR pain to use phones in Mexico - expensive!! Food was good, not quite American like we're used to. I would recommend they improve on the coffee. It was terrible. I like Starbucks. They have no cream here. I missed my good AM cup of JOE. Excursion to COBA with Gonzo(our guide) was great. Bumpy roads, but we ate with Mayan people(theyare great), did the zip line, climbed the ruins and repelled into a Cenote(cavern with clear water). Ended with free tequilla shots at a road side stop. It was so much fun. Do it. Swan with dolphins - it was ok, did a lagoon, would recommend the ocean ones. I loved Iberostar, would definately go back. My teens like it, not that much set up for teens, but they like the beach and water sports. The jungle is so cool. Love the monkeys, and iguanas and birds. The \"Holler monkey's\"- do holler at times, it scared the heck out of me one time at 0600 going for my coffee. Just wasn't ready for that wake up call. They don't come near people. The marble walkways with water and fountains are so beautiful. Amazing.

I was concerned before arriving as to how handicapped accessible the resort would be as I have a difficult time walking and would be bringing my trusty scooter as my method of getting from point A to B. I am happy to report that this resort is completely wheelchair accessible! Although a little bumpy, I was thrilled to find I could even enjoy the jungle paths!! The gradual, slope into the pool with a hand rail allowed me to get wet and the fine sand on the beach made it possible for my tootsies to feel the ocean waves. We loved the location of the Iberostar Tucan as it is not far from a shopping area which is easy to get to even in a scooter. I could go on and on as to how great the Tucan is for anyone who has trouble getting around. One more awsome discovery was my scooter (with a little adjusting), would fit in the back of a hutchback cab or a van which meant I could visit the Tulum ruins, Playa de Carmen, and more.

We went as a group of 8 adults (great company folks!! Thanks to you for making it greater!!)) to celebrate a silver wedding anniversary and we where just overwhelmed to the point that we will be booking again next year!!... I read the reviews prior to going, so thanks to all who wrote them as the hints and tips where extremely helpful, here are a few more to add. There is no need to take towels (think of the excess baggage!) as they are supplied for the pool/beach, there are towels in the room and these being a little bigger would have helped, take a few wire coat hangers as there aren\u2019t enough supplied to house the \u201cmust have\u201d holiday wear! An absolute must is snorkel gear, expensive to buy at the hotel and difficult to find good inexpensive ones in Playa car.

We are both in our early 50's and found plenty of things to do and throughly enjoyed ourselves. The weather was a little cool,which I understand is unusual for this time of year, but since we are from Wisconsin it was fine with us. The temperatures were in the upper 70's and 80's. The evenings were a little cooler and I would suggest you pack a light jacket or sweater. Although they suggest you dress for dinner..long pants for men and \"dress casual\" for women, we saw many people wearing shorts. I don't recommend this but no-one was turned away from the buffet restaurants regardless of their dress. Everyone dressed a little nicer in the gourmet restaurants and it added to the the ambience. The food was consistantly good and we never were unable to find something that appealed to us at the buffets. The menus at the gourmet restaurants are limited but offer two or more choices at the very least. The staff was excellent and always helpful. As far as tipping was concerned, we tipped $1 to the servers and bartenders and the service was always super! We noticed that many people never tipped and it is not required but we knew that their salaries are ridiculously low by our standards and we certainly felt tips were justified. We gave the room maid $5 a day and we found the mini bar to be well stocked with soft drinks, water and beer. We also received little extras. Any requests we had were taken care of promptly. Watch out for the \"shooters\" at the lobby bars...they are very pretty to look at and taste great but they are potent...I can attest to that. Try a Miami Vice...(half strawberry margarita and half pina colada) They are great...Coco Locos on the beach are also pretty good!! We were advised that the jewelry sold on the beach was not real silver...possibly a silver finish over stainless steel..pretty and not terribly expensive. They make a nice souveneer but do not look at them as an investment in fine jewelry and certainly do not pay the asking price...The vendor will take at least half the price. Our room was very clean and we had no problem with the temperature. The beds are a little \"firm\" but we slept well. I e-mailed the hotel about 2 weeks before hand and requested a first floor room that was centrally located and we took a copy of their reply with us. We were given a great room on the first floor in the middle of the resort..Perfect! There were not too many children there when we were there and I have to say for the most part they were always well behaved. I know that some of the Europeans complained about loud Americans and unfortunately there were a few. Mostly the wedding parties who were there with groups of friends and relatives but they only seemed to get loud after they had a few cocktails under their belts. Some of the \"Euros\" were not exactly friendly either..they don't seem to get the idea of moving over for people to pass on the walkways. We did meet many nice people from other countries so I don't feel it is fair to catagorize people by the country they hale from. The beach is fantastic...The water that beautiful blue you see in the ads. There were always plenty of chairs and if you don't want to be in the sun you can always get and unbrella at the towel hut if you can't find a shady spot. We actuallly preferred to do that because you can sit closer to the ocean. I hope this has been helpful and if you have any questions, feel free to e-mail me.

This was our secondvisit in 2 years. After our 1st stay we were so impressed by Iberostar that we have only been to their hotels since. The Dominicana (Dominican Republic) is another favourite - went there last MAy and going back again this year. The standards of the hotels are all comparable but the DR is a bit cheaper than Mexico.Staff really friendly and helpful - we got fruit and champers in our room for my birthday and hotel t-shirts for visiting again. Had real fun watching the monkeys. Only 1 gripe - 1st time we went to Tucan all the entertainment was to pre-recorded music/singing. At the Dominicana all the evening shows were performed by live proffessional musicians - even had a live band - the quiality was excellent. This year the Tucan seem to be trying the same concept-and good luck to them but the lead singer was not quite up to the same standards Have to say as soon as she appearred on stage we left for the lobby bar - a real let down for the rest of the team -musicians dancers etc who all put in a great deal of effort. The up-side - this encouraged us to get out of the hotel a bit more and make the most of the great bars in town. The only trip we did this time was the FAT CAT catamaran trip - sold at the welcome meeting as visiting lovely beaches etc - this was actually a booze cruise - as much and as fast as you can drink - we had a very short stay at one beach for snorkelling but the sea was so rough it was really difficult to get in and out. The sea had washed up loads of rocks which you couldn't see because it was so murky. The shatterred coral bits being washed in the waves was so sharp it made loads of holes in my swimsuit. To be honest I thought that it was quite dangerous and although the crew were really good they ought to have warned us about the rocks. The hermits island built from cola bottles was a real disappointment. Wouldn't recommend this trip unless you have a good appetite for beer and good sea legs.

The only down side of the Tucan is that after 2 weeks of the same Mexican music at breakfast, lunch and dinner is nice to eat in the quiet!!(think they only have one CD!!) If you want to eat alone make sure you have a table just for 2 or 4 depending on how many there are in your party or you will have a Star entertainer sitting with you for breakfast, this is nice for some people but others do like to eat alone.

We have never stayed at the Tucan before but all of us have been to Mexico many times. We were all so happy with this resort and would go back in a heartbeat! The rooms are okay. Yes, the beds are hard but my husband and I had no problem sleeping every night. The mini bar is filled with bottled water, soda and beer, all included of course, and the maid fills it up every day. There is room service until 11:00 p.m. which is a limited menu but is great to have if you don't want to leave your room. The breakfast buffet offers a wonderful selection of breakfast items or if you just want coffee and a muffin, there is a small restuarant down by the pool area. For dinner you have your choice of five restaurants (which you need reservations for) or the buffet which you don't need reservations for and is open until 10:00 p.m. Because we were only there for five days, we were only entitled to one guaranteed dinner reservation. We e-mailed the hotel a few days before and requested two dinner reservations, one at the new Japanese restaurant and one at the Italian restaurant. The hotel gave us both reservations with no problem and both restaurants were very good! When we got there we put our names on a waiting list for the Steakhouse restaurant and were able to get that reservation as well. Unfortunately, none of us made it to the steakhouse that night (too many hours at the pool bar!) We found out that the good alcohol is hidden either under the bar or in the back. Just give the bartenders a few bucks and they are happy to get it for you! The beach is truly amazing! If you don't get out there early enough to get beach chairs under a palapa, you can get a nice big beach umbrella where you get your beach towels everyday. We never had a problem finding chairs by the beach or pool. There were so many acitivities during the day it is impossible to be bored here. Take advantage of the non-motorized water sports it is included and worth it! Bring water rafts for the pool. Everyone was using them and the staff by the scuba center is happy to blow them up for you. The only negative thing I have to say is that the pool area is very, very slippery when wet! I fell once really bad and my husband slipped several times (we were sober). Make sure you bring water shoes with a good rubber sole. They were the only things that saved us from really hurting ourselves. The other thing I must add about people getting sick down here is, \"Watch What You Eat\"! The hotel told us that their water was purified so we used ice in our drinks and never had a problem and we drank a lot!!! What you must stay away from is, fresh fruits and vegetables and green salads! I know it is tempting when you see all this wonderful fresh fruit at breakfast and they are making these wonderful fruit smoothies, but don't do it!

The hotel shares its grounds with a sister hotel called the Quetzal. You can freely use there facilities as much as your own, however they are generally a mirror image of your hotel. The two hotels are situated parrellel to each other with the pool close to the beach in between. Both hotels are surrounded by lush jungle landscaped gardens with many statues. Walking around these gardens is like walking around a zoo. They have monkeys, parrots, tucans, lizards... even a giant tortoise, not to mention pelicans and many others. I even had the unfortunate experience of meeting a giant spider on the path from the pool, however I had drank quite abit of mexican beer at this time so I'm not sure if it was real or not! The pool is lovely. No diving is allowed because at its deepest point it is only around 1.6m. The pool bar is a must. It is abit cold as fresh water is continuously pumped in from a waterfall with its source from an underground lake, however after a few drinks you become immune to it. By the end of the holiday we called the pool bar 'the devils grotto' because of the way you feel after a drinking session in there! Make sure you say hi to Letitia and Raphael in the pool bar, they will make you very welcome. As you can see I like my drink so other places to drink are the lobby bars in both hotels. I tended to drink in the tucan lobby bar as this was only a short crawl from my room. Say to Alberto behind the bar that James Bond says hi and he will be back in 2006. Food is excellent here. Lots of choice. The buffet restaurants are designed around big ponds with huge fish and even turtles swimming in them. All the a la carte restaurants are great. It says two visits per week in the brochure but you could eat in one every night if you wanted. All you need to do is put your name down on the cancellation list in the lobby area. Water sports are very good on the beach. You can get jetskis and go paragliding if you want, but I was happy with the hours sailing on the catermerans which were free with the hotel. Excursions are plentiful. Chitchen Itza was good to see but was a very long day. Make sure you go to Xel Ha. Anyway as far as I'm concerned you can't go far wrong booking an Iberostar hotel.

We arrived very late on Sunday evening (@10:30pm) (Our transfer took over 2 hours from the airport . . . uggh). We were greeted by a warm staff and had no wait to get into our room in Building 17 (near lobby bar and main dining restaurant). Luckily, they have a late night buffet from 11pm to 3am. Our room was nice . . . nothing special. 4**** at best. However, we did enjoy the large double shower. Heeding the warning from other reviewers, we brought a mattress pad for the bed. We needed it. The beds are rock hard! Even still, by the 5th day we were sore. Room service was a surprise amenity. However, it ends at 11pm. We rarely used the mini bar. Tipped $3 and received towel art and extra water. The food is surprisingly good. Like any buffet experience, we were pretty tired of it by the 5th day. Tried three specialty restaurants, Steakhouse, Mexican, and Caribbean. We were really not impressed by any of them (except the Tres Leches cake in the Mexican restaurant). Tried to get on the waitlist for Bonsai (Japanese) to no avail. Pool and beach are both nice. Yes, people really do save chairs from the crack of dawn. This is really annoying because they only occupy the chairs for 2-3 hours a day. The hotel should really do something about this. Also, the jacuzzi in the center of the pool is just a cold water jet pool. The only warm jacuzzi is in the spa. The adult pool bar is seperate and shaded so it always looked really cold. If you do not like children, this is not the place for you. We don't have any kids, but we don't mind them . . . usually. We did here. They were all over the place. What's worse is that they were rude and unattended most of the time. Parents seem to let them loose in the most unsafe places, the pool, the beach, and best of all, the buffet restaurant where they poke their hands (and feet) into everything. Next time we go, we will stay at a Couples-Only resort for this reason alone. Last, I will say that this is the hardest working staff I have ever seen.

The jungle grounds are amazing, the staff so welcoming, polite and genuinely friendly and the food is overwhelming and vast - offering a great variety and always creatively presented alongside carved watermelons (true works of art), ice sculptures on gala night (sunday) and fresh fruit and flower displays, also check out the speciality resaturants within the hotel and plan your reservations so they do not coincide with special evenings in the buffet restaurants (lobster night, gala night) - the work and effort that is put into everything by the staff on a daliy basis is unbelievable - this also goes for the room -maids who gave us chocolates and a different towel animal every night, and even \"curtain art\"!! on our last night. The entertainment team otherwise known as the Star Friends have boundless energy and enthusiasm and after seeing them dance around in some crazy costume in last night's show - you can't believe that they are the same people who are bouncing around in the pool the next morning doing water aerobics while you're making your way to the beach to chill out - the Star Friends I salute you!! However do not be put off by the all-inclusive tag which gives so many resorts a stereotypical reputation - here you really can do as much as you like or as little as you want - the kayaks, jetskis, parasailing, snorkelling, bike rides and tennis are all on offer and whether you want to take part in \"Mr. Banana Beach 2005\" or not - the choice is yours!! Personally, I preferred to stand on the sideline and gaze in disbelief as I watched a 60 year old speedo-clad holiday maker shake his stuff like Beyonce in his hope of winning the title...If you don't want to see this - then just stay on your sunbed or take a walk down the beach towards the right - it is deserted down there... Take a cab from the hotel to 5th ave ($4) - and here's a tip - walk down the centre of the street between the many silver and souvenir shops - one sway to the left or to the right and you will be encouraged endlessly into that shop which so happens to be nearest to you! The shop owners are not pushy but just encouraging in gaining your interest which is understandable as it is their livelihood - although never pay the full amount which is offered as you will be ripped off! Also recommended is a trip across to Cozumel from the ferry port on 5th ave and head to Carlos n' Charlies if you are in a party mood of course - no quiet and dignified lunch to be had here - instead yards of Margaharita and doing the conga around the tables - you cannot miss this place - you will hear the whistles on your approach! It was in Cozumel that we also visited the Chankanaab Park where my sister got to swim with the dolphins - a great memorable experience and many photo opportunities! Also congratulations to the couple who got engaged that same day where the dolphin presented the ring! Well it would be easy for me to continue saying how great the place is, but I would be more than happy to answer any personal questions should you want to find out more - there is so much that appeals here, we are returning next year for two weeks as one week just flew by - in the meantime I look forward to hearing from you - enjoy your stay!

Also you must pay the doctor in cash, you cannot charge it to the room, and it cost $200 including medicine. And though I felt better in a day or two you cannot go out in the sun on Cipro (2-3 days). A day later the air conditioning broke down to numerous buildings on the Tucan side including ours for 3 days (I think a rare and unfortunate occurance). The management was very helpful and nice about it, finally moving us to a junior suite our last night and giving us complimentary messages due to my being sick on top of everything else. They did claim that nobody else in the entire hotel was sick but me (taking no responsibility) and that the safety percautions they take are extraordinary, which I believe, because the hotel is obviously very well run. They do have the best beach in Playa Car (we walked the beach, lots of erosion from Royal Hideaway on north), my teenage son loved the pool and met other teenagers.

The weather was perfect the entire time (Nov. 26 - Dec. 10). The beach was wonderful...the ocean warm, enough waves to have fun, we loved the people selling silver and jewelry and we LOVED sitting on the beach with unlimited drinks. (not that we're a bunch of drinkers, either...but hey, it was a vacation!) I would recommend taking boogie boards with you to really enjoy the waves...they're MUCH cheaper in Canada than at the resort, and you could probably trade them for some great jewelry if you didn't want to bring them back! I don't really understand the complaints about the beds. Firm, but not \"hard\". If I had a complaint, and believe me I had to think hard to come up with one, it would be that the room didn't cool off enough at night for my personal taste. I emphasize this is a personal preference, because I was the only one in our group who found it too warm. Possibly because it was our first time in Mexico, possibly because my husband speaks a little spanish, and undoubtedly because of the great people we travelled with, we all tried to get to know our waiters, waitresses, cab drivers, etc., by name, and made sure to introduce ourselves as well. We loved the Mexican people. Great sense of humour, they provide service unlike any we've seen elsewhere, and what's truly amazing considering the numbers of people they have to deal with, they remember your name if you're friendly, they chat with you (quite hilarious at times the ways we will attempt to communicate...its almost like charades, and we would all be delighted when we were successful). Cab rides were always interesting, informative and fun this way. So...the rooms were great, the beach was amazing, we didn't use the pool much but enjoyed it when we did. The water was refreshing, but far from cold. Barely cool, I'd say. The beach has tons of chairs, yet never seemed crowded and there was certainly no difficulty finding a spot where you were not right next to anyone. Service was fantastic. We took the tour to Chitzen Itza...highly recommend it, but take extra water if its hot. Our time there could have been at least a couple of hours longer in order to see more, but an amazing experience. Also to Cozumel for snorkelling...ferry ride rough, but lots of fun, the reefs are amazingly beautiful. As for the water....use bottled water when in your room.

The food was great...both at the buffet and at the reserved restaurants. In fact, during our first few days we found we ate FAR too much, trying to sample everything!

I will add to the consensus that you shouldn't be at all concerned about booking this resort. We were there the week of December 12-December 19th. I'll apologize now for the length of this review! First off I'll tell you a bit about who we are, to give you a better perspective of this review. I am 32 and she is 34. We went down with the attitude that something would have to go terribly wrong in order to ruin our vacation. We were expecting some little things to not be exactly to our liking, but we wouldn't let this affect our fun. You have to keep in mind that this is Mexico after all--things are just a bit different there. Our priorities when looking for a resort were: a great pool, a swim up bar, a great beach, good food & 24hr international alcohol. As for our tastes in food, we are both quite adventurous and like to try new things. We are certainly not gourmets, but do appreciate great food and usually every couple of months we'll go to a very nice restaurant where we will spend about $200. We chose the IB* Tucan/Quetzal because of a combination of the reviews here, the price and because it offered everthing we were looking for. Also, the close proximity to Playa Del Carmen was a big factor that ruled out a couple of other resorts. When we booked our package, we didn't know what side (Tucan/Quetzal) we would be on. We asked our agent to request the Tucan based on the reviews here. I also emailed the resort about 6 weeks prior to leaving. We also requested a king sized bed on the 2nd or 3rd floor in buildings 11-13 with a non-smoking room. The courteous response to my email was that they were looking forward to our arrival, but couldn't guarantee any of our requests, but would try their best. Based on some other accounts, on our arrival, I was expecting that the check in clerk would have no record of our requests. If this was the case, I wasn't going to let it bother me anyhow. Much to our surprize, we were placed on the Tucan side, in building 12 on the 3rd floor in a non-smoking room! It was such a great location, and I would suggest that you request the same. The Quetzal side does look very nice too. As said previously by others, it is a mirror image to the Tucan, except finished in Teak rather than marble. One comment on the difference, the morning after our arrival, we had an orrientation with our tour rep, and she mentioned that the rooms on the Tucan side are nicer than the Quetzal side. I can't comment as we never saw the rooms, but from seeing the lobby, bars etc., I think that the Quetzal is just as nice. I was expecting the resort to be a bit bigger than it actually was. Based on everyone's reviews, I thought it was going to be HUGE! It is big, but really doesn't feel THAT big. I think the way it is designed is perfect. The jungle really reminds you what the area must have been like prior to all the resorts moving in...it's wonderful that they kept it. We saw the monkeys most days, and the other wildlife and even just the sounds are really great! I agree that the paths were a little uneven and dark--not a problem for me, but could be for some older people. They also have some trees that you have to navigate under/around in places. Once again, not a problem for me. I give the grounds and the lobby etc. top marks for their beauty. The pool was very nice...it was a bit cool though. It was nice for a refreshing dip, but too cold to stay in for hours. I was dissappointed with the swim up bar though--it is off to one side and was in the shade most of the time. Our weather wasn't the hottest, so maybe it is nice in the shade when the heat is unbearable. I never ended up going to the swim up bar in the whole week, and this was one of my priorities when choosing the resort...and it really didn't affect me at all. It's funny the things that you think you really need, which in the end don't really matter. The beach was very nice, but I had expected it to be bigger based on the previous reviews. It was better laid compared to some of the others that we saw (ie the Gala that was next door had 1/2 the beach taken up by a soccer area and volleyball area). For most of the trip the beach was quite clean...except for the Sunday that we were leaving. On Sunday, the beach was littered with drink cups and cigarrette butts. I think that this was the first really busy day, and the crowd seemed different. There seemed to be more children (until then there weren't that many kids). We were probably one of the younger couples at the resort. Most were in their 40's & 50's. This didn't bother us too much, but it might for some of you. It really isn't a big party place, and the night club had max. 20 people in it when we were there (we only went 2 nights--shut it down on one of the nights). We hung out in the lobby bar in the evenings, which was a great spot for us...great people watching! As for rude people, yes we did see a few. And I can't say that they were all Americans either (there were some). The most obnoxious was another Canadian, but there were others from Britain & continental Europe too. The food was good to very good. It's not a gourmet meal, but I found it to be better than what I had expected. There are many foods that were prepared in ways that you don't normally have them, and I found this to be fun. You just have to be adventurous. The selection for one week was varied enough that I didn't get bored. We did get an extra a la carte dinner by going on the wait list, and had 3 in all. Our favourites were the Mexican (don't miss this one) and the Steak house (both our steaks were really tasty...they needed to be sent back first because they were blue rare, but this didn't ruin it for us). We also went to the Italian which was okay. When we arrived, they had just opened a Japanese restaurant (which we didn't try), and didn't have the Tropical anymore. The service in the entire place is out of this world. These guys work very, very hard. We were glad that we each took $50 US in ones, and this seemed to be a perfect amount for tipping. Please do too!! We tipped $1 after every couple of rounds at the bars, and $2 each night to the maid (we had towel art every day except for 2, and the mini-bar was always stocked). They give you a 5 litre bottle of water, but we didn't seem to get this a couple of times. I phoned down to request that one be sent up on two different days, and both times it never showed up...don't really know why. The room that we had was very nice. The bed was hard...I was expecting this and it wasn't an issue. The pillows also sucked, but I still slept like a baby. We didn't have a musty odour in our room that I noticed, and no bugs really (a few flies one night after we had left our door open). The air conditioning worked fine for us, but it wasn't that hot in the evening when we were there, so this might not be a great comparison. Oh ya, if this is a concern for you, a previous review stated that there were no English TV channels...there are 3 or 4 (one of them is FOX News--what a good laugh that is!). Don't know why this would be an issue though...your in freakin' Mexico! All in all, I would recommend this resort to anyone that isn't expecting a true 5 star resort. It is about a 4 star...don't expect more and you won't be dissappointed. I will definantly be back to Playacar (great area) and quite possibly return to the Tucan in the future.

Usually with a 5 night stay, you get to eat once in these fine restaurants. The beach had plenty of chairs, drink service (Premium brands) was always available on the beach, at the pool, and of course in the bars and restaurants. Someone complained about too many chairs and not enough light in their review. I'd rather have too many, than have to wait for a chair at the beach or pool. As for not enough light, you're in a Tropical Rain Forest. Of course you're going to have dappled or limited light. I'm sure they were restricted as to how many of the trees they were allowed to remove to make way for the buildings. We can not say enough about how well we were treated on this our second Honeymoon. My wife had stayed here 3 years ago, this was my first time to Mexico. I'd love to stay again at the Tucan. Easy access to Playa Del Carmen was a $5 or 50 Peso cab ride.

Let me start by saying the food and drinks were great, and the jungle was really cool too. the service was also fabulous--the staff is stellar in every aspect- helpful, courteous, and just wonderful. We had a great time in spite of the Tucans shortcomings, but there are a few things i wish i had known before i booked it. 1. The hotel has no outdoor space other than the jungle- and the pool area. you cant hang out in the jungle, which leaves the pool and beach area--and they are very crowded and cluttered. 2. almost all the rooms are very dark as they get no sunlight- hence the musty smell. 3 . the entertainment is for children. 4. 4 of the 6 restaurants are on the side of the lobby-leaving only two that are near the beach. this makes no sense to me. there is no direct sunlight/ view of the beach or sky anywhere in this resort except around the pool.and on the beach. you would think that the bar by the beach/ pool would stay open later...or there would be a buffet restaurant open for dinner by the beach, but instead the two restaurants w/ a view are both a la carte. it would have been nice to eat under the stars/ by the sea even if you are not able to get reservations. 5. there is no tv in english and there are no movies/ cable that you can pay for either. 6. generally too cluttered with excess furniture- the pool, the beach, the plaza bar. you never got a sense of wingspan or being out in the open. it was just too cluttered. in conclusion, the tucan was great for eating vast amounts of food and getting sloshed on very good drinks. there are a ton of kids and elderly---very family oriented. always something to do/ something going on. i would return with a large group of friends perhaps, but not for a relaxing romantic vacation AT ALL.

I'll give my opinion and comment on some of the opinions expressed by others as well. Cancun Airport: Maybe we were just lucky but we got through immigration and customs in no time. Ours was the only flight arriving at the time - about 3:30 on a Friday afternoon. We were on our way to the hotel within about 40 minutes. Check-in: Easy and fast. No reservation mess-ups. We got our bracelets and keys and the bellboy brought our luggage almost immediately. Only unfortunate thing was that it was almost dark by the time we arrived - this was just before 5:00pm. The drive from the airport was a little longer than expected - about 45 minutes. Room: Very nice and very clean. Sure, there's a slight musty smell in the bathroom. It's just due to the humidity - the air is always damp here. Welcome to Mexico - if you're going to complain about it, go somewhere drier. The maid service was terrific. We tipped about 20 pesos each day and our fridge was always replenished, and funky towel art each day. Gardens/Grounds: Nice jungle paths throughout the resort. Wildlife everywhere. If you've been here and didn't see monkeys, I have some advice for your next time: Look up. We saw and heard monkeys everyday. If you see green leaves - not dead ones, but green ones - falling to the ground, they are likely being dropped by a monkey. We saw large ones, small ones, babies even - right outside our room in the mornings! Wonderful! Also, lots of wild birds - flamingos, spoonbills, herons, peacocks, turkeys, chucks, and lots of these rabbit-sized rodents that I don't know the English name for but the Spanish name is \"seraquay\". The look a little like large, short-haired guinea pigs. There're everywhere! The gardens are lovely and well maintained - very tidy. Watch for animal doody on the paths or you'll be cleaning your shoes daily. Restraurants/Food: We found all of the restaurants to be very good. The buffet food is a little repetitive but there's enough variety that it should please everyone. We tried the Tropical and Mexican restaurants and found both to be very good. The snack bar food at the pool/beach areas is pretty much American junk food - burgers, pizzas, fries, but there are also plenty of totopos, guacamole, and salsa which we loved! Pool: Huge lagoon style freeform pool. It's deeper and therefore cooler than most big resort pools here so it is refreshing to go for a dip, although we prefer the ocean. Lots of sunbeds all around the pool but difficult to find one in the sun as most are under palapas or shaded by the gardens. We ignored the adult pool with the swim-up bar. It's in the shade and didn't look very inviting to us - we're not really drinkers anyway and there's another poolside/beach bar at the main pool as well as in the palapa restaurants. Beach: The most beautiful beach I've seen yet. In the hotel area, the beach is a constant parade of people. It's great for people watchers. No trouble getting a sunbed at any time of day either in sun or shade. The water is not too rough to swim in and there's lots of activity. There is a little toplessness but in truth, I didn't see one pair that was worth a second look so you know it ain't vanity. The guys aren't shy here either - like the 300 pounder in the cheese-cutter thong. Really - some people just don't care, huh? Anyway, lovely white sand, goes on for kilometres. I recommend a long walk south to \"The Rocks\". There are no resorts at this end and we wathced pelicans diving for fish for a long time here - very peaceful. There is clear evidence of beach erosion in some areas but it is not bad in front of the Tucan/Quetzal. It is much worse further north near the Reef Club where there is no beach left at all. Entertainment: Evening shows were a little dull but actually pretty good considering they are not professional entertainers. We only went to two shows. There was live music on the beach a couple of days when they had beach parties which were fun. Staff: With few exceptions, the staff were wonderful - very friendly and helpful. And, hey cheapskate - \"all-inclusive\" make not make you feel obligated to tip but keep in mind that the people who are busting their butts to make sure that you have a good time are paid only about 35 pesos a day - that's a few bucks to you and me. So, a dollar goes a long way and as if they're not already doing enough for you, just see what happens when you leave a buck here and there. You'll never see them with their hand out, but there's no question that they really appreciate it. Town: Playa Del Carmen is a safe 40 minute walk from the hotel. We went twice and did not return until after dark and did not once feel in any danger. The streets of Playacar are very safe and there are always people about. There is a plaza about 5 minutes from the hotel where you can buy anything that you can get in town but the prices are a little higher. Overall: A lovely, wonderful hotel. Clean and spacious, lots to see and do. The exchange rate while we were there was 9.00 pesos to $1CAD at the start of the week and 8.50 at the end. The rates at the cambios in Playa Del Carmen were the same, although we did find one on La Quinta on our last day that was paying 8.85 so we changed some TC's here.", "Date": "December 15, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol, UK", "Title": "\u201cThought this was supposed to be a hotel review?\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2873786", "Content": "I stayed here for my honeymoon after reading reviews from here and most seem to be excellent, (although a few seem to be about people's personal experience with other guests and about their stomach upsets!?!)

We had reservations for the Tucan but were moved to the Quetzal. I never saw a Tucan room so I don't know if we were downgraded or not, but our room did not have the double shower that others have spoken about (why do I think my wife had something to do with this). But you have access to all the same things, so this was not a big deal to us. The resort is gorgeous and the staff was always very attentive and helpful. Before I begin, I always found it helpful to know what folks expected as I read their reviews, so here is our frame of reference. We were looking for a nice place to spend quiet time on a pretty beach that also offered other things to do if we wanted to pursue them. We did not expect to be pampered nor are we picky eaters. Here are our collective thoughts: The airport: As you are trying to get out of there, lots of official looking folks will call for you to come over at the counter they are working behind. Don\u2019t do it. They are trying to sell you a trip or a time-share visit. Keep on walking. Outside the \u201cbagboys\u201d will run up and try to \u201chelp\u201d you with your luggage. If you need help, fine, but they expect a tip. You can keep walking on past them as well and find your ride waiting for you. The room: Not opulent, but nice. Tile floors throughout. Balcony with a table and chairs to sit at. One of our chairs was broken. No iron in sight for wrinkled clothes. Bottled water, cokes, beer in the refrigerator. Gallon bottle of water in a cabinet. Our refrigerator was not the best, as it struggled to get things a little bit cool. TV with English and Spanish channels. Overhead ceiling fan was all we needed at night. As everyone says, the beds are VERY firm. The food: Good, and quite varied. I found the buffet to be better than folks had let on. Breakfast was the best. We had the buffet lunch at the restaurants by the pool every day. There is one on the Tucan and Quetzal side. You can get ice cream at the one on the Quetzal side or at the beach bar. We signed up for the Steak and Mexican restaurants when we got there, and put our names on the waiting list for the Italian and Seafood ones. We ended up with reservations to all four of them. Every restaurant has an appetizer bar, which you need to go easy on if you want to leave room for the main course. I thought the desserts at the buffet were better than the ones in the restaurants. The beach: It was great. Lots of room to spread out if you wanted to. We had great, 90+ degree weather. Places in the shade are taken very early. But you can get an umbrella that you stick in the sand, which is what we did every day. You get them at the same place you get towels. Had to get one by 10:00 or they ran out, but folks turn them in during the day so keep checking. There will be topless ladies all around so be prepared for it. Most are older ladies who you wish would put their tops back on. Lots of smokers, but the ocean breeze seemed to take care of that just fine. The only folks who got on my nerves were fellow Americans who brought their own boom box, turned it up real loud, talked even louder to be heard over the music. Rude Yanks! :) We moved to a new spot and all was well. There was one Spanish lady who cut in line at the beach bar, but the bartender saw her and refused to server her until he waited on everyone else. Very funny. From the beach you can see Cozemel island across the way. As you lay there you will see jet skiers, para-sailers, canoers, boaters, and the occasional cruise ship. Outings: We chose the ruins at Coba, and loved it. It's not nearly as well persevered as the ruins at Chichen-Itza, but you get to do a lot more. Not only do you get to see and climb a ruin, you also get to swim in a cave, canoe, hike through the forest, zip-line over a ravine, and rappel into the ravine. Finally they feed you a Mayan meal. Great trip. Shopping: There is a small shopping center within a five-minute walk of the Tucan. About 20 or so shops. We found several things we liked there. We walked into Playa one morning for shopping. Sidewalks all the way and very safe. Once you get used to the shop owners trying to get you into their shops, it was a fun time. Just turn a deaf ear and all is well. Expect to bargain with them. You could get most things at half the asking price or less. If you are willing to walk away from a deal, they often times will come down even more. They accept pesos and US dollars, but not all of them had the right change in dollars. I took the peso as change and exchanged them at the front desk before we left. They use a flat 10 for 1 exchange rate in the market, so it is very easy to convert prices in your head - i.e. 300 pesos is $30 US dollars. Complaints: Not many. We wanted to swim in the pool at night, but they shut everything down at 7:00. The entertainment at night was mildly entertaining. Maybe a 5 on a scale of 1 \u2013 10. We were content just walking the beach at night. We had the bellboy pick up our bags early so we could hit the beach before we left. He was to put them in the hospitality room, but we found them on the curb. Our refrigerator could have been better. And I still wanted that double shower.

My family consists of my husband, myself and our 14 yr. old daughter. Let me first say that upon arriving at the Cancun airport, beware of the timeshare vultures!! Any representative that is providing your transfer to the hotel will be located OUTSIDE the airport. If you are approached inside the airport (after clearing customs & immigration), you can bet it is for timeshare purposes. I have been a travel agent for over 20 yrs. and can ususally recognize these ploys, but have to admit it took a good five minutes before I was on to them. Actually, when they asked for $50 in exchange for a \"free\" champagne brunch at the \"grand opening\" of a new golf course at the Moon Palace, I got wise. They also offered 1/2 price tours. Once outside, our \"real\" tour operator explained how clever they can be, even getting ahold of the shirts (or uniforms) of legitimate tour operators. Anyway, STEER CLEAR! The hotel is as beautiful has everyone has stated on trip advisor. I had emailed ahead asking for the 11-12 block on the third floor and also requesting specialty restaurant reservations. There was no record of my email. We were put in room 1307, a ground floor with a promise that we could move to our requested room halfway through our stay. We agreed to that, but once we got settled we decided to keep our room. The terrace faced the jungle with a walkway barely visible in the distance, so I didn't feel our privacy was invaded. As \"rock hard\" beds have been mentioned so many times, I was concerned enough to take air mattresses with us, thus requiring us to check-in a large suitcase. We were able to carry on our other luggage--we were only staying four nights. The beds are firm, but I never unpacked the air mattresses. We all slept just fine. A/C worked great and plenty of hot water and great water pressure in the shower. We forgot to leave a tip the first night and did not receive the towel art mentioned often. We left tips each night thereafter and thus received the towel art. There was always 1 or 2 gallon jugs of purified water left in the room that was handy for brushing your teeth so that you didn't need to use the few cold bottles of water stocked in the frige. The food was very good at the buffet, and I can see how it may become repetitive if staying a week or longer. They offer many choices and even my VERY finicky daughter found plenty to eat--yes, they offer many \"Americanized\" types of foods--chicken fingers & nuggets, cheese sticks, french fries, mashed potatoes--but there was also many other more unusual choices. I particulary enjoyed the sauteed pineapple with onion--two things I would never think of putting together but it is delicious! I have read on this site that Thursday is \"Lobster Fest\" at the buffet, but this was not the case while we were there. I had promised my husband Lobster for Thanksgiving, but he had to settle for all the shimp he could eat (and he ate a lot!) I didn't hear any complaints. As mentioned earlier, my restaurant reservations were not received, but I was able to get a late seating (9pm) at the Steak House. We took our finicky daughter to the buffet at 8pm knowing she would be happier eating there and the two of us then went to the Steakhouse. My tenderloin was excellent and my husband's pork ribs equally as good. They had many exotic appetizers (squid, snails, grouper) that you won't see at the buffet. The nightly show put on by the Star Friends can be entertaining if you realize that these hard working kids are not professionals, but put forth a lot of effort. It is not a Vegas style revue. We did two tours in the four days we were there. Not wanting to take full-day tours, we chose Alltournative's Chikin-Ha tour. I highly recommend this tour and Alltournative. The groups are small (we had about 12) and more personal. We biked a short distance through a jungle path, snorkeled in a crystal clear cenote, relaxed in tubes in a little lagoon, and (best of all) did three zip lines over the jungle canopy. My husband, not a big fan of heights, loved the experience. They also take the time to explain a little of the Mayan culture. You witness a Mayan purification ritual inside a cave-like cenote and an authentic mexican lunch awaits your return. Note: The zip lines are not mandatory--there were a few on our tour that did the first two (lower) zip lines, but optioned out of the highest. I would not hestitate to take another Alltournative Tour. The next day my daughter and I went horseback riding at Loma Bonita. We both have horses and ride at home, but my daughter has always wanted to ride on the beach and swim in the ocean with a horse. Loma Bonita is the only ranch that takes you to the beach and allows swimming with the horses. Having done it, I have to say we both would not do it again. The horses for the most part look well fed, but I have to wonder how long they can keep up the pace. We were the first of 3 rides that day and some of the horses were exhausted, and it appeared they would be used for the next group waiting. Be forwarned that these groups are usually in excess of 40 people. Being experienced riders, my daughter and I didn't appreciate being \"herded\" by galloping, yelling cowboys and neither did our horses. I would be interested to know if anyone has experienced Punta Venado Ranch as I was told this was the best place for riding tours (with small groups). I must say that Carlos with Olympus Tours (located in the Tucan lobby) was extremely helpful with our tour bookings. The only downside was that the hotel is a little too family oriented for us. There were many younger children and it felt a little like Disneyworld at times. We found ourselves more than once at a dinner table in the buffet between two very large \"kid only\" tables--the parents wisely at an adult table well removed from the kids. There were many groups of extended families at this hotel and tables of up to twenty were common (almost the norm). Maybe because it was Thanksgiving week?? I'm not saying this is a black mark for the hotel, just that it is their niche and not really our niche. Small children are very much a priority here and I can appreciate that. As mentioned by others, take many $1 bills for tips. We took $50 in ones but could have used a little more--I would recommend $100 for a week stay. We also took a few fives for our tour coordinator and tour guide at Alltournatives. I never felt anyone had their hand out for a tip at the hotel but they genuinely seemed to appreciate it. The beach and water was gorgeous and getting a lounge chair at the beach was not a problem in the afternoon--we are not ones to be at the beach at 7am! The beach is not huge, and the lounge chairs are lined up side by side, so there isn't much room for spreading out. We watched a beach wedding ceremony at sunset on the far Tucan side of the beach. We met a couple on the Chikin-Ha tour that married this way and they said the Tucan staff did a wonderful job and that they perform wedding ceremonies six out of seven days. If you are looking forward to a vacation to the Tucan/Quetzal, I'm sure you will enjoy your stay.

It is an hour bus ride from the Airport and you get to see some of the real Mexico during the ride. We had reserved a Jr. Suite, which I would HIGHLY recommend. The Jr. Suites are all ocean front, our balcony was 30' from the beach and 120' feet from the ocean. Check in was the only bad experience we had. We booked our vacation through Apple Vacations which uses the Tucan side of the resort, the Tucan is the hotel on the right side of the resort and the other side is the Quetzal, which is used by Funjet vactions. Both sides are equally as nice, so when we were booked at the Tucan, but put in the Quetzal side, I was not concerned. The problem came when the 4 of us got to the room to fine only one bed (king size) along with the two small couches, there was no bed for my daughters. My wife called the front desk who at first said there were no other rooms available for several days and our daughters would need to sleep on the couches. After my wife became VERY upset, there was a room available the next day and they came and made up the couches. This was the only bad experience we had, but after having booked the Jr. Suite 9 months ahead, and the reservation being for 4 people, having only one bed was a BIG mistake. ROOM: After we arrived in our new room, we could begin enjoying our stay. The refridgerator was well stocked and we tipped $2 everyday and the fridge was restocked everyday instead of every other day as it is supposed to be. We had towel are everyday, which my daughter collected on a shelf as her own little zoo. Housekeeping does a wonderful job of keeping your room clean and organized for you. The beds are as hard as everyone else reported, but by the end of your day you are so tired that you can manage to get to sleep. The room safe is very handy, but don't bring a laptop, because it is not that big. The shower is very big and the water pressure is great, the water is not really hot, but is warm enough to be refreshing. The rooms do not have alarm clocks, so bring a battery powered one, because the rooms appear to have motion sensors that turn off power to the outlets after awhile. I say it appears this way, because in the first room we had, the power shut off during the night and while we were out, so our plug-in clock was always wrong, and when we would open the door after being gone, the lights would turn back on as I opened the door, this didn't happen in the second room. There was always 1 or 2 gallons of bottled water in your room to use for brushing your teeth, do not use the faucet water for brushing or drinking. The bathrooms are a little small. Hotel: The hotel grounds are outstanding. The jungle seperates the Tucan and Quetzal sides and the jungle is huge. We saw the monkeys in the trees several times, sometimes they were right above us and we could watch them play, there were animals walking everywhere in the jungle, it was awesome. The hotel is quite big, so you do end up walking quite a bit, but there is so much to see on the way, that you will not mind it at all. There is a very nice email room with two computers which cost about $2 for 15 or 20 minutes. Food: The food was pretty good at the buffets and there was good selection. Due to our busy schedule we ate only at the Italian restaurant. It was nice and very good. My daughter did not like what she rdered and the waiter noticed this without us saying anything and insisted she order something else, which really made the dinner. We had made dinner reservations via email before we arrived and those were set when we arrived. Beach & Pool: The pool is salt water and might have been a little cool, but wasn't a problem at all. We spent most of our time at the beach and had no problem finding chairs. Only one day were the waves a little to big, the rest of the days they provided just the right amount of fun. People do walk down th beach trying to sell you things, but all you need to do is say no thank you and they simply walk away, they are no problem. Being from the USA, the topless optional beach was new to us. We did see about 20 topless women and after the first or second day it wasn't an issue. Did see two guys in thongs, that is so wrong. Scuba Diving: I dove twice with Puerta Adventuras divers, which was just ok. Then I dove twice with Dressel Divers which is at the Tucan, they were much better and I should have dove with them for all of my dives. If you have ever dove in Cozumel, you will find the water in Riviera is not as clear, but is still a good time. Side Trips: We did a full day of snorkeling with Snorkel Adventures, it was a good time, with lunch included. We swam with the Dolphins with Dolphin Discovery, which was an incredible experience and worth every dollar ($129) per person plus $50 for a DVDo f your swim. You can check out their website and make reservations ahead of time. We went to Xcaret, which was a little disappointing, only because the Tucan is so impressive. Xcaret is a lot of jungle paths, which you already have at the Tucan. The evening show(6-8 pm) at Xcaret is outstanding and worth the price of admission alone. We went downtown to 5th Avenue several times which is a $4 taxi ride or probably a 30 minute walk. They are a little annoying down there trying to get you into the stores, but that is al part of the experience. Make sure you haggle over the price and walk away once in awhile, they will lower the price even more. While downtown, we found a guy who had two little monkeys and for $5 you could hold them and take al the pictures you wanted, my daughters loved it. We are always concerned about eating outside of the hotels, but there are plenty of safe to eat places on 5th ave, we ate at a place called Karens and the fahitas were great. There is also a Mcdonalds and Burger King there. At the Tucan they want $70 for hairbraiding a full head of hair. On one of the side streets off of 5th Ave, we got each of there's done for $15 plus tip. There is a small mall about a 10 minute walk from the Tucan, it is nice, but those prices are set, no haggling. Overall, this was great hotel and resort and would tell our friends to stay there.

Just returned from a fantastic week vacation with our kids ages 1-17 at the Iberostar Tucan and had a great time. The resort was absolutely beautiful. Our family would highly recommend it. There are so many good things to write about and I'll begin with the grounds. We were amazed at the beauty of the ponds, jungle area, waterfalls and overall landscape. Found it to be clean and well kept. Our kids enjoyed taking walks because everywhere we went there were live animals. We loved the pools and beach. The main pool had two gradual entry areas for kids but majority of pool is 5ft. Also separate shallow pool for infants. Pool for watersports and adult pool with bar and waterfall. Plenty of chairs but best spots are taken early. The beach is awesome!Loved swimming in the ocean. The beach also had plenty of chairs and some shaded huts. Water in both pools and ocean was warm. Our rooms were located in building 14. We got adjoining rooms on first floor and loved the location. We were close to pool and to restaurants and had a jungle view. Ouyr rooms were spacious but beds were hard. Air conditioning seemed to keep room comfy. The shower was large and plenty of hot water when needed. Service was exceptional everywhere we went. Everyone is always so pleasant and willing to help. Room service food was very good taste wise and presentation wise, but limited. Buffets were repetitive morning, noon and night. But ok. Ate at the steakhouse and italian, both were good. Hightly recommend a day trip to Xcaret. Absolutely beatiful, floated thru underground river and snorkeled.....so much to see and do. Went downtown to Playa Del Carmen, since our last visit in 2002, they are really making improvements. Great place to shop and eat. A nice new MacDonalds for kids to enjoy too. Kids are kept entertained around resort and did not see too much of them. Had a 1 yr old and 3 yr old with us who were to young to participate in the kids club. Age reqt is 4 and up. They take kids for day at no additional cost. My 7 yrs old loved it and even participated in the evening show with the Star People. I also want to compliment the Star People for the unvelievable shows they put on every night. They are all so talented. Loved this place and would go back.

The hotel grounds are amazing, always lots of animals to spot in the jungle. The room was clean and spacious, there was always hot water and the minibar was so stacked with beer, you could't close the door! Yes, the beds are hard but this is a Mexican thing. The towel art every day was interesting. The pool was huge and warm and the beach, where we spent most of our holiday, was stunning. Soft sand and small waves. The hotel has a large seperate pool bar that was mainly dominated by American guests. We have been to other all-inclusives in Mexico and Cuba and didn't really rate the food in this hotel. Not much choice so it got a bit boring after 2 weeks. The food tended to be warm, not hot. The Italian Speciality Restaurant was good. There was caberet style entertainment every night that has a 14 night rotation so you don't see the same show twice. The Star Friends work had at this but it wasn't really our scene. We went a couple of times but the American guests were usually louder than the music!! Its well worth taking the trip into town (5th Avenue) as its only \u00a33 in a taxi. (the shopping is great girls!!) We had a couple of excellent meals and reasonably priced (steak and lobster dinner for \u00a310) and you can get 6 Corona's for \u00a35 in some of the bars. Take one of the side streets off 5th Ave and see \"real\" Mexico. The people are really friendly and the area is safe. We would recommend the full-day all-inclusive trip to Xel-Ha to make sure to get to do all of the activities. If you do the half day with Tulum, its a bit of a rush. The speed boat ride through the mangroves in Cancun is also good fun. We did tip the maid every other day and the bar staff. But this didn't appear to effect the service you got. The lobby bar was a bit small and tended to get really full before dinner so you couldn't get a seat. The guy playing the violin every other night was also a bit depressing!

The jungle is a lot of fun, spotting the animals etc, but be warned the monkeys can be noisy in the early mornings. The beach and pool were attractive, clean and well maintained.

The food, Beware After eating dinner after the third night became violently ill, coming out each way for six hours straight. Don't get me wrong the food tasted delicious, but there are birds flying around the main dining room, grabing food off of plates. To make matters worse, the toilets wouldn't flush in the resort three o'clock in the morning because there was a water pressure problem. They broke at a very bad time for myself.

The accomadations are wonderful and the tropical grounds as well as the beautiful beach are beautiful. There were always plenty of loungers available. The drinks were great. The bartenders went out of their way to make what ever we wanted. Our wedding was wonderful. We had thirty people join us and they all had a wonderful time at the resort. Mariela, our wedding cordinator, did an unbelievable job of making our special day wonderful. We had our ceramony on the beach followed by a dinner at the Tropical resturaunt and a reception dance at the night club. Our experience was relatively stress free and well organized ahead of time. Music, flowers, the champaigne toast and the set up of chairs, alter, etc. on the beach were all done to perfection. A friend of my wife's had recently been engaged and enjoyed the experience so much that she booked the hotel for her wedding early next month. We look forward to going back to their wedding in a couple of weeks and to enjoy a week to celebrate our first anniversary! The food was good but not excellent. We were able to eat at each ala carte resturaunt and enjoyed the extras that each offered especially the Tequila Boom Booms at the Steak House. Beef and chicken were not up to our expectations, as living in the Midwest, it's hard to compare. The buffets were good, sometimes redundant, but service was always excellent.

We had a brilliant time: Food/Drink - a la cartes really good (excellent seafood starters in Steakhouse), lovely red snapper main course in Italian and had a great steak in Tropical. Least favourate was Mexican - I think we picked the wrong thing though - tacos were quite plain, but still enjoyed the starters, desserts, wine and service in all! Buffet was good quality - we stayed in Tucan side but preferred Queztel buffet - seemed a bit quieter. My favourite buffet time was breakfast - fresh fruit, omlettes made for you & lovely pastry, breads etc. We also enjoyed the buffet by the beach/pool - less choice but fresher as there seemed to be a quicker turnover of food. We had some lovely fish, chicken & steaks straight from the grill. Mmmmm Room - big & clean, not really very luxurious for 5 star. But fine for us. We thought the bed was fine. Better than ours at home which is on its last legs! Room smelt a bit damp - but must be the humid atmosphere. Grounds - beautiful. Monkeys in trees opposite our balcony gave us great entertainment! We stayed in Block 14 which was perfect - in the middle, so not far to restaurants, reception, pool, beach etc. Entertainment/Staff - staff are wonderful. My husband got a litte fed up of the evening shows - but I loved them! We went to Playa Del Carmen 3 nights and it was well worth the trip. Good to do something different when you are there for 2 weeks. We enjoyed the Blue Parrott - a lovely beachfront bar/disco.. with loungers for 2 on the beach.. you can sip your drink & look up at the stars with your feet in the sand. Dancefloor outside too! Good music. Good if you fancy a late night, best go late. We done some trips - but won't go on as we agreed with other reviews - enjoyed Xel Ha (especially the snorkelling - lots of beautiful fish), Xcaret, Tulum, Chichen Itza - they were all worth doing and enjoyable. Beach/Pool - we did find the beach busy at times, but found a quietish spot (far right Tucan side) - the loungers next to the pool were sometimes busy too - but wasn't too much of a problem. We knew it was a busy hotel before we booked so can't complain. A bit too many kids for us as a honeymoon couple, but again we knew the hotel was a family hotel when we booked. Sea was lovely and enjoyed floating on my air bed.. can be quite a few waves though & strong current - so take care! A walk along the beach was nice in the morning to stretch your legs.

This is only my opinion and I do not hope to present a monopoly on the truth - clearly others have a much more favourable view of the hotel. Firstly, the hotel was very busy when I visited - so it seemed a fight to get a sunbed in a good position. Somewhat irritatingly other guests get up early to put their towels out. Reminded me of holidays in spain & greece! Personally, I found it to be quite noisy by the pool - lots of kids shoutings, dive bombing etc - not the best for a relaxing break. Also, the iberostar staff play this repetitive music (including the 'iberostar theme tune'), which is quite loud. Lots of activities going on - I am sure this appeals to many people - but not me. Secondly, there is no snorkelling. The beach is very pretty (although the hotel has quite a small stretch). Again fight for sunbeds on the beach. Thirdly, I found the rooms to be of a very average standard - they are not awful, but not great by any standard. Fourthly, the food was mass produced and highly variable in quality. The specialty restaurants were nothing special. Many of the wiaters spoke very poor english and the service was not great, i.e. not particularly friendly. Despite the above, I think the hotel deserves its 4* rating (but not more). I think the hotel would excel in appealing to families. If you like mass culture & lots of activity, then go here.

First of all I would like to thank others that posted their reviews because that was one of the reasons that I booked the Tucan. Don't want to take to much space in writing this review because others have told exactly how it was in the past. I found a lot of the information written by other reviewers accurate. Meaning the positive ones......... Food: Excellent. Me and my companion travellers found the buffet in fact better than the a la carte restaurants. We only tried two (Steak and Mexican) so maybe we were there on the wrong day and made the wrong choice. But don't understand me wrong: the buffet was better, meaning that the al la carte was more than OK. Pool/Beach: In one word, excellent. No problem in getting chairs or all the other things you read in the reviews. Service: Outstanding. Everybody is working very hard in doing their best to give you the best vacation. Of course we tipped also but I would like to warn, in my opinion, everybody for the tipping. Yes it's true that the people that work there do not earn a lot of money. By tipping them you give them surely what they deserve, I feel that way to. The friendliness and helpfullness is something where a lot of waiters and staff in Europe can learn from! But by tipping some, you forget a lot of others that are working behind the scenes. Also we must not forget that we are in Mexico and we should not make it for example a 2nd USA. It is another country with it's own culture and ways of life. We should not impose our \"more\" western lifestyle, because that would take the charme out of it........ Together with my friens we saw that guests that were not tipping were not helped as quickly as others that did. This cannot be the idea of an All Inclusive Resort. I can't blame the waiters of course, so I can only blame those who do the tipping......... Maybe there is another way! Did the golfcourse of Playacar which was magnificent. If you are a good golfer you are really going to enjoy this course. Visited a lot of golfcourses over the world but this is for sure in my favourite top 5 ever. I think that if you book it directly with the course it is cheaper than booking it through the hotel. It saves you around $20. Also if you are not fond of travelling with large groups and going in and out busses all day, you can alternatively rent a car. We rented a Jeep at the hotel for $60 incl. and did a tour to Tulum, Chitzen Itza and Cancun. Lot of fun and you get a chance of driving on bumpy roads through the jungle. I can write so much more, but I think the general idea is clear. It is the only resort I visited in Mexico so I cannot compare it to others. But if you want to have a great vacation where everything is taken care of in a luxurious way: choose the Tucan.

Most of the previous reviews create a perfect picture of the hotel but here are a few personal comments. The food was excellent. We visited all but the Tropical A La Cartes and would recommend them all, the buffet always had plenty of choice but we found it was quite nice to get a taxi ($4) into Playa Del Carmen a couple of nights for a change of scenery (Sur - Argentinian Steakhouse in 5th Avenue was fantastic) plenty of places to eat and drink at reasonable prices. The pool was amazing, we felt a little disappointed to find the pool bar was separate from the main pool but after visiting it found it could get quite rowdy so is probably best placed where it is. The beach was spotless and our preferred choice over the pool. The rooms were fine. The staff were absolutely brilliant (Clemante & Eduardo in Tucan lobby bar were absolute stars) We visited the disco on a few occasions for a late drink, the music could get a little repetitive but it does have to cater for all nationalities. We were not great lovers of the cabaret but I think this is really down to personal choice. Highly recommend the jungle tour in speedboats in Cancun. Xel-Ha is a good trip (excellent snorkelling) but we wished we had made our own way there by taxi or bus as you can come and go as you please. We swam with the dolphins in The Aquarium in Cancun (pool based) which was good but watching the dolphin experience in Xel-Ha I would say this would be equally as good.

The place is complete paradise. We had previously been advised that the non-smoking block, block 15 was the best to be in, so requested it and were lucky enough to get two rooms on the ground floor. Block 15 is convenient for the restaurants, lobby and pool/beach. The rooms are wonderful - huge showers. The maids leave towel art and chocolates in the rooms, so it is always exciting on returning to the room in the afternoon to see what has been left. The food was of a very high standard. We ate at three out of the four speciality restaurants and buffet the rest of the time. All were equally as good - the only difference being the speciality restaurants were waiter service. We particularly liked the lobby bar. The waitresses were all so friendly and sweet - one even bought me a present!! The bar manager makes a point of learning each guest's name and nightly will come round and shake you by the hand and ask how you are doing. The evening entertainment was sometimes very good, but sometimes not so good. But one has to admire the energy and enthusiasm of all of the Star Friends entertainment team; and I can assure you by the end of your stay you will have the Club Dance tune going round in your head!! The pool and beach are fantastic and as they are so close you can alternate between taking a dip in the pool or the ocean. The only thing that was slightly off-putting about the pool was that sometimes you would have divers under you. We loved walking through the jungle and did so several times a day - looking for monkeys! We saw a monkey on our first day but no more after that!! Just a 5-10 minute walk out of the hotel is a little parade of shops. These shops are just as good as any you will find in Playa de Carmen. We went into Playa de Carmen once but were very put off by a lot of the shopkeepers standing outside the shops shouting at us to go in and have a look round; something that did not happen at the shops near the hotel. We really did have a fantastic stay and would recommend this resort to anyone and we certainly plan to return in the future ourselves.", "Date": "October 21, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Colorado", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location!

I have previously stayed at the Iberostar Cozumel and the Iberostar Paraisio Del Mar and was happy to find that the Tucan had the same excellent level of service, accommodations and food as I have come to expect at an Iberostar Resort. In my opinion, it is hard to beat an Iberostar resort. In fact, I went to the Kantaneh Palladium last March, and although there was absolutely nothing wrong with that hotel, I found myself wishing I was at an Iberostar. Since so many wonderful things have been written about the Tucan already, I thought I might share a tip regarding getting into all the speciality restaurants, regardless of your length of stay. For a 7 day stay you are guaranteed seating 2 speciality restaurants. We were able to go to all the speciality restaurants( and some twice) by simply putting our name on the waiting list of the speciality restaurant we wanted to eat at either the day before or the morning of that day. They will notify you by 5:00pm if you will be seated at the restaurant by sending a note to your room. We ate at the speciality restaurants every night except for the night we arrived and the night before we left. We elected to go to the buffet the night before we left just for a change of pace as the buffet has alot of choices and the food is good. Without exception, all the speciality restaurants, Steakhouse, Caribbean, Italian and Mexican were excellent. I hesitate to choose one over the other as I think it is dependent on individual taste. Another tip: If we want to go to places like Tulum, Xcaret, and Xel-Ha economically, use a collectivo to get there. It will cost you around 250 pesos, much less than a taxi or a tour. You can pick up a collectivo at the intersection of Calle 2 and 15th Ave. Collectivos go just about everywhere as this is the transportation used by the locals to get around. Finally, please tip the people at the Iberostar. Even though it is an all-inclusive, these people do not earn much money (like $3.00 for an entire day). Just think about how hard they work and what a wonderful time they make sure you have and I don't think it will be too hard to part with a dollar here and there. For the price we pay for a week at a resort in Mexico, there is nothing that compares to that in the US for the level of service, accommodations, and variety of food that we get. Why people complain about anything is beyond me.

The rooms were very nice, with a big tile shower with double shower heads, small patio with a clothes rack to dry your wet bathing suits, digital safe that was easy to use. The mini bar was well stocked with water, beer, and a different variety of sodas. We tipped the maid a couple dollars everyday and received chocolates and towels art everyday. The food was good. We especially liked the breakfast buffet which had an omelet bar and all types of pastries and really good donuts and strong coffee. They even served lunch and dinner type food at breakfast time if you'd prefer that. We ate once at the Steakhouse. We both had the tenderloin which was very good. They bring you a \"blooming onion\" for an appetizer and they also have a full bar. The best drinks , we found, were at one of the lobby bars. If you ask for a certain premium liquor they will use it instead of the house liquor. The mojitos were my favorite. The wait staff at the bars and restaurants were always very helpful and friendly. Our favorite bartender was Manuel, he made the best cocktails. We always tipped either the bartender or the waitresses a dollar everytime we ordered a round. They work extremely hard and deserve it. We found that the most friendly of the staff were local people of Mayan descent. They were much more friendly and helpful than the other staff at the resort like the customer service or pool staff. The pool area was nice as was the beach. There are alot of beach chairs available. Not always in the shade though. If you get there earlier in the day you shouldn't have a problem finding a palapa to sit under. Be sure and not lose your towel cards because there is a replacement fee.

We tipped the maid daily as advised & received all the goodies mentioned by others.

Both sides of the hotel surrounded by amazing scenery, lots of wildlife. What are those large rat/squirrel things?!! There was so much variety with the food we just don't see how people can complain. I am a bit of a picky eater but had no problems. Managed to eat in all the restaurants, the Italian was a personal favourite & we had a 2nd sitting by adding our name to the reserve list. We never had a problem finding a lounger in the shade no matter what time of the day. There were a lot of Americans & yes you knew they were there but then again we have often seen Brits to be ashamed of while on holiday. Although I admit to being a bit peeved that while we abided by the rules & dressed for dinner etc many of the Americans dressed down & wore shorts, spoiling the ambience.The staff were lovely, many of them speaking several languages, so clever. Rafael in the pool bar could mix several cocktails at the same time & spent his one day off learning German. We did a few trips. The snorkelling at Xel-Ha was amazing, particularly at the bridge end when food was thrown in. Chichen Itza was fascinating, has to be done though a very long day. The night entertainment was what you'd expect ...good fun though. My husband really loved the house band, an excellent sound and a nice variation in playing styles.... brilliant trumpeter !!

CHECK-IN: We arrived around noon and were able to check-in right away. Like some of the other guests, we were booked to the Tucan side but were checked into the Quetzal side. When we complained they stated they had no rooms on the Tucan side and that there was nothing they could do (I also e-mailed the staff before we went several times requesting the Tucan side!) Although I was not pleased, we went ahead and checked into the room we were assigned (Bldg. 23). Very close to the pool and beach. THE ROOM: Very nice, spacious, and clean. A couple times we saw very tiny ants on the sink, but it was nothing too bothersome. The STAFF: Our maid was not always as timely as we would have liked (she came in the late afternoon some days), but she always left towel art and chocolates for us after she had our room in tip-top shape. There was even a fruit basket delivered to us an hour or two after we arrived. The bartenders and restaurant staff were very nice and accomodating, trying to meet our every request. THE BEACH: Wonderful!!! We thought it was clean and never did we have a problem getting chairs. RESTAURANTS: Very good food with plenty of variety! The buffet was always stocked and the food was hot. We ate at the Steak Restaurant and it was also good. PLAYA DEL CARMEN: Although we had been to Cancun, Playe Del Carmen was a welcome change from all the hustle and bustle of Cancun. We never had a problem getting the activities scheduled when we wanted them and they were never completely packed. If you haven't already, try the ATV Jungle Tour - it is so much fun!! Be prepared to get muddy though! 1 CRITISISM: There are no elevators in the buildings. After a long day at the beach we did not want to carry all of our stuff up several flights of stairs!

I felt very safe. I even left my camera in a cab and had it returned to me! Very friendly people. Now onto the resort. My REVIEW: Check-in- We checked in at the Quetzal on 9/3. I had requested adjoining rooms for us and our children and another room close by for my parents. The front desk manager was very friendly however gave us rooms across the hall which obviously would not work for a 1.5 year old and 4 year old. He put us in Bldg 22 which was a great location. My parents had a second floor room in the same Building which they loved. We were then informed that the only adjoining rooms at the Quetzal where in the building 27 and very far from the pool and beach. I was a bit disappointed since I had been e-mailing them my requests for close to the beach and adjoining and was never told those type of rooms did not exist. I think he sensed my frustration because he offered to move us to the Tucan Bldg 14 which was on the jungle side but more centrallly located. We moved there on our second day. The location was fine. 2 minutes from the pool and the restaurants. Grounds: Spectacular throughout the resort. The walkways at both properties interweaved and were beautiful. Very clean and lush! The jungle path was awesome especially at night when they lit up the caverns and crvices. Very cool! Waterfalls. tucans, flamingos, THe kids loved the animals. Even saw the monkeys. Thye==ey are only on teh Quetzal side. Pool/Beach area was a bit littered upon. They were constantly trying to keep up with it. THere were still those who \"saved\" chairs although it is not permitted NOR enforced unfortunately We still found chairs since it was not peak season . During peak season it would proably be much worse! The pool could use some resurfacing on the bottom. My kids feet were all torn up from it by the end of our trip. Activities were constantly happening outside and were entertaining. The night shows were fun and kid friendly. The Scuba demo in teh pool was a great plus. M<y husband sailed two days which was included. The windsurfing was only for those who have done it before. The instructor never showed up. The snorkeling trip was worth the $25.00. We saw better fish on it then on our catamaran sailing trip which was more than double the price. Children's Area could use some updating. The kids pool was just a small circle and was almost too hot to swim in. The jungle gym was for older kids so there really is not much there for a child under 4. Neighboring resorts had more kiddie water park areas with slides, etc. The food was great! I am not one for buffets, but it was always fresh and different every day. We loved the food and the service. We llooked forward to Breakfast every day. The sit downs were okay but not fantastic. We tried the Caribbean, Italian and Mexican of which we really only loved the Italian. I heard the Steak House was excellent , too but we never got there. It is kind of inconvenient to have to make your rervations in person between certain hours in the lobby. It would be easier if you could call them in. It was very hot everywhere there-over 100 every day. No breeze on the Tucan side since it is in a jungle. Our room was the only cool place to be had. As long as you stayed in the water you at least felt refreshed. However, the pool did get quite warm my mid day. Housekeeping: I do want to point out that on the Tucan side the housekeeping was only average. There was no towel art or great amenities. The floor always seeemed a bit dirty (sandy) THe refrigerators in our rooms were not working to weel so the drinks were never ice cold. We put in a repair request but it was never completed. OUr remote was broken also and never replaced. My parents who stayed on Quetzal side had towel art, candies on their pillows, etc. Much better there. The overall feel at the resort was very European. We were definitely the minority being from America. We enjoyed the different cultures and felt like we were even farther away from home. However the smoking was annoying to people like us who do not tolerate it well. People were smoking in all the restaurants, at the pool in the pool. It was a bit frustrating. One night our room even had to get sprayed because the smell of smoke from another room overtook our children's room. It was awful! The service was great everywhere. The bartenders, waiters and star friends were always so pleasent. Our 4 year old loved the kids camp. For some reason though they closed it every afternoon for 2 hours which could kind of put a damper on your day if you had child free plans mid afternoon. They did reopen by 4pm. I think it should be opened at night also for parents who want to go to teh shows or to Playa. They could just show movies and have pillows blankets, etc. I would pay extra for that service! We had a great time. The resort was for the most part was great. I do think it would be a bit overwhelming in season. There are so many chairs crowded onto the beach and pool area. I would probably try a different resort by Iberostar or another brand next time just for comparison sake. I would chose Quetzal side over Tucan. The location is great. Close to the ruins, attractions and Playa Del Carmen is just 1.5 miles away on a very nice road with a cobblestone walkway for bicycles and pedestrians.

Food absolutely awful I am a complete foodie and nothing appealed to me, the food was under heated lights obviously but as a result was overcooked and all in all awful. The al a carte is like no other al a carte that I've been too thank god, you have to go and get your starter! and the main course was well below average we only used 3 of the restaurants as we had given up the will to live at this stage. TRIPS chichen itza was fantastic but a long day and you only get to spend 3 hours actually at the place which was a shame, but well worth it. Do NOT book your trips with the reps go into Play de Carmen and there are loads of places to book trips with at half the price. We went with dolphin discovery to swim with the dolphins and we paid 179usd each as we swam with sting ray, manatee and then the dolphins. This was worth every single penny the Manatee were our favourite the dolphin area was large and they had quite a bit of freedom which we were pleased about. Xcaret DO NOT bother, the underground river was great but that was the only thing that was, animals were in small confined areas including the dolphins and the whole place was so man made and artificial.

Playa de Carmen was brilliant wander around and watch street entertainment, its very chic in areas yes some work is going on but it kept us sane. If you enjoy good food and wine go to a restaurant called the Glass bar, bliss perfect food and soooo much wine to choose from which is expensive but when you having been dying for a good glass of wine who cares it was well worth every penny. This hotel has the potential of being a five star but is seriously let down in the entertainment and food. By the way we are a well travelled couple in our mid 30's so we are no oldies.

Here is a recap: ROOM/HOTEL: We thought the rooms were very nice. I agree with other reviews that the best buildings are nearer the to beach, and I recommend the 2nd or 3rd floors for privacy. We were on the Quetzal side, one building from the beach (other reviewers didn't like Quetzal, but we couldn't tell the difference.) There was a wall of vegitation outside our balcony, and we faced the resort next door. Every night I thought it was a little loud at the other resort, and then I fell asleep immediately, so I guess it wasn't too loud. Yes, the bed was firm, but we were comfortable. If you tip the maids each day $1-2, then they give you more drinks in the bar, make the towels into animals and leave chocolate. This was a big hit with our 2 year old. Regardless, the maids keep the rooms very clean. We loved the grounds, with the animals all around in the jungle, and the winding stone walkways between buildings. If you want nothing but an air conditioned, hide in the hotel experience, this place isnt for you. The entire staff worked non-stop to make this hotel look spotless and were very helpful when we needed help. I read some postings that differed with this, but perhaps those folks had a different attitude towards the staff. We enjoyed attempting conversations in Spanish with the staff and learning a little about them. FOOD/DRINK: This buffet is as good or better then any buffet I have been to, including Las Vegas. I always thought I'd try something different for lunch but ended up eating the chicken asada, fresh tortillas, guacamole, and salsa. It was great. Like any buffet, you try a little of everything, figure out what you like, and go back for seconds. We ate all sorts of food and drank the water in the buffets with no ill effects. We ate at the Italian and Steakhouse and we agree with other reviewers that both were good. You need to make reservations in-person at the public relations desk, 2 reservations per 7 day visit. The drinks were great, maybe light on alcohol, but you can get a strong drink by asking. The Mohito was a big hit for my wife, and my daughter loved the ice cream at the bars. TOURS/ACTIVITIES: We didn't do any of the trips, since we never bored of lounging around, playing in the ocean with our daughter, and walking on the beach. We were surprised that the sand area was smaller than we had imagined, and could get a little crowded, but it didn't keep us from enjoying the day. We would reserve our lounge chairs each morning with our towels, and then go to breakfast, like most folks did. Since the clientele was from all over the world, there were some topless folks, but we didn't care. We did enjoy meeting folks from many different places. We went into Playa de Carmen one day in the evening ($4 for the 5 minute ride) to avoid the heat, which was a great tip from other postings. We enjoyed just looking around, doing a little shopping, and bartering. Stick to cooked food and bottled drinks in town and you should avoid any tummy problems. KIDS: Since we had our 2 year old daughter we didn't get too adventurous with our activities. She was too young for the daycare, and we enjoyed hanging out with her. At the Tucan, forget the stroller since the walkways are rough and uneven. We brought our backpack child carrier and it was perfect, not only for our walks on the beach and our trip into town, but travel through the airports was much easier. We had a babysitter for one evening so my wife and I could have a \"grown-up\" dinner at one of the restaurants. We setup the babysitter at the public relations desk, and the person they gave us was the hotel's operator at $10/hr.

Just make sure you stop by the reservation desk by one of the two times they are there a day. Make sure that you bring lots of sunblock because I sunburned my back after just 45 minutes of snorkeling. That is how potent the sun is down there. Make sure you visit on of the ruin offsites. You will regret it if you don't. You can take a short taxi ride to 5th street to shop or you can take a short five minute walk to some shops just up from the resort. Another amazing feature of this resort is there jungle on the resort. It is full of different animals and monkeys that will blow your mind and provide you with many photo opps. The beach is just great to full of palm trees and beautiful white sand. You can even see cozumel from the beach. From their you could also jet ski, para sail, snorkel and dive. Just make sure you stop by the desk. Bring down your own snorkel and they will lend you a mask and fins.

My wife and I just returned from 7 outstanding days there and it was everything that I hoped it would be. After a little issue with the room (they put us in double beds on our 5th anniversary, not good) they put us in a beautiful room overlooking the pink flamingo pool. From that moment on the trip went without a hitch. Food was excellent, staff was very friendly, and the grounds were superb. Hats off to the Lobby Bar and the bartenders there. Gaspar on the Quetzal side was great. If you are a diver be prepared to shell out some bucks for that. We booked a 6 tank package on arrival (buy 5 get 1 \"free\") and it was $600 US. I thought that was little high for inside the resort. Europeans really thought it was excessive. When we bought it we thought it included any dive that was on their chart but later found it was additional ($130) for Cenotes and ($180) for Cozumel. They send a videographer on each dive to sell the video to you @$80.00 for a 10 minute tape or $100 for a 2 tank -20 minute video. We wound up buying our Cenote video but I think they would sell a lot more if the prices were a bit lower. Dressel dive center certainly makes a healthy profit so you might want to shop around which we didn't do. (BTW_ nothing against the staff at Dressel, there were great. Just overpriced) 4 thumbs up from us. We WILL be going back as soon as possible.

Just come back from spending two weeeks at the Tucan and have had a excellent time. Rooms-Our room was close to the lobby which was handy and was v.nice and clean, we had kingsize bed-it was hard but comfortable and no problems sleeping. Weather-Everyday was hot and sunny except one day when it thundered and we had a bit of a rain storm but that didnt last long!! very humid all the time. Beach/Pool- Pool is very big and it is nice and warm which makes a change! Don't bring any beach towles-You're given towel cards when you arrive. Beach is just amazing, never had a problem finding a lounger and u can hire an umbrella from the pool hut for free. Food/Drink-There was quite a wide variety of food at the buffet but the problem we found was that it never changed and after two weeks eating the same thing it began to become bland and boring. We went to the Italian and Mexican Ala Cartes. Italian was very good and wished we'd booked it twice! Mexican was disappointing-not suitable for vegetarians as every dish contains meat. The entertainment in the Ala Cartes was very sweet as there are 3 little mexican men who sing to each table and play instruments. Cocktails were lovely especially the pina coladas and bahama mamas!!!! Staff-The staff were amazing and do anything to help you. They work very hard and if you have any problems, they're soon resolved. You can get your photo taken with the hotels Parrots and Iguana which can be quite funny, also the animals in the jungle are interesting, we didnt realise there were flamingos in the quetzal as we spent most of the time in the tucan but on our last day we walked through the quetzal and discovered them!! Excursions-We did the trip to Xel-Ha which we thought was great and did alot of snorkelling. We also did The Jungle Tour which is a must!! You get your own speed boat and drive full power across the ocean followed by more snokelling. Shopping-we got most of our souvenirs from Playacar and only went to 5th avenue once which is better to buy alcohol, corona beers etc. You can pay in dollars but you get change bk in pesos.

Let me first mention the positives - the food was very good. Better than I expected. The buffet was generally better than average with all kinds of food. The Thursday night included the biggest lobsters you've ever seen grilled. It was amazing and I'm wishing I'd had another right now! They have 4 ala cart restaurants to go to at night. The seafood house was not good - I wouldn't recommend it, but the steak house was fantastic. It had an amazing salad bar with incredible seafood salads, etc. and was really good. One recommendation - skip the desserts at the ala cart restaurants and go to the buffet restaurant for desert. Much better. Another recommendation about the rooms - make sure request a room in buildings 11 or 12. I saw this recommendation on one of the websites and I'm so glad we did it. It\u00b4s quite a walk from the front of the resort to the back, and 11 and 12 are right next to the beach and pools. The beach is beautiful and the pools have something for everyone. My only real complaint is that the bed was rock hard. And I mean rock hard - this is the hardest bed my husband I have ever slept on. It was like sleeping on a table shaped like a kind sized bed! I don\u00b4t know if all the beds were like this or if we just got lucky, but we were pretty stiff after that.

We had a great time. Good size rooms, a big walk in shower, plenty of hot water; firm beds, yes, but no problems sleeping. We were on the ground floor near the restaurants on the edge of the jungle. Enjoyed getting ready in the evening and then watching the exotic wildlife from the balcony \u2013 and I\u2019m not just talking about the Yanks! As recommended, a dollar or so tip got the mini bar replenished (although not always) and towels made into animal shapes etc. Good food throughout the stay. All the speciality restaurants were good, the Mexican and Italian the preferred choices. While you only get a couple of speciality restaurant allocations a week, we found that by going to the pyramid shaped kiosk in the reception area just after breakfast you could check if there were any unbooked seats in these restaurants, and 9 times out of 10 they could fit you in. So we ate in speciality restaurants at least 6 or 7 times in a fortnight. Didn\u2019t get poorly while we were there but I did have a tummy upset when I got back to the UK \u2013 but that might have been the overeating! The jungle walk to the pool was a daily highlight. Watched and filmed the monkeys one afternoon \u2013 lovely experience. Great pool, but you do need to claim your beds with a towel or risk sitting under a loudspeaker or in the shade if you don\u2019t. Beach is lovely white sand and water crystal clear. Thought the Star Friends were a hoot \u2013 so much energy, but not too much in your face \u2013 unless you\u2019re my wife who got dragged onto the stage one evening much to her annoyance \u2013 although she did win the Miss Iberostar Belly Dancing competition! Special mention for the hotel Doctor\u2019s \u2013 they were great \u2013 they have a surgery near the main reception \u2013 and sorted out my wife\u2019s ear infection (a common occurrence in tropical climes apparently). In terms of trips : we recommend the swim with dolphins \u2013 and do buy the video \u2013 we did - you\u2019ll regret it if not when you get back home. Xcaret is not far and worth a visit. Jungle tour \u2013 speedboat & snorkelling \u2013 with Blue Water Adventures was great fun.

Rooms- these were wonderful - all marble floors. The maid kept the room spotless and it was a lovely treat to see the towel art each night when we came back from a hard day round the pool! the shower was massive. Pool - it was asbsolutely huge and we never had any problems getting a sun bed. it was great to have a separate pool with a swim up bar and activities pool too. There were people always wandering around to get you a drink. beach- beautiful white sand and gorgeous warm waters. The sea was incredible in colour. we got kayaks a few times and went out to the sea and saw fish. Food - anyone who does not like the food is mad. I am a very fussy eater, but never found any thing not to eat. breakfast was amazing. It was great to see your omelette being cooked in front of you. The buffet was massive. there was always pizza, chips and burgers on plus so much choice of other things. One night was Mexican night, another chinese and another tropical but there was plenty if you didn't like these. You could even get free champagne all holiday long. the cocktails were great and if you wanted one that wasn't on the menu, it wasn't a problem. My only criticism was that the a la carte restaurants tended to get a thumbs down from people. the Mexican was pretty poor, but it didn't matter because we just left there and went to the buffet as did a few other couples. the steak in the steak house was amazing. Grounds - these were incredible. the hotel has monkeys, a tortoise, turtles, flamingoes, iguanas etc. etc. we never tired of looking for new animals. The hotel had marble floors on the Tucan side and wood on the Quetzal side. it was great, because although I thought it was two separate hotels, it wasn't really and you used them both. we ended up staying in a room on the quetzal side and contrary to popular belief they are no different apart from a different duvet. the staff worked so hard and always had a smile on their faces. we were amazed at how clean the hotel was - they even had a man polishing leaves in the recpetion area. We only got back yesterday and are tired but it was the most amazing experience ever.

We were originally staying at the Occidental Grand Flamenco Xcaret, who overbooked for our last three days, and offered us the option of spending our remaining three days at the Iberostar Tucan in Playa. After a less-than-what-we-expected experience at the Grand Xcaret, we were more than happy to move. Upon arrival, we were absolutely astounded by the beauty of the Tucan. The lush jungle and open, airy lobby areas were absolutely beautiful and romantic. The grounds at the Tucan are beautiful, and offer the opportunity to see a ton of native animals roaming about. Our room was immaculate, spacious and very comfortable. The pools are fabulous as well, although this is definitely a family friendly place, and there were a lot of children and teens running and splashing around the pool. The water in the pool was almost too warm to be refreshing as well- probably about 85 degrees. Since we were only staying a few days, we didn't get a chance to eat at any of the restaurants as they did not have reservations available. This was not a big deal however, as the food at the buffets is amazing. There was a huge variety, and the quality was exceptional for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The beach is typical Playa - you can't really go wrong there. Water was amazing, and the beach goes on for miles. After dinner, the entertainment was OK - I think it was better at the Xcaret. The shows were a good diversion while you digest your dinner. The nightclub (on the Quetzal side) was OK as well, although it was sort of disturbing that they allowed kids (under 18 - we're talking families bringing their 5 and 6 year olds in there) in the disco.

First the good things: The resort is very pretty and the jungle adds a great atmosphere. We saw Monkeys on almost every day. The staff are very friendly, especially the maids, waitstaff and bartenders. We tipped a lot and it just adds to the service. The rooms were spacious and clean and the beach is nice. We only used the pool once as it was warm and I prefer the beach anyway. We did one trip, a combination to Tolum and Xel-Ha and it was amazing, we had better food at Xel-Hal than at the resort. In addition the different groups of people are intersting. Between the limited language it is nice to speak to Italians, Mexicans and French. Make the effort and don't spread the idea that all Americans are ugly tourists. The negative: We booked the Tucan and they tried to put us on the other side, the Quextal. I read this happens and spoke to our travel agent before we left and she told us to call if they try this. This resort is attached to the Tucan but it is not the same, there are a few nuances which make the Tucan better. When you arrive, after about a 45 min bus ride you just go to check in and they didn't say sorry we had to move you. It was only when I complained and asked to use the phone did they \"miracleously\" find us a room. The check in staff were NOT friendly or accomodating although we booked a year in advance. Then we had to find our own room, no escort. Of course I had requested a second or third floor and they don't make any guarantees so they gave first floor but we moved a day later. However, the ocean view is a joke, it is a partial ocean view. We honeymooned in Sandals and they are full ocean view. For the money you spend they should tell you this. In addition I was soooo annoyed at the rudeness of the staff and the fact it took 45 mins of discussion to get the side I wanted and booked that I asked to speak to the manager. She came out after much wait and was pretty much like \" i don't know why you're upset you got what you wanted\"!!! I expect to be treated better for the money we spent. In addition, she told me the Tucan side was over booked, but that's not my problem as we booked August 2003. However it was eventually sorted out but they did not make you feel like your money or business was even a big deal. The other negative is the food. We ate at the Italian and Steakhouse and they were both very good. I emailed the resort before we left for our reservations and that was no problem, they had them waiting when we arrived. My husband even got sick one night (too much Tequila) and they managed to switch us last minute. However the buffets are bland and boring. If you are expecting authentic Mexican food don't but if you like a lot of generic food such a french fries and pizza this is perfect for you. Again we went to Sandals and their buffets were great. Also, the pool closes at 7pm. I know this sounds late but it is still hot and many times I wanted to swim at night but you couldn't. It would be great if you could. At Sandals Montego Bay the pool bar, which is much bigger, was open all night, as were the jucuzzis (sp??) etc... The last negative is those insane chair hoggers. Come on, it's vacation, if you have to get up at 6am to save a chair you need a life!! And I saw plently of people do this, luckily we were up early and at the beach by 8-9am so we got seats. But many people saved chairs ALL day and were not there most of the time, it's just rude. Also, the beach is not very big, again depends on what you are used to, so it was hard to get privacy. Overall I would agree with other posters. We had a great vacation because we made it great. This is NOT a 5 star resort and if I were honeymooning I would be dissapointed here. We spoke to one couple who were told they had to go to another resort because it was overbooked and it was there honeymoon. Another person said they went to the other resort, not an Iberostar, as they were told they were transfered there and they did not have a room for them so they had to come back to the Tucan and they found a room. This is not professional. I would probably not go back because I like to be taken care off, and I'm afraid once you go to a really nice resort it is hard to go to a good one. If we had not travelled to other places I think this is fine but now we had stuff to compare it too it is just not excellent.", "Date": "August 11, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "S.

The last week in June found our family of four on the way to the Mayan Riviera on Mexico\u2019s Yucatan peninsula. We stayed at the Iberostar Tucan and were very pleased with the trip as well as the resort. Rooms are clean and pleasant. Yes, the beds are hard, but you get used to that quickly. Room safe is a nice feature; you set your own combination so remember it! Bring a travel alarm clock if you need one as they don\u2019t have clocks in the rooms. Shower is large. Room fridge was restocked daily and they have gallon bottles of water as well as smaller bottles. Best bungalows are nearer the beach; buildings 11-13. There was a septic odor near 14 and 15 and higher numbers have the \u201cjungle view\u201d but they also have the roosters that wake you up at 6 or 7 in the morning and they are further from the pools and beach. Lots of wildlife there! The food at the main buffet restaurant was varied and excellent. Many of the breakfast items, cold items, and salads were daily constants, but most of the hot dishes and desserts changed daily. Each night they have a different theme and so, a different main dish. There are, however, TONS of other tasty dishes. I ate like a pig and couldn\u2019t manage to try everything! I didn\u2019t find the specialty restaurants all that exciting, but the food is still good. You can make reservations for the specialty restaurants the day you get there for the whole week. We thought you could only make them the day you wanted to eat there, so we lost out on the steakhouse (which seems to be the most popular one). The main pool goes on forever and is very relaxing. Lots of people bought floats in the gift shop (about $13 US), so if you can pack one, do, or bring a permanent marker to label yours as the ones from the gift shop all look alike and a young girl started to take off with ours one day. We didn\u2019t really bother with the sports pool or swim up bar, but some people do. The resort has activities all day long and they change every 30 minutes. If you\u2019re bored, that\u2019s your fault! The beach was great as well. Both the pool and the beach have plenty of lounge chairs, some in the sun and some in the shade. They start to fill up around 9 or so. Most people seem to be late sleepers. I get up early so I would walk up to the buffet and get some coffee in my travel mug (they also have 8 oz styrofoam cups). Then I would stake out our spot under the palapas by the pool and sip my coffee and read for a while until the rest of my family got up. The solitude was great and by 7:30 it\u2019s already getting hot! They water the grass and grounds every night. One morning I got up early for one of our excursions and thought it was raining out and went back for my umbrella, but it just turned out to be the sprinklers watering the grass! Different ones of us took side trips with TNT to Chichen Itza, Tulum, Xel-Ha, and the ATV jungle ride and enjoyed them all. We wished we had skipped the tube ride down the river at Xel-Ha and spent more time snorkeling instead. Chichen Itza is long and hot, but well worth it. The van was air conditioned, so that was ok, but when you get there, there\u2019s a lot of walking in the sun. Make sure to climb the pyramid; just hold the rope on your way down! The wait staff bust their butts and are very grateful to have the jobs they have. Some speak good English and others not so much, but they only get paid $200 a month and are very grateful for tips! They deserve it! They are very friendly and nice, too. Souvenirs \u2013 check the hotel gift shop first. They actually have better prices than Playacar Plaza (5 minute walk) or Playa del Carmen ($4 taxi ride), although they lack an abundance of things to choose from.

Just returned today (2004-8-8) from a 2-week stay. Mayan adventure: from childhood, I have been intrigued with (ancient and) Central American (a.o. Mayan) civilizations. Being able to stay in a hotel with a \"Mayan theme\", and in addition getting to experience the Yucatan peninsula first hand was a dream come true. We simply loved the excursions to Tulum, Coba, Chitzen... Also Xcaret is IMHO a MUST. In addition, a boat trip to 'Isla Contoy' is worth your time as well. One thing that bothered us some: prices for those trips were not cheap. Hotel atmosphere: as many before have stated: the Tucan/Quetzal combo is simply superb. Aliens/guest horror stories: unfortunately(?) am not able to report a sighting of any kind. All people of all nations and races where no problem to us at all. BTW. one of the reasons we, as a family, travel abroad is to get to know people. We talked to Americans, Brits, Dutch people, Austrian ... and of course Mexicans (staff, star friends...). Food: loved it, none of us got sick. Beach: very good. We did not participate in the 'towel game'. It was no real problem to us, since the hotels did not seem fully booked. Hotel classification: having frequented quite some 5* hotels in all corners of the world, I have a minor problem with actually categorizing the Tucan as such. Everything is there, but e.g. the rooms are not of the highest standard. Playa del Carmen: A 'town under construction'. Sorry to say, but that was a true letdown. Luckily, all other things made up for this one misfortune.", "Date": "August 8, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Silver Spring, MD", "Title": "\u201cUnreal\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2421977", "Content": "My family and I along with 5 other families visited the Tucan from July 27th to August 3rd. The time we had is almost hard to put in words. I am 18, but we traveled with people of all ages. From a person my age's perspecitve, this resort was perfect. The beach was beautiful, the pool was huge, there was a bar every where you turned. It was an american college student's dream. The dj at the disco was pretty bad, but he would have his good runs. I am going to say this now, because nobody knew this while we were there. The disco BLOWS UP at 11. So don't go in before 11 and think that it is a bust, because it isn't. I had the time of my life and I am trying to get my parents to go again, which I am sure will not be too much of a problem. From a parents' standpoint, this place is perfect as well. My parents especially enjoyed the fact that there was just no agenda, except for on a la carte nights of course. Also, you had to get into the buffett before 10, but that wasn't much of a problem after a day on the beach. With so much to keep the kids preoccupied, all of the parents in our group were totally relaxed. Miscellaneous: The shows are fair, most are pretty cheesy, but there is a bar there and its something to do while waiting for the disco. As far as all of these reviews saying that the europeans are nasty and impolite, I have no idea what they are talking about. I encountered not one impolite european. We made good friends with the dutch. If anybody was there when we were and you heard singing coming from the swim-up bar, that was our group and the dutch having a singing comp. The mexican a la carte is awful, don't go. Steakhouse was excellent surprisingly. As all have said, leave tips for everyone. Good bartenders: Luis, daytime beach bar. Victor, afternoon beach bar. Some other guy, I never got his name, but he is at the show bar every night and he makes a wicked white russian. I feel as though I have said too much.

We just got back, and had a blast. The resort was incredible - it had everything, the place was immaculate, and the service was incredible. Everyone there worked extremely hard. Since it's an all inclusive place, most people don't tip at all, but I can tell you that a couple bucks go a long way. We tipped the maid every day and got tons of drinks and a very clean room. At the show, we tipped the waitress a couple bucks at the onset, and she came back to check on us every 5 minutes. One thing I was really suprised about here was the food - I never thought it would be as good as it was. The selection at the buffet was very good. Every day they had the basics, but they ALWAYS had different things too, which including people making it right in front of you. The variety was nice because you didn't get sick of eating there. The restaurants were very good. The filet at the steakhouse was among the best I've eaten, and the Mexican restaurant was fresh and delicious. The one drawback, is that the buffet is not air conditioned. It didn't bother me most nights, but when I'm in the 95 degree heat all day, the last thing I want to do is eat while I sweat. Take advantage of the shopping center a five minute walk away. They had a lot of cute crafts and a drug store which was helpful. When you shop with vendors, always bargain. My wife and I got a beautiful handmade hammock for $20! Here it would cost $100 easily. As for the trips - Chichen Itza was incredible. The architecture was impressive, but make sure you go with a tour guide who knows what they're talking about, preferably a Mayan. We did, and it was a big advantage. Climbing to the top of Kukulkan's pyramid, was steep, but you have to do it. We did the Mayan adventure snorkeling trip which overall was good. Snorkeling in the cave was a very cool experience. The impressive thing about both those tours is that the lunches were very good. It was a well thought out lunch at a restaurant, with terrific Mexican fare. I expected to get a taco and a smile, but it was very good. We booked the tours thru apple, which I would recomend. Overall, you can't beat this trip for the money. It's beautiful, the food is good, and there is tons to do on and off the resort. Be warned, in the summer, it is HOT!

Travelers: me (43), my husband (45), son (19), daughter (15) and mother (68). This vacation was by far one of the best we've ever taken. We've been to many places in the Carribean and the Tucan was far superior. In a nutshell: We all enjoyed every minute of our stay. The weather was perfect, the pool/beaches were great and the staff was wonderful. Go and have and wonderful time! For those of you who like details! Airport: A far cry from when we were there 2 years ago. The airport has been totally redone and was air-conditioned, modern and efficient. We traveled through Liberty Travel and were met by their affiliate, Olympus Tours. We traveled by a large, air-conditioned bus to the resort which was about 45 minutes from the airport. Our guide, Gustavo, provided a lot of information about the resort and surrounding area as well as the excursions. He was very informative and answered everyone's questions with a smile. I would highly recommend both Liberty Travel and Olympus Tours. Check In: We arrived at about 12:00 noon. There were no lines and the staff very quickly checked us in as our rooms were ready. I had emailed the hotel about a week before our arrival and requested two rooms in Buildings 11, 12 or 13 to be closer to the pools/beach. We were initially given rooms 1347 and 1349. However, when we got to the room, it reeked of cigarette smoke. We returned to the front desk and they quickly assigned us rooms in the only non-smoking building, #15. A bellman took all of our bags immediately to our new rooms. Rooms: Both rooms were immaculate and cool when we arrived. Both the room and bathroom were done entirely in marble. We had one room with a king bed and one room with two doubles. Yes, the beds are very firm but my husband and I loved them. We both agreed that we had never slept in beds so comfortable in a hotel. The bathroom was very large with a nice sink area and a large (big enough for 2) shower area. Rooms were cleaned every day quite early so you always had clean towels available. Pools: The main pool is 32,000 sq. ft. and looks absolutely huge. Even though the hotel was booked, the pool never seemed crowed. Although we didn't head down to the pool until about 10:30 a.m. daily, we never had a problem finding a few chairs in the shade. We took the advice of some of the other reviewers and brought 2 floats from home. A lot of other guests did this too. I highly recommend doing this. We used them constantly. The main pool is extremely warm (about (90 degrees) and a bit deep in most spots (about 5 ft) which can be problem if you hover close to the 5 ft. mark! There is also a large rectangular sports pool that was also very warm. This pool was exclusively for water polo (our favorite), water volleyball and water basketball. And of course, the ever popular adult pool with a swim-up bar. This pool was about 10 degrees cooler than the other pools and very refreshing. There was also a nice-sized baby pool for the little ones. I found all of the pools to be extremely clean for the amount of people who swam in them daily. There is a sign posted that the pool closed each evening at 7 p.m. for chemical treatments. Beach: It never fails to amaze me how beautiful the color of the ocean water is in Mexico. It is the most perfect aqua blue-green I have ever seen. The water is crystal clear. The waves were really high for a couple of the days and the rest of the time the sea was very calm. There were always plenty of chaises available but the ones closest to the water always filled up first. The water is cooler than in the pools (about 82 degrees). The beach was very clean with the exception of some cups that some of the guests would leave behind. The hotel had an employee come around periodically to pick these up. There were a few women who went topless on the beach but they were definitely in the minority. There were only a few here and there. Food: We all found the food to be the best we've ever had at an all-inclusive. There were 2 buffets that served all types of food for both breakfast and dinner. For breakfast, there was eggs, bacon, sausage, hash browns, potatoes, waffles, pancakes, omelets, fresh fruit, cereal, etc. There was even a fresh donut station every other day where someone actually stood there and made fresh donuts for you. They were great. For dinner, there was always a traditional Mexican food station and then stations with many different types of other food. There was always a selection of fish, chicken, beef, vegetables, breads, side dishes, fries, pizza, etc. Everyone else is right - if you can't find something you like at the buffet, there is something seriously wrong! There are 4 specialty restaurants on the property that you need reservations for. They are the Tropical, Italian, Mexican and a Steakhouse. We tried the Italian and the Steakhouse. Both served great food and had excellent service. The Mexican and the Italian restaurants were air-conditioned and the Steakhouse and the Tropical were not. For lunch there were two pool/beach grills that served a nice variety of food from fish, beef pork, sandwiches, pizza, pasta, etc. There was even a charcoal grill going all day grilling hamburgers and hot dogs! Bars: There was a bar everywhere you looked. One on the beach, one in each pool grill, one in each lobby and one in the entertainment area. You never had to go very far. Some of the bars also served ice creams cones all day. They were great. We thought the drinks were great and the bartenders would make anything you wanted, any way you wanted. Entertainment: The Star Friends seemed to do a very good job keeping the little ones happy so that their parents could enjoy the resort. The Star Friends seemed to be everywhere from morning till late at night. We would see them down by the pool in the morning, doing activities all day and then we would see the same people in the shows at night. The nightly shows were pretty good. They usually consisted of a children's show at 8:00, a guest participation show at 9:00 and a Star Friends show was around 9:45. The shows were usually over by 11:00 and then people would head over to the disco. Some of the shows were better than others. Our favorite was the Aladdin Show. They put their own spin on it and it was very well done. Boy, I could watch Angelo dance all night! Excursions: We went to Xcaret one day. It was very nice. My husband and son did the underground river and said it was spectacular. The water in the river was a little cold for the rest of us (about 60 degrees) so we skipped it. There were two beaches, an aquarium, a scenic tower, etc. There is too much for me to even mention. They had swimming with the dolphins and that looked great. The next time I am in Mexico, I will definitely do this! I would book your dolphin reservation via internet well in advance of your trip. They get booked up very quickly everywhere (not only Xcaret). I booked the entire day at Xcaret over the internet and it worked out well. We chose the option with lunch. There are three restaurants on the property and the lunch was excellent. My daughter and I para-sailed off the beach at the Tucan. It was amazing. It was only $70 for 2 people ($40 for 1 person). We all did the banana boat rides on the beach ($8.00 a person). They would go as fast or slow as you wanted and make the ride as smooth or as bumpy as you like. We kept giving the driver a thumbs up and he took us on a fast, bumpy ride. We ventured into Playa del Carmen one morning ($4.00 cab ride each way - 5 minutes to town) to the Fifth Avenue main shopping area. Big mistake! It must have been 100 degrees and we literally felt like we were melting. We left around noon. We did find out while we were there that all of the shops were open to 11 or 12 o'clock every night so we ventured back after sundown and the difference in temperature was significant. It was actually very comfortable walking around. You can bargain with most of the vendors. When you ask how much something is, they always tell you a price that is more than twice what they really want. We always were able to bargain them down to less than half of their original price. My husband played golf at The Playacar Golf course which was a short 15 minute walk (or 2 minute cab ride) from the resort. He played first thing in the morning. While it was on the expensive side, he said it was well worth it. The course was spectacular and the holes were all unique. Your green fee ($160.00) covers all the food and drink on the course, as well as a full lunch in the clubhouse at the end of your round. He rented clubs ($33.00) so he would not have to drag his clubs around Mexico. On the recommendation of one of the other Tucan guests, we tried a restaurant in town our last night. It was called The Blue Lobster and it was great. We had three lobster dinners, three lobster bisque soups and soft drinks for under $90 dollars including tip. Their medium sized lobsters were only $22 a piece - try to find that in the States! If you are interested in going, it is located at the intersection of 5th Avenue and 12th Avenue on 12th. Finally, this was a great vacation and I would go back to the Tucan in a heartbeat. Do keep in mind that this is a European hotel chain and that there are many, many smokers there. I absolutely hate cigarette smoke (yes, I'm an ex-smoker!) but I was honestly bothered by it very little. There are many guests here from all over the world. You hear English being spoken very little. We heard German, Italian, Dutch, French and of course, Spanish. Most people were very nice and courteous. I will not be like some of the reviewers and bash any particular country for their rudeness. There are both nice and rude people everywhere and that includes the U.S. Judge people for themselves and not the continent they are from. A smile goes a long way. Relax and have fun!

The previous reviews are spot on. Rather than say the same stuff everyone else has i'll just give a few ideas. Try walking the full length of the beach into Play del Carmen just to be diferent, its a lovely walk and you can dip off in the ocean as you go. Go out at least once visit at night into the town, just for the atmosphere!!! It makes a change from the hotel. Ask for champagne at the bar for something different and there own version of Baileys is delicious. (big measures YUMMY). Swam with the dolphins in the ocean at Wet n Wild water which also incudes your admission and you can spend the rest of the day going down flumes and rides. Gives you a full day out. Dolphin swim was great, lots of contact and tricks. Do tip the hotel staff if you can. The service they provide is unbelivable. Just a few dolars here and there makes all the difference to them. The bar staff will spend time with you, learing your patter, telling you theirs, doing tricks, making paper roses etc. They will recognise you ater just one meeting!!!!! Maids clean your room daily and leave you towel animals and chocolates on your bed. Definately worth a dollar here and there. Overall just realx and enjoy. Although this hotel is at it's maximum capacity just now, its never crowded, sometimes walking through the lobby you feel like there is hardly anyone there. There is always plenty of room in the swimming pool because of it's immense size and no problem getting a lounger here , even at 9am there is plenty to choose from.

Use the bottled water Eat yogurt one week everyday before you go to Mexico. I never got sick. Watch what you mix in terms of foods. They use alot of limes in their cooking as well as mixing alot of diff sauces, etc at the buffett. You would get stomach sickness if you mixed 20 different things at home as well as all those sugary type drinks like COCOLOCO, STRAWBERRY AND BANANA DAIQUIRI'S, RUM RUNNERS, PINK LADYS, DIRTY MONKEYS, BLUE HAWAAINS, PINA COLODAS AND so on.

I arrived on vacation with a very severe sinus infection necessitating a visit to the doctor. If this happens to you skip the hotel doctor and take a cab downtown to Dr. Mario? ( Medico on 10 th avenue) The doctor was very thoro and profess. The cost was $50 for the appt and $ 55 for an antibiotic and an antiinflammatory that fixed me up in a day and saved my vacation with a 103 plus fever The evening shows for our week very weak and corny. More like games and singing by people in the audience embarrasssing themselves on stage etc . The kids program at 8 pm for an hour was nice for the kids but the adult entert was bad. No plays or shows except for an international dance show our last day which was good. Mostly goofy stupid type stuff. If you want to see bands, etc go into town and skip the nights at the hotel when there is nothing listed like a play or show as they post a schedule a week in advance. If you like corny games and audience participation type stuff then you may like to stay and watch This continues to about 11pm. The disco is open until 330am but is mostly loud rap and techno and kids under 16 yrs old The town is worth seeing and definitely get your kids hair braided and your massages there at half price to the hotel. shopping is a little chaotiic and carpet bagger stuff and everything for sale is basically half of what they orginally tell you including the silver and hairbraiding. Most of the other stuff is kids choker bead necklaces and junky type stuff. Good buys on liquor and chess sets. It is a nice diversion from the resort scene a few nights.

I was gasping for a smoke (dirty habit I know but so what) and asked the driver how long we would be, he could see the packet and pointed in front of the bus and said OK no problem. After the two ciggies I got back on the bus and our rep got on and with a big smile she introduced herself as Annie (She kept that smile for two weeks and was the best rep we have ever had) she issued our welcome pack and we had the wristbands and towel cards from the hotel and also the sheet you get when booking in so all this was done on the bus so as to save time when you reached the hotel. Drinks were available from the bus driver\u2019s mate ($2) during the 45 minute trip. The hotel was first class a real 5* the food was the same, all the staff were pleasant and had a smile for everyone, anything we had a problem with (and that was not very much) they sorted out even the room that they gave us first. It was on the ground floor, which I had requested not to have but in our notes someone had said we wanted a ground floor room. We were moved to a first floor room overlooking the Monkeys, which was good, but they seemed to make a bit of noise when we were trying to have a nap late afternoon. We have been on a few All-inclusive holidays in the Caribbean before and this was one of the best. People say you have to get up early to get a lounger on the beach and around the pool but we were out by 8.30 to 9.00 each morning and had no trouble at all, if you stayed in bed till 11.00 then perhaps you would have. The pool was big and the beach was good and plenty of day time entertainment (if you wanted it) I can say that for two late 40\u2019s people we had a great holiday all round, (here it comes) about the only problem we had was the Americans, they thought that they should be treated like Gods and be first in everything, they pushed in when there was a queue, they treated the Mexicans as second class citizens and they tried to take over everywhere, now this is not just me taking but ALL the Brits we spoke to where of the same opinion, having said that there was some polite Americans but they were few and far between. So in our opinion this holiday was one of the best and if you can put up with the Americans then it would be very worthwhile taking a trip to the Tucan", "Date": "July 12, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta", "Title": "\u201cIberostar Tucan,Its Wild\u201d", "Author": "travelcr-7", "ReviewID": "UR2268251", "Content": "Iberostar Tucan,Its wild with Pink Flamingos,Iguanas,wild monkeys and lots of . birds.making all kind of noises.Our daughters age 9 and 11 loved that part!

The beach was gorgeous as was the pool. We actually spent more time in the pool bar because the large pool was so warm! Drinks flowed freely and the bartenders were very generous with the liquor. They often topped off the drinks with an extra shot without you even asking them to! Top shelf liquors are on the lower shelves but they are happy to serve them to you if requested. Food was average, typical of an all-inclusive. My husband and I were both able to find something we liked at all times. Awesome pico de gallo at all the meals! Watch how your meat is cooked- it tended to be VERY rare and we often had to ask them to throw it back on just a little longer (e.g. hamburgers at palapa, tuna at Tropical restaurant and steak at steakhouse). Rooms were nice and as reviewed several times before, beds were hard but you're so tired it doesn't matter! We were able to see the monkeys twice. A baby one even climbed onto our balcony and sat on the rail to let us take it's picture! The staff works extremely hard at all times and make it their priority to do what it takes to keep you happy. The grounds were always well kept. For excursions, we did the Mayan Adventure, Chichen Itza, and the bar crawl. We enjoyed each of them. Chichen Itza is a long trip but if you like learning about culture and history, it is well worth it. make sure you do the Chichen Itza plus so you get beverages for free- it's HOT!

We have been on many all inclusive holidays in the caribbean and no where comes close to this place! The hotel itself is amazing, split into two sides, the Tucan and the Quetzal. The grounds are like a jungle with tropical birds, iguanas, monkeys etc. The whole hotel is decked with marble floors and thatched roofs and it is spotless throughout. The rooms are huge with big bathrooms and nice furniture, if you can get a beachfront or poolside room them do it because the views are amazing. The beach is by far the best I have seen and the pool is a huge lagoon with jacuzzi, fountains and a separate adults only swim up bar pool. You get waiter service by the pool and on the beach so you dont even have to move to get a drink! The food is great, loads of choice in the buffet with show cooking every night and as many fajitas as you can eat! Again, excellent waiter service. The A La Carte restaurants are great with a good choice on the menus, there are four A La Cartes in total and we thought that the steakhouse was the best. The bars are well stocked with premium brand drinks and a full menu of cocktails. Watch out for the tequila though because it is lethal, the Mexicans drink it like water so they like to watch us Brits choke when we try to down shots of the stuff! The entertainment team are excellent with a full programme of events through the day and great live shows at night, the best entertainment we have ever had. In Playacar/Cancun there are lots of trips to do, I would recommend swimming with the Dolphins, speedboats at Cancun and Xcaret which is a big ecological park with everything from dolphins to exotic plants and butterflys. Playacar town is four dollors away in a taxi and has lots of shops bars and restaurants, even a MacDonalds for those who are craving a taste of home! From the town you can get a ferry to the Island of Cozumel which is also worth a visit. Senor Frogs is a great party bar where they serve cocktails in yard glasses, most tour operators offer a night out there. All in all this was the best hotel and the best resort I have stayed in so far. The staff in the hotel love the Brits and they appreciate the odd tip for good sevice, although tips are not expected you cant help but give them a little extra. The only negative point I can think of is the airport at Cancun. To warn you, they check all luggage by hand, yes by hand, no x-ray machines! This is done on the way in and on the way out so it can delay you a bit at the airport. The immigration is very slow and queues are likely. Dont be put of by this though, only a minor point but I had to write something negative! If you stay at this hotel you will not be dissapointed, great location, great food, great staff. The weather is fab and you will get the best tan! After seeing Cancun we were so glad we stayed in Playcar, to sum up Cancun in two words - Concrete City.

This is by far, the most beautiful resort I have seen, we were in building 1300, a short walk to the pool and beach, and a terrific view of the monkeys every morning, around 8:00am. Beware, the monkeys are VERY loud, and did wake us up, every morning but two, however we did not mind, as we loved watching them in the trees, and my kids thought it was terrific. The resort is full of animals, and you can see many by walking the pathways through the jungle, very pretty. If your not an animal lover, and don't care for the wildlife, this is not the resort for you, as there are numerous animals, and you will see and hear them daily. We actually loved the resort, a very relaxing atmosphere, and a true joy to watch the animals in their habitat. We stayed for 7 days, and got to eat at 2 al carte restaurants, the Italian, and the Mexican, both of which were excellent. A word of advice, make your reservations for the ala carte restaurants, right after you check in, as they book up fast, especially the steak house, which I heard was fabulous. The employees work extremely hard, they are always trimming trees, raking leaves, and mowing grass, and we found all of them to be very courteous. Please go see the shows in the evening, they are great, and they employees work hard on these shows, our kids really enjoyed the shows as well. The first 45 minutes of the show is geared towards the kids, and they have a blast dancing. Maracrus, Kelsi, and Linda who work the children's program are fantastic with the children, and do their very best to keep them busy and entertained. My kids did go to the kids club a few times, and really enjoyed it. I could go on and on, this was truely a vacation of a lifetime, that none of us will forget.

We had a wonderful time despite the fact that it rained (like a monsoon) for 4/7 days (there was a tropical depression in the area, which was unusual for the time of year, according to hotel employees.) The hotel and grounds are beautiful and impeccably maintained. We really enjoyed the chickens, peacocks, guinea fowl and monkeys roaming the resort grounds. My son still talks about the \"kee-cocks\" daily and tries to make the sound the peacocks make (kind of like a cat meowing). We were in building 15, which is pretty centrally located--quite close to both the pools AND the restaurants (which was very important during those days it monsooned!) The rooms are decent size and are very clean and the mini-bar was always well-stocked. My only complaint about the room was, as previously reported by other reviewers, that the beds are HARD. I like a firm mattress, but these beds are almost concrete-firm. My husband and I jokingly referred to them as \"Fred Flintstone\" or \"prison\" mattresses. We had a plumbing issue in our room, but it was rectified very quickly, to the hotel's credit. The food was excellent! There was always something for everyone--even my picky 6 year old was always satisfied with something she liked to eat on the buffet. My kids REALLY loved that they could go to the pool bars and order an ice cream cone whenever they liked. That was a nice touch! We had no problem getting \"our spot\" every day--my husband went down to the pool with our pool toys, etc. at about 7:00am every morning and we always got the same spot--under the largest palapa, right between the Massage palapa and the pool bar, right in front of the zero depth pool area. This was the PERFECT spot for families with young children, we found. Perhaps our favorite thing about the resort was the service. We received excellent, friendly \"service with a smile\" from every employee we encountered.

We were in building 11 and would recommend it because it was so close to the beach and pool. We even had an ocean view, very, very nice. It was a walk to the lobby and food area but what a nice walk through the jungle. They even barbaque everyday lunch right on the beach which is great. The food was great. Lots of fruit and fish which we love. Thursday night is lobster night and was it great. The drinks where also great and actually some of mine where alittle too strong. We brought my daughter 13 and her friend 12 and they had so much fun. So much to do right at the hotel you really don't even need to leave. The town Playa del Carmen is very nice and only $4 taxi ride. But watch out for people trying to sell you time shares in town, very annoying. Our kids did the para-sailing right at our hotel and loved it. Also the banana boat was a blast, a must do for only $9 a person!

This was my second time to Cancun/Playa del Carmen (stayed @ Moon Palace without the kids in 2001) and I'll say that overall the Tucan was better. The pool and the beach where much better, in fact from talking with people who stayed further south by Tulum(beaches were rocky)as well as Moon Palace beach which had to much seaweed to even go in, the beaches here are just about perfect not to rough but still some waves to jump into. The pool was also nice, never really crowded but make sure you reserve you spots early, my wife got up at 0530(once) to get a padded cabanna for our daughter. The food was always good, we ate at the Italian and the Steakhouse(they were both excellent) but you only get 1 ala carte visit for each 3 nights you stay. It would be nice if you could get more ala carte visits because they are definitely better than the buffets. Something we did a couple of times was order room service for lunch it was really good and probably better than the buffets by the pool. The room service salads have been given my daughters seal of approval. Something not talked about much here(I know its a hotel review) are the tours. Would you go to Egypt and not visit the pyramids? Well don't come here and not go to Chitzen Itza, it is a great place. The tour was through Apple(Amstar) and costs about $78/person. One really cool part was after lunch was you can swim in a cenote(sunken well) this was not in my tour last time(2001). Another tour was Tulum/XelHa, Tulum is great but not near Chitzen in terms of size or structures. XelHa is a ecopark where my whole family snorkeled (with fishes) for the first time. XelHa was great and you could probably spend a whole day there not just the 4 and 1/2 hours you get in the tour. I would recommend comparing tours, there are many different tour companies Amstar, Iberstar,etc. reps have desks right in the hotel lobby so talk to them. I would say Chitzen Itza is a must see and XelHa or Xcaret (ecoparks) might be better for a whole day type of tour. Some other tips are get a layout of the hotel (we printed one off the net) and decide if you want to be closer to the beach/pool or the lobby. Also be aware the rooms have 3 floors. We emailed ahead requesting a room in bldg. 11 and got room 1101, first floor, super close to the pool and the beach. I would recommend seeing the shows each night, they are entertaining but about what you would expect (this is not Vegas). One thing talked about here are Europeans attitudes towards Americans, I would say this is false but then again maybe we were just to busy having fun to notice.

The mini frig is stocked with water, sodas and beer. We asked for extra bottled water and had plenty each day. The bed is very firm....but i had no problem getting to sleep each night. Most of the workers at the hotel spoke english and were the nicest people I ever met! They are very hard workers and always have a smile.

I'm a very picky eater but found plenty to eat! They had hotdogs, hamburgers, pork, tacos, potatoes, salad, Itilian dishes, soup, fruit, desserts and plenty more each day! Breakfast foods included everything from pancakes, eggs, waffles, fruit, donuts, cereal, etc....something for everyone! Ate at the Itilian restaurant and the food was great and was a nice romantic atmosphere. The pool was the largest I've ever seen and soooo beautiful!!!! We never had a problem getting 2 chairs by the pool or by the beach at any time of the day. To get to the pool we had a 2 minute walk through the jungle which is very nice. Seen monkeys each day around noon. Plenty of birds and animals to see. The beach was very beautiful! Rode jet ski's for $50. for 30 minutes...but very fun! Plenty of free drinks by the beach. There is a mini mall which is a 5 minute walk from the hotel with plenty of gifts to buy. They also have an ATM machine and phones. The phone was free to use with my calling card. (The hotel charges $5.00 to use a calling card.) We took a taxi to 5th Street which is a tourist place for shopping. The shops go at least a mile or more but we only went a few blocks. It's just a block or 2 from the ocean about 2-3 miles from the hotel and cost $5.00 by taxi to get there. If you love to shop, then this is the place to go! No one had a problem taking American money. (One peso is equal to about 10 cents. Finally got the hang of it the day we were leaving!) Spent the one day horseback riding at Loma Bonita and would recommend this to anyone who loves to ride horses! We had a group of 20 and our guide was very funny! We first rode through the jungle on a trail and ended up at the ocean. They took the saddles of a few horses and we took turns hanging onto the horse while it swam out in the ocean. Was very cool! They take your pictures while on the horse and you can buy them for $10. at the end of the trip. The horses love to roll around in the sand...so if you see the ground getting closer....JUMP OFF! I did! While at the ranch, check out the monkey in the cage! Hand him a soda and he'll drink it! Will make a cute picture! I did get a few bug bites although my husband didn't get any. May want to take some bug spray. The hotel was at full compacity....but with all of the space it never seemed crowded! We never waited in line for the buffet or anything else at the hotel.

The beach was beautiful, and the food was great, there was always more than enough food to make me happy, and i am a picky eater.

This trip to Iberostar Tucan was a 2 year anniversary trip for my husband and I. We took a Sandals trip for our honeymoon to Ocho Rios, Jamaica. Iberostar doesn't quite match up to Sandals when you're a couple. When we arrived we were placed in a room with 2 double beds... which could be resolved, but why would they even think to put a couple there (we didn't think we had to ask for a king size)? At other all inclusives (Sandals, specifically), you get to eat in an a la carte every night. Iberostar you just get to eat in a la carte restaurants 2 nights and the buffet can get old and is just not as romantic. If you want to do windsailing which they say is included, it costs $39 us dollars to get a lesson and then you can go for free. Other all inclusives include snorkeling, glass bottom boat rides, banana boats, etc. As far as service goes, the maid service was great (we left tips everyday), but the buffet and bar service was OK. Very few workers were very welcoming to us until we left a tip. Maybe it was a bad week for staff because other reviews say the opposite. The bar open at 11pm was like a singles bar... again, not sure if this is something honeymooners are looking for. The pool and beach were great. The rooms and grounds were also very nice and well kept. If you have never been to an all inclusive before, this place I'm sure would be fine, but after being wined and dined by Sandals, we will not return to Iberostar again.

The Iberostar offers clean rooms, a friendly and well educated staff (that know 5 different languages), plenty of activities for adults and children to participate in and a relatively lively atmosphere. When you check in, be sure to make your reservations for the a la carte restaurants at that time in the lobby. There are 4 a la cartes..Mexican, Italian, Tropical and Steakhouse. We did the Mexican and Steakhouse and both were excellent. The rooms provide a a nice sized closet but no dressers. There is an area next to the closet which is large enough to put your suitcases and \"stuff\". Large closet with lots of hangers. As by now you know, the beds are hard, but, sleep comes easy after a long,fun filled day. Mini bar provides cervesas, bottled water and a variety of sodas. The showers are large enough to accommodate your entire family. Blow dryer provided but is there to dry your hair, not style it. Shampoo and shower gel provided. Bring conditioner and a bar of soap from home. There are 2 buffet restaurants to accommodate both the tucan and Quetzel guests. You can go to whicher one you like as you share facilities. The food was OK. The buffets provide breakfast, lunch and dinner, but, if you are not allowed in the buffet for lunch with beach attire. There are palapa grills provided near the pool/beach area for lazy people like us that didn't want to change. The palapa grill also has a bar. The service was fast and friendly...AND THE ALCOHOL WAS FLOWING!!! I stay away from the fu fu drinks and stuck to my rums and diet coke. No watered down drinks here. We had to ask them to go a little light on the liquor. The lobby bars at the Tucan/Quetzel were a nice touch. It is a great area to have a drink and converse with your \"new friends\". It opens at 10 am. There is usually a guy there playing music in the evening and it is not a self serve bar. Gals are running around the bar and the lobby taking drink orders. We tipped as these same people were getting drinks for us by the pool in the a.m. and were still working at 11pm. There is a nice pool bar at the far end of the pool. It is in a sunken area that is usually shady. Derek from Ireland, we looked for you every day....couldn't find you. I walked around asking \"Is your name Derek?\" Didn't meet Derek, but met lots of other people. There are lots of activities around the main pool and also, ping pong, dance lessons, spanish lessons, etc. you are provided a list of activities when you first check in. Take it with you to the pool or beach so you know what is happening. The chair game is in full swing. I recommend 6a.m. to find your chair at the pool and 8:00 at the beach. Unfortunately, people are now reserving 6 chairs in the sun, 6 in the shade, 6 at the beach. The shows in the evening are silly and are meant to make you laugh and maybe meet people. The show area has a roof over it which is nice in the event of a light shower. Servers provide drinks. Never made it to the disco but heard it was fun. It is on the Quetzel side. I must say \"Hola\" to Barbarita, Roberto, Jeff, Trina, Kaylee and Justin, our newly met friends. Had a blast and hope to see you again. This resort is the prettiest resort we have stayed at in the last 15 years. Very tropical and lush. Flamingos, monkeys, birds, etc. The path throughout the resort is rocky. People who had a hard time walking told us that the resort provided transportation for them to all the facilities. This to me indicated the ultimate in service.

Our travel group was two families, (4 adults, 4 children, ages 5,8,9, & 14) It is honestly difficult to find any material issues with this resort. We spoke with many people from many different countries while staying at the Tucan, and everyone commented on what a fantastic place this resort is. Spotless in all respects, good food, friendly staff and friendly guests, great overall environment for family fun. Some quick tips: 1. Bring about $50.00 worth of one dollar bills, they come in handy for tips. Even though it is never expected by the employees, they truly appeciate the extra money. The bell hop for example makes about $5.00 a day, so tips really make a major difference in their lives. Wet money is fine, but any U.S. dollars that have even the slightest tear has no value in mexico so crisp bills are best. 2. bring a inexpensive air mattress or ring from home and leave it at the pool when you come home. They have them in the gift shop for about $140 pesos ($13-14 US). I bought four before we left for $1.29 each and they where great for the kids and adults alike. 3. Pack less than you think you need. No really, pack light, makes for easier travel. 4. Use the space under your bathroom sink to store large pieces of luggage if needed. 5. Make your al lacarte dinner reservations as soon as poosible upon arrival. 6. E-mail the hotel about 7-10 days before your trip to make any special requests. We did and it worked out great. 7. Get involved in at least a few pool side activties..they are fun. 8. Make sure to say hello to some of the other guests. Meeting people is part of the fun about travel...or at least I think so. and finally 9. Please do not be rude to the staff, even if you do notice something not so great. They work very hard for your enjoyment, say hello (Hola), smile, they know that you are on vacation and they wil do whatever they can to make it right...if possible. One final funny thing. Remember, this is Mexico and things are a little different than in America. ie. I went to the beach bar one afternoon and ordered a drink they call a \"Dirty Monkey\", kinda like a frozen Mud Slide with banana. Very refreshing I might add. I asked if they would put a small amout of vanilla ice cream into the bottom of the glass with the idea that this would make it more like a coffee ice cream milk shake, but with a little kick. Mind you the beach bar has the ice cream machine, and the bartendars give ice cream cones out all day long. When I ordered the drink and made the special request for a little ice cream in the bottom of the cup, the bartender looked at me funny and said, \"sorry senor, I cannot\". At first I thought he just did not understand, but came to find out that they can only serve ice cream in a cone...they cannot serve ice cream in the cup. Why I asked? Reply: Boss man says ice cream in cone only senor. I reply, but I don't want a cone Amigo, I just want a little Ice Cream in the bottom of the cup before you put the drink in. Bartender response: \"Sorry Senor, Boss Man no like, no give instruction how to put ice cream in cup.\" We'll no reason to fuss over something like this, but it's amuzed me eversince.

We want to thank all those who took the time to post reviews of this property and hopefully offer some tips of our own. We reserved the Tucan, but we were actually placed on the Quetzal side of the property. The gentleman at the front desk was most accomodating and we made arrangements to change rooms on Monday (we checked in on Saturday). We were in Building 27 with a perfect view of the Flamingos, but they were not so noisy that they woke us in the AM. We were also very close to the trees where the monkeys \"hang out\" and we were able to see them several times. As it turned out, we were so happy that we declined to move on Monday. We cannot say enough about the cleanliness of this property!! It was immaculate...we never had an issue - either in the room, the pool area or even in the restrooms around the pool and beach. The food was abundant and varied enough that we all left every meal satisfied with both the quantity and quality of the offerings. Our only negative experience was at the Caribbean sit-down restaurant, again, it wasn't a bad experience, simply not what we had so quickly become accustomed to elsewhere on the property. We loved the steakhouse and wished we had tried to reserve it more than once. We tried the breakfast and dinner buffets at both the Tucan and the Quetzal sides and found them equally satisfying. The \"coffee man\" on Mexican night was really amazing! We didn't take advantage of the Kid's Club because the twins were so content to play in the pool and they were able to make friends from all over the world. It was necessary to go to the pool area very early (between 6 and 7 am) to reserve chairs, but once done, it was great to know that we had a perfect place to \"park\" for the day. The \"Star Friends\" worked hard to make the days fun and the activities that they offered at poolside were always well attended. We did do two excursions -we went to Cozumel to go snorkeling with the hotel water sports operator (Dressel Divers).We took the ferry to Cozumel and a taxi to the Iberostar there. Once there, we relaxed at the pool, had lunch and boarded a boat for snorkeling. Unfortunately, this was not a good experience - we were on a boat with Scuba divers and the seas were pretty rough. We did not feel totally safe and the Dressel staff member we were comfortable with was actually diving. We were left with another fellow whose English was almost nonexistent and the boat's bilge pump had broken. Rather than paying attention to those snorkeling in the open ocean, the boat crew was bailing by hand - my son was very frightened when we drifted into water well over 100 feet deep and it took the boat more than 15 minutes to come and get him and my husband. Once the boat did return, the gentleman in charge of our safety left the water with at least four people still in...not a great experience. We did address this with the management at the dive shack and they agreed that this should not have happened and they did offer some compensation. However, based on this experience, we chose not to take advantage of their other services. We also went to Excaret for the day and we really enjoyed our time there. Take note, though, the tour operators tried to sell us bus transport with our entrance tickets, but it is only a $10 taxi trip from the hotel.

We are a family of 4 with 2 teenage girls. What can I say....it was everything we had hoped for. I booked this trip over 6 months ago and I also have been reading these reviews for months and found all the positive reviews to be accurate. I only wish I had taken advantage of some of the tips...like bringing insulated mugs and a clock. No biggie -- we survived without them. FOOD/DRINK: This was our first experience with an all-inclusive, and I was delighted with everything from the selection of food at the buffets (I too am VERY picky) to the service, to the ample drinks (never too weak, if so, just ask for more liquor). For example, on Thursday at the buffet we had lobster and champagne -- how can you go wrong with that! We went to the Italian and the Steak House and found both to be a nice break from the buffet -- to sit down and be served is something that I enjoy (most mothers will understand that)! The food was always presented beautifully and at the specialty restaurants there were impressive appetizer buffets -- plenty of seafood and lobster at the Steak House, nice antipasto at the Italian. Beware wine drinkers: these were the only meals where I found a decent glass of wine. GROUNDS: The grounds are spectacular and well-manicured. The animals walk freely throughout the property. There are waterfalls and fountains, cobblestone pathways which are lit at night, beautiful flowers and plants. It's amazing. The entire resort was always clean and sparkling, someone always washing or polishing, or caring for the animals. ROOMS: I was not thrilled with the location of our rooms at check in, we were on the Quetzel side in Bldg. 25 on the ground floor, on the outer edge of the property which faced the fence to the property next door. Lots of passers by which was annoying, In the mornings I always found someone outside my window tending to the grounds. So we were moved 2 mornings later to the Tucan side, Bldg. 15 on the 3rd floor which we found to be perfect. Like a previous reviewer said...this bldg. is sort of in the middle of the resort with a short walk to either the restaurant/lobby area or to the pool/beach. I would definitely recommend speaking up immediately if you are unhappy with your room, and they will do everything to accommodate you. The change of rooms went smoothly and quickly and definitely was worth it. We had a beautiful view of the jungle area, with lots of peacocks visiting us on our balcony. I am the only one who caught a glimpse of the monkey. I am happy to report no critters of any kind in our rooms. The room was pretty and large enough, beautiful shower and plenty of counter space to spread out. The beds were a bit hard, but we expected it and toughed it out. The only downside to this bldg. is the proximity to the theater. Kind of noisy at night if you happen to try to get to bed early. POOL/BEACH: We spent most of our time at the beach, but the few times we went to the pool for a dip we found it was so big that the water never seemed crowded, even though the hotel was at full occupancy. HOWEVER, I must warn you -- be prepared for the people who sneak down before dawn and hog all the chairs at the pool and the palapas at the beach. You would hope to be able to sleep in on your vacation rather than have to get a wake-up call just to get a chair or some shade! We never had a problem getting a chair at the beach before 10 AM. My only complaint for the entire week was the inadequate number of beach umbrellas. I actually had to wait on line one morning for an hour to get the 2nd to last one -- they only have 15. After a few consecutive days of blazing sun you will find that you need a bit of relief from it. Bring lots of suncreen and a hat (even my scalp got burned). Needless to say, the weather was terrific: sunny and hot every day with a nice breeze. Only rained for about 15 minutes one evening. The beach was so gorgeous -- from the turqoise water with nice waves to play in, the soft white sand, the entertainment. ....and the guys will enjoy the few women who go topless. The American gals will wish the European men would please stop wearing those speedos with their big bellies hanging over! NIGHTLIFE: We did not find much to do at night....and really didn't care. We were so exhausted after swimming, eating and drinking all day that we were knocked out by 10 or 10:30. We would eat dinner, then walk around for a bit and maybe do a little shopping or have a night cap. We never did make it to the disco which opens at 10:30 (next time). The shows were cute, but for us, not enough to sit through every night. Those Star Friends really work so hard to make you have a good time. I think it woud really be fun to go with other families next time so the kids have others to hang out with. Mine did not meet anyone their age, which would have been nice. EXCURSIONS: We did the Tulum/Xel-Ha tour, half day at each. Tulum was interesting and we learned some history and got great photo ops there. Xel-Ha was nice, but I can't say it was really worth it. It was very crowded, I didn't like any of the food, and it just reminded me of an overcrowded water park. I wouldn't go back there. SERVICE: The employees at the resort can't do enough for you, so I would recommend to tip as often as you can. We brought about lots of small bills for this.

Snorkeling on a private beach was wonderful - through \"Snorkeling Adventures\" in Puerto Morales (great lunch). Had heard some other snorkeling trips were disappointing. Rode ATVs in the \"jungle\" (no animals seen unfortunately) and beach - had a great time and decent lunch. This ranch also offers horseback riding on beach and (for a short ride) in the water. Ranch name, I believe, was Loma Bonita. Was south of Cancun, 40 mins. north of Playa del Carmen. The only areas where the hotel could improve is to offer a teen program in the evening (younger children and adults had nightly shows - most were decent) and have softer beds.

All I can say is \"What a place!!!\" It was more than we ever thought it could be. First of all, I have been reading reviews from this site for three months since we booked the trip. I understand some of the previous things mentioned however, here is my two cents worth. Rooms- Room was nice, clean, and what I expected, we were in building 28, It was close to the buffet, but also close to the peacocks (who are louder than the roosters) however, they never woke us up. Service- THE BEST!! everyone was great and the staff went out of their way to talk and get to know you. Grounds- very clean, always being taken care of. Pools- very nice to look at but the main pool was at the opposite of the spectrum that it was too warm- it was 92 everyday and sunny. the adult pool with the pool bar was very nice and the water was colder. It was a blast in there! Food- I am not a picky eater, and in turn found the food to be diverse enough for me and I thought it was really good, as did my wife. the mexican specialty restaraunt was my favorite- they even brought me extra when my waiter overheard me saying to my wife I could eat two more tacos. I was creative enough to keep anything from getting boring. The drinks were not watered down when we went. As a matter of fact, EVERY mixed drink I had was \"topped off\" with the main liqour. a small tip here and there just made their day. My wife and I have never done an all-inclusive so take what you want from this review. but I know we WILL go back, and to the tucan/quetzal. Why chance staying somewhere else when you've found a good thing? One thing to complain about is this- there is no night-life in the resort, if that's what you want- go to town at night to blue parrot, or senor frog's. Everything is pretty much done at 11pm. However after partying all day, 11pm isn't too bad. There is a lot more to say that's good, we did have a visitor in the form of a scorpion one of the mornings. I called the front, someone came and gave me a spray to get where it hid. I took care of it myself, and out he went. Even though we had a blast meeting people from all over, it would be even more fun to go with a small group. depends on your thing. Last thing- another reviewer was right that the worst group of people are the Americans. Most of them were very friendly, however watching behavior and observing rudeness can have a few spoil for the many.

My husband was not able to do his second dive and Dressels let my son use it and he did it in Cozumel. They were excellent! We thought the food was good and there was a huge variety at the buffet. If you cannot find somethng you like, you are very picky. We got 3 Ala Carte dinners and we had good meals at the Italian and Tropical, but the steak was not as good. We would have liked a specialty buffet night instead. The staff was very friendly and always busy. They work very hard. We did tip at the ala carte meals, houskeeping and bartenders. The grounds are gorgeous and although the resort is large it is very easy to get around. Part of the family was in bldg 18 which was near the front lobby and it never seemed hard to walk to the pool or beach. My mom, brother and one son stayed in bldg. 15 which is in the middle overlooking the jungle. To us they had the perfect location. They had a short walk in either direction.

First, the rooms, we had two rooms next to eachother in Building 11. I did email the hotel the week before to request this. We had no problem with the beds, after a day in the sun, you're really to tired to care. The rooms were spacious, closets had enough room to hang and each person had a shelf for clothing. There is also a tile bench across from from one bed with room to put suitcases and bags on and room underneath for shoes, etc. Bathroom was great, the tile shower was huge, and sink area had plenty of room for toiletries. We had no problems with bugs or odors. Each room has a porch or balcony with table and two chairs and a drying rack, which is really nice because you can actually sit outside while your suits are drying and not have to sit on them or hang them over the railing. The main pool is very large. Most of the pool is over 5 ft, but they are two more shallow areas. Bring rafts from home. There is also a small wading pool over by the kids club and an activities pool for water volleyball, etc. The water was a nice cool temperature. We spent most of our time down at the zero depth end with the younger kids. The pool area is nice because it is right next to the beach and you can see, hear, and smell the ocean. People did reserve the lounge chairs very early in the morning. Although, halfway through our stay we received a notice reminding us this was not allowed and items would be picked up if left at early hours. This seemed to deter people alot and I do know that the security did remove towels, books, etc. There were always chairs available on the beach. The beach at this hotel is by far the widest and nicest of any of the Playacar resorts. We had a few days of rougher ocean which fun to play in the waves and some calmer which was nice for kayaking. The water temperture is perfect and the sand never gets hot! The food was good to excellent. Breakfast buffet was always plentiful with anything you could want. They also had a more continental buffet down by the pool in the am. Lunch buffet by the beach was always good. Chips, salsa, and guacamole every day! They also grilled hot dogs and burgers every day. Fries too at lunch and dinner. We never ate lunch at the main buffet so can't comment on that. The dinner buffett was also good, it did get a little more tiring as the week wore on, but we always found something good. The desserts were always outstanding and my older kids learned that they like expresso using the machine in the buffett. We went to the steak restaurant one night, it is open air by the beach, it was good. My husband and I went to the Italian another night, it was excellent. Much fancier, you may not want to bring tired kids. Ours had room service (included) that night. The Star Friends were great. There were always various activities planned. They would invite you to participate, but were not overly pushy if you declined. You could also check out bocce ball, vollyball, horseshoes, etc. at the towel hut for your personal use. My only problems with the resort were with the kids club and the fitness center. The kids club is only a small hut by the wading pool with a few plastic tables and chairs. They did have foosball and bumper pool. No kids over 8 seemed to use it. We did put the younger two in one day for an hour while we went parasailing, only to be told that tomorrow my 3 3/4 year potty trained child would not be allowed because they're supposed to be 4. Well that was the end of that. The kids club could definitely use some improvement, in staff ( they didn't seem too enthusiastic), and comforts, maybe some comfy soft chairs and toys. The fitness centers only problem was that it didn't open until 8am. A lot of people suggested that it open at 6, so maybe the hours will change. I can't finish this review without saying how terrific and friendly the staff here are. From check in to waitstaff, bartenders, even the pool and landscape crew. If you take the time to say Hola and smile, it makes such a difference. Overall our vacation was fantastic and relaxing. We met lots of nice and intersesting people from US and Europe.

The food was average, great lamb chops and loved the guacomolee, drinks are defenitley watered down but who cares. The staff was the most friendly I have ever encountered anywhere and I have been all over the world. My complaints are : Our room should have been better prepared for us, we needed a bulb in bathroom, one of the lamps was broken, the button for the fan was not working and our faucet in the sink was broken and lose and could not close the stoper in sink, and on one occasion we were not left towels in our room and there was water on the floor near the toilet and I found a cochroach in the bathroom. so I can not give top points to our room. I also feel that the Message area and braiding areas should be separated as it is not very relaxaning to get a message while children and their parents hang out to get braids.

I do agree that you should venture out for 1-2 meals to break things up and downtown Playa Del Carmen has some great restaurants and is a $4 taxi ride away. The pool area is beautiful. We were there March 20-27 which was Spring Break time for many schools so there were quite a few families there which helped in filling up the pool area (or at least the available chairs) by 8 AM.

Since so much has already been written about this resort, I'll try as much as possible to avoid being repetitious in this review. The Tucan is one-half of the Iberostar resort in Playacar, the other resort being the Quetzal which is the mirror-image of the Tucan. The two share many of the same facilities, including the pools, bars, and restaurants, and it's sometimes hard to distinguish on which side you are. One thing we learned during our stay is that the word \"Playacar\" is used to describe the beautiful resort zone that is located just south of Playa del Carmen. The resorts in this vicinity, along with the Iberostar, include several Riu properties, the Gala, and the Royal Hideaway. One can see them all by walking along the beautiful beach which links them. This resort has several features that would rate an \"11\" on a scale of 1-10. These include the beach, the grounds and landscaping, and the fun and energetic activities staff. Walking thru this property is equivalent to being in a conservatory and an aviary, with so many kinds of tropical plants and birds. And there are also unusual mammals (including monkeys), lizards, and turtles which inhabit the property. The resort staff are all friendly and \"went the extra mile\" to make our stay pleasant. Our housekeeper was very good and kept our room refrigerator stocked with beverages, and she did those extra things such as forming animals from the room linens. The activities staff were highly congenial, making an effort to get to know us and always inviting us to the various daily & nightly activities. In fact, they occasionally joined us for lunch, so we used these opportunities to question them, gaining knowledge about the area and the local culture. The same staff who ran the activities doubled as those who performed in the nightly shows. (The quality of these varied from \"very good\" to \"high school variety shows\", and some of the humor is pretty corny, but we found ourselves laughing in spite of ourselves.) So why did I rate this resort 4-stars and not five? One reason: the food. While our meals weren't horrible, in no way was the food comparable to the quality of the rest of the resort. We were always able to find something that we liked, but sometimes our choices were more limited than we would have preferred. And no, we're not particularly \"picky\" eaters; we found the food in the Palladium resort (where we have stayed previously) to be much better. Miscellaneous tips: yes, the beds are VERY firm, so plan accordingly; the bartenders often make the drinks weak, but will strengthen them if you ask. And they remember who tips them (hint-hint). Topless is not permitted at poolside, but accepted on the beach. The pool water was cool, but not cold - certainly no colder than pool water during a Pennsylvania summer. Mosquitos were not a problem at all. Yes, the birds do squawk, but remember, they are acting like birds in their natural habitat. Many of the restaurants have roofs but no side walls, so the birds do have access to unguarded tables - don't leave your table without someone remaining behind to protect your food. Bring plenty of sunscreen with you: the sun gets wicked, and sunscreen in Mexico is expensive. If you plan to walk to Play del Carmen rather than take the taxi ($4 US), do it in the early AM as it does get very hot. The elusive monkeys can more frequently be found in the early AM on the Quetzal side. Bring a camera - there is so much to see. There is a gym on the premises; while small, it is air conditioned, and sufficiently equipped (new treadmills, free weights, universal-type machines, one bench) to provide a decent workout to stay toned. And last but not least: do make the effort to get to know the activities staff. They are very nice, a lot of fun, and they can make your stay a super time.", "Date": "March 15, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Quebec", "Title": "\u201cSimply SPECTACULAR\u201d", "Author": "beaang", "ReviewID": "UR1722351", "Content": "My husband and I visited the Iberostar Tucan 22-29 February 2004. In a word, it was SPECTACULAR. Here is my detailed, and hopefully informative, review.CHECK-IN: Upon our arrival we checked in and were immediately served a tasty daiquiri and were issued bracelets, towel cards, and an information kit. As we were early and check-in wasn?t until 3:00 PM, we were told to leave our bags in the lobby with the bell boys and enjoy the resort amenities. I believe there were hospitality rooms but we did not use them. The lobby bathroom was rather large, however, so we went there to change into our beach clothes. From there we headed out to the poolside grill for lunch. When we returned at 4:00 PM we were told that we could head out to our room immediately and they sent a bell boy to our room to deliver our bags.OUR ROOM: As per our e-mail request (sent in Spanish and English), we were given a room in building 11 on the third floor close to the beach (room #1151). From our balcony we had a view of the tropical jungle and limited view of the ocean. As we were up so high, we didn?t hear a thing (including the roosters) once we closed our patio doors for the night. Our first day there, we had a monkey visit us. He stayed for around five minutes, munching on the leaves in the planters surrounding our balcony. Another day two ducks came by to perch. The room itself was very clean with tiled floors and a LARGE marble shower in the bathroom. There are no bathtubs in this resort. The toilet water stank every other day, but we got used to the smell after awhile. Other guests we spoke to didn?t have this problem. We were told that the water was safe to brush our teeth, but not to swallow. We had two double beds and a daybed in our room. The mattresses are hard, but we are used to that so we slept extremely well. There are no drawers in the room, but there are plenty of shelves and hangers in the closet for organizing clothing. There is also a safe in the closet, free of charge, which is easy to use. There is a television in the room but we never had time to watch it. Please be advised that there is NO CLOCK in the room, so unless you pack one you had better request a wake-up call if you have an excursion planned or have to get to the airport on time. There is a table and chairs in the room and a long counter with a mirror overhead. There is also a small bench for those ladies who want to do their makeup while the bathroom is occupied. Beneath the counter is a minibar, refilled every day, stocked with bottled water, soft drinks and beer. We left a little gift bag for our chambermaid filled with small gifts and $2 USD each day with a little thank-you note written in Spanish. In return we had impeccable service and towel art sprinkled with fresh red flowers.THE HOTEL: The lobby is incredible, with marbled floors and high ceiling, Mayan art, and even live parrots. There are plenty of padded benches to sit on, boutiques, and a spacious lobby bar with tables and chairs. There is also a desk for travel agents where you can speak to and verify information posted by your travel representative. We traveled with Signature Vacations and were taken care of by Nathalie Pinet. Quick tip ? make sure you attend the information session hosted by your representative. This is a great way to plan your vacation. There are two Internet terminals, open from 10 AM to 11 PM ? 20 pesos gets you around 15 minutes of computer time (HOTMAIL and AOL are not available). Past the reception area are the restaurants. On each side of the marbled path are waterways with large fish. There are beautiful tropical plants everywhere ? a real treat for the eyes. Behind the restaurants is the animation area, ?La Plaza?. This is where Star Friends perform every evening. The stage is quite large and the hall itself is huge with plenty of coffee tables and chairs. A large bar stands opposite the stage at the back of the hall. If you cross through this area, you will see two pool tables. Should you wish to play, you must cross over to the Quetzal side for balls and cues. Toward the Quetzal side of the resort where the restaurants are, you will walk along wooden paths and take in breathtaking landscaping complete with lush greenery, waterfalls and flamingos. The path through the tropical jungle, lit at night, will convince you that you?ve chosen the ideal resort. Surrounded by trees, tropical plants and flowers, you cannot begin to describe the beauty of this area. There are peacocks, roosters, iguanas, ducks, birds, and creatures resembling rats without tails wandering around. There is even a toucan, which unfortunately is fenced in and alone.THE POOL: This pool is HUGE and absolutely beautiful. There are two zero-entry areas at each end, with an unheated hot tub in the middle. The water was very warm, contrary to what I have heard and there were many people using it, especially children. The Star Friends give an Aqua Gym course at 11:30 AM every morning in one end of the pool and diving lessons in the same place twice per day. A second pool is used for Aqua Volleyball and Aqua Basketball. There is also a kiddie pool and pool bar (my favorite). The pools are closed for chemical treatments every night at 8:00 PM, so if you prefer to swim at night you?re out of luck. Towels can be exchanged daily from 8 AM to 6 PM.THE BEACH: The Playacar area is renowned for its beach and I saw for myself what all the hoopla was about. You can walk for miles in bare feet in either direction ? towards the undeveloped area you will only walk past one resort, Gala. After that, it is a deserted expanse of water, sand, and litter washed up by the waves. As long as you stay in the water, you can walk a long way. I suggest taking water shoes if you plan to go very far. If you walk the other way, you will pass through a line of other resorts, including the Riu resorts, Viva Maya, Royal Hideaway, Allegro Resort, Viva Azteca and Reef Club. You might make it into Playa del Carmen, depending on the surf and the coral. When we were there the wind had picked up quite a bit, making the water hard to wade through. Most found the waves too rough and opted to remain ashore. When the water was too rough the dive shop did not lend out the non-motorized watersport gear, included in the all-inclusive package. On the beach we didn?t have trouble finding a spot in the shade, even when we arrived at 10:00 AM. Many people chose to sit by the pool instead, where there are also ample shaded areas. WARNING: I didn?t see any lifeguards on the beach, nor at the pool.THE FOOD: Restaurant and bar hours are indicated in the information kit given to you at check-in. Breakfast is from 7-10 AM in the buffet restaurants near the lobby and from 10-12 AM in the poolside grills. Lunch is from 1-3 PM in the buffet on the Quetzal side and from 12-5 PM in the poolside grills. Snacks are from 5-6 pm in the palapa (hotdogs and hamburgers) on the beach. Dinner is in the buffet restaurants from 6:30-10 PM, unless you have a reservation in an ?-la-carte restaurant. You can reserve two ?-la-carte restaurants per week for either a 6:30 or 8:30 PM sitting. Reservations are made in the lobby at Public Relations from 9-11 AM and 5-6:30 PM daily. Be sure to reserve as soon as possible, as the restaurants fill up early. We ended up getting three reservations, as the man in front of us cancelled his Steakhouse at the last minute. The Italian was my husband?s favorite and mine was the Steakhouse. We also went to the Mexican and found that to be good, also. There is also a seafood one, but we weren?t interested. At each ?-la-carte there was an entr?e buffet where you could easily fill up before the main meal arrived. If you are hungry after 11 PM, head over to the buffet on the Quetzal side for late snacks. Overall, the food was excellent in all the restaurants, including the buffets. There is something here for everyone, including the fussiest eater. My only complaint is that the fajita flatbreads are way too small.FITNESS/SPA: There are a lot of things here to do for any fitness enthusiast - tennis, gymnastics, dance lessons, cycling, soccer, volleyball, basketball, watersports, diving, jogging, etc. We took a peek at the spa and fitness center and were impressed by the number and quality of weight and cardio machines available. You can use their lockers, towels, steam bath and Jacuzzi. My husband and I went on the bike tour with one of the Star Friends. This was a great way to see the Playacar area. Once in Playa del Carmen, we were given an hour to shop and visit, then took the long way back around the Playacar Golf Club. Note that if you want to take a bike out on your own, you have to pay. The beauty salon, open from 8 AM to 7 PM offers facial and body treatments, hairdressing services, coloring and manicures. They also offer massages in the spa or at the beach (near the pool).ENTERTAINMENT: I was impressed with most of the shows put on by Star Friends, except for Miss Iberostar, which I found a waste of quality sleep time. One of the performers did an incredible impersonation of Michael Jackson. They have a movie for kids at 8 PM every evening, but the projection quality is horrible. Waitresses come around serving drinks throughout the evening entertainment, which is much appreciated. If you can stay up late enough, there is a nightclub on the Quetzal side open from 10:30 PM to 3 AM.KIDS: There are organized activities for kids 4-12 years old in Lucy?s Mini Club from 10:15 AM to 5 PM, including games, movies, soccer, bingo, sand castle building, dancing and treasure hunts. The kids we saw seemed to be having a great time. There is a playground next to the kiddie pool with lots of sand all around.QUICK TIDBITS: We brought our insulated plastic Disney mugs with covers for our drinks at the bar. The drinks stayed colder longer, the sand didn?t get into them, and the bartenders got a kick out of them. If your on-site travel agent invites you on a drinking tour, take it. We did Mayan Madness with our Signature rep and had a blast cruising to three bars over three hours where we made new friends and danced the night away. Also, be sure to purchase a calling card should you wish to phone home. We got one from our Signature representative. You have to walk 10 minutes to the Plaza or go into Playa del Carmen to use it. If you use the phones at the hotel, you will pay a fortune.That about sums up our experience at the Iberostar Tucan. We did two excursions, Coba Ruins and Xel-Ha, but we?ll be posting those reviews separately. We met people from around the world, all very friendly.

The food, I thought, was lacking but I am a very picky eater. There was not one decent piece of chicken to be found other than in the Tropical restaraunt. The buffets had lots of seafood, beef and pork but I'll be damned there were no white breasts of chicken. We ate the fruit and salad no problem. The Italian rest was great as was the Tropical. We did not care for the Mexican rest. although we do love Mexican food. They put sugar in all the drinks and I swear they watered down the alcohol. We started ordering martinis which proved to be a wise choice. Try the Mojitos at the bars (rum drink with mint and limes). They were great but again lots of sugar. We are not big drinkers in any respect but 2 really good cocktails would have been great every night. Didn't happen. The red wine with dinner was very good. It would have been nice to get a bottle of Dos Equis or Corona at the bars but they only had tap beer. Ok enough about the alcohol and food. The beach was awesome and the water great! You can walk to the right of the resort and it is deserted. Lots of people to the left as that is where all the resorts are. Definitely go to Xel Ha for the day. We took a cab ($30 one way) but worth it. Get there early (8:45) and start snorkeling before the crowds arrive and the water gets a little murky from all the sand being kicked up. Definitely lots of fish to see. Lay in the hammocks and walk down to the cenotes as the water is soooo clear there! The gym was fine and it is a great place to run/walk along the streets under the trees for shading. The tipping did not seem to really matter but we did leave $$ for the maid everyday. The bartenders did not seem to care if we tipped so we stopped. We also left $$ for the ala carte waiters. We stayed in blg 11 near the beach on the 3rd floor. 11 and 12 would be the rooms to be near the beach and they were quiet. The pool was nice but hte smokers and the kids hung out there so we stayed on the beach all week and there was plenty of room/chairs. The Quetzal side bar near the lobby has a happy hour entertainer but the Tucan side did not. The Quetzal side has a nice water fall and flamingo pond-check it out.

Silly Gringos, this resort is too nice for you-We'll put you next door in a mediocre motel and there's not a damn thing you can do about it. Chenga los Americanos! I wouldn't really call this a review, more like a buyer beware for the tourist venturing into Mexico for the first time. I would like to review the Iberostar but never got the chance. We were stuck in a motel next door (we couldn't even see over the fence, but it sounded like a fun place) because they overbooked the brand new, beautiful resort that they were selling us on for the good part of a year-the old bait and switch. We waisted 1 1/2 days bickering long distance with our travel agent, to no avail. I'm not quite sure what or who to put the blame on in this instance. It could be because we were traveling with a large group or because we used Suntrips (beware) as our agent. If you are traveling with a group try to eliminate the middleman (Suntrips) and do it yourself.

It began on February 28 through March 4. We met friends in North Carolina to travel together to our Paradise vacation. After having a 4 hour delay for our connecting flight out of Charlotte, NC due to snow (yes, snow in Charlotte), our anticipated arrival time of 12:30 PM changed to 4:00 pm arrival at Cancun airport. Our tour package was from TNT and the mini bus was right there waiting for us. Drive was about 45 minutes, as we had to drop off some other guests at other hotels. I must say the Iberostar was much more appealing to the eyes than any other resorts we saw. We were particulary impessed with the security of the resort. Once in lobby we were greeted with a tropical drink and they were waiting for us to check in. Our rooms were side by side (in the 1600's section) as requested and ground floor. May I add this section is conveniently located to the buffet area, lobby, pool, and beach. It could not have been more perfect. As we hadn't eaten since early morning, we checked in our room and headed for the buffet. We were seated with a smile and immediately offered wine (white or red) or cerveza. The variety of food is phenomenal. We relocated to the lobby bar and quickly made friends with the bartender and waitress. Day 2 (as with many mornings) included a wonderful breakfast---omlettes made to order....and everything for anyone's taste buds. We missed our TNT hospitality meeting as we went to beach to get some much needed sun. (bring plenty of sunscreen). Though Josue did contact us to join the next group the day after. We used the time to make our dinner reservation at the Steak House, which was very good, though a lot of seafood for appetizers. The tequilla shots at the end were a surprise that evening. Josue from TNT was very helpful to set up times for the ATV Jungle Tour and the Dolphin Discovery. The drinks were plentiful and just ask for a bit more liquor if you want them a bit stronger as they are a bit weak at the beginning.They do oblige. A dollar to two tip goes a long way. Our room was always immaculate. The marble floors and bathroom was very nice. We didn't find the beds hard at all, as we are use to the firm mattress. We had towel art every morning and the mini bar was well stocked every day w/water, soda and beer. Our alarm clock (Mr. Rooster) was always on time at 5:30 am every morning. The peacocks, roosters, iquanas, flamingos had the run of the place, quite amusing I must say. Unfortunately,we didn't see any monkeys. The pool and beach area are beautiful and the grounds are immaculate. We signed up for a massage at the pool area....which was fabulous, well worth it for $35.00. Also, there's a little shopping center-just a 15 min. walk. Nice to do after dinner. The only small negative was that there was no coffee maker in room, and for us that need that caffeine rush first thing, waiting till the buffet opens at 7:00 was just a small inconvenience. I could go on and on, but to sum up our 8 day trip, it was relaxing, enjoyable, and absolutely the best. Our 250 pictures between the four us prove it.

We loved it! It's as the other reviews have pretty much already said. The Tucan's open air lobby is grand. The grounds are clean, the jungle is a sight to behold. We encountered flamingos, peacocks, roosters and finally monkeys on the day before we left. The food is great. We tried the Mexican and the Italian restaurants. I liked the food at the Italian restaurant the best. The buffets have plenty to offer in the way of variety. I enjoyed the food at the buffets and the beach side grill. The service in all the restaurants was outstanding. I didn't believe the other reivews to be true when they spoke of how dedicated and friendly the employees could be. It was all true! We stayed at another all inclusive about 30 mintures south of the Tucan in 2001. We found the customer service there to be very lame. I thought our room was beautiful. The beds are really hard and took some getting used to. The bathroom was large and the shower was great. We were in building 19 on the 2nd floor just off the lobby. I must admit that we did encounter early morning noise from employees doing their jobs. Our maid Wendy did an awesome job. I brought plenty of $1.00 bills and truely felt like a tip was due for a job well done. Thanks Wendy! The pool was not cold as the other reviews had stated. I enjoyed the water areobics on 3 days of our stay. I also enjoyed walking with my husband down the long stretch of beach every morning. Oh yeah, don't forget to get the ice cream cones from the beach bar. My husband and I were hooked on the chocolate cones. The drinks were also great and always served with a smile. Our Apple Vacation representatives Ana and Victoria did a awesome job during orientation and throughout our vacation days at the Tucan. They seemed to be at the desk in the Lobby area anytime we needed them. Believe me I asked alot of questions! We did not check out the night life the whole week that we were there so I cannot comment on it. The only downside to our vacation was when we were going through the Cancun Airport with what seemed like several buses of people at the same time. The Cancun Airport obviously cannot handle that type of mass people. They do not have any x-ray machines and do all checking of suitcases manually. Needless to say after standing in line for well over an hour they started just taking suitcases and sending them through without checking. This was quite disturbing to us.

The range of age within the group was mid-thirties to early sixties. A great time was had by all.The location of the resort is excellent. It is situated at the south end of the Playacar beach area. The Gala resort is to the south of the Tucan & the RIU complexes are to the north. Beach is very good. Lots of activity to the north, with all the other hotels. If you enjoy romantic beach walks travel down the beach to the south, past the Gala, and continue through the rock formations. I guarantee that it will be worth the trip. Good snorkeling right off shore and the best water/sand on the beach. No development has spoiled this area yet. The proximity to shopping is convenient with a shopping mall a 5 to 10 minute walk & Playa Del Carmen a 20 to 30 minute walk. Taxis are $4 one way to Playa Del Carmen. If you enjoy walking, or running, there are a variety of options including the beach, or the sidewalks and streets in the Playacar area. We enjoyed running or walking to Playa Del Carmen and then back through the streets surrounding the Golf Club Playacar. We did not play golf, but the golf course is beautiful and appears to be very challenging. Now on to the review of the Iberostar Tucan resort. Service - Excellent. Everyone, from the time we checked in and until we checked out, were very friendly and accomodating. Tip if you wish. It is not expected, but truly appreciated. The tips that we gave the maid(s) produced some towel art and some fresh flowers. Tips to the bartenders produced name recognition and extra attention. These individuals earn their tips, unlike some of the service that we have received in the U.S. Rooms - Adequate. Smaller than most we have had in other hotels. The shower is large & can easily be enjoyed by two. Shower gel & shampoo dispensers in shower. Bathroom could use better lighting. Beds are hard. They sit directly on a cement slab. We like hard mattresses. These rate as extra firm. Buildings 11&12 are the closest that you can get to the pool/beach without paying for upgrade. Buildings 16,17,18 are closer to lobby & restaurants. We were in building 12 and found it to be very convenient for our needs. If you are on the third floor in building 11 you may sneek in an ocean view. The closer you get to the lobby/restaurants the more noise you will experience at night.Restaurants - We ate at two Ala Carte restaurants. The La Hacienda (mexican) & the Uxmal- Tropical (seafood). The mexican was a grade B. The seafood was an grade D. The La Hacienda & the La Gondola are the more formal of the Ala Carte restaurants. We heard that La Gondola was good. If you sign up for extra Ala Carte restaurants you may receive them the day of the service, but with 22 of us we didn't try. The buffet was a grade A-. Among the best of the buffets at the all-inclusive resorts we have stayed at. Lots of variety. Good quality. We heard that they have lobster every other Thursday night. Unfortunately they did not have it on 2/26. The Cozumel buffet (Quetzal side) opens earlier in the morning than the Tulum buffet. Great for early risers that must have their coffee by 6 am. Bars - Drinks were the best we have had in Mexico/Caribbean. Ask & you shall receive. Tip & you won't believe.Fitness Center - Small but good. Can get crowded very easily. Two elipticals. Two stairmasters. Two stationary bikes and three treadmills. All newer styles and good quality. Nice variety of barbells & dumbells. Also several styles of benches to work off of, along with stacked weight stations. Overall one of the best fitness centers that I've been to at an all-inclusive. Granted, that doesn't take much. Grounds - Beautiful. The jungle is in the center of property, between the Tucan & Quetzal sides. Monkeys, flamingo's, peacocks, and a large number of other birds & animals, including a strange looking creature that resembles a cross between a rabbit and a rat.Pools - Large & not as cold as advertised. Lots of children in main pool area, much more family oriented than the beach. If you don't have children it is a bit much for most. Swim-up bar is in a relatively low shady area. It is a lot of fun but gets very cool in mid-afternoon. Other Cultures - We did not find that the European's, or others, were rude. All of our cultures are different. World tensions are a little high right now. Vacation is no time to add to it. It is the time to lessen it. Reach out. It works. Summary - Great hotel. Wonderful staff. If you don't insist on comparing everything to the USA you will enjoy it immensely.

The hotel is as wonderful as is the staff. My family and I (2 adults, two girls 12 and 8) vacationed here February 11-19. Even though the weather was unusually wet and cool for this time of year, it didn't dampen our vacation. The hotel itself is just spactacular! From the glorious lobby to the colorful archictecture, all were candy for the eyes. I particulary loved the marble walkways just beyond the lobby that connect it to the jungle walk. The jungle walk is the best! You will spot roosters, pheasants of various sorts, peacocks, cute rodents that my 8 year old nicknamed \"Big Butts\" for their more prominent feature! We were informed by our favorite waiter Roger, that there are 7 monkeys living in the jungle. We spotted one early one morning. Eating was never a problem. The buffets were over abundant with a diverse variety of foods. Everyone in my family always found several things that kept them happy at all meals. To be quite honest, my children never ate better! Wine was always offered at dinner along with soda, etc. Bar drinks were awesome! My husband always requested mucho tequila or rum which was served without a problem. The pool area is beautiful. We are beach people, but we swam in the pool a few times. The adult pool was chilly, but after a drink or two we didn't mind! The beach is pretty. I've been to nicer (St. John US Virgin Islands!!!), but this one worked. We would always reserve a palapas in the morning and shift in and out of the sun. The water was changeable in that some days it was calmer than others. I wouldn't let me kids in alone because their was a strong current and undertoe. They basically stayed at the pool. The rooms are very nice. We had a oceanfront junior sweet. It consisted of two HARD double beds and two twins. The mattresses lie on concrete platforms. The bathroom was fine except the lighting is really bad. There is a real international flair at the Tucan. Many guests are from Germany, Italy, France, England, South America. We found them be like any other guest. They weren't rude or obnoxious as I've read in other reviews. We had one brief encounter at lunch one afternoon with a European guy, but jerks live all over the world, right? My only complaint is with the gym. My husband and I work out and this gym was a disappointment for such a fine hotel. The gym is too small, hot, and with old equipment. You can only get in a moderate workout.

The resort is situated in the \"playacar\" resort area about a mile from Playa del Carmen. The resort itself is BEAUTIFUL. I must admit that I have been to several nice resorts but this is the prettiest I have ever been to. The strengths of this resort are it's beach, the property itself and the friendly staff. However, as you can see I only gave this resort a 3/5 rating. This resort is billed as a \"5 golden apple\". Five apple it is not. The weaknesses of this resort are part of it's strengths. First, there are animals all over it. Beautiful, yes, but who wants to eat dinner with a crow? Yes, a crow right on the table next to you. This is because the entire hotel is \"open\" meaning the lobby (Breathtaking by the way) is open, with no walls, the buffet, yes open. Meaning that there are birds all over the place. But no bugs, hum. There are huge birds including peacocks and roosters, all over the place. Did I say roosters, yes, and yes they start crowing at between 4:00 and 4:10 each morning. Bring your ear plugs. The food, well there is a lot of it and it is presented quite nicely. However, my wife is anything but a picky eater and by the 4th day we were both wanting to go into town to pay $80.00 for a meal, just so we wouldn't have to eat at the hotel anymore. I am sorry, maybe its seasoned for the European travelers. Which I found to be quite friendly by the way, despite what other reviewers have said. The rooms were nicely decorated and quite comfortable. Forget what others have said about the beds being hard. Yes they are a little firm but you will be so tired that you won't notice. (till 4:00 that is). The entertainment. Well, think senior play. Oh by the way if you go on the night that says \"Miss Iberostar\" be sure to wear your best underware guys. This evening starts out with four women. Each then is given points for how many men's shoes she can bring back from the audience (harmless enough). Then how many shirts, and yes pants. Then the real laughing starts when fifty guys have one minute to go up to the front of the stage and get their shirts, shoes etc which have been unceremoniously \"dumped\" on the stage. All in their underware. A little juvenile I thought. (I realize that there are some of you that are at this moment saying \"that sounds kind of fun, honey, I think I know where we are going\") All in all this is an OK resort. The monkey's and wildlife are cool if your from the US. The beach is nice and the grounds imaculate. However, like any resort thats really nice it gets busy and this is no exception. The buffets, beach, pool and lobby are busy. I would just warn you to bring your ear plugs,plan to get to the pool by 7:00 to get a good seat (you have to reserve them with a towel) and plan to go into town to eat in the evening. Other than that this hotel is just as others on this site have portrayed it.

We've been back a little over a week afetr a 5-night stay at the Tucan, which is more or less a \"cruise on land\". While it might be exactly the same caliber, everything about the Tucan is wonderful, and it is definitely a top notch resort. It was everything we expected, and more: The setting is beautiful, the activities plentiful, the room clean and comfortable, the food delicious and bountiful, and the staff friendly and efficient! We read a number of the reviews on this site, and while we certainly realize that the Tucan -- like any resort -- can have occasional problems, we did not experience ANY of the issues mentioned by previous reviewers. Personally, I think much of it is attitude, so as long as you do not expect 100% perfection all the time, stay relaxed, go with the flow, and simply try to have fun, you will not be disappointed at the Tucan. Ok, so here are some tips we'd like to pass along as a result of trip (in no particular order). TIP 1: Get your reservations for the a la carte restaurants in early as they fill up fast. However, we were quite pleased with the variety and quality of the buffets and almost preferred these over the restaurants. TIP 2: Take along LOTS of $1 bills for tips. We took about $75 of these and nearly used them up...well worth it. TIP 3: Leave a tip each night for your maid. We did this, which include a couple dollars, some small \"trinkets\" and thanks you cards in Spanish, and we got great service, included small towel creations each day. TIP 4: Take along insulated mugs for drinks while sitting around pool or beach. These worked well, and the bartenders will gladly fill them. TIP 5: True, the beds are firm as pointed out by other reviewers. No problem for us, but if this is an issue, you may want to request pads. TIP 6: Request a room on the 2nd or 3rd floor and if possible near the pool. While view is not necessarily better because of the foliage, you have a little more privacy. Plus, you'll possibly get a better view of the monkeys! TIP 7: Buy a phone card down there to call US unless you have a cell phone that will work there (some do). We had a lot of trouble calling home, and it is very expensive from the room ($5/min). This is not the fault of the Tucan, but rather a function of the local phone market. Phone cards are available from local gift shops (ours was $10 for 12 minutes), and shopkeeps will gladly show you how to use. TIP 8: If you plan to do snorkleing, bring your own mask and snorkel. TIP 9: Bring lots of film, including water resitant cameras. There is LOTS to take pictures of! TIP 10: Pack light. You don't need a lot of clothes, though be careful. We actually packed TOO light and ended up wearing some things a couple times. TIP 11: Check out the activities at the resort early in your stay and plan what you want to do. There are a LOT of activities, and unfortunately, we didn't quite get a grip on it all until we were almost ready to leave. TIP 12: Take the Spansih class offered by the resort. We think it's 11:30 each day near the pool restaurant, but double check...worth it! TIP 13: Visit the town Playa del Carmen. This is a great little town with lots of shops, restaurants, bars, etc. You get there by taxi or scooter, which you can ret for a reasonable rate. Or, you can walk (~2 miles). TIP 14: Do some pre-tanning before you leave. We are not big tanners, but we found this kept us from getting sunburned. TIP 15: Use one of the tour companies. This is the only way to go. They are extremely helpful, and it makes the vacation so much easier. Ours was Apple, and we definitely recommend them. They can also arrange side tours, such as snorkeling, Mayan ruin tours, etc.", "Date": "February 14, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston MI", "Title": "\u201cSimply the best\u201d", "Author": "Reda_Grudzinsky_2004", "ReviewID": "UR1648208", "Content": "My wife and I have just returned from the Iberostar Tucan 1-09-04 thru 1-16-04.

It is a gorgeous looking hotel, though the rooms are a little smaller than you would expect and the beds are a bit hard. But these things are trivial issues because what the Tucan does offer is relaxation, friendly and good service, a clean location - they just go all out to make you feel welcome and wanted. And that is all you can ask from a hotel.Like many people we chose this hotel based on the reviews on this site, so I would like to say that, as a European, I've been a bit surprised by the anti-European tone of some of the reviews here. People are just people - some are friendly, some are not, some do things you don't like, some even smoke. If you are staying in any hotel, anywhere in the world, just accept this or try to ignore it. For the record, I liked the Americans we met while we were there, I don't wear speedos and my girlfriend didn't go topless. In fact, while we were there (Aug/Sept 03) the staff were very aware that topless sunbathing offends some people and did try to ensure that this was minimized. A little more cultural understanding and tolerance would have probably improved the whole vacation for some of the people writing reviews here. It is a great hotel that does well at accomodating all types of people. One point of interest for UK visitors - the staff generally speak OK-to-good English, but they are far most used to American accents rather than British, so you may find being understood slightly more difficult than the American visitors. We had several amusing moments in one of the hotel shops getting a lady from Chicago to just repeat what we said because the guy behind the counter understood her accent and not ours. The Food - well, the quality wasn't amazing but it was a buffet and they went all out to provide different styles of food and different options every day, which (from what people told us) was far different from some of the other hotels in the area. My advice, though, would be to eat in town at least a few times - as the standard of food is superior. We payed around 180 pesos for a good two course meal for two with drinks. That's around \u00a311 - can't be bad.Trips - Expensive. Even though you are in an all-inclusive, you are going to need a fair bit of money to go on the excursions. Be prepared to pay. And, if you do decide to go to Chichen Itza (which you should), it is 4-5 hours away by bus. Drinks - I actually drank less on this holiday than I normally do at home, because I'm a wine drinker and there didn't seem to be any good wines (although we found a nice California white in a shop in town). But, as others have said, ask for the exact brand you want in your drink otherwise you will get a cheapie. They have all the major brands, so you will have the choice.It was a fabulous place to stay, and I would recommend it to anyone - from ANYWHERE in the world.", "Date": "February 13, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Grand Haven, MI.", "Title": "\u201cThe best !!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1639689", "Content": "We just returned from the Iberostar Tucan Feb 7, 2004.

Many great spots taken by 8:00am. -$10.00 charge if you lose your towels. -Lots of topless sun bathing at beach - I tipped the maid $2.00 a day and she was very grateful- great towel art every day and, just a nice thing because many here are quite poor. - Walk south on beach from hotel for really nice, semi-secluded beaches. -Need to reserve restaurants a day in advance- limit two reservations then put on waiting list for choices. Mexican and Italian enclosed and nicer ambiance, Seafood restaurant is just regular beachside restaurant with a few props added for dinner. - Buidings #11 and 21 are closest to beach except junior suites that are on the beach. As numbers get larger, farther away from beach on each side. The upper floors are the best in my opinion- more breeze, many with views of the ocean, less musty smell. Large resort, lots of walking. -Shopping center just a five minute walk from resort had cheaper prices than going into Playa Del Carmen- we were surprised! - We rented a jeep at the rental counter inside the hotel. We went at noon. It was too hot so we came back. The rental company tried to tell us we damaged the jeep; we hadn't even gotten out of it. Threatened to get the hotel manager etc.. Be careful of this. If you rent, pay attention to his markings of prior damage to the car. Resolved ,but not fun. -Cancun airport often a real mess- especially on weekends. We waited 1 1/2 hours in the Northwest line to check in baggage, flight delayed over two hours, missed connecting flight in US etc...Allow enough extra time going home. -Water in bathrooms NOT potable- don't even rinse your toothbrush in it. Plenty of bottled water provided by hotel, extra in room fridge, more on request. I've been \"sick\" before in Mexico, much better to error on the side of being too careful. We ate everything in all restaurants in hotel- just really good even though a bit repetitive. - BEST guacamole in the world if you are a fan HAVE A WONDERFUL VACATION !!!!!", "Date": "February 9, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "carroll maryland", "Title": "\u201cHighly Recommended!\u201d", "Author": "HDJIMMY", "ReviewID": "UR1627284", "Content": "What can I say? My family and I have stayed at the Iberostar Tucan for the last three years in a row, and loved it each year. The service is superb, and the rooms are beautiful.

The surf was gentle compared to most places we stayed in the past, so that was a big plus. The restaurants were great, though some better than others. We enjoyed the Italian and Mexican the best when it came to reservations for both the cuisine and comfort. The buffet restaurant was plentiful, with varied highlighted foods and themes nightly. The shows were well performed, with also a different theme nightly, to keep it from being repetitious. The staffs worked from sun up, to sun down to both entertain and provide a clean and pleasant environment for its guests. The only complaints we had, were pretty much the rainy days we encountered staying there in the months of June and July. That is unfortunately the beginning of their rainy season, so that comes with the territory. Also there were some mosquitoes at the shows at night, and walking through the beautiful \"jungle walkway between the pool and restaurants, so pack some spray. The kids loved the soft serve ice-cream and snacks by the pool, and the adults enjoyed the free flowing drinks in the hot sun! Again, what can I say? Our annual vacation there is well worth the money spent. We are currently working with our travel agent on trying to find a different resort to stay at, but unfortunately after staying at the \"Tucan\" the others seem to fall short for us.

My husband and I stayed at the Iberostar from January 10-17 2004 and we had an absolutely great time. We chose this hotel solely on reading hours of reviews for hotels all over Riviera Maya and Cancun and found this one to be one with the most consistent good reviews. We weren't disappointed and I was so glad that i read all the reviews to get the helpful hints (like bringing a small clock for the room!) So I will, in return for all the great postings, post about my experience as well. THE ROOMS -- wow, totally beautiful....marble everywhere, on the floors, the countertops, the bathroom, and the shower. Very nice and classy. Carvings on the walls, plenty of places to sit -- there was a chair with a table and a long bench seat. There were no drawers for the clothes, but plenty of space to hang things up and shelves to put your clothes on in the closet. The bathroom is very good size with a wonderful shower with dual showerheads. In the shower there is bath gel and shampoo, but no conditioner, so I wish I would have brought some of that. They also have lotion for you to use. The minibar is nice with coke, diet coke, orange soda, sprite, fizzy water, bottled water, and a big 1 gallon plastic jug of water. I wish I would have taken others' suggestions and brought a water bottle so I could have kept it filled with water. Also, my husband drinks diet coke like it's going out of style, and they have tiny cups by the fountain machines so he was constantly refilling it. Would have been really convienent for us both to have travel cups of some sort. Also, as earlier mentioned, it was so nice to have a small alarm clock in our room...it's not necessary to know the time in this paradise, but it was convienent when needing to get up at a certain time for the early excursions. The bad part about the room -- the beds are hard as a big block of styrofoam. We are used to a very very soft mattress, so that kinda sucked...but after a long day of swimming and sun we didn't find it hard to go to sleep, but my husband had a sore neck a couple of days. Also, we requested a non-smoking room, but they didn't have any available so they told us that if we hated our room they would move us as fast as possible...however, the room didn't smell at all, no musty smell or cigarette smell or anything. A big suggestion -- if you don't mind climbing the 3 flights of stairs then request a third floor room....we had absolutely no noise and the view from our balcony was wonderful. I felt sorry for those people on the ground floor with no privacy from their patios. THE GROUNDS -- the beach is absolutely beautiful! Wonderful warm water, cool clean sand. We were told this was one of the busiest weeks (although that was accompanied by \"book your excursions quick\" so that could have been a lie) and it never felt crowded. Never more than 5 people in the pool or 10 people in the ocean at one time. Lots of sunbathers but we never had a problem finding great lounge chairs. Some topless sunbathers, but it wasn't really a problem...I think I only saw 2 a day, and they aren't allowed to be topless near the pool area, only at the beach. Lots of speedos, though!! The jungle areas are beautiful, lots of birds and other animals -- we got a brief glimpse of a monkey, but sure did hear them alot! It felt like the hotel was part of the jungle, it was so nice. THE FOOD -- What can I say, buffet paradise! There is food anytime between 7AM and 11PM if you want it. We got room service one day and it was very good and fast. We were at a big disadvantage because neither of us care for seafood at all, so we missed out on a big part of all the food. There seemed to be endless shrimp, lobster, fresh fish, etc everywhere. So we stuck to beef...there was very little chicken. Anyway, we were ready for different food by the time we got home, but it was great while we were there. We ate at the steak and mexican restaurant for our 2 alotted reservation dinners. Both were good, I was very impressed with the steak. Lots of places to get drinks. They have great frozen drink machines in all the bars and then they add as much alcohol as you want. We found that they were often joking with us if we didn't ask for extra alcohol! So I don't know why some people thought drinks were too weak..just tell 'em what you want! TIPPING -- We went with lots of dollar bills prepared to tip but to be honest, it didn't seem like anyone expected tips at all. When they served you a drink or brought room service, they took off before you could even reach into your pocket or bag to tip them. This was very nice becasue it would be extremely easy for them to make you feel as if you needed to tip. We did tip the maid every day and left her little notes and gifts...she treated us great, leaving cute towel art on our bed with flowers. She filled our fridge every day (even though they are only supposed to do it every other day) and left little extras like lots of lotion and an extra rug for our floor. Otherwise, the only people we tipped were the tour guides for our excursions and the nights we went to the reservation dinners. ETC -- A couple people posted that you should bring towels, but I'm glad we didn't. The beach towels were great and they gave you fresh ones as often as you wanted. We went to Chichen Itza and it was fabulous -- one tip -- don't bring your kids to this excursion unless they love a 6 hour bus ride and endless talking about history! A kid on our trip seemed bored out of his mind! Dolphin trip at Isla Mujeres was lots of fun, but really overpriced. We bought both trips through the Apple reps and in hindsight, the dolphin trip wasn't worth the $$. Okay, sorry for the ridiculous book I've just written. If you could possibly have any more questions please email me. But otherwise, but go, have a splendid time, and enjoy the paradise that the Iberostar Tucan offers!!", "Date": "January 19, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201chappy new year\u201d", "Author": "andyroo_7", "ReviewID": "UR1550968", "Content": "Just got back from a great new year spent at the Tucan,there are so many positives, but I dont think it is fair if you dont inform people of what are,in my opinion ,a couple of negatives.The first was my room,it was large and spacious with a great shower and two large beds with no worries about hard mattreses,the problem came when I looked out of my balcony.I was in room 1503 on the ground floor, and out the back was a dark dismal jungle with a big banana tree blocking out anything,all the rooms that side were devoid of any sunlight and this was the case in block 16 as well,the next problem happened every morning at 4am without fail,the cockerels started crowing and continued till people got up and moved them along ,these might sound petty things but after spending 3000 thousand pounds for my holiday you expect a little better,anyway I lasted four days before getting fed up and got another room straight away across the corridor in 1511,what a difference,it was bright and airy and sunny,the musty smell in 1503 was gone never to be smelt again,so I am just warning potential visitors to ask for a room looking out onto the back road away from the forest it will be worth it. Now the positives,the people were fantastic,what a friendly ,easy going race they are,they take every thing in their stride and just go about their jobs with little fuss but total effciency,the food was fabulous,even if the food was the same all the time,which it wasnt,the variety is so immense there is no way you could get fed up with it,chuck in the four restaurants and over a fortnight you have a mind boggling array of local and continental cuisine.The pool I cant comment on as I never went in it,I stayed down on the beach for the whole two weeks and never had any trouble getting beds or felt cramped or intimidated,some days the wind was strong and the waves did pound onto the beach and try to drag you back with it but there was always a guard handy to keep you out of trouble and I never saw anyone in trouble the whole two weeks.The weather was also good which helped,not as good as the Gambia where I spent last new year but a damn site warmer then England and I have come back with a nice tan .The entertainment team worked hard and put on some lavish shows and chucked in a couple of excellent singers as well,the only change I would have liked was the mini club for kids start earlier and then get them packed off out of the way,thats just a totally selfish view as mine have grown and flown but the kids werent really much of a problem and as there was no apparent babysitting service I guess there was nothing else anyone could do .I cant leave without the topless issue, a European thing I was told and yes that is probably true,although how a country as steeped in the porno industry and Hugh Hefner and his bunnies can be so prudish beggars believe,my wife was probably the largest woman on the beach who was topless ,god bless her ,she wasnt like the nymph ,svelt like figures that paraded up and down the beach front and I made her,grudgingly, put on her top when she went swimming to appease the natives and Americans,but we never had anything said and no one was ever spoken too as far as I am aware,so women,go there with the full knowledge that in this hotel at least you can come back with no strap marks for those backless summer dresses.To sum up we have had a glorious two weeks and have come back refreshed and raring to go ,would I go back?mmm difficult,probably not,not because of the people or their fantastic ancient cities and water park or the hotel,it was,for me ,just too far away and too much of a time difference,The Gambia are on the same time as us,when England were dancing in the new year it was 6pm in Mexico and felt really strange,the flights there and back were long and tedious and I couldnt wait for them to end and I used to love flying,so next year it will probably be Africa again but full marks to the Tucan and their lovely friendly staff,my wife and I will never forget them and can thoroughly recommend this hotel as long as you avoid the aforementioned pitfalls,any one need to know any more please feel free to e-mail me.", "Date": "January 14, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Ontario, Canada", "Title": "\u201cHeaven on earth!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1546853", "Content": "I have stayed at the Iberostar Tucan/Quetzel five times during the last six. Last year I tried the Iberostar Paraiso del Mar instead. Having been various places in the Caribbean over the years, once I found the Tucan, I just had to keep going back. I have gone twice on my own and was perfectly comfortable and safe as a woman alone. The staff were wonderful. I am always amazed at people who complain about little details, especially in service, that are compared negatively to hotels in Canada and the United States. It's Mexico for goodness sake! It's a different culture. They don't always get it right (according to our standards), but if you treat the people nicely, they'll do anything for you. They're lovely people and the minor mistakes and the fact that they operate on \"Mexican time\" is part of the charm. If you want a Canadian or American hotel, stay in Canada or America! I've always found the Iberostar resorts to be clean, safe with good food and a lovely, relaxed family atmosphere. My main complaint over the years has been the music -- they play too much Europop and bland American pop music. I wish they would play more Mexican music. Many people have complained about the watered down drinks. From speaking with the staff, I think it's a combination of cost saving and also wanting to limit the amount of alcohol people are ingesting. The staff have always been extremely accommodating if you request more alcohol in your drinks. I've also found that if you use the mini-bar in moderation and are pleasant with the maids, they tend to refill the fridge every day. Unfortunately, the beach has suffered severely over the years from erosion, which they have tried to stem. Once in the water, though, there are no rocks and the water is lovely. Sometimes the surf can be a bit rough, but because there is a huge sandbar and no undertow, the waves are actually fun rather than a problem for anyone other than a purely novice swimmer. I intend to keep going back -- I'll probably alternate between the Tucan and the Del Mar and will probably try the new Lindo at some point.

The best way endorsement that I can give the IBTQ is as follows: A local newpaper published the hotel occupancy rates for each zone on the Yucatan pennisula. Playacar kicked tail on every other region--80% compared to 50%. During this week, IBTQ was at 100% occupancy. With all of the dubious trip reports on the internet, many of which appear to be manufactured by the staff of struggling resort properties, this is one standard that you can rely on. I formally toured (or trespassed on) each resort in Playacar. While all are respectable, and some opulant, I still believe that IBTQ is the best all-around choice. What was hot: awesome white sand beaches, huge pool, pleasant rooms, gorgious grounds blended with a jungle, sipping (non-alcohaulic) drinks all day long, a humble and accommodating staff, well appointed buffet restaurants, and snorkling south of the Gala. Those features which were either wash-outs or non-existant: we never saw any evidence of a kids club. The ala-cart\"restaurants\" were only OK--no reason to get excited about. Most organized activities appeared to be forced. The spa was only token. There was no hot tub on the property, but who wants to be hot. We walked through the entertainment area several times but never felt the urge to sit. Even though we don't drink, we observed the swim-up bar several times. We were concerned with the number of adult fixtures drinking endlessly without getting up to use a restroom. Finding chairs at the pool or the beach was really no big deal. If your one of those people who will be bent out of shape all day long unless you have the best seat in the house, get up early. The first evening there, the heat and humidity seemed unbearable, but our bodies adjusted, and only became a problem on our Tulum and Chichen Itza tours. Of the 49 people-days in our group, two were spend with moderate levels of digestive sickness. We knew in advance that modesty would be an issue on the beach, but were a bit overwhelmed. We tended to camp out around the pool, and chose the more \"American\" areas on our visits to the beach. This is certainly an element that should be considered by parents (and wives). In short, the IBTQ certainly isn't perfect--vacation destinations never are.

We had read quite a few reviews before we left for vacation and had consulted a travel agent who recommended the place. There was hardly a negative comment online and I have to say, we were thoroughly impressed with the place. I would recommend it to anyone and I would stay at any Iberostar after this experience. The hotel was spotless, the staff incredibly friendly and the grounds exceptionally cared for. Tropical birds and fish circulate throughout, lending a very pleasing touch to this high quality hotel. The beach was great, never a problem finding a spot and the water was warm and the sand cool. Pleasant enought to spend the day and never too hot. The pool looked nice, but we don't travel from bone chilling New England to sit at a pool. The buffet was plentiful and of course drinks were never-ending and not too watered down. One minor complaint about the food: the steak restaurant had a great seafood platter of appetizers, but since my husband doesn't eat fish he had nothing to choose from. A really minor problem- for him. We preferred the Mexican Restaurant. One other \"complaint\" was the incessant Celine Dion Christmas CD that played in the buffet dining room. We lived through it . Our room was very comfortable and private with no noise from any other rooms. The bed was hard, yes. Not a big deal and if that is the biggest complaint I have on vacation, so what? Really, you only notice these small things because you get so spoiled by how nice the place is, almost perfect! We also barely knew anyone was around. The week of our vacation was the last week of the slow season, very temperate (low 80's) and a great choice for a getaway before the holidays. We skipped the night shows, preferring to seek the beach, even in the dark, it was truly romantic. The Playacar area of hotels is really special, very upscale and you can walk to the little village to shop for souvenirs with little hassle from the vendors hawking time-shares. Playa del Carmen is a different animal, with shop owners hassling anyone who strolls by. These guys hawking are just irritating and really turned us off, there is nothing charming about it. I would not recommend shopping there, go get a drink at Senor Frogs to say you went, and maybe check out the beach, that's it. This was our second time in the area, after staying in Cozumel 5 years ago. Not much has changed in this little town. Cozumel is worth a day trip but we really preferred the mainland. We like to snorkel and took 2 excursions through the hotel and TNT travel. I had thought about trying to find some of the cenotes ourselves and I am glad I didn't. Many of the areas are privately owned with exclusive contract arrangements. Not to mention that such out of the way places are not exactly easy to find. Go with the tour. Spend a few bucks and get the real deal. The guides were great for both of our trips and we met some really fun and nice people from the U.S. and Europe. We had small groups (10-20) for both trips, making the experience very personalized. We did the Mayan Adventure and did 3 different snorkeling spots. Akumal's Yal-Ku Lagoon was the best of the the three, starting in brackish (salt and fresh) water and slowly drifting out to sea. We also visited an open and a closed cenote (caves connected by underground river), which were both fascinating and very different than reef snorkeling. No fish to speak of but incredible scenery. Our second trip was by Alltournative to the underground river system of Nohoch Nah Chich through the \"jungle\" via Unimog (a jeep like vehicle). We started on a farm with 2 different cenotes and then a reef trip via kayak. The Unimog ride was rough as they try to get the passengers thinking about 4-wheeling as it was meant to be. Lunch was served on the farm on both trips where the cenotes were located. Good food, and yes, even Corona (Mayan Adventure). We had a blast and enjoyed it much more than Xel-ha, which we had done before. X-Caret sounded way too commercialized for us. These special side trips are really great. You get some different types of snorkelling and really see some beautiful areas without crowds. The guides are knowledgeable about the area and are very willing to answer questions about the region and the traditions. FYI, these excursions are geared for adults and not for small children.

We felt very safe and felt very safe with our daughter going to our other family's rooms alone.

If you are there for more than 3-4 days the food kinda gets old since they serve almost the same food each night, but it is always good. The drinks are great, I suggest the Blue Hawaiian, or the rum punch. A little advice the fishing isn't great in Playa so I really wouldn't waste my money and if you do decide to fish, book it at the Hotel not downtown, we got screwed and the fishing sucked. We also went to Xcaret, which was beautiful, but if you want to go for snorkeling, go to Xel-ha. Also if you like to snorkel, go on the snorkeling trip from the Hotel.

We were there for 7 days and got one of the Jr. suites with an ocean view. The jr. suites are just a little bigger than the regulare rooms, so unless the ocean view is most important to you, I suggest save the extra money and get one of the regular rooms. The room overall was very nice. I was a little disappointed it the minibar. They only stock it with sodas and beer. I thought there would be coctail stuff in there too. But oh well, it was still nice to have. The maids turned down the beds and left chocolates every day with some beautiful design with the towels. That was great. The hotel grounds are VERY beautiful!!! The Tucan side is very beautiful, but the Quetzel side is amazing. There are actually two Iberostars (The Tucan and the Iberostar Quetzel) sharing the property. You are allowed to enjoy both properties amenities. The Tucan side is more busy than the Quetzel side. Each side has a buffet and both had a wonderful selection of foods. We found the Quetzel buffet to be more tranquile. It's smack in the middle of waterfalls and trees. It's just beautiful. Everyday we loved walking through the jungle grounds. There are peacocks, chickens, monkeys, just roaming around. My little boy got a huge kick out of all the animals. They advertise a lot of restaurants, but you are only guaranteed 1 night reservation for every 3 nights of stay. Then you have to be on a waiting list if you want to eat in them on the other days. If you are open to the reservation times, you will have no problem getting in. We ate in the steakhouse and the Mexican restaurant. Both were very good and the service excellent. We are not seafood lovers, but I talked to someone who said it was very good. The pool is huge and very beautiful. But the hot tub in the middle is cold. We were so disappointed to swim to it and find it was cold. But there are hot tubs in the spa. There is a palapa by the pool where they give massages or you can get one in the spa too. The beach is lovely. It is very busy right in front, so if your like us and don't want to be around a lot of people, off to the edge of the property there is a lot less people. The property is the 2nd to the last on the beach. So if you walk just a little bit south there is a nice streatch of beach with no hotels just beach. Its real nice to spend some time that way. Overall the trip was great. This property is very family oriented and our little boy had a blast. If your a couple who doesn't want kids around don't worry because it's not overwhelmed with children. There is a beautiful adult swim up bar and pool. We sometimes were wishing we could be there. Ha, Ha. The only thing I didn't like about the property is at breakfast and lunch, the employees who do the entertaining and excercise programs are told to invite themselves to eat with the guests. The first time it happened to us was at breakfast. It was a beautiful girl there on an exchange program from the Netherlands. Actually we really enjoyed talking to her. She was very sweet. At first we thought she was just lonley. So we didn't mind her joining us. But at every lunch and breakfast we noticed all the employees entering and soon asking to join people at their meals. We found ourselves hurring to finish or think of an excuse (so as not to be rude) to tell the person not to join us. We did notice they ate at the end of meal time. Like when breakfast was just about to close or late lunch. So we started trying to eat early. We weren't trying to be snobish, but we are very private people and enjoying our family time alone. We get so few of it at home. I would recommend this property to everyone!!! This is our 5th trip. We stayed at the Cancun Palace then the Moon Palace and the last two years at the Allegro Playacar. The Iberostar beat them all overall, especially with the selection of food.

Just returned after 1 week. Loved it. Tips: Taxis: Make sure they're a/c works well. Our preferred form of transportation. Cheap and clean for the most part. Trips: Do Tulum ruins. Take the tram and buy your Xel-Ha tickets there. There is a booth right next to the tram booth where you can save about 10% for your all-inclusive tickets to Xel-Ha. Normally, they're about $56. When we were there, we purchased them for $50 and did not have to stand in the Xel-Ha lines to buy tickets. Just walked right in. Trust me, if you just buy the admission, then have food, drinks and/or rent gear, you will pay a lot more than for your all inclusive ticket. Pool/Beach: It might have been the time of year, but we didn't have any problems finding a spot...either in the sun or shade. Contrary to the previous male poster, we found the topless scene to be enjoyable. To each his own. No big deal, unless you bring the rug rats. Hammocks & Playa del Carmen: Buy a map from www.mapchick.com. Great help on best places to go. We bought 2 family (huge) Mayan hammocks from the recommended vendor and paid $60 total. We saw others paying $70-85 for just one! Most unusual spot: Try the \"OM\" bar just south of the Blue Parrott. You can sip your favorite drink and toke from a mid-eastern bong filled with aromatic tobaccos and liquor. I'm a non-smoker, but I and the other non-smokers in our group found the experience to be a lot of fun. Phone calls: My cell phone worked just fine. I saw many other people using theirs also. Internet: The internet cafe in the resort worked just fine for me. There are many others elsewhere. Dress: Forget the \"dress code\" issue at the ala carte restaurants. We saw all sorts of clothing worn there with no one being tossed out. Pack light. No worries. Tipping: We brought some \"thank you\" note cards with an appreciative message in Spanish for our housekeeper each day. We left $3 each day along with some innexpensive but nice perfume, makeup, Christmas ornaments, etc., to leave her each day. We were treated like royalty! We would occassionally tip a bartender a buck or two after they had served us a few drinks, but never felt obligated to leave anything. We just appreciated the fine service. Europeans: Yes, most have the filthy habit (smoking) and are a bit standoffish, but we just ignored them if they ignored us. They seemed more embarrassed than snooty. There was enough beach, food and pool for everyone to have a great time and the restaurants had huge sections where smoking was NOT allowed. I think Iberostar is getting the hint that most prefer their food without the smelling Camels. Montezuma: He will probably visit you or someone in your party before you get back home. It's usually not too bad and will be controlled with one or two doses of over-the-counter medication. Most of it is because of us overindulging on fruit. The mangos and papayas are great. Drink: The buffets in the morning serve all sorts of fruit juice. You MUST try the banana juice which will always be on the far right end of all the juices. It's great! Airport: A breeze coming an going. No worries, just get to the airport about 3 hours before departure on your way home and you'll survive the long lines waiting for the customs munchkins to rummage through all your suitcases. Last thought: Go there ready to appreciate the friendliness of these wonderful Mexican people.

While I have to admit the food did eventually get old, if I were someone who tried more types of foods, there would've been plenty of variety to get through the week. I found all the staff to be incredibly helpful and curteous and you just can't beat the scenery from this place (MUCH better than crowded Cancun).

Snorkeling and the new \"SNUBA\" craze is what we enjoyed the most - anyone over 8 could SNUBA at XCARET and our 11-year-old had the best time of his life doing that (get to go down about 15-25 feet with oxygen but are tethered to the surface with the air hoses -- safe and fun).

The grounds are incredible, and even contain a jungle in the middle of the property... As for our room, we upgraded to an ocean front junior suite which also located us very close to the pool. (By the way, we recommend reserving lounge chairs on your way to breakfast to get a good location). We agree with other reviews that the beds feel, at first blush, quite hard; however, we all slept extremely well. The room was a very good size and immaculate. Our minibar was replenished everday and each day had towel art left by the housekeeper.This was our first experience with an all-inclusive resort and we are sold. As someone who is basically cheap and gets annoyed every time the bill is presented after a meal or round of drinks, I was surprised how much stress went out of the trip without having to deal with that. Overall, the food was very good. We'd agree that the dinner buffet starts to get a bit routine and that it's a good idea to vary things by going to one of the specialty restaurants. We went to the Italian and Mexican restaurants and have to recommend taking advantage of the appetizer buffets there, as it was some of the best food we found at the resort.Our son loved the kids' camp, and so did we...He eagerly spent the lion's share of each day at the camp and had a great time. The constantly changing activities there kept him thoroughly entertained and he made many friends, including staff member, Maria Cruz. We have recommended the Iberostar to many friends and would go back in an instant. We've been to Hawaii a number of times, but this was our first visit to Mexico.

Be aware that there are many Europeans at the resort, and many of them smoke. Since most of the resort is open-air, it is not as bad as it sounds (and they do have non-smoking sections in the eating areas), but if you absolutely hate smoke, you might try another location. 2.

We were there last August and if anything, it's gotten better. Most things were the same, but the lobby bar is now a full bar with seats and an area with small tables and waitress service. Beautiful stained glass of tucans on the side wall. Last year it was a regular room in the 16 building by the buffet, this year it was a Junior Suite on the Oceanfront. The volleyball court was RIGHT outside our balcony, but with the glass doors shut you couldn't hear a sound. The staff is amazing. Always smiling, always friendly, just say \"Ola\" when you pass anyone on the path, at the beach, etc. and their faces light up. We recognized a couple of bartenders and a captain (supervisor?) from last year - Raul and Jose - and told them we remembered them...they were so happy! Raul always had a smile for us, talked to us about family, etc, knew exactly how we liked our margaritas...Jose was great, we hugged goodbye! Every night he was by the lobby bar and would come over and ask what we did that day, how things were....they really are wonderful people that work there. The buffet was amazing as usual - Thursday was still Lobster night (Happy Thanksgiving, who needs turkey!) I took the chefs picture at the grill and he was all smiles! We did try the SteakHouse one night (on the advice of a Texan no less!) and we'll stick to the buffet from now on. Let's be honest, it's not Morton's....they tried, but, unless you LOVE The Sizzler, stick to the buffet! The room was beautiful as before, we love the hard bed, best sleep we get is at the Iberostar! The bathroom is gorgeous, all marble, just make sure you put the towel on the floor, it gets slippery when wet! The walk in shower is amazing, especially if you are on your honeymoon <wink wink> as it fits two VERY comfortably.... The jungle is plush as ever, the monkeys were extremely animated this past week - jumping onto the roof of the club, etc...so cute! I was \"chased\" by an iguana, my husband think I'm insane, but he startled me! The pools were a bit chilly this time of year (last time we were there in August). The beach was great, there were waves this time! We had fun playing in them...took a long walk down the beach to the uninhabited stretch - there's a lovely bay with a huge rock where the pelicans hang out. Take your camera! We did walk to the Plaza Playacar this time, nicely decorated for Christmas, but the hotel shops were cheaper and had the same stuff. We went on two excusions - a fishing/snorkeling trip with Adventura Mexicana. We made the reservations with our GoGo reps (Carlos and Alex, great guys!) in the lobby. BEST TIME EVER! The crew was great, friendly, funny, helpful...we went trolling and bottom fishing (Mayan style). I actually caught a fish! Then one crew member (Looks just like Derek Jeter, I swear!) took myself and my husband for a private snorkel on the reef. Schools of fish, beautiful! Again, take your underwater camera! Friday we went horseback riding at the Rancho Loma Bonita - again set up by the Gogo guys - rode thru the jungle out to a private beach, then they take the saddles off a few horses and you ride them into the water bareback and hang on as they swim. Very cool! Oh, the shows. Admittedly, cheesy...but still entertaining. The Latin Show and the Mexicana show were both great. The kids who do the entertaining are amazing.

It has a pretty setting, and they've managed to maintain the jungle in the middle of the hotel. The rooms were fairly large and comfortable (although it would be nice if they included bureau/drawers.) There were shelves in the closet. They maintained the room, and the mini bar was always restocked. The food was medicre, at best. My friends and I are probably a bit more critical coming from the NYC metro area. But we found that the specialty 'restaurants' were not great at all. We ate at the Seafood, Mexican, and the Italian. The Italian one, surprisingly, was the best one of the three. Also, if you want to, you can sign up for more than the two nights in a serve restaurant if you put your name on a waiting list the morning you would like to try a restaurant. Some people we met ate at the Steak restaurant, and said it wasn't good. Actually, the buffet was better than the restaurants for the most part. At least you could get something you would like. Food was uneven. Some of the food at buffet was delicious, other food medicre or worse. Breakfast buffet was very good. Especially having omelets made every morning to your liking. Most of the people that worked at the hotel were very nice and accommodating. They were pleasant and helpful. There was one person during our stay that we didn't care for....the lifeguard. He was fairly rude. Unfortunately, we had red flags at the ocean quite frequently. I went to ask him a question about other areas of Playa for beach, and he pretended not to speak english...or spanish for that matter. (I can speak enough Spanish to get by). Not until his friends started answering me, did he start to speak. He was always yelling at people to get out of the water, yet all the hotels around us had people swimming in them, at their discretion. But mainly, my complaint was he was rude. Speaking of beach. This beach is not what I pictured. If you are looking for the calm water you find in the Caribbean, it wasn't here. Not sure if it was the time of year we went, but I've been to islands at this exact time every year, and never saw such rough water. I was disappointed, although my traveling friends do not mind the rough water since they are very good swimmers. The pool was refreshing and pleasant....but what was with the jacuzzi/hot tub in the middle? It was not hot! And the water surrounding it was deep, so if you didn't swim, you couldn't get to it. Swim up bar was a lot of fun. Nice way to end a day, or refresh yourself from the sun. We had monkey sitings, as promised. You just have to be a bit patient. It's easier to see them in the mid to late afternoon. They tend to hang out behind the towel pick up area. Saw lots of other animals on a regular basis....and flamingos, turtles, tucan, etc.. The disco is so-so. We wound up going into town. Of course it was low season, so town wasn't hopping all that much either. The lobby bars were very nice....although one of my traveling companions found it very warm/stuffy in that area, since everything is open air, and the air didn't circulate well in that area. Ask for the good tequila in your drinks....Hornitos. The lobby bars close fairly early...I think around 11:00. Going to town or the ferry boat to Cozumel is a $4 taxi ride. They don't have pay phones that work with your major credit or calling card or prepaid cards (which are actually the cheapest way to go)! They charge $5.00 a MINUTE to call US!!! We walked to a small strip mall up the street to purchase prepaid, and use the local pay phones. One of my friends needed to call home, and only left a message (1 minute), and was charged $10 US!! from the room. The shows are sort of goofy. We never stayed. But I have to summarize and say, this place is really good for couples and families. The kids and couples liked the shows. Also, I think it's a great deal for families with kids! Knowing where you food is coming from....I would recommend for them. For singles....I think, personally, it's more fun to stay on local beach in town, and eat out everyday.

We had honeymooned in Cancun but wanted someplace similar but quieter for our anniversary. Playa del Carmen was perfect! We had never stayed at an All-Inclusive before. The Tucan was amazing! We arrived at noon and thought we might have to wait until 3 p.m. to officially check-in but we got a room right away. However, we had requested a non-smoking room and had to wait till the next day to move to that one. There is only one non-smoking building (#15). Unless you have a problem with stairs, ask for a 2nd or 3rd floor room so you have a balcony. Otherwise you have a porch that is not very private. 3rd floor balconies even have a thatched roof. Maria Caroline at the reception area helped us with our room switch and answered several of our questions over the week. She was wonderful and was our favorite employee at Tucan. The room was great (loved the marble floors and marble shower), food was great (so wonderful to not have to wonder where to eat and how to get there!) and the beach beautiful. The pool was beautiful but that is the only comment I can make since we only passed it each day to get to the beach! The beach was wonderful and we were always able to find chairs under palapas even though the hotel seemed to be filled to capacity. Possibly because of this, offers were made to spend a night at the new Iberostar Lindo or 1-2 nights at the Iberostar Cozumel. Even though I was tempted to take the offer at the Lindo since it had just opened that week, we would have had to check out of the Tucan and then check back in when we returned (and no guarantee of the same room). That made our decision very easy and we did not take the offer. Even if you have a phone card, there is a $5 connection fee from the room, so we made our phone calls from the Playacar shopping area that is 5 minutes from the hotel. Look for the 2 telephones marked TELMEX. Before you leave home, be sure to call the customer service number listed on the back of your phone card to the specific information about calling home. Also, be aware that a phone card that has 600 US minutes equates to just 66 minutes from Mexico. We enjoyed our visit to Playa del Carmen except for the time share people. However, they were worse at night than in the daytime. We took the ferry to Cozumel just to do some some shopping and sightseeing. It was the longest 35 minutes (each way) of my life...bad case of motion sickness! Tipping: We knew it wasn't required but took several $1 bills as advised by several of the reviews I read. We tipped the maid the first couple of days hoping to see some the towel artwork that I had read others refer to. We saw none of that although we did get chocolates the last couple of nights. We tipped a few other employees over the week that were extra nice. However, everyone was nice and it was so refreshing to want to tip people instead of feeling like it is expected. Take money, I promise you that you will want to tip! There is only two things that would make this resort better. 1) There should be a complimentary shuttle to the Iberostar Parisio Beach. Even though they advertise exchange priviledges, it would cost you a $17 cab fare each way to get there. 2) It would also be nice if bikes were complimentary. The only way they are is on a daily group bike ride to Playa del Carmen. We took no tours because we had done the tour thing 10 years ago and wanted to take full advantage of the resort. It was easily the best vacation we have ever had! There is a reason that the Iberostar Tucan is rated #2 (only behind the Royal Hideaway) with TripAdvisor users.

I have stayed at some first-class resort properties in the U.S. and NONE have been as clean as this property. The food was average as I expected it would be. The drinks were as stiff or waek as you wanted them to be. Not many kids this time of year and tons of Europeans. The floor shows were OK and the disco was fun. A few honeymooners but mostly couples over 45. Not a party place which was fine with me. Beach was awesome, water just the color of any brochure you have seen. Hotel employees were friendly and helpful. Pool was fantastic. It did take me about a day to get used to the topless sunbathers on the beach. I wanted to return with my husband and two boys ( ages 12 & 9) in June but I may rethink that because of the topless sunbathing. Took the Loma Bonita horseback riding trip( I am not a horse lover but my sister-in-law owns her own horse) and it was alot of fun. The ranch was clean and the employees there were great. They served lunch and I ate everyhting they offered and did not get sick. I agree with the other reviews that the meat is far from U.S.D.A but the fish and pasta are fine.

The grounds are beautiful, the pool is exceptional, rooms are okay, the buffet is plentiful and we found it to be better than the ala carte dining. We ate at the Italian restaurant, which was pretty good, but the Steakhouse was way below our expectations. We swam with dolphins on Cozumel and enjoyed it very much, but bring your own underwater camera, their pictures are outlandishly priced although we did buy two of them. The beds are way to hard and the pillows are flat as pancakes, but never-the-less we slept well. My daughter felt uncomfortable because she was constantly being whistled at my hotel employees, but when dealing with anyone on a one to one basis they were all friendly and courteous. My two major complaints are this-One night they had tables set up and merchants were there hawking their wares, they will do anything to try and sell their merchandise, including lying and overcharging. The hotel should not allow this, it left a really bad taste, and makes the hotel seem tacky and not quite up to their 5 star advertising. Also, they allow fairly high pressure sales when inquiring about excursions. It is way cheaper to rent a car and go on your own. However, we did the Mayan Adventure and it was alot of fun. This was our first trip to Mexico and I wish we had had more time there, there is alot to do nearby and we did not have enough time, lying by the pool took presidence for a few days. It is difficult to find a lounge by the pool at certain times, but there was always loungers on the beach. Our room was oceanfront which was very nice, though not what you would consider to be 5 star. All in all, I think that for the price of the trip we did get our money's worth and then some.

Its gated and has good security. The town of PlayadelCarmen is a little rough but is very charming overall. THE BEACH: Very nice. Turquise water(not ice blue like some). The sand is very smooth and there are plenty of chairs. No worries about the beach. There are about 15-20 resorts along this same beach. You can walk up and down and sort of check them out.(There are topless Euros everywhere though). THE RESORT: Very clean and well organized. Rooms are a little far apart but not a huge problem. Its about 200 yards from the lobby to the beach and the rooms are between the two. I would not call the resort georgous or luxurious. Simple but nice is a better description. THE ROOMS: Good sized but not huge like the Palace or some other resorts in the area. No hot tub. Views are pretty weak in all but there is some jungle(or as those of us from the south would call it, trees) to look at. You get a king(or 2 doubles) and a small couch and balcony. Beds are a little hard but no big deal. THE FOOD: Good for an all inclusive, but still a little off. The quality is ok for the most part but its just not going to taste the same as home. Understand that before you go and the food will not dissapoint you too bad. Go to town to a resturant a couple of times to break it up. Drinks were about the same. Top shelf liqour available upon request but the mixers were cheap. Not too bad though. The \"specialty\" restaurants were pretty weak. We ate at the Italian, Mexican and Steak House. Let me just say, dont get your hopes up. The Italian and the Mexican were the best. The steak house served a bland piece of meat, 1/3 of an overcooked baked potato with a little sour cream on it, and 1/4 of a corn on the cob.(Weak) OVERALL: Nice resort that wont dissapoint, but no 5 star( I gave it 5 stars considering what you get for the $$ which was awesome). Service was very good but they do not pamper you and many do expect a tip. There were A LOT OF EUROPEANS. You can tell from many reviews that they dont particularly like Americans and they show it. There are topless and speedos all over the place. Dont expect conversation or even a return hello. Thats the worst part about the resort.

We also went on the Dolphin Discovery and that to me was the best day ever in my life I swam with the dolphins which has been my dream 'to do' thing for such a long long time - we bought the video and that too was so professional done. Our last trip was to X-har (pronounced shel-ha) where my friend Kathy and I went snorkelling - the fish are amazing - huge rays - massive parrot fish and fish of every colour you can imagine - this too was a brilliant day for me. It was our friend Patricia's birthday on that day and she just sat and chilled out and was very patient with us while we had fun in the water.The evening shows were really really good - the whole of the entertainment staff where so professional and very pleasant to everyone.The beach and ocean is a WOW - when you first see it - the sea is just so turquoisey blue. We saw 2 weddings on the beach while we were there which was a bonus.The pool was great and we especially like to go into the Hot Tub in the centre of the pool and drinks our Margaritas, there is also a swim up bar adult pool which is very pleasant.We managed to get some lovely photos of the wild life all around us - the monkeys, Mr. Tucan, the little mousy animals, the Flamingoes and lots of other birds ect.The only thing that I can tell you to do is - if you go to Tulum Ruins - you must take some mosquitto cream of spray with you or else you will get bitten very badly.I WISH YOU ALL A WONDERFULL TIME AT THIS BEAUTIFULL HOTELLuv Paula, Patricia and Kathy xxx", "Date": "November 5, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baltimore, MD", "Title": "\u201cThis place is wonderful\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1437772", "Content": "My boyfriend and I went to Mexico in October of 2003.

The grounds are lovely, jungle, beautifully lit at night. Lots of wildlife, birds, chickens, litttle brown rodent-types called seracas. The monkeys returned on our 4th or 5th day (from wherever they go) and were really cool. Entertainment at night in the bars (guitarist, violinist) and on the beach during the day (strolling mariachis). The shows at night were pretty good, some skits, but great singers, musicians and dancers. Not as much lip-synching as at the Palladium. The star friends were a talented, friendly group. The clientele was mainly European and we did see some topless beachgoers. This hotel is not as large as the Paraiso or Palladium so you do not have to walk as far. We stayed near the restaurants and were close enoughto grab coffee and take it to our rooms in the morning. Went to Cozumel which is a wicked trip when the sea is rough. Take dramamine! Checked out the Iberostar in Cozumel which is very small and most people were obviously there to scuba dive. The Tucan staff was super and couldn't do enough for you.

Uncomfortable beds? Not hardly - I got the best sleep I've had in years. The employees of the hotel seemed to go out of their way to be helpful. Most of the time I couldn't even light my own cigarette. I don't think I ever finished a drink at the bar before another one was at my table. The food? We ate at the Italian restaurant one night - the food and atmosphere were superb. The rest of the time we ate at the buffets. The food there was very good, and we got something different every time. The pool was not too warm, as I have read in some reviews. The adult pool was actually kind of chilly, which was great in the heat of the day. What was most impressive was the beach and the ocean - especially early in the morning. Clear and blue. My wife doesn't like the water, but even she was neck deep before it was over. I read about how crowded the hotel is, but it didn't seem crowded at all. We always found a good lounging spot whenever we wanted. If you get a chance, try to take the sunset cruise. The sunset from the water is beautiful, and the lobster afterwards was delicious. A quick aside to Jessica. I couldn't have lost the \"La Cucaracha\" gargling contest to a more worthy opponent. This was BY FAR the best experience we've ever had in Mexico. I would recommend the Iberostar Tucan to everyone. And we will definitely return next summer - if not sooner.

I didnt really spend that much time at the pool because I personally like the beach a lot better. The only complaint I would have is that sometimes you couldnt find a place to sit by the beach and pool. A lot of people would wake up really early to get a spot and I am not one of those early birds. The water was beautiful and all the water activties were great. One of the best parts of the trip was the staff. The nicest staff EVER at a hotel. They would help you in any way you needed it. The food also amazing! I love the buffet and ate there every day. The resturants were ok but I liked the buffet much better. The drinks are unlimited. You can start at 9 am if you wanted to! Also the night life was amazing. You wont want to leave the resort. We would all watch the show every night, go to the discotech to dance or just go back to the room for a early start to the next day.

The quality of the restaurants and the food available were of a very high standard. There was never any danger of going hungry or thirsty through lack of choice either. And, like scores of other reviewers, we can't praise the staff highly enough. They really made the place (and our vacation) with their hard work and ready smiles. However, the big, big letdown were the rooms. Given the hotels five-star plus rating, we had expected to be using adjectives such as sumptuous, palatial, luxurious or superb. In reality, the best descriptions we could muster were small, adequate and spartan. We've had rooms in two-star hotels that have been every bit as big and every bit as well appointed. Neither of us expected that we'd have to live out of our suitcases due to lack of closet and drawer space, but that's what we had to do.

To see the jungle lit up is lovely and makes you feel like you are really in the tropics. The pool is huge, the only downfall were the Texans who felt they had to smoke in the pool!!! I had a nasty experience when i nearly swallowed a cigarette butt while swimming along. The pools are cleaned constantly during the day so i think i was just unlucky! Finally the staff... Well I cannot express how amazing they are. They bring you cocktails while you are sunbathing, they are all very friendly and never stop smiling. Their smiles never left their faces.

You can walk along the beach - and at one end of the beach (towards the rocks), you can enjoy decent, but free, snorkeling.....if you take the little train that is marked \"beach\" it will lead you to a bunch of \"private\" beaches.Hotel - Gorgeous - very well taken care of.Rooms - Nicely sized, all have balconies - asked and got Building 1200 - a must if you want to be close to beach and pool. And, if you have to head to lobby or restaurants, and see one of the bellboys with a golf cart - just give them a holler, and they will GLADLY pick you up, and drop you off. (its a 6-7minute walk from building 1200 or 1100 to the lobby) The bathroom is nice - two shower heads were a joy. Tip the maid couple of bucks each day, and you will get all your stuff orgainized, well stocked fridge, and chocolates. I left $5 one day for the heck of it, and we came back to rose petals on our bed!!!Restaurants - you can go to 2 ala carte restaurants per week - we went to the (1) Mexican Restauant - very good. Appetizers and deserts are buffet style. The tamales at the appetizer buffet are out of this world. I was happy with this choice of restarant. Then we went to the (2) Tropical Restarant. This was OK. Its outdoors close to the beach (they redecorate teh lunch buffet restaurant). I would NOT recommend this restaurant.Couple of notes - when you make reservation for restaruant, which you should do the first night you check in or next morning, they have menus you can look at. Secondly, note that the Mexican and Italian restauratns are air conditioned - the Steakhouse and Tropical are outdoors -hence you can wear \"bermuda shorts\" to the outdoor restaruants. However, its not THAT hot at night. But, I probably would have went to the Italian place for the A/C if I had realized this earlier. Buffets - decent - some things are great, others decent. It gets boring after awhile. But, the food is good. The room service menu is limited - but, and it came in handy couple of times, and theyare very prompt to deliver it. Good tip - while you are waiting for you bags to arrive upon checkin, order a sandwich or chicken fingers - thats what I did, and it hit the spot!SHOWS: I was actually impressed with these. Only went to two, but they were quite good. And, it does, at times, get goofy and amateurish, which is quite funny. (for example, a Spinal Tap moment, when on \"movie night\" one of the performers playing Darth Vador got stuck in the \"spaceship\" he was trying to get out of).POOL: Gorgeous, and ohhh so warm. The pool bar is thankfully separate - as I noticed on one day, a big Texan, who was in there from the time I got up, and still there on our way to dinner!!! No kidding! Perhaps thats why it was so warm in there!WATERSPORTS: the usual - but extra slow service at the desk....ACTIVITIES: Non Stop - Voleeyball, water aerobics, bike rides - its non stop. If you want to do some shopping - don't spend the $10 roundtrip for the taxi to Playa Del Carmen (unless you want to). Take a NICE walk to Playacar, to the little shopping plaza across from the Riu resort. Its a nice walk, and very safe and pretty street. Lots of tourists.

My husband had a steak at the steak house that he said was one of the best he had ever had. I had the ribs and they were plentiful and very good! The buffets have different food every nite, so it doesn't get old at all!

The weather was so perfect...plenty of sun and a few showers here and there, so don't worry if it shows yucky weather. The jungle surrounding the hotel was really really cool, with monkeys, iguanas, these big rat looking things ?, roosters, geckos, flamingos, etc, etc. The pool was big and we had no problems finding chairs to sunbathe on. The adult pool is much cooler than the regular pool. Oh, and the beach!!!! My first time to the beach and it breathtaking! The sand was so white and the water was so clear!

The only thing we did away from the resort was the Mayan Adventure, which is an all day snorkeling trip. Very cool! You go to three places...a freshwater lagoon, a cenote or cave (very cold), and a lagoon that is a mix of freshwater and saltwater (the best one). It was worth the trip if you like to snorkel.

From the arrival at the Cancun Airport, the FUN began!!! Our shuttle ride to the Iberostar was great! Didn't take long to get there. When we arrived, check-in was a breeze! We were given a ride with our luggage by a bellboy who was very friendly; in fact, every single person who worked there (and there are a lot of people who work there) are absolutely wonderful! They work harder than most I've ever seen (besides my husband) and are so friendly! We stayed in a junior suite in building 20, which is oceanfront, near two restaurants and close to the pool without being right at the pool. Everything we needed was accessible. The rooms are clean, air-conditioned and well-kept by the staff. They stock the fridge each day with plenty of bottled water, sodas and Superior beer (which was quite good). The food in the various restaurants was very good; we were never sick and it was plentiful, especially at the main buffet restaurant near the lobbies (one for Quetzal and one for Tucan). It doesn't really matter which side you're on; they're both very nice. We stayed 5 nights and made reservations for the a la carte dining for 2 nights; one on \"steak night\" and the other for \"seafood\". The steaks were cooked as ordered and were very tender and delicious. The seafood was good as well. Breakfast at the restaurant up front near the lobbies was awesome! You can get anything you'd ever eat at breakfast; omelettes made to order, pancakes, waffles, fruit, cereal and milk, coffee, juices, etc. I have to say at this point that the coffee is the best I've ever had! The Espresso w/cream is superior! I regret not finding out what kind of coffee they serve and buying it to bring home. Lunch at the beachfront restaurant near the pool was super! I would recommend the chicken fajitas with green/red peppers and onions on warm tortillas......DELICIOUS!!! The beach is absolutely pristeen! The palapas are wonderful for shade, the sand....soft and white. The water was clear and a gorgeous color! We took the ferry over to Cozumel, but wish we had gone over when there were no cruise ships docked there; that made for very crowded streets. The club, called The Mascara, at the Iberostar opens at 10:30pm to 3:00am. The DJ there is GREAT!! He plays all kinds of music and there was a different theme or time period of music each night we went. The staff that performs in the theatre also gets everyone playing games on the beach, at the pool, gives salsa dancing lessons in the afternoons, and they all hit the club about 30 minutes after they open once they've changed their costumes, etc. from the theatre. Great bunch of people! Loved them! And boy, can they dance! If you like tequila, try the \"tequila boom-boom\" shots. They are wonderful!! We arrived on Monday morning (9/8/03) and stayed until Saturday (9/13/03). The weather couldn't have been better; sunny each and every day; had a full moon on Tuesday night, which was breathtaking! You owe it to yourself to go to Xcaret. We did not go there on a tour because we wanted to go on our own. It cost $5.00 to take a taxi there, admission ($49.00)and that was it! You will not spend a lot of money in Mexico because prices are very good. Xcaret was the most awesome park I've ever been to in my life! There's a butterfly farm, bat cave, an hour-long underground river ride (fantastic!), jaguars, turtles, beautiful birds, flamingos, beach area, restaurants on the premises with wonderful cold drinks. Try the \"Coco Loco\". WHEW!! You can pay additional cost to swim with the dolphins here; my 21-year old daughter did that and I got some great shots of that!! There's also horseback riding for an hour for $30.00 additional and they take your picture on the beach; pics are very inexpensive and very professional! Our pic cost $7.00. The only thing that I suppose was a \"negative\" concerning the Iberostar is the marble floors can be very slippery if wet; I'd suggest wearing flip flops, at least, when walking around your room. The shower is the same; very slippery, but also very large! It could fit 2-4 people easily. Please, even though this is an all-inclusive resort, TIP the staff. Just one or two dollars mean much to these warm, wonderful people of Mexico. They make your stay at the Iberostar so comfortable and so enjoyable and fun!

The golf carts to take you and your luggage to your rooms was a brilliant idea. Our kids (14 and 18) had a great time with the Star friends and met some really great kids from Boston (Meredith and Chris - we'll be in touch). Found the Trip Advisor reviews very helpful indeed, especially the location of the buildings. We asked for building no. 12 and were over-looking the pool and just a minute from that beautiful beach. The staff were first class (Wilbert, Pierre, Angel, Alex) we all got on very well with. Food buffet never became boring. Did like the Italian a la carte but, didn't bother with the Mexican as heard bad reviews of it, and our only complaint of the Steak restaurant and the Tropical was that the staff were too efficient as we found that we had eaten three courses in about 45 minutes as they tended to rush you. A tip: don't order you main course until after you have eaten your first which slows things down a bit. Otherwise, your main course will arrive as soon as you have eaten your first, which was a bit too quick for us. Also, the wine in the a la carte is not very good quality. We craved a decent glass of wine when we got home. But what a small price to pay. We had such a wonderful holiday. Tulum was breathtaking, this was the only trip that we went on as found them to be a bit expensive and plus, who needs to travel around when you can stay in the Tucan and make the most of their facilities. Loved the jungle walk, especially at night when it is beautifully lit. Entertainment as a whole was OK, didn't bother for the first week but our kids really got into it and loved the disco. We particularly liked the security of the place, including the disco which was within the hotel confines which we found very reassuring. This meant that we could go to bed knowing that our kids were safe. Boy, do those Star Friends work hard, such friendly people too. They deserve a pay rise!!

My gf and I had the pleasure of being in paradise from August 5th till the 11th. Its this simple, if you have any major problems with the Tucan or the Quetzal you are in need of some mental help. The place is outstanding. The food is great. The beds are outstanding. The service out of this world. The beach and pool, look at the pictures and tell me what you think. The star friends are all great. Drinks are flowing and they are as strong as you want them to be. The minibar always full. Plenty of monkeys and other really cool animals. All in all everything is great, I really only have one complaint and that is that you actually have to leave and go home. From my discussions with people at the resort Iberostar is a great company and has a great product all over the world. I like the Iberostar soo much that I will be going back in Nov. for one week at the Iberostar Paraiso Del Mar. Its basically a sister resort to the Tucan and the Quetzal and we will be bringing four other couples.

We booked our hotel reservations through apple vacations, and booked our air through America West because the flight times were at much better times and prices were better. Apple vacations still provides round trip transportation to and from the hotel just for booking the room with them. When we were dropped off we were checked in propmtly and given Conga, possibly the best juice I have ever tasted! We requested a room near the pool and beach, which came in handy because it is a walk through the on site jungle the hotel has. However we did love walking through the jungle each evening on the way to the dinner buffet, and the shows. All the food was excellent, the Mexican resturant was our favorite, and the buffets came in second, but all the food was great! Wide variety of fresh seafood, rices, salads, fruits, veggies, everything! The chefs also carves amazing art into watermelons, and would sculpt large fish or mayan face out of flour and chiles or fruit. We took our camera to dinner every night! The drinks were always excellent, and strong, you may even have to ask for a drink with not so much liquor in it. All the servers and bartenders were very kind and attentive. The hotel must pay them well because they dont get tips but serve with better quality than any American resturant or bar we have ever been to. Ever now and then we would give them a dollar because we were so impressed! The pool bar is cool too. The wildlife in the jungle is awesome! Despite all the warnings of renting a car in Mexico, we did it because the tours provided in the lobby are a bit pricey. We rented the car for 2 days and went to Hidden Worlds on the snorkeling tour of the underground caves, which was really cool, bring an underwater camera with a flash! Then we went to Tulum to see the ruins, and then to El Eden, a cenote connected to the huge underground water systems. El Eden was awesome! Freshwater huge swimming hole with unlimited visibility and a cliff you can jump off of into the deep end! That was our highlight! You have to visit this place, it is off the main highway just past Akumal Cenote on the right will be a small sign and a driveway. It costs 3-5 dollars per person, well worth it!!!! We had no problem driving, just know the rules of the road, you can find it on the internet. To save money we ordered room service the night before we went out to these excursions so we would not have to wirry about finding a dplace to eat and not get sick off the food. We also brought 2- one liter thermos's for water which we took every day with us to the beach and on the town to stay hydrated. Just fill up your thermos with water when you go to breakfast. There are bars everywhere at the resort, but the cups are small so bring your own cup for alcohol and they will gladly fill it up for you. We were really glad we brought the thermos's and cups. The watersports were great at the hotel, if you are facing the ocean head to the right and walk down past the resort area and you will be on a beautiful beach probably by yourselves, it was neat to explore anyway. The night shows were great for adults and children, they have some very talented singers and dancers! Very well done. we are coming back for our next vacation!!!

These people are the hardest working bunch people I have ever met. The only reason I gave this a 4 star rating instead of a 5 was because of the buffet.

The resort is beautiful with tons of marble and great landscaping. The pools and beach are wonderful and the rooms quite nice. The resort is carved out of the jungle with many animals and tropical foliage. We stayed in an oceanfront room which was a total waste of money. Buildings are not high enough to get any type of view. You are still 100 yards or so from the water in the \"oceanfront\" room. Very few oceanfront rooms here to begin with so save your money. The food setup is a joke. You only get to eat in the sit down restaurants twice per week long stay. This was irritating as we are not big buffet people. Food was O.K. at best and really geared to Europeans. Another thing we found tough was the lack of guests who spoke English. We were there for 5 days before we met anyone who spoke English. This made it very tough to socialize. Drinks at the resort were a major dissapointment also. They served luke warm Modelo draft beer, terpentine tasting house wine, and very few top shelf liquors and no bottles of wine. The only place you can get a bottled beer is in the sit down restaurants and again that is only twice per week. The whole resort is ridiculously hot with no A.C. in buffet area, entertainment plaza or lobby. The bottom line is, the Playa Del Carmen area is a gem with many great excursions close by, great beaches and a cool downtown. Don't hesitate to stay in or visit this area. This resort is beautiful with great service but the food and drink issue was too much for us. We won't be returning anytime soon.

For those of you who can't walk up and down stairs a lot need to request the ground floor because there are no elevators. We changed our room from 3rd floor to the first floor and actually got a better building. For anyone who plans on snorkeling alot-TAKE your own. They let you borrow theirs for only 1 hour and if you try to rent it costs $18.00 a day. Also, the travel agents tell you that you can be upgraded to a junior suite which is NOT true. You may also want to take a couple of your own beach towels just in case because when you check in they give you 1 towel card per person and if you lose one it cost $10.00 to replace. In Playa del Carmen you can get some good deals but you really have to bargain a lot which my husband hates. You have to name your price and walk away if you don't like theirs. They have almost the same stuff in every shop. We didn't get to see any ruins. Ran out of time. We did go to Xcaret which wasn't that great in my opinion but some of our party liked it. The entrance fee didn't include snorkel rental! Extra $10.00 a piece. We also went on the Mayan Adventure tour which was fun. It took you to Akumal- Ya Kul lagoon, then a cave, lunch, and then to a nice cenote to snorkel and jump off cliffs. We actually got a taxi to take us back later to the cenote for the kids but we almost couldn't find it. The traffic there is wild. They drive like maniacs. I would not have been comfortable driving on my own so we took the taxi alot. The best advice I can give is to AVOID Cancun airport on SAT. We arrived on July 12 and left July 19th. The arrival wasn't as painful as departure. I think everyone on vacation in Cancun was trying to leave when we were. We almost missed our flight and they go through your luggage.

We stayed 8 days and were very impressed. There was myself, my husband, son 14 years old and daughter 12 years old. We have stayed in Cancun twice at the Fiesta Americana and at the Moon Palace. We wanted to do something different this time and we also liked the idea of being more south- closer to Tulum and Cozumel. We had a great time in Cancun but Playa Del Carmen was a nice change. The resort was beautifu and very clean. Playacar is apparently a private resort area. You pass through a security gate to get in and then each of the resorts within, have their own gate with security. We felt very safe, not that we ever felt unsafe in Cancun. The staff at the Iberostar was fantastic. They really worked hard to make everybody happy. We had an ocean front suite which was very nice. I liked the bed but it was a little too firm for my husband. We happened to be on vacation when tropical storm Claudette made an appearance. It was hard to get an accurate weather report unles you spoke Spanish (CNN). The U.S. CNN pretty much avoided the topic and only concentrated on the states. They do know that there are many American vacationers down here, right? Oh well, the management did their best to keep us up to date. They sent us a memo with the important info. needed to be safe and the latest details of the storm. We had an ocean front suite and were nervous. By the time we left for dinner, the maid had taped our glass sliders, when we returned from the nightly show, the ocean front suites also had metal barriors put on the outside of the glass sliders and sand bads were all along the front of the resort. I was extremely impressed with the efficiency and organization of the storm preparation and felt very safe. The next morning when we awoke, the beach and the rest of the resort was being cleaned up and we were again having fun in the pool by afternoon. The food was very good and we did take advantage of the two restaurants (Mexican and Steak House), although the buffets were also high quality. One night my son had a very bad headache, I suspect from playing volleyball in the sun all day and not drinking enough water, but he could not go to dinner with us. We ordered room service for him (also totally included) and we were very impressed with the presentation of this food. We took the bike tour (included) in to Playa Del Carmen one day and really enjoyed it. The prices are much better there also. For example. my daughter wanted the front part of her hair braided with beads. At the resort $40, in the Playcar shops $25, in Playa Del Carmen $12. Definately worth the trip besides the bargaining there is alot of fun. The only two things I would say negative about the resort, although they didn't really effect us, is the night shows were very good but they do get very crowded and there is no air conditioning. The sides of the rooms are open and they have fans but it does get hot. The other problem for some people might be that it is a long trip from the lobby to the pool or beach. I had thought about having my in-laws come with us next time but I think it would be just too much walking for them and they are not ready for wheel chairs.

As a very frequent traveller and someone particularly demanding on service, the Iberostar Tucan and Quetzal really deliver. After a great 10 days there on a family vacation with a teenager and near-teen, I can say that the positive comments reflected in each of the user reviews are generally accurate. Service is prompt, courteous, and always at the ready to go the extra mile, food is very good, drinks are always cold and plentiful, and the beach and grounds were impeccably maintained and groomed. The rooms are generous on size and the amenities. The combination of the pool nestled up to the beach provides plenty of sun and fun - and the numerous bars by the pool will help keep your whistle wet. Shade is provided by numerous palapas on the beach and surrounding the pool. Plenty to do at all hours at the Tucan/Quetzal to keep you entertained. The whole Riviera Maya area is a great place to visit and with the Iberostar Tucan or Quetzal as your home-base you won't find a better sun and fun vacation spot. While we would have been very satisfied to spend our entire 10 days within the resort, don't hesitate to venture out to see Playa del Carmen, Cozumel, Mayan Ruins, Xcaret, Cancun, etc. Its a great vacation spot - one we're certain to return to in the coming years.

Save your Money .. Go somewhere else\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1132347", "Content": "We travel to many destinations, both in the States and abroad many times a year. We have stayed in the best of the best resorts (Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton, Rosewood Hotels, Bellagio) probably in the world, which all have a 5 star rating, and rightfully so. I do not say this to brag, but more as a point of reference for this review. Now we (my fianc\u00e9e and I) are looking for a wonderful destination to have a wedding and a honeymoon. Our now former travel agent (Dena McDonald) recommended that we try the Iberostar Tucan resort in Playa Del Carmen, Mexico that she promoted both on her website and in phone conversations. She said it was a great place to get married and have a honeymoon. She, as well as many websites, listed this resort as a 5 star all-inclusive resort. We read all the reviews on Trip Advisor and the resort seemed to be meeting the expectations of its customers. Boy were we fooled.This was NOT the 5 Star resort we were promised.ALL-INCLUSIVE: Defined in Merriam-Webster Dictionary as including everything.I assume that Merriam Webster has never gone to the Iberostar Tucan Resort and heard the lady in the limited hours reservation booth tell them after standing in line for an hour, to eat at a restaurant that is air-conditioned can only be booked for one night during a four day stay, or better yet for two whole nights during a seven day stay. But wait, what about the All-Inclusive term? They do offer food to their patrons as promised, however they fail to mention that it is served in a non-air conditioned room that provides absolutely no ventilation. Nothing better than eating food in 100-degree temperatures with about 90% humidity, which has sat out for an unknown period of time in what we later referred to as the Sweat Hut! The Sweat Hut is a very large Golden Corral type buffet with no air conditioning, with the added bonus of birds flying through the restaurant scavenging food from peoples plates and the buffet lines. Just as advertised sub-tropical mangrove swamp. Except they fail to tell you that you will eat in the middle of it.Maybe the room could make up for us going to town every night to eat in the air conditioning (except our one night in the air-conditioned restaurant (more on that later)). Maybe not. Want a room with a view? 350 rooms listed on their website, surely most have a view of the ocean, right? Nope. How about 10 rooms (all high end suites) face the ocean (that is not even 1% of the property). Pretty disappointing for a beachfront property. After checking in, we hiked a good \u00bd mile to our non-beachfront room. Our room was good size, with a king size bed. Things can only get better, right? I assume for cost savings, they decided to leave out the box springs (remember 5 star resort), and put the mattress on a slab of concrete. Authentic - possibly; 5 star - not even close. Nighttime came and we were finally got to sleep on our nice hard bed with the mattress that was probably obtained from Goodwill (trick take the comforter and place it between the mattress and the slab of concrete for some extra padding). Well, the next day was pool/beach day; we were really looking forward to a relaxing day.Hey, who needs to sleep in? Nothing better than going on a relaxing vacation, sleeping in and being awoken with yelling maids and the maintenance mans radio blaring that a toilet backed up in some room at 6:19 am. They both were in the breezeway, as there are no hallways. Have to note here that when the Iberostar says on their website this complex blends harmoniously into the landscape they are NOT kidding. The echoes and reverberations sound great when there is no carpet anywhere on the resort, everything is concrete (walls, floors, ceilings), and so you get a nice echo effect with every noise.Off we went to the beach/pool area, as after all, we were suppose to be looking at this resort for a wedding/honeymoon location. About a good \u00bd mile walk through the jungle (which I will admit is kind of cool unless your lucky to have your room face the jungle and hear roosters crowing at 5 am) we made it to the pool area. People putting their towels down earlier in the am already reserved most good seats, but we found a nice spot to get some sun. As we lay in the sun and enjoyed the weather, we watched the families come in. By the tens and hundreds, kids and families everywhere (great for a family vacation, not so good for the romantic wedding location we were promised). We waited and waited and waited for poolside service, again, crazy us, 5 star resort usually means poolside service not here. Off I went to find a place to get something to eat and drink for us. Hey, I found 2 places near the pool/beach that had buffet style food (imagine that). Again though, birds, heat, humidity, no air conditioning, and a lot of people crowded in these smaller Sweat Huts. I brought back our humidified food to find that we should have just skipped this meal; the food was more than disappointing. A dip in the bathwater warm saltwater pool helped cleanse the body from such an exciting time.We made it through our trip and it was our last night at the Iberostar, we were ready to go home. Going back to work sounded like fun by the 3rd day there. Since it was our last night, and I had waited in line for about an hour the first day to make our one reservation at one of the two air conditioned restaurants (remember only one reservation per 4 night stay), we chose the Italian restaurant, well actually the other was full and we did not have a choice. The food was again, sub par. Actually my fianc\u00e9e got so sick on the food (as she is not a drinker) she had to stay in bed until it was checkout time. We had to checkout late and even called the front desk to confirm and let them know. After the front desk called the room about 10 times, we decided to go to the lobby and wait to go to the airport. We went to the lobby and waited, but remember the lobby is complex blends harmoniously into the landscape which equates to no air. As my fianc\u00e9e laid on a couch in pain from the food from the night before, I went to check out. Checking out was a fun experience, I was told that I had to pay for the extra time spent in the room. I explained the time in the room was less than pleasurable and was due to the food from the night before. The rude lady at the counter (Judith) had the nerve to ask if we had filed a report. A report? With who? Obviously it must be state law in Mexico to file a report when someone gets sick on food. Nope, just an Iberostar off the cuff rule, which translates to too bad sucker. I paid, we left, as you have to have a checkout pass to leave the resort (felt like I was at Russian border crossing at this point).As you read this, you might wonder, the resort knew we were there looking for a place to get married (with about 50 guests) and have a honeymoon (wow, sounds like a great money making deal if I was running a hotel), that they would have done something special for us. Maybe an upgraded room? Maybe a basket of fruit? Maybe even bend the rules and let us eat in an air conditioned restaurant twice nope. We got nothing.

You got a lot for your money and it was by far one of the best places (from what I saw) down in Playa Del Carmen. But since this is a review I will give you my opinion on certain items. This is not necessarily a honeymooners type of place. There are a lot of people and a lot of kids. So if you are looking for quiet, then try someplace else. The pool is big enough to fit about 1,000 people in it but do not go there to cool off because it is like stepping into a giant hot tub. Try the ocean to cool yourself off. Be prepared my American friends for an invasion of people from Europe. And when I say prepare, I mean prepare your eyes. Us Yanks are not accostumed to seeing women strolling around the beach wearing no tops and guys wearing \"bannana hammocks\". And these are not models by any means. I spent the week after I got home trying to erase a German woman and her husband from my memory, because I saw them every single day I was there. Hilda and Fritz as I affectionately called them. There is also a lot of smoking. For some of you that will be a plus for others, like me, a large disappointment. There are smoking sections in the restaurants but for some, rules do not apply. I loved going up to the buffet and having some hairy man or woman with a butt hanging from his/her mouth ask me what they were serving today. I almost said cancer with a side of emphizima and a liftime tethered to an oxygen bottle, but I refrained. Do not go into town unless you are prepared to be badgered by the locals to look in their store. I do know that this is customary in the Caribe, but from the places I visited this was right up there with the worst I have seen. You must walk down the street, eyes forward and tune everything else out or else a 5 minute walk will turn into a painful 1 hour trip. And do not tell them \"I'll stop in on the way back\". I tried this and when I did walk past him to return to the taxi stand he recognized me and continued his sales pitch. When I kept walking h the most important. The booze. Alright if you are all inclusive prepare your liver for an ordeal of a Belushi like bender. It is quite a liberating feeling walking up to a bar, ordering a drink, and walking away. This no money thing is a concept I could really live with. And the drinks, not too many american liquors down there, but heck they all do the same trick. The beer thing is a little different though. You get into town and all you see is Corona signs. The motor vehicle department sign in town probably has a Corona sign attached to it some how. Tucan.... no Corona. What??? We are in Mexico correct. Nope. Dos Equis is on tap. Not the most flavorful or tastiest of Beers. So I warned you. The shows each night are entertaining. The workers there do there best everynight in sweltering conditions to provide something entertaining while you are boozing. IF you still like to go out on the town don't bother. I was shocked to find my second to last night there that there is a dance club on the Tucan's grounds. Yes a club that opens right after the shows end. A club that is completely free again to the Tucan all inclusives. Very convinient. Overall it is a great time. THe food is good. If you do not like something there is always something else. The rooms are nice and quiet with good AC. The beach is fantastic. Lots of chairs and plenty of ocean. THe chairs around the pools are tough to get if you are not up early to claim them.

I was leary about an all inclusive since I've had a terrible experience with the food and service with other all inclusives I've been too. Iberostar Tucan was absolutly incredible!!! I couldn't complain about one single thing other than a week was not long enough!! THe food was great and the specialty restaurants were excellent! The drinks were perfect, just because because the bartenders will try to get you to look the other way as they pour more alcohol into your drink!! I was feeling it after just two margaritas!! The service was excellent, there was always somebody right there eager to assist you. There are so many things to do that you couldn't possibly fit them all in a week. There is something for everyone to do. My grandparents and my parents were content laying on the beach, my aunt and uncle wandered off on their own to take the scuba lessons and salsa classes. My boyfriend and I played water basketball, volleyball, soccer, went out on the kayaks and painted ceramics. You could rent the bikes and take a short ride into Playa del Carmen and have lunch and shop. We also took advantage of the sister resort in Cozumel for the day and went snorkeling. We would all meet up at the end of the day for drinks in the swimup bar before dinner. I highly recommend it and we all agreed that we would go back to the Iberostar Tucan. FABULOUS!

It's very clean and the staff is very nice. The beach is big and not crowded. The food was a pleasant surprise, as good as you get for an All-inclusive. Make sure you get reservations early to some of the restaurants in the resort. We actually stayed in Quetzal which is adjacent the Tucan but it's all the same resort. The entertainment is pretty good. You definitely want to spend some time in downtown playa. There is a great shopping district. The clientele was over 30 and we seemed like the youngest people in the place, but I'm not sure if it was just timing. The say they do get a pretty good Spring Break crowd.Overall, I would absolutely recommend it.

We had so much fun. We had lobster for our thanksgiving dinner! What a fun time. They were actually overbooked for the thanksgiving week, but they made free offers on a first come first serve basis to go to their sister hotel in Cozumel.

Cozumel was fun with awesome snorkeling but the beach is too coraly for my tootsies... Overall trip was superior.

We went with another family and everyone loved this hotel! In review:What we loved:The buffet food was better than expected. The grounds were incredible (we saw monkeys, flamingos, iguanas, etc.) The beach is about 3 mi. long and gorgeous. Plenty of lounge chairs. Staff and service excellent and very friendly. Rooms are nice and have good sized balconies. Great location in Playacar - $4 cab to Playa del Carmen and ferry to Cozumel. No one got sick!What could be better:The beds are really hard. Difficult to make reservations in optional restuarants (you can have 2 dinners per week and it was hard to get even that.)Book ASAP. We ate at the steak place and the Italian restaurant - both were just pretty good, but it was a nice change from the buffet! That was our only complaint ALL Week - not bad for 8 people whose age ranges from 10 to 48.

The Iberostar Tucan is an absolutely amazing place to stay and the activities in Playacar and the surrounding areas are endless - any vacation is definitely what YOU make of it and we certainly got our money's worth.
