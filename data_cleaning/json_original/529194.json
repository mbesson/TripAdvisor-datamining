However, my wits were tested when I arrived at Altavilla in Rome. The room my wife and I booked looked more like a broom cupboard than a double room. The bed was a three quarter bed, which they tried to pass off as a double. The bathroom looked like something out of a prison movie. The breakfast was very basic and if you arrive late, you will have to make do with whats left. Now, the staff was one of the most friendly and hardworking any hotel could wish for. When we complained about our room the front desk and the porter were scrambling around to find us an alternate room. The staff were always happy , cheerful and willing to help us with any service especially Vito and his very well behaved dog. The poor guy that running the breakfast room in the morning was a shinning example of hard work. Never in my life had I seen a guy mutli-task with such speed and determination between washing dishes, making coffee, laying out the food, clearing the tables and tending to the patrons . . . this was all done by a single person for our 4 day stay for the entire breakfast room which consisted of more than 10 tables. The staff knows the hotel is not the greatest but they tried their best to make our stay comfortable.

However, I must say that our experience was more than adequate. The rooms are admittedly a little tired and need updating and the toilet did double as a bidet, the hot water was a little sporadic and was a little snug, but for a budget hotel, we could not fault the cleanliness, the breakfast offered nor the staff. We were there for 4 nights and everyday we had fresh towels and our sheets were changed after a couple of nights. Breakfast consisted of cornflakes, orange juice, bread rolls or croissants with jams and tea and coffee, all of it, as much as you wanted. The staff were very helpful and when we had to check out a few hours before we were due to return, they were able to store our luggage for us until we had to go. In short, if you are expecting plush, spacious rooms with all the mod cons then don't stay here, but if you are looking for a hotel within easy reach of the station and public transport and a short walk to many of Rome's main attractions then this is a great place to stay.

But now i wonder whether these people ever went abroad or maybe it was the staff and their friends who wrote the reviews. I was travelling with my family and we had a triple room which was akready small for two peaple let alone three. But since we only stay in room to sleep it was not that big a problem. The problem was the walls were all damp and in great need of some paint., and furniture need to be changed like one viewer wrote krea have some good cheap furniture. But the biggest problem was the bathroom, Again walls need to be changed, the toilet had a double use one as a toilet and also as a bidet something unheard of. Also when we got in the room we noticed that the toilet was leaking. (this was on a Sunday) I went down to reception to report the problem the reception told us that they will take care of it, and by the gods of Rome they did they put a towel at the back of the toilet. Next morning we woke up to find a complimentary swimming pool and beautiful aromatic smell in the bathroom. Again i informed reception and was told that on sunday they have no plumer (no pluming problems on sunday maybe) and was told that it was already noted and the plumer will see to it straight away. We went out for the day got back late in the evening and beleive it or not the problem was solved yes qiute right by putting another towel at the front. Another thing is the lack of communication after I made the booking on line and got the reservation confirmation number I sent an email asking for some information regarding getting to the hotel and to reconfirm the booking I never got an answer. I don't know how the ministry for tourism in Italy classifies the hotels but sure this hotel should not even deserve to be classified to accomodate people and to think that tourists are made to pay tax to visit the city!!! nice welcome.

The guy who checked us in was friendly enough, although his tone revealed that a trove of disaster was waiting to be found. After checking in we were told that the lift was 'on strike' and that we had to take the service lift, which is out the back of the hotel, through a courtyard and into another hotel. The service lift was about 100 years old and the size of one very small Italian. It is old, slow, smells really bad and not recommended for the claustrophobic. The brochure and online brochure mention that the rooms had been 'recently renovated'. I had some news for the owner of this dank establishment, 50 years is not recent. The floors are prison gray and the furniture is ancient. I know we were in Rome to see relics, bt not in the hotel room. OK, it's only a 2 star hotel, but go to IKEA for furnishing, that would be perfectly acceptable. The problem with the room, other than the wardrobe that I was afraid to open for fear of finding the corpse of William Burroughs or an entrance to the catacombs, was that it was being used as general storage for the rest of the hotel. There were no less than 4 beds in a double room, a random dining chair and some kind of sofa bed that was draped in a carpet. The bed was desperately uncomfortable and unromantic as there was a wooden ridge running down the middle of it. The toilet and shower did not have doors. Instead there were wooden folding doors that do not close. The shower door was broken and constantly fell off it's hinges, the basin stand had cigarette burns on it. There was also complimentary mould everywhere. The shower was nothing short of disgusting and we actually resisted sing it for as long as possible. The whole place smells like wet sock and there is a generator in the courtyard that goes off early in the morning. Our window looked out into this soot covered courtyard. We attempted breakfast once, never again. For a nation that at least understand coffee, this hotel ought to be ashamed of itself. The coffee made me gag. The only thing that smelled worse than the hotel was the coffee. The crockery is not washed by machine, instead there is a sweaty little man furiously washing and replacing cups and saucers as people leave and enter. The breakfast hall smells like a scullery that has not seen soap, ever. A steam bath funerary where crockery goes to die. Thankfully though, there is a myriad coffee shops ready to serve you properly. You might have read that this hotel is at least cheap, well I don't think that nearly \u20ac100 a night is cheap. If I had known what I was getting myself into I would have opted to roam the streets at night. There is internet usage available, but this will cost you \u20ac5 for 3 hours. Go to the nearest internet cafe where you can pick up bandwidth for less than half of that. There is no wifi, not even in the lobby. Do not stay at this hotel. Look around for something else, there must have been at least 5 better looking options on the same block.

The furniture was old but it wasn't that bad and the bed linen was simple and clean. The bathroom was not fit for human habitation it was so small even a midget would struggle the shower was really dangerous no grip on the floor and when you stepped out to dry yourself you were basically in the toilet the only plus in the bathroom was the clean towels everyday. the room was manky in that it needs painting and dusting the floor needed cleaning and the curtains were manky aswell.

Our room windows faced the open courtyard which was shared with another hotel and the night we chose to leave the windows open for some fresh air, we were woken early morning with the sounds of bin covers clanging, and bins being dragged across the cobbled courtyard area!!! We had planned to move about & stay in other hotels across the city, and suffice to say that we stayed in better hotels (cheaper and with free air con) ,all of which were conveniently located either close to one of Rome's attractions, with lots of little trattorias around as well as close to a metro stop.

The business tactic of this hotel is \"Have a good website but don't bother with the actual hotel\". The hotel has no stairs, only a lift. When it's busy, one may have to wait for 15 minutes to get ground floor from 4th floor. The staircase is behind an emergency door. We didnt wanna open in the fear of triggering a fire alarm. A lady, who waiting with us for the lift to take us to the ground floor, suddenly had a breathing difficulty but can't go out to get some air. Luckily the lift came just in time and she managed to get down (don't know what happened to her as we came down in the next ride after 10 minutes!). Standard breakfast. Nothing to shout about.

Instead of a door, our tiny bathroom was separated from the rest of the room by a wood-paneled sliding curtain that offered little privacy, and our room overlooked a dark, dirty courtyard, where people shouted all night and watched soccer at full volume. My boyfriend and I had booked four nights at the Altavilla long in advance before our trip based on the charming pictures shown on their website. We wanted to treat ourselves to somewhere special to cap off our first vacation together, but were deeply disappointed by what we ended up with. We could not get our money refunded because we had booked so far in advance, and to make matters worse, we passed by a number of rooms that were much nicer than ours as the maid tidied them up in the morning, which cost the same price as our dark little hole (as confirmed by the front desk). When we asked to be moved into one of these rooms, the front desk person cheerily agreed, and said if we packed our suitcases, our luggage would be moved over to the new room by the end of the day. By the end of the day, nothing had changed, and we were told that they booked all other rooms for the night. The front desk person promised that if we kept our suitcases packed, they would move everything after a room had been prepared the next day, but of course it didn't happen then, either. If I had known what to expect, and booked the room on the cheap, this would have worked fine as a budget room.

We are well used to budget travelling and only booked a hotel because the hostels in Rome were the almost the same price and it was impossible to get a private room even months in advance. We booked on the web, but when we arrived the place looked different to the photos - it turns out the pictures on the website are of the Hotel Giada, which takes up three of the five floors of the same building - same lift, same breakfast, different entrance, but different business and very different rooms. On the plus side the location near the train station was good (just far enough away from the sleaze and only a ten minute stroll to the Colloseum), the hotel and rooms secure, the bed was comfortable, there were no bad smells, the room was well cleaned every day, and hot water was plentiful at all times. On the minus side the air conditioning was useless, we thought some of the staff were a little rude at times (although after a few days we suspected this was a rather general attitude in Rome and not particular to our hotel), there was quite a bit of noise from around 8 in the morning onwards, as the walls and doors were thin and there was some (much needed) renovation work going on during the week, and the decor and furniture could use some updating. A previous reviewers experience of coming home late to find the door locked and the porter asleep on the couch matched ours, but he woke up and let us in immediately, so it didn't matter. Anyway our room was on the first floor at the rear of the hotel. It had a small double bed, a small bath/shower room, a TV, desk, wardrode etc. The window, like many Roman hotels, looked into a shady internal courtyard, but had a louvred shutter bolted to the outside so there was no view and no light. Fresh towels, soap, shower gel, toilet paper, and clean plastic cups were supplied every day, but there were no fancy extras like sewing kits, shower caps, shoe shines etc. One thing that bothered us was the lack of a 'Do-not-disturb' sign as we like a lie-in and were woken several times each morning by the cleaning lady checking if the room was empty. The Alta Villa was much cheaper than most other hotels at 125 euro per night, so we weren't expecting much, but we still a bit disappointed when we realised we'd been tricked byt he website. However we were there for a wedding and had a chance to compare with the hotels of several friends, and given the price differences the Alta Villa was okay. If you're going away for a short treat then splash out and book a superior room somewhere like the Ariston down the street, double the price, but has all the nice touches. On the other hand if like us you're on a tight budget this is a reasonable option - in Rome you'll be out at the sights all day anyway, so the room is only for showering, sleeping and storing your stuff.", "Date": "May 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tomah, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cActually, quite nice\u201d", "Author": "ParentsOf3", "ReviewID": "UR5048295", "Content": "I am stunned by previous posts ripping this hotel to shreds.

Being near Termini, we also took advantage of the subway and bus lines (and returned our rental car to the Hertz location in the station). The room itself was fairly large (by European standards), and we paid 120 euros/night. The breakfast was pretty good (the capuccino was excellent!) and our bathroom was new and modern. My one complaint would be the lack of stairs - elevator only access to the rooms. This hotel literally \"shares\" a building with a hotel next door (Alta Villa got floors 2 and 5, the place next door got floors 3, 4 and 6 - a liitle weird, but whatever).

That was ok and reasonable , however what was not ok is with the staff who were rude and room that was aweful. * Staff - Which staff, it seems that they only have two staff and they were absolutely rude. It may be understanable if they don't understand English but they speak good English and simply choose to be rude. We were absolutely shocked with how we were treated. We got in the room and found that we didn't have a towel. I had to ring them and it took them close to an hour to bring one up with no apology whatsoever. My partner rang to get a glass to brush his teeth but was told that he(the staff) is finishing and could not care less if the room does not have the glass/cup, so we didn't get the glass. * Room and Toilet - I have never come across a room so small with two single bed cramped in there. It was horrible, dark, aweful smell and cold with window that does not have a view. The heater was not working and the toilet is the size of a TV box. No joking. The water does not have any strenght and it just drizzle despite how you turn the tap. The worst thing is.. the HOT water only last 8 seconds.. (Average time), sometime it lasts a bit longer of 10 , but others, it's 6 etc. The toilet is full of mould and smells.. * Lift and Stairs - The lift is very old and dodgy. I was planning to take the stairs but was told that there is no stairs. They only have emergency stairs fitted with alarm to go outside the building. Try having to wait for a lift on level 4 and the lift could only take 6 people at a time !! * Hotel, check in and check out - despite what the website says.. this place is nothing like it. The hotel is not well maintained. As for check out, The hotel sign says that we could check out anytime, 24 hours. On the day we needed to check out 4:30 am, we found a guy snoring on the sofa at the reception area. we tried to wake him out, but he would not get up.
