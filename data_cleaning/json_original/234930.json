Although it seems to be described in no guidebook or internet site, the hotel is a real gem. The decor is modern and pleasantly functional and the bathrooms are impeccably clean and newly upgraded.  The staff is efficient and helpful (whether on the telephone, over email, or in person). This is a very well-run establishment near the Free University with a bus stop out front that provides easy access to the heart of Berlin.  The setting of this hotel is a real knockout. It is located in an upscale and safe neighborhood filled with lovely villas of architectural interest and beautiful trees not far from the Grunewald. I still remember with great pleasure my long walks through this very special neighborhood. If I inherit a million bucks, I'm buying a house here.  Given the safe locale, the close proximity to public transportation, and the helpful staff, the Hotel Am Wilden Eber is an excellent choice for women traveling alone.  This hotel is for those who enjoy the dynamism of Berlin but at the end of the day want to retreat to a peaceful and lovely setting in one of Berlin's most appealing residential areas.", "Date": "Oct 19, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR500511430", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d234930-r22718589-Hotel_Am_Wilden_Eber-Berlin.html", "HotelID": "234930", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
