However, I couldn't help steal a very short glimpse and noted that many people spoke negatively of this accommodation. I am honestly quite surprised. Let me qualify this by saying: do not come here if you are after: a) a Contiki like pub-crawl through Europe; b) the bells and smells of a Plaza or Savoy; or c) a base for a large group of people. I came to Rome with my mother, as I wanted to introduce her to Europe. The Group Palace by Relais was perfect. An old residence converted to a hotel, it was like living as the Romans do. Isn't that what one is supposed to do in Rome after all? I don't think there are more than 8 or so rooms, so you are never overwhelmed by people coming and going. The lack of guests also explains the breakfast room that you could fit in the bathroom on most hotels, which had from memory only 4 tables (holding about 2 people each). This was easily covered by arriving to breakfast either very early, or very late. From the little street of Banci Vecchi, a left turn would take you through cobble-stoned streets to smalls piazzas, market squares and some wonderful fashion stores. A right turn took you on to the main drag and in less than 10 minutes we were in either Piazza Navona, Puente Sant'Angelo or 5 more minutes on to the Vatican. We walked everywhere - even to the Pantheon (quite close) and off to the Spanish Steps and the high-end shopping district (little but further away). The young lady at reception was always pleasant and helped out with any queries we had. She kept insisting somewhere was a 'taxi distance' though to us it was a stone's throw. Perhaps they were used to lethargic tourists who wouldn't walk anywhere - just ask the front desk for a map of Rome and to point out the place you would like to go to, and its relation to the hotel. You will see soon enough how close a walk it may well be. There is no point in taxiiing when walking the streets, smelling the coffee, saying bongiorno to passers by and of course, admiring the local Italian beauties - can all be done on your way to your next must-see-site. They also had a foreign girl (Eastern European I believe) who it appeared spoke no Italian, nor English but worked her arms off. She was responsible for breakfast, cleaning and all other activities. She never stopped. On the negative side, if you are carrying a few suitcases you would need to send them up one or two at a time in the lift (which rises within the space the curving staircase leaves in the middle) - or you could do as my mother and I did, and just walk the stairs. The carbs and red wine you will consume in Rome means walking as much as possible isn't just a healthy activity, it is a coma-avoiding requirement :) Also, the bathrooms (quite simple but ample) had very, very poor water pressure, and rather than try to shower, you would be better off having a bath everyday. The only concern is that the lip of the bathtub is very high, and not at all accessible for travellers with limited ability to participate in Olympic high-jump! Be warned. The street itself upon first look seems somewhat of a back-alley - but it is a standard Roman street, mere metres away from the main thoroughfare. If travelling alone or with work, I would no doubt stay at a brand name colossus, however with a friend or partner, the Group Palace by Relais would suit me just fine. Ciao. NB: The wireless only seems to work in the lobby and not in the rooms - though this could merely have been my iphone, though people with blackberrys were also in the lobby quite often tapping away on their devices...", "Date": "August 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "chicago", "Title": "\u201cClose to everything but non-smokers beware\u201d", "Author": "clee82", "ReviewID": "UR115967631", "Content": "We decided to try and stay as centrally located as possible when visiting Rome for only 3 days. We chose the Relais because of this, which for the price (USD$125/nt), the location was perfect for walking to the Sistine Chapel or Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain. The only long walk was to the Colesseum and the Roman Forum - which done early in the morning before the streets were crowded was so beautiful to see all the vendors setting up, or restaurants sweeping their patios. The hotel is off of the main street so you definitely need a taxi to find it. It's super cute but very small as is everything in Europe. They have this little bitty old school elevator that you use to get to your rooms so it's wise to pack small and light if there's more than 2 of you trying to work the elevator at once. The room was actually a very good size for a European hotel. It had it's own bathroom and a queen sized bed, with a desk, and a window that overlooked the back alley. Number one, we asked for non-smoking room and everything in our room reeked of cigarettes, the drapes, the bedding, EVERYTHING! Since the husband and I do not smoke, I instantly had a headache that lasted most of the trip. Our luggage had been lost for 2 days of our trip so we tried to keep a positive attitude about everything. The bathtub never supplied hot water and when I say bathtub, I mean bathtub - if you wanted a shower, you stood up and used the hose like from the old movies (water spraying everywhere because of no curtain). I was very confused about this but greatful since some people we met had to share a bathroom wtih other guests. The bed was honestly at least 10 years old, it was like a piece of cardboard. I would say it was probably only 5\" tall. There was a TV in there but flipping through the channels, I think there was only 1 American channel or at least 1 with someone speaking English.The complimentary \"breakfast\" was a cafe machine to supply coffee, cappuccino, etc, some pre-packaged jelly filled croissants, oatmeal, and fruit. There may have been other items there but I don't recall, and I believe there was maybe one table in there, so you have to bring everything back to your room or with you. The first door man knew of our luggage being lost so we told him to contact us immediately, a new man came on the second night and we told him to call our room whenever it showed up. We checked before we went to dinner, after we went to dinner, and before we went to bed when he ignorantly told us \"your luggage is not my problem\". Probably sick of us asking about it and calling the airport to see when it would be delivered but we were in the same outfits for 3 day!!! My husband went down to yell at him and at 4 am, we got the call that it had arrived. Overall, I would say if you're on a budget and want to be centralized, this hotel was not bad at all.", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ayr, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cLoved it would go back .\u201d", "Author": "cats68", "ReviewID": "UR115525029", "Content": "I was booked into one of their other hotels and when i arrived there had been a problem with the booking so there were no rooms .

Having done quite a bit of research I went for this hotel due to the quality of the customer feedback, having traditionally always gone with large chain hotels when staying abroad. We were not disappointed. We stepped in and the decor instantly says charming and traditional. Our room (Room 4) was fantastic, with a very large bed, a spare single bed (not needed or requested), lots of room, cupboard space containing a fridge, safe and hob(!) and a large marble bathroom with impressive suite. One downside could be the hand held shower head, but it was hot water and did not affect us. Breakfast - Brilliant. Breakfast was delivered to our room each morning within 10 minutes of us calling reception. Two whole trays of continental meats and cheeses, rolls, croissants, eggs and tea and coffee. It really set us up for long days of sightseeing. One day it wasn't that hot, but on the whole it was lovely having it delivered to the room. Location - On a very quiet street within 50 yards of the Victor Emanuelle Main road which leads to both the Vatican and the Victor Emanuelle building within 10 minutes. Piazza Navona and the Pantheon are both walkable within 5-10 minutes, which is perfect for anyone wanting to see Rome for the first time.

I am literally writing this review from the second leg of that trip. Claudia was welcoming and our room was ready much earlier than we had anticipated. Our flight had arrived around 7 AM and check-in time was not until 2 PM. We had planned on taking the Tiber River Cruise and getting lost around Castel Sant'Angelo and the Vatican. She offered to let us use the Internet downstairs and rest for a minute and before we could leave our room was ready. Once we unloaded our luggage in our room, she saw us off with a map after she circled some nearby points of interest. We booked the hotel room through a travel site and everything was in order. We had seen reviews that indicated that some people felt \"baited and switched\" and ended up in a different hotel down the street, but this did not happen in our case. We also found that our Junior Suite Double room and found ourselves upgraded to a Triple room instead. The room was large enough. The air conditioning was as good as expected for a European hotel room. And we were far enough from via di Corso Vittorio Emmanuele II that, although there was some street noise, it did not interfere with getting rest at night. The location for this hotel was amazing. We were located very close to Castel Sant'Angelo, Spanish Steps and the Vatican, but also Piazza Navona, Piazza di Popolo, Campo di Fiori and Trevi Fountain were also easy walks. We even walked to the Colosseum before continuing on a 3 hour walking tour of Ancient Rome. The hotel's location was also located in a residential neighborhood, so we felt like we were staying with Romans rather than with tourists. The hotel also offered (and we took advantage of) a private limousine transfer service for Euro 43, only 3 Euro more than the standard taxi fare from FCO. We had an amazing time in Rome in general and would absolutely stay with Palace again. However, our greatest compliment to them has to have happened after we checked out. My wife left her Blackberry in the hotel room. The cleaning staff found it after we had already left for Venice and took it to the front desk. Claudia personally contacted the travel site we had used for the booking, found our Venice hotel, e-mailed me to let me know they had found the phone and offered to ship it either to Venice or back home to the States. I cannot say enough about the service that Hotel Palace provided. The hotel room itself that we paid for was both a great location and value on its own, but the staff really went above and beyond when it came to the hospitality portion of the hospitality business. We tossed our coins in the Trevi Fountain before we left.

Admittedly we did got lost a couple of times trying to navigate our way round Rome to the hotel but I think that was more down to my poor map reading skills. We contacted the hotel before our trip to find out about arranging to get there and they have a shuttle service which you can request for 29euros or a limo option (which was actually a mercedes) this cost slightly more than the shuttle but it was worth it and the chauffeur took us around the city and pointed out the sights and gave us a bit of background info. Both options were cheaper than ordering a taxi which was 40euros so something to bare in mind before setting off. When we got there we were early for check and the woman on reception was a tad unwelcoming, I think she thought because me and my partner are both young (something she commented on) we were joking about having a reservation or something but she quickly changed her tune when she saw we had booked and paid for our rooms and did all she could to be welcoming. She also gave us a map which showed the hotel and was detailed, I would advise using it! The rest of the staff were friendly so no complaints there. The room itself was gorgeous, the bed was massive and comfy, there was a flatscreen TV and the bathrooms were big and clean. The shower is hand held so it's better to bath than shower but it does take a while to actually run a bath. There were complimentary bathrobes but no slippers as it has said on the site I booked through so I would recommend taking your own, the floor was a bit rough and uneven, not a flaw with the hotel in my eyes it just added to the character or the building (it was originally a palace built in the 15th century). Lots of people have said that the rooms were dark due to the shutters on the window but these keep the room from getting too warm and if you do want more light the obvious solution really is the easiest... Open the shutters! Breakfast is served from 7:30am to 10:00am and is included in the cost, they had cheese, ham, bread rolls, two types of cereal, hot and cold drinks, yoghurts, pastries and two cake type things but if you go too late the good stuff could well be gone.

The Vatican was a 10 minute walk from the hotel. Campo di Fiori, Piazza Navona also within easy walking distance. The forum was a longer walk, but not a difficult one. My room was large enough to accommodate a king size bed, a large desk, and a small single bed. For the three of us, the size was adequate, but there was not a lot of extra space. The furniture is old and comfortable, but nothing in the room is particularly elegant or luxurious. However, the building itself retains some of its former grandeur. The bathroom was spacious, with a large tub. There is no stand-up shower. There is a small breakfast room off the lobby that serves the typical Italian hotel morning meal of sweet cakes, cheese, and meats. Claudio, who is the hotel's day manager, is truly a kind and hospitable gentleman. He speaks english fluently and is happy to help with tips for what to see, how to get there, and wants his guests to be as comfortable as possible. Our room was kept spotlessly clean by our housekeeper. And with two teens in the room with me, I can assure you, she faced a Herculean clean-up job every morning. If wireless internet access is important to you, I would recommend a room directly above the lobby. Likewise, don't be surprised if your television reception is a little wobbly at times. The air conditioning was barely adequate for the early September heat wave we experienced during our stay, but my understanding is that the air conditioning in most hotels in Rome is weak. I found the noise level tolerable. I heard sirens, but not peoples' voices. There is no view from the windows. The night managers, while friendly, are not as skilled as Claudio in hotel management. They really just babysit the front desk. I booked the hotel through Unitravel and I did find it difficult to reach the hotel directly to confirm my reservation. However, Unitravel responded promptly and helped me reach the hotel before I arrived. I would recommend this hotel for visitors to Rome who are comfortable navigating the city on their own and are willing to forsake some of the amenities one typically enjoys in an american hotel, such as a full-service restaurant, brand new fixtures, etc. In return, a guest receives a comfortable room in a charming location at a very good price.
