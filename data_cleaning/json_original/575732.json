We usually stay at the Marriott in Times Square for their corporate rate, but got sick of the circus. Times Square is great if you have never been to NYC, but gets really old after awhile. So, we picked this spot and were pleasantly surprised. It was in a great neighborhood and easy to find. The ground floor lobby provides convenient check in and then you head up to the second level. This is the fun part of the hotel. The concierge lounge and Opia Restaurant are located here. There is an affiliation with the hotel, but Opia is run separate. Great food and great bar scene in your hotel. Would recommend making a stop before or after dinner for a drink. You need to change elevators to get to the guest rooms, which is a little awkward but not that big of a deal. This is NYC, so you can expect a smaller than usual room that is clean and nicely appointed. I believe this used to be another hotel property and went through the Marriott conversion. The hotel was priced very reasonable for NYC and plan on staying here again. Staff very friendly and same goes for the Opia team.

The fireplace in the lobby is amazing and provides a centerpiece for lounging, enjoying free snacks and having a drink. Opia Restaurant and Bar is a bit expensive for our tastes but that doesn't keep people from filling it every night. Its clearly a hip and popular spot in the neighborhood. Unfortunately, trendy decor isn't always functional. The raised ceramic bowl in the bathroom is awkward and takes away from much needed counter space. On the other hand, the shower is one of the best I've seen in a hotel. We found the heating and air conditioning system to be slow to respond in getting the temperature right. That means it runs often and is very loud when it does. We didn't sleep well as a result. Other reviews mentioned traffic noise from 57th Avenue but we didn't find that as offensive as the HVAC system. The lighting in the room is a little cheap for a Renaissance. Many of the lamps didn't work properly. This could be fixed for a modest investment given the success of this hotel. While your at it, add another mirror in the main room.

When we arrived, the staff greeted us warmly and they were quite friendly. It was our first trip to NYC together and were pretty unfamiliar with the area. They graciously switched us to a larger room on a nicer floor for no extra charge after my husband petitioned nicely. They gave us several vouchers for free breakfast at their restaurant/lounge...I think we only paid for breakfast once in the five days that we were there. The room was spacious enough with a great view of the street. Every morning my daughter would wake up and sit on the window ledge looking at the cabs passing by.

Location and Marriott affiliated. Stayed one night to do the holiday thing with the kids. We are frequent visitors to NYC. We are from LI so know a lot about the city and try different places to stay depending on location. Wanted to be close to the tree so this seemed the perfect pick. THE GOOD: STAFF WAS JUST LOVELY. SO HELPFUL. SO FRIENDLY. CAN'T SAY ENOUGH NICE THINGS ABOUT THEM...THANK YOU! The restaurant on site \"Opia\", although independent of hotel (I believe) was great. Food was excellent and atmosphere was wonderful! Rooms were clean and efficient. You didn't need or want for anything. Beds were comfy. :) Flat screen TV. Plenty of storage space. Location was close to everything. Quick walk to many major attractions. THE SUGGESTIONS I am not one to complain too much, especially b/c I am so loyal to Marriott, but instead of giving the negatives, I will give a few suggestions. 1. Ask for a room that is not ON 57th Street. The traffic noise was pretty bad and made for a rough night sleep. But we managed. :) 2. Skip the comp breakfast or go super early. The room they host the breakfast in, although nice and clean and warm, is beyond small for the amount of people, who like us, are late risers and rush to breakfast before it ends, lol. You can eat comfortably in the Opia restaurant if you want to pay for a nice breakfast. 3. Check-out is a busy time and the wait for the elevators can be a little long. Small elevators so they fill up quick. Just be patient. :) Other than that, this was a nice hotel with an exceptional staff.

I didn't really know quite what to expect, after reading the mixed reviews on here. Our taxi driver found the hotel easily, it's on a very busy crossroads of 57th Street and Lexington. The building is a mix of modern and older parts and the entrance is situated between a couple of shops and is quite discrete. The concierge on the lower lobby was helpful (we had quite a few questions for him during our stay and he printed addresses off for us, as well as checking telephone numbers), and the hotel reception is on the first floor. The reception is very quirky with amazing chairs and lighting, and is different from the usual Renaissance/Marriott hotels. There are two bars and a restaurant off the reception, all in all quite small and intimate, not a big hotel chain feel at all. We were given a room upgrade due to being Gold Elite members, and the room was lovely. A huge bed, gorgeous bedding and lots of pillows, masses of wardrobe and cupboard space. A huge flat screen tv and a very spacious, modern bathroom with a huge selection of Aveda toiletries. Within minutes of arriving in the room, we answered a knock at the door and there was a present of a bottle of wine and a huge box of chocolates, as they had noticed it was my birthday when checking the passports. What a nice touch. After a quick freshen up we went down and had a drink in the Opia bar, which was buzzing with lunch time clientele, all looking very smart. It had a great New York feel about it. You pay for the priviledge though, by the time the 20% tip had been added, 4 beers were $39! Looking for something quick to eat after journey, there's a TGI Fridays within 50 yards, so we headed there, for standard TGI nosh. Immediately surrounding the hotel there are lots and lots of shops, restaurants to suit all budgets, news kiosks, street food vendors, snadwich/salad bars etc etc, and constant traffic. Two doors down there is a standard New York diner, called the Palace Restaurant and we had a traditional American breakfast here both mornings at a good price. We found it virtually impossible to get a taxi early on Friday night, and the concierge spent 15 minutes to hail one down for us. He was fantastic. Would we stay at this hotel again? - Without a doubt!!! The staff and management were some of the friendliest yet professional and helpful I have ever encountered.

We were very pleasantly surprised when we stepped into the lobby to see the unique, chic decor - very beautifully and stylishly designed! Unfortunately, the main check-in area is so small, that only two desks are available for check-in. At the time we arrived, only one desk was open and there was a line of half a dozen people - not very efficient... I must pause here and also state we brought out 4-month old son with us, as we couldn't get a sitter for the weekend. We were concerned about bringing him to NYC, as it isn't the most \"baby friendly\" place. We were again pleasantly surprised at how friendly everyone in the hotel was towards us and our little boy. The hotel made accomodations for us to have a roll-away crib and a mini-fridge since I am a nursing mom. Back to the hotel itself... After we got checked in, we went up to our room on the top floor and were very UNpleasantly surprised to find out how TINY the room was - it could not have been any larger than a large walk-in closet. And a crib most certainly would not have fit. We called down to the front desk and after finally speaking with the manager, they made arrangements to switch rooms for us (THANK YOU TO MANAGER LARRY!). The hotel also gave us coupons for free breakfast each morning and the restaurant (Opia) was a nice morning experience. The dining room got crowded, so service was slow and not always attentive, but we weren't in a rush either (and they were very kind about us bringing in a baby stroller). All in all, I give this place 4 stars. It's a beautiful little boutique hotel, but it is tiny in every regard - from the lobby, to the elevators, to the rooms.

I wanted to make it special and decided to splurge a little on a room with a terrace. I found a deal on their website for Valet Parking included in the room price and also two free drinks ($15 max). The lobby is on the second floor which is a little odd but they tell you where it is on the way in. The lobby was very modern and a little quirky but overall not bad. We arrived before our room was ready so they checked our bags for us and we heading out for a day exploring the city. We came back around 2:30 PM and our room was ready. They said they would send our bags right up but an hour later they still had not showed up. I called down for them and they sent them up in about 5 minutes. The room was quite small but the terrace had a great view and a small bistro table. We ordered room service for a late lunch, the price was quite hefty and the quality unimpressive (nearly $70 for two hamburgers and fries). The bathroom was nice except the shower had very little water pressure and was very difficult to shower in. The pocket door in the bathroom did not lock and also did not block any sound so there's not very much privacy. The air conditioner cooled the room well but was very loud and woke us every hour when it kicked back on. The Queen bed was at best a Full bed and was not very comfortable. For breakfast the next morning we again ordered room service. When it arrived I noticed they had forgotten the bacon in my meal. They did send it up when I called down for it but it took around a half hour and I had already finished eating. This meal was close to $80 for two breakfasts and was probably worth at most $40. Upon checking out I noticed that they had included a charge for the parking despite it having been included in the bill. When I mentioned it they corrected it but it makes you wonder how often that happens. Be sure to check your bill for inaccuracies! All in all, the best part of this hotel was probably the terrace and the Valet parking.

Wonderful Aveda products supplied the bathroom (soap, shampoo, conditioner and lotion only). Internet access was charged but credited back on check out (again due to 'silver' status).

This is NOT because our particular room was too small, just poor design of the bed and the corners being hidden under the comforter. There were only two bath sized towels in the bathroom. At least one more would have been helpful. Also no hooks in the bathroom for wet towels, etc. The most important CON was arriving in the restaurant for Easter Sunday breakfast/brunch. We were seated (at a table with incomplete settings) only to wait over ten minutes with no attention. We were then informed that the restaurant was closed for the next 30 minutes so they could change over from breakfast to brunch. We left wondering why the 'Special Easter Brunch' was advertised as starting when we arrived and feeling like the service really lacked in professionalism and simple manners. No apology, no nothing. Just \"we're closed for the next half hour; if you want to come back then, that's fine\". It was such a downer way to end the stay. We were able to see what the 'cozy' rooms look like as opposed to the room we were upgraded to, and they are seriously small in comparison.

When I reported this to one of the receptionists, I was told that there should be one in there. Odd. By the way, there might be some collusion between the doormen and certain cab drivers. One driver, who gets a lot of business from a certain doorman, immediately pressured me to agree to a flat rate $30 fare to LGA. The doorman told me that I should be suspicious of anyone who tries to charge me any more than $30; that $30 should be about right. Given the agreement between the sums quoted by the two gentlemen, I wonder if the doorman isn't getting a cut of that $30 to keep referring fares to the driver in question.

I'll try to review this hotel in the context of New York Hotels, which I am sure are very small, and very expensive. First, the location is amazing. Lexington and 57th, only 4-5 blocks from the GE building, and Central Park. It's a very expensive area, maybe lacking a little bit in normal restaurants (i.e. not restaurants that take a month to get a reservation). For tourism though, it's a great spot. The hotel itself is very nice. Nice decorations, very modern, stylish, and intimate, which is what I wanted. I hoped a smaller hotel with less guests would mean better service. There were just a few issues which got a little annoying. 1. When we arrived there was no one to help with the luggage and even after check in there was no offer to help. Not a huge deal, but expected I think at this hotel. 2. The first room we got (with points) was only a double bed. This was really really small. I was happy to have a free room, but two people cannot realistically fit on a double bed comfortably. Maybe this is how it is in New York. 3. The heater was broken. I am surprised no one noticed this before I got there. They came by and fixed it which was nice within about an hour. 4. They were able to move me to a king room, which was super nice of them! Much much better. The problem was, no heater again!! This time someone came to fix it right away, however, they never fixed it. 5. We came home from dinner / show late, at about midnight, and the heater was still broken, completely, no note, or communication or anything. Just a cold room. I call to the service number, and no one answers after multiple calls. I go downstairs to get help, and they apologize, give me some waters, and move me to another room. BTW, every time we ask for help with bags, it takes nearly 30 minutes for someone to come. Now, back into a queen room, which was very nice and comfortable. 6. The desk manager at night offered free breakfast to compensate for the situation, which was generous of him. I told him, we have plans for breakfast, but thanks anyway. Points / credit may be nice, and he said that was great. However, when we check out, a letter arrives with certificate for breakfast. I mean come on!? Other than that, great hotel. Nice restaurant with good food, and a kind of club / lounge atmosphere.", "Date": "December 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belmont Shore, California", "Title": "\u201cNEW YORK GETAWAY\u201d", "Author": "gvagenas", "ReviewID": "UR87622208", "Content": "We were 6 nights in New York City.

I was staying in Hotel Hell at the Roosevelt for work (read my post on that, if you dare) and decided to stay an extra night in the city and switched to the Renaissance. This was a stylish, well-situated hotel that has a great boutique feel. The entrance is right on 57th. Check-in is on the floor below the hotel lobby. You must take an elevator up to the lobby after check-in and then a different elevator to your room. It's confusing the first time but fine once you know where you're going. I was most impressed with the decor. Very Sleepy Hollow-like, in my opinion. Lots of chocolate browns, nature-inspired bronze statues and beautiful glass-blown pieces decorate the public spaces. The rooms are large for New York. Very modern with a light wood closet/entertainment center/desk piece as the room's focal point. I was scheduled to have a \"larger queen room\" but was given a comfortable king bed. The bathrooms are just as pictured by other travelers' photos. Natural stones, modern fixtures, Aveda products, plenty of space for a single girl with lots of products. The staff was lovely. The front desk attendant couldn't have been nicer and gave me a bag of chocolate covered raisins as a welcome gift. A manager on duty personally thanked me for choosing the hotel, especially impressive since I wasn't paying for it. The bellman was perfect, storing my bags after checkout and helping with a car to the airport who happened to be the best NYC driver I've ever used. The ONLY downside: tiny elevators. If you have two people with two bags in elevator, you experience sardine can-like closeness. They're tiny but it's an older, renovated property; it's what you would expect. I didn't mind but a claustrophobic would. Great chain hotel with a wonderful boutique vibe.

I have stayed at hotels all over the world and have NEVER had service the way I had here. I am a native New Yorker but haven't \"vacationed\" or been a \"tourist\" of the city before. Amazing does not even seem to be a proper word but I cannot think of another. We arrived on Friday afternoon and had a very easy check-in. We stayed in the Sky Loft Suite, room 1701. Now yes I will say it was pricey, but for a special occasion TOTALLY worth it. The terrace overlooking 57th street was spacious and comfortable. Every single employee that we encountered greeted us with a smile and wanted to make sure we were happy. We had to chase 2 of the gentleman down the hall to give them a tip!! We asked for a refrigerator and extra chairs for the terrace, when they heard we were a bachelorette party they brought us 9 chairs and 2 fridges. If we had a need it was solved in under 5 minutes. The room was comfortable, spacious, VERY CLEAN, Keuring coffee pot definetly an added plus. We did however have 1 complaint, we had received complementary breakfasts for our stay at Opia. While the breakfast was SCRUMPTIOUS (we highly recommend hte southern breakfast and the almond pancakes) we found the main waiter to be a bit rude and discourteus. Two days in a row we had breakfast with our vouchers and both days he tried to tell us the voucher was for only 3 of the guests instead of all 4 and we found him acting VERY pleasant and accomodating to other guests while we had to wait 20 minutes for pancakes and eggs. In conclusion, because I can go on:) this was a FANTASTIC stay, wonderful people, AMAZING staff and accomodations. You all were so amazing that the guests that came to the party were even impressed (when they walked in they were formally greeted and told where we were...even top class service to those that weren't staying at the hotel).

Our room was the perfect size, not too small except perhaps the bathroom....not much space in the way of a counter-top to lay hairbrushes on, or make-up. We did not eat in the hotel restaurant, but the menu sounded delicious. We felt the prices for breakfast were way out in left field, so we chose to go to the Greek Diner 2 doors down and have breakfast and then we found that the diner delivered, so we were able to enjoy breakfast on our terrace. All of the staff at the hotel were wonderful, in particular Daniel, a Bellman was more helpful than one could ever imagine. Our only complaint, the hotel internet. M husband had to work and needed to log into his office computer. The hotel outsources their internet service and they would not allow my husband to use his \"Go To My PC\" program to log into his office. He had to go to Kinkos a few blocks away to get what he needed done. What he could have done in an hour at the hotel, took an entire morning with the walking back and forth and having to wait for a free computer. That sucked. All in all, I'd highly recommend this hotel, despite the poor internet service. Next time, we'll just bring our own laptop with our own wireless card. It'll work better and won't cost anything either...the hotel also charges for internet service.", "Date": "June 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cMeets expectations\u201d", "Author": "Martin3", "ReviewID": "UR65591298", "Content": "I quite like this hotel.

The restaurant, Opia I believe, was packed each night as well as the bar area. If you are wanting a lively night scene this is your place. The negatives: 1) Concierge level is the bar area so at night you have to order from a list of about 8 appetizers. For breakfast the doors are closed and you have to use your card to access which is more typical. 2) The noise level is loud from the street due to not being high up. If street noise bothers you then DO NOT stay here. 3) Business Center - Well, this isn't what I call a business center when you have to pay for it. As many have said, why when you pay $250 to $350 for a room do you have to pay for internet or to use the business center. 4) TV service was sketchy at times.

Very nice and quiet overall. Nice modern interior design. The doormen are always nice and opens the door for you. Great location - big brand name shops around, and only a few blocks away from Central Park, MOMA, and Serendipity3. Free internet in the lobby area. Cons: Other than the toilet tank doesn't fill up quickly (ie. you have to wait 10-15 minutes between flushes, and sometimes it just doesn't flush for reasons I don't understand - maybe our neighbor flushed and we have to wait for our turn?), I have some thoughts on its service. This hotel is marketed as a boutique hotel, but I do wish the service can step up a tad bit. - We went to the concierge to book a town car to the airport for our departure. There was a couple before us when we got there and there was no one at the counter. We all stood there for 20-30 minutes until someone finally showed up. However, she didn't apologize or explained for the prolonged absence. She does seem nice and helpful when she is there though. - The restaurant is designed nicely but the service could be improved. When we went there for dinner, no one greeted us at the front even though they weren't busy and were just chatting in the bar area. They saw us and didn't bother to come forward. Finally one of them came forward and showed us to a table, but they didn't offer a menu. We later discovered the menu was inside the drink menu and ordered our food, but realized that they offered some other guests a bigger menu. Our food arrived and the server never checked back to see if we needed anything. The guests next to our table tried for 10 minutes to get their attention so they can get some ketchup. It is not a big deal, but it gets a bit irritating. Their food is OK and their menu makes you think it were a serious restaurant, but the service is not. Just be prepared, and don't expect a lot of service like a regular restaurant.

When you enter into the hotel you're not sure if you've actually arrive as the lobby is more of a hall way. The door men hit the button to open the door, which is normally reserved for the disabled. Once you're finished your hallway check in you have to take your bags up one level cross over to the other side and wait for the elevator to take you to your floor. I was disapointed with the room. It was too small. I'm a Marriott silver card holder and the room I had was, in my opinion, inadequate. The decor looked like any other hotel I've been to. The scenery was the side of a semi-derelict building. In order for room service to awaken (at about 9 or 10 AM!), I had to call them 2 or sometimes 3 times asking them where my order was. Now if this place wasn't sold to me as a 5 star location boutique hotel, I would not have expected 5 star service and I would have probably been satisfied with it.

She insisted, took my address, and several months later has yet to send me the coupon. Adding insult to injury, as they say.

It is hip, trendy, upbeat and located in an ideal location. Our room was small, but so are most apartments in Manhattan and staying here was like living in NYC for a few days. Decor was minimalistic but modern and edgy, service was outstanding with doormen, and bellmen and concierge greeting you with gusto and helping in every respect. Our room had a small terrace, which in and of itself, is a small luxury in NYC. Food was good and ambiance chic in the resturant. The location was amazing, we were able to walk to everything or it was a quick cab ride away. New concierge lounge had just opened and offered a nice array of foods and had a very interesting decor. This hotel is not for guests who are anticipating the usual Renaissance stay. It is small and inviting and very NYC. Gone is the \"Marriott carpeting and drapes\" and in it's place cool seating and warm lighting and artistic glass. You won't find a big check in desk when you walk in, instead there are small kiosks where you are checked in and directed to an elevator to the main lobby and to the room elevators. This hotel is for guests like us, who are ready for an interesting city stay and instead of booking an independent small hotel or a W Hotel can now happily book a Marriott property and get and redeem points. We enjoyed our stay very much and were very impressed with the interesting differences between this hotel and traditional city Marriott Hotels.", "Date": "August 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cFabulous Stay\u201d", "Author": "clindsey91", "ReviewID": "UR38572543", "Content": "What can we say but excellent customer service, very accomodating from hotel staff.

It is much nicer than many other places in the same 3 star range. Pros: - Very clean - Comfortable bed - Good storage area for the space - Nice bathroom - Excellent location Cons: - Price (almost $300/night) - Layout of the bed - Just skip the breakfast (they finally told me it was free on the last day, but service was ridiculous and a waste of time) Overall, it's a great hotel but make sure you look for a good rate. I got stuck last minute and had to pay a fortune. Very cosy feeling and great location. Only a few minutes to Central Park and 5th Ave. Nobu is literally right down the street. (although for better prices and sushi just as good head to Times Square - \"Blue Fin.\") I think I'd like to stay a little further down next time, the walk from Times Square/Midtown area was too long after a long night. My ONLY complaint (and I am not easily bothered by room size I swear!) is the bed layout. It has VERY sharp corners and the very first night I banged into the edge. I have never had such a bruise that was there for literally weeks. Kind of hard to move around and I am quite small as is my fiance.

The staff were polite, the rooms were clean, and the location was great. On top of this, the complementary cheese plate, Chardonnay, and personalized \"warm regards\" card was an added bonus. We arrived to a spotless room on Friday evening with a staff eager to assist us with our luggage. We dropped our stuff off, dressed, and got a drink at the restaurant before hitting the streets. I like my scotch and I appreciated their selection so 57 gets a nod for that. The hotel was brand new, and looked it! The bathrooms were *clean*, the beds were comfy, the TV was nice, there was plenty of room for storage, there was a full size mirror with peripheral lights on the back of the closet door, and a great view (I was on the 13th floor). The overall design of the room was chic and clever. In bullet form, here are the takeaways from my stay at this hotel: * Courteous: the staff was polite and helpful * Clean: the bathrooms, beds, rooms, restaurant, lobby, etc. were in great shape * Charming: the decor of the bedroom along with the assortment of lighting options (beneath the bed, behind the bed, ceiling, overhead reading lights, etc.) can really help set the mood. Don't forget the complementary cheese plate and wine! * Convenient: It's on 57th and Lexington.

Bar was expensive but a swanky place to have a quick drink. Conceirge excellent as was the door staff. Limo to airport well worth the fare of $55, compared to the yellow cabs.

My friends and I arrived at the hotel at 12, with our room not being ready. We decided to go do a little shopping and told the front desk that we would be back. Around 5, our room still was not ready. However, we were given free drinks and food at the hotel bar, which has great service and a lovely atmosphere. Overall, the room was a great treat, considering some of the hotels in NYC. The bathroom was spacious, and the beds/bedding was extremely comfertable. The high-def TV was a plus, but because youre in NYC, you probably arent going to use it alot. The only problem in the room was that if you wanted to put the AC on, it never went off. Also, the sink had a drainage problem but we informed the front desk about it, and they fixed it. My friend got sick, and the hotel gave us 5 bottles of water for free. Also, they would continously hold open doors for us, and gave us whatever we needed. One of the bellman, Joshua, was amazing for negotiating with cab drivers for us. Overall, it was definitely a great experience and if Im in the NYC area again I will definitely choose this hotel..

I stayed at this hotel the weekend of July 4 with my girlfriend. We both agreed that this is a very nice hotel. For someone who has only been to NY twice, this is the PERFECT location. Lexington ave has plenty of shops, and you are 1-3 blocks from Park, Madison, and Fifth Avenues. Bryant Park, The MOMA and everything you would want to see are close by. There is a subway station on 59th and Lexington Ave. It's also a short walk to Central Park and Times square. You get the midtown feel but without all of the tourist traffic. If you look at the Renaissance in Times Square, you'll find that it is in the heart of Times Square, which means extra congestion and noise all hours of the night. I would much rather walk the 10 short blocks down to Times square. As for the hotel I got an incredible rate of $179 a night. They are renovating the hotel, and there was a lot of noise in the lobby. but once you get up to your floor you won't hear a thing. They also stopped construction around 5pm and didn't do any on the weekend. We arrived too early to check in and the concierge was kind enough to hold our bags until our room was ready (note- we arrived at 10:45 and there were still tenants in our room, which was why is wasn't ready.) the bellhops were extremely friendly and always greeted us every time they saw us. There is a restaurant in the hotel that also has a lounge and a bar, so it's a good place to relax and have a few cocktails. We didn't get the chance to eat there but the menu looks good. Average prices for a NY restaurant. We stayed in Room 411, which I would highly recommend for any couple. The bathroom was extra spacious, and there was a separate bathtub. there's a large mounted plasma TV in front of the bed. there is also a desk and a couch. I'm not sure if it's pull out, but either way the room is spacious enough for 4 people. I'm a 25 year old male btw. Anyone who says the rooms are small have unrealistic expectations for hotels in NY. It was quiet at night, except for the occasional car horn. But again you are in NY and it's expected. I'm also a light sleeper. I guess the only blemish is that you have to pay $20 for internet but I highly doubt you need it. I just wanted to by some tickets for a party at the last minute. There is a restaurant right next door that offers a good breakfast/brunch for a great price! the total bill was $19 for two people. For my future visits to NY I will be returning to this hotel. By my standards which are high but realistic, I approve of this hotel! I do not suggest the Renaissance in Times Square. It's too busy and you won't get any rest. Please don't miss out! P.S. Be sure to visit Crumb Bakeshop at the corner of 52nd and Madison.
