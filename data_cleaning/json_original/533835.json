From the outside it looks like a nice hotel, only a couple of minutes walk from Kings Cross - great location! As soon as you step through to the reception you realise this is super budget. The reception area smells of smoke and is cheap through and through. However, the receptionist was friendly and helpful. We had a room at the end of a corridor on the ground floor - good for lack of noise from other customers. Appalling due to very loud and continual noise from what I suspect is the boiler which neighbours the room. (Room 73) This is bad luck, and I'm sure other rooms would have been fine noise-wise. The room was extremely tiny. The double bed was the smallest bed I've ever seen described as a double bed - I suspect about 4ft wide. The en suite was tiny too, I initially thought it was the cupboard. However the room and en suite were perfectly clean and the bed comfortable. Breakfast the next morning was in the basement, with windows so not too dingy. Not the best or worst breakfast I've ever had - it was adequate. The 'chef' lobbing toast across us into the toast section made us laugh ;0) It was an experience!! They also allowed us to store our backpacks at the hotel for two nights for nothing, which was really handy indeed. All in all it was a cheap and clean hotel in an excellent location.

The outside of the hotel looks quite plush and even the inside is well-carpeted once you get beyond the reception area. I had asked for a quiet room and the receptionist must have looked at my request, taken in our age (my husband and I are in our 60s), and said \"I had better give you a room on the first floor - room 55\" Room 55 was at the back and was very quiet. It was also warm, a plus in December/January. The surfaces were clean - sheets, towels, etc. There were more than enough coat hangers. There was a plentiful supply of hot water. Now for the downside: I have stayed in several budget hotels in London but this was the first one where I was given just one towel. On the first night I asked for a second towel when I returned late at night and was handed one by the night receptionist. However, just two towels (for my husband and myself) were left again the following morning. There were no pictures on the walls (we could live with that) but a mirror in the bedroom would have been useful. Far worse was the fact that there was no light shade (just a naked bulb), no bedside light which meant one of us always had to get out of bed to switch off the light, and not a single hook. Anywhere! I know the Europa is a budget hotel but surely they could have managed just one hook in the bathroom... We didn't risk breakfast. Probably a mistake as, apart from the orange juice and the surly staff, the breakfast reviews sound quite positive. Instead we went to St Pancras Sation for breakfast each morning. Can recommend \"Le Pain Quotidien\" (but not budget!) The bathroom plug was broken and the television didn't work. I did report the television to reception and it had been fixed by the time we returned to the hotel later that day. I mentioned that the surfaces were clean - nice crisp sheets - and the towels were changed each day. However, my husband put his clothes in the drawers and, when he took out his scarf, it was covered with a thick layer of dust. There was also a piece of chewing gum stuck on top of the carpet between the twin beds which wasn't very pleasant. I couldn't really recommend this hotel because I have stayed in better budget accommodation for the same price in London. However, it was New Year, when many hotels double their prices, and the European seemed to maintain its normal tariff. Also the location, on a garden square so close to Kings Cross, was perfect for us. You can even walk into the centre if you are reasonably fit. We walked back to the Europa on New Year's Eve from Leicester Square. It took about 35 minutes.", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cGood value, great location\u201d", "Author": "HarryAngstrom1", "ReviewID": "UR121878260", "Content": "Actually not the worst hotel you wil find in this are of Lonodn in this price bracket.

The hotel was easy enough to find (10 min walk from Euston station or right across the road from Kings Cross Underground) Our first night was spent on the 2nd floor at the front of the hotel (room 20) - upon arrival in the afternoon we were made up - lovely view out of the window, nice clean room, tv, brew facilites, etc - however during the night there might as well had not been a window as we could hear EVERYTHING - footsteps, conversations, sirens, cars, etc! My husband went to reception after the worst nights sleep and they agreed to move us to another room at the back of the hotel. Our new room was ground floor right to the end of the hotel (room 78 I think) which was a lot better - slightly larger too - however we were right next to the boiler/laundry room so could hear it firing up all through the night. We decided to stay as we didn't want to spend our holiday weekend packing and unpacking! On the plus side - this hotel was a very good location - right across from the Kings Cross tube - cheap for London at \u00c2\u00a375 p/n which obviously proves you get what you pay for. Breakfast was included in the price which was fab - A hot buffet breakfast consisting of sausage, beans, eggs (scrambled and fried), plum tomatoes and bacon. You get 2 slices of toast from the kitchen staff when you sit down at your table but don't expect a smile - also we asked for more toast and was met with a grunt - we had to ask twice more before it arrived! There was cereal, milk, tea/coffee, orange squash and water but make sure you don't use the sauces as they looked like they had been there a few years - plus the 'use by' date on one of the ketchup bottles was 2007!! (Maybe they just refilled them but we didn't want to risk it - they did look a bit grotty!) There are plenty of restaurants and cafes in this area with a McDonalds right on the corner of the street and a Pizza Express on the next block up.

I asked for a quiet room on an upper floor with a view, and that is what room 54 is. The toilet and shower-room were separate, always a good thing. Hot water in the shower took a while but water pressure was fine. One of the cleaners almost smiled one morning. Now the negatives. Staff at check-in had a world-weary air of resignation. The TV only had BBC 1, but if you fiddle with it you lost that, too. Breakfast is anarchic \u00e2\u20ac\u201c only two staff trying to cope with far too many punters.

The lumps and springs added a touch of the unexpected to our night's sleep. And the single flat pillows were an elegant nod towards comfort.

We could not sleep late because the curtains were very thin and the bright light would go through as if there were no curtains. It's so easy to have double curtains or dark curtains to solve the problem that I talked to one of the staff at the reception about that problem but although she listened, she seemed not to care at all. As for breakfast, it was even worse. The plates smelt bad...(You know this strong smell that you can get on dishes that is not well washed)...We tried to find 2 clean plates and tried to get something eatable. As for the coffee it was hot but tasted like water. I lived in London for almost 2 years and I had never had such a bad breakfast! The breakfast was so disgusting that we decided not to eat breakfast there anymore. I was really upset about the room and then about the breakfast. I could not understand how so many people could come down to breakfast. Because the hotel was probably fully booked and people did not care or were very hungry.

I went back two weeks ago and unfortunately it wasn't quite so good. I wanted a basic room and when I rang the week before the girl on reception said phone on the morning you are coming down to London and see if we have any rooms. Not very helpful. I rang the next day and got one of the more helpful receptionists who took my credit card no to hold the room for my first night. I was arriving the following Wed evening. When I arrived the following week the receptionist said they were fairly full but I was given a basic room as requested, \u00c2\u00a335 with the toilet at the end of the corridor and on the top floor. That was fine by me. The room 49A was actually a room divided in two hence 49 and 49A and there wasn't room to swing a cat. It was long and thin and when you lay on the bed the Tv which was high up on a bracket was facing the right hand side wall so you couldn't see it properly. Towel provided but no soap. The guy in 49 was coughing all evening and you could hear everything. He had his tv on till 4am. Breakfast was OK you help yourself to eggs bacon etc and the orange juice is orange squash mixed with water. They have a room to leave your luggage when you check out if your train or plane is later in the day. This is handy as KX left luggage are about \u00c2\u00a37.50 per bag to leave for up to 24 hrs. I found the reception staff helpful and would have stayed longer than three days but for the noise. When I stayed the previous year I got a big room on the top floor for \u00c2\u00a330 with the toilet at the end of the corridor and no noise. Pity this time it wasn't so good and I had to move to another hotel round the corner. Still for \u00c2\u00a335 for a single and with a great location and helpful receptionists I think it's a reasonable deal.

To say this hotel was basic was an understatement. Yes the location is ideal for tourists but that was about the only good thing about it and I would seriously recommend people to stay elsewhere if at all possible. Firstly there is no interaction with the staff and guests, I tried to engage in a pleasant conversation with the receptionist but was brushed off. Then when we entered the room it went downhill from there. We envisaged the room to be small and basic and this was as we thought but with further disappointments. Firstly the cupboards scattered around the room were all at funny odd angles and made the room seem even smaller. You had to climb over the bed to get to the otherside of the room. The wardrobe rail was broken and we had to fix ourselves in order to hang our clothes, the TV had not got good reception on a couple channels (which although we thought wouldn't matter one night when we stayed in it was this channel which had the movies on!) The shower which ajoined (we paid extra for a private bathroom) was too small to get dry, the shower was falling apart at the top and with only two small towels it was not good - we had to use one towel for the floor as no matter what we did water seemed to go everwhere. It reminded me of a cheap self accommodation apartment abroad not London! The shower had a hole in the floor to it and the toilet, again placed at an odd angle, had no toilet roll holder so you had to reach up to the top of the toilet to get some. The room seemed to stay moist when you had a shower and brought about a heat in the bedroom. Luckily the only good thing about this was that of the fan above the bed. However when I stood on the bed to pull the string to turn it on I couldn't reach, it was too high up, luckily my partner could reach but only just. Unfortunately the plumbing must be faulty as everytime anyone else in the hotel was running a tap, having a shower, using the toilet a loud gurgling sound would emerge from the shower hole and in order to sleep at night we had to block with one towel to get peace!!! In addition sleeping facing the front had a view of a small little park, nothing to brag about, and it was noisy at night so sleep was lacking. The breakfast - I was so looking forward to this, however it was cheap and nasty. The food looked like it was sitting a while in a buffet style container and the cereal in open containers. My partner, who never says no to a good fry up, passed on breakfast and ate a bit of toast that we were given. It was not a full english fry as anticipated but cheap thin sausages with no taste, bacon very undercooked, some cheap tinned tomatoes and beans and eggs that had just been sat there. No mushrooms, hash browns, even black pudding. Very disappointing. I would like to point out that on the first day when we came back after a day of sightseeing before going for dinner we wanted a drink in the room, it was wet and we wanted a hot drink, unfortunately the maid had not cleaned the room fully and we had not been given clean cups and more tea/coffee to use. I went down to ask for more and the receptionist, rudely brushed me off and told me to 'help myself' in the open kitchen - when I went in I was disgusted. It was the first day in the hotel and from what I saw in there I didn't go to breakfast for even toast for the remainder of the stay. Milk left lying out, cereals still uncovered left lying for the next day, cheap food and bread pushed into the freezers in abundance. Nothing was fresh and looked after. So as you can imagine I would not recommend this hotel to anyone even my worst enemy. It is ok if you don't eat, are extremely tiny and an insomniac but to people who like sleep, do not like avoiding cupboards, like to eat a good breakfast to start the day off and like peace / quiet don't go.

The only positive was clean sheets. Room had the smallest 'bathroom' I've ever seen, and it stank - my girlfriend refused to use the shower. TV was one channel only with a remote that clearly belonged to another TV. Too hot in the room - heating on all night with no control over this. Didn't bother with the breakfast, so can't comment on that. Relatively cheap, but certainly not cheerful. Spend another 20 quid and get somewhere decent would be my advice.", "Date": "April 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Budapest", "Title": "\u201cStole my money\u201d", "Author": "TravelGirlBudapest", "ReviewID": "UR6766953", "Content": "I booked a room in the European hotel, but when i arrived there I got somewhat scared.

Its been two months now and I havent seen any money back, furthermore they also charged me for the second week.
