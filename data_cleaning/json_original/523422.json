Since we were arriving by car on a Friday night, I emailed the hotel to ask about parking that night. The response was that it was free after 6.30pm til 8.30am on Saturday morning, which translated to me, as being free from Friday 6.30pm and then all through the weekend as stated on their website. However,we found that there are restrictions on Saturday from 8.30am till 1.30pm and it is parking for residents only. This means if you had intended to go out Saturday and leave the car parked, it's impossible to do so. You either have to find a pay car park from 8.30am till 1.30pm (and then who is going to interrupt their day out sightseeing to come back and move the car back to the free parking outside the hotel?) or end up paying for many more hours while you leave the car in the pay car park, while you are out for the rest of the day and possibly into the night. This small but INCORRECT piece of advice from the hotel, was of great concern to us, since we had specifically chosen this hotel for the free all weekend parking we thought they were offering, and which was implied on their website.

She arrived a little earlier and was put into a basement room with a tiny window because no other room was available, or so they said. Also we booked the Albion House Hotel but were given a room at the Excelsior instead. The next day, the concierge promised, we'd be able to move into a better room. We asked for a room at the Albion but none was available. I was puzzled but decided not to say anything since I was tired and just wanted a nice room. We were then put into Melville Hotel. The first impression of the room was actually good, it looked clean and was modernly furnitured. However it lacked diverse basic equipment like tissues, a bin (we used a bag which was taken away by the cleaning staff with the result of having nothing), face and floor towels, a blowdryer, bedside table... Also we were told that there was Wi-Fi, but couldn't get a signal. However we were still relieved about the improvement. We weren't pleased about the breakfast however. It was without question the most horrific breakfast I ever had at a hotel. First of all we had to wait in a cue cause there was only room for approximately 10 people. The \"buffet\" consisted of toast, cheap cheese and ham slices, cold boiled eggs (if one was lucky) and fruit juice. And there was some jam and Nutella on the table. I'm sure most of the lodgers decided to stay away from breakfast after their first morning. At least so did we. Now some people could argue that that's what it's like in a budget hotel but 100 Pounds a night are not actually cheap and one could expect a moderate service.
