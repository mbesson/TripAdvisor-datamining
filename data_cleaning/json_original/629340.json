{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Convenient place, nice people We spend 4 nights in this hotel in January 2007, with our 6 year old daughter.We enjoyed the location: close to the train station and metro, close to the amazing zoo (have a look, even if you are adult).The street was really quiet, unbelievable. There is a kind of shopping area close to the train station.The people in the hotel were reliable, we could let our computer in the room without any issue.The room was small, but we could manage.A place we really recomend.", "Date": "Aug 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR498125649", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "The4Family78"}, {"Content": "Falue for money! We stayed there for 2 night in February 2008. The hotel is about 2 Minutes walk from JR Ueno station. Despite the city location it's very quiet.The rooms are small, but not extremely small. Everything in the room is nice organized. It's also quite new and clean.Rates are low, and as a business hotel it charges per room, and not as many hotels in Japan do per person. The breakfast buffet is OK and has what you need to start the day.One warning: the hotel is good and many people know it - better book early!Next time in Tokyo I will stay there again for sure!", "Date": "Mar 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR361148209", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Jensimann"}, {"Content": "Cute European Style Hotel This is a really cute little hotel located across the street from Tokyo's Ueno station. We stayed here for a couple nights and found the hotel very charming. The interior decor is done well and the hotel is quite new. The rooms are small (but what do you expect in Tokyo?!). The immediate area around the hotel doesn't have much character, but it only takes about 5 minutes to walk to Ueno Park and to the market area, which is lively and bustling. The only thing I'd warn people about is that there were lots of small flies in the bathroom, which was a bit odd. There was no caulking between the edge of the bathtub and the wall, which is my uneducated theory on their origins. We just kept the bathroom door closed, so they didn't get into the room. Better flies than mosquitoes!", "Date": "Oct 23, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR426651341", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Urban_Adventurer"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066461-d629340-r19089095-Hotel_Astil_Ueno-Taito_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "629340", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
