{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Stadia Suites Stadia Suites is located in the new financial center of Mexico City. The hotel is surrounded by other high rises many still being built. Its a long walk away from what's billed as the largest shopping mall in Latin America. But I never made it that far.I would compare the hotel to a Residence Inn. The rooms include a small kitchenette that includes a small washing machine. So it seems to cater more towards longer term stays.I was only in Mexico City for 4 nights so I didn't have a chance to eat at the hotel. They have an on-site, linen table cloth restaurant and a nearby Italian dinner that handles room service for the hotel.The rooms were clean and functional. For me they seemed to lack the warm, welcoming feeling.", "Date": "Nov 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR208345403", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "zhatch"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g150800-d1208884-r21825743-Stadia_Suites-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "HotelID": "1208884", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
