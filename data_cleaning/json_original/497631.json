First impressions were that it was not 4 star and although I had booked a delux room they had not been informed of my upgrade by the travel agent in uk. They offered me an upgrade the next day but could not be bothered to change for one night the room I had was ok. A uniformed member of staff then turned up with wine fruit and water. Had a meal in the restaurant a la carte which was good and reasonable and coffee in the lounge near reception. Swimming pool on roof very pleasant and hot with a very warm jacuzzi excellent plus a bar if you wanted a drink or snack. Returned to hotel for one night on the 5th March got a delux room although again not allocated! lovely room 510 with a limited view of clocktower. Wine, fruit and water arrived and later a member of staff to ask if all ok, followed by someone else asking if I had any laundry. Meal in hotel restaurant lovely in lovely surroundings, served by lovely staff! Left the hotel and the luggage man took my cases and sorted out transfer to airport.

Firstly though, I found the staff very pleasant and helpful and it's not their fault that the place is so drab. The first thing that you notice when you go to find your room is the smell ... I thought it was the smell of damp but my friend said that it was the smell of chlorine from the water displays in the lobby, it was very strong and permeated into the room. You do get used to it after a couple of days !!!! Next, the place is very drab and joyless, and there are very few places to go to visit or eat nearby. I certainly feel that we stayed in the wrong part of town. We went to the sister Hotel for a day but that is very tired looking also and certainly nothing like the pictures posted on their site, very very dissappointing. We found the prices very expensive for food and drink at both Hotels.I hardly slept for the first three nights as the bed was so hard and really, I will not be in a hurry to go back to Dubai.", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Australia", "Title": "\u201cJust a bit of a let down for Dubai standards.\u201d", "Author": "Jess P", "ReviewID": "UR125378868", "Content": "The pool and spa area were fantastic, very relaxing.

We called for room service 3 times during our stay and each time they were either extremely late or no show or brought us wrong orders. One time we asked for extra plates and cups and they didn't even show up. No ropes or slippers, just simple towles. Wrong information on how to use the safty deposit box.

We arrived at 1.30 in the morning but check-in was quick and painless. The staff were friendly and efficient. Our room (no. 619) was fine and had a very large and very comfortable bed. The pillows were too deep and firm for me but we had no problems getting them changed. We had a large flat screen TV, internet access, mini fridge, hair dryer and room safe, but unfortunately no tea/coffee making facilities. The bathroom was small but clean and adequate. The room was reasonably quiet, except for a fire alarm that rang briefly at 3am the first night (we never found out why). There was a bit of traffic noise from outside but not enough to keep you awake. The hotel had a small gym, separate male and female saunas, roof-top pool with loungers, a jacuzzi and a small bar. Pool towels were provided. The hotel is situated in an established part of Deira and it is not surrounded by building sites, unlike a lot of Dubai. It is not very close to the many of the sites of Dubai (which are all quite spread out anyway) so you do need to take a taxi everywhere. However, the taxis are very plentiful, cheap, reliable and safe. However, only use the official metered taxis as there are some rogue taxis, which charge you inflated prices. The hotel runs it\u2019s own transports to it\u2019s sister hotel somewhere close to the Dubai beach and they also run to Deira City Centre Shopping Mall. My husband had a birthday while we were staying there and the staff surprised him with a lovely, sponge birthday cake left in our room on the morning of his birthday. Buffet breakfast was provided in the main restaurant on the first floor, which was adequate with a reasonable selection of hot and cold food. This room also served as a buffet dinner restaurant in the evenings \u2013 the Al Riqa Restaurant. We ate here only one evening, which I think cost 89Dh per person. It was okay but nothing special. There was also a very nice Chinese Restaurant on this floor called Summer Place, which we tried on our last night and had a lovely meal. The prices here were reasonable and the staff friendly. On the ground floor was a tea lounge called The Royalton Lounge \u2013 again, the staff here were lovely. The hotel also had a pub called The Dublin Arms, which I think was appalling and I would hate any foreigners to think that this was a typical Dublin pub. It was dark, dreary and seedy. It had a poor selection of drinks. It allowed the patrons to smoke (which would certainly not be the case in Dublin). They served greasy crisps with your drinks. They also served meals here but the menu was not particularly appetising. We had just one drink there and didn\u2019t go back again. I have been to many bars in Dublin and they are not like this!

We arrived at 4:00am after a long overnight flight, at which point we were offerd the possibilty to check in early if we wanted to pay an additional \u00a360 ! We naturally declined . This obviously meant that the room was vacant, and considering we'd just come from South East Asia where if a room was vacant there was never an issue to check in early with no charge, and this was all standards of hotel from moderate to expensive hotels. Having decided that we were not going to be ripped-off we decided that we'd once having slept in the foyer for a bit , to go exploring when light and return at the appointed check in time which was 12:00pm. In the end we returned to the hotel at 11:30am. At this point we attemped again to check in but were told that we couldn't as it was company policy (yet we knew the room was empty !).At that point having had very little sleep I forcibly expressed my dismay and utter incredulence at this attitude. But I was still told check would be 12:00pm as they 'needed to prepare the room' - utter nonsense of course. In the end we did end up checking in 20mins early.

Each time, I've had some sort of hassle with the staff. I'm pretty easy to please, so this is unusual. But it's one of the cheapest yet decent places in Dubai so I kept going back. Here were my problems. 1. First time I checked in (11:30pm after a long flight) they said they'd \"misplaced\" my reservation. They left me sitting in the lobby for over an hour. They told me they were going to send me to their sister hotel. Then they managed to \"find\" an available room. That room was there the entire time. Never got an apology. 2. The second time I stayed there I arrived a couple of hours before the official check in. I made sure I'd informed them I'd be requiring an early check in and they'd told me no problem. When I showed up, they said they'd have to charge me for an extra day. Why hadn't they told me this when I'd informed them earlier? They told me to have a seat in the lobby and they'd look into it. Finally, after an hour I asked what was happening. They said they hadn't yet looked into it! They just left me sitting there. I paid extra for the room and they sent me a complimentary fruit basket. 3. The third - and final - time I stayed there was this past August. When I returned to my room from some meetings, I found that all the business receipts I'd had organized on the desk were gone. I got the housekeeper and he said he'd thrown them away - as though this was perfectly natural. I'd been traveling throughout Asia and it was all my receipts plus some warrenties for office equipment I had purchased. All of them were gone! Maybe you throw away a banana peel, but unless it's in the bin you don't throw away a guest's paperwork! I complained to management and was told if my papers were important they should have been kept in the room safe. Pretty insufficient response in my opinion. I'd like to meet the business person who locks up their receipts every night. I won't be staying there again.

We could stay in a luxuous room for 1 night, and than move to an other, normal room. Since I didn't like to move after 1 night, we had to pay for the 2nd night in our luxurious room. Beds are fine, room was clean and big, view on the clocktower roundabout (I guess other rooms have no view since there are standing other buildings around the hotel) breakfast was ok...

The staff are very good and friendly. Although this is certainly not the best or most luxuarious hotel in dubai i find it very convient to the shopping centers. There are one ot two very minor areas of the hotel that need a little refurbishment but find that in most establishments but all in all a very nice hotel i would return to again meet some really nice people there as well given the price i was very satisfied with this hotel.", "Date": "July 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kuwait City, Kuwait", "Title": "\u201cOk, but wouldn't stay again\u201d", "Author": "johnybegud", "ReviewID": "UR7935522", "Content": "I stayed in this hotel for a number of reasons, but mainly that it was a great rate ($88/night for a twin room) and I was paying myself! There is nothing particularly wrong with the hotel or its quality of staff. Everyone I spoke to was polite and helpful, if not gushing with enthusiasm. Suneer in the breakfast room was the exception - very helpful and friendly. We (my son and myself) stayed three nights in June 2007. I also booked the hotel because it was in Deira. Knowing Dubai traffic I wanted something the same side of the creek as the airport. However that was my first mistake. All my business was over in Bur Dubai or further afield - it took me almost 45 minutes one day just to get over the creek. The hotel: Breakfast - Ok but pricey at Dhs69 for the pretty ordinary buffet. Location \u2013 can be a nightmare to get a cab; we had to walk on many occasions, and in 42 deg heat that can be exhausting! Internet \u2013 extremely pricey. Dhs 100 for 2 hours. Go to the internet cafes just a block away for at Dhs 5 for one hour. Room \u2013 Ok, did the job. Bathroom not the largest, no plasma TV, but free slippers. But clean and towels replaced regularly. Summary: a decent hotel, but don\u2019t expect anything more than the four stars it maintains. The location lets it down big time in my opinion but the rate I got (through Hotels.com) was excellent. I would not use the hotel again, but this is down to location.", "Date": "June 19, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Metropolitan Hotel Deira", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d497631-Reviews-Metropolitan_Hotel_Deira-Dubai.html", "Price": "$85 - $208*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">40 c Street, Near Dubai Clock Tower Al Maktoum Road</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">PO Box 33214</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Dubai</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">United Arab Emirates</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "497631", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/22/b9/3f/standard-room.jpg"}}
