The H.R.C. for a great burger accompanied by music and terrific service for about the same price. If you ask for a beer you'll be served a Berliner (lager).

Six of us were travelling to Berlin from Edinburgh for New Year. We were arriving on the 29th Dec and departing 1st Jan. About 4 weeks ago I reconfirmed our booking with the Hotel by telephone and asked about transport from Tegel Airport to the hotel. When we arrived on the 29th we were told the hotel had been over booked and was full. We were to be move to an \"apart hotel\" about 2kms away, part of a global chain, where three rooms had been booked for us. The manager of the hotel had already left for the day (6pm). She was eventually contacted by telephone, but with rooms at a premium over the holiday we had little option but to accept this forced alternative. I learned that the apart hotel had only been booked 4 days previously. Our rooms were obviously sold on to a higher bidder!

Excellent location a block from the Ku'damm and close to restaurants in Savignyplatz (10 min walk), but it was quite quiet even though it faced a few other hotels and the Hard Rock Cafe. Staff was friendly, there was a fruit bowl up front for the taking, along with a small hotel bar. A few nice touches in terms of art (hence the Arte Hotel...). Our room was decent, nothing special, but the closet was falling apart and there wasn't any ventilation, so it got even more stuffy after taking a shower.
