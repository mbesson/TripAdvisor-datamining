{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Relaxed and healthy Aiona is an unusual property. Walking through the front gate, one could be forgiven for thinking he had been transported magically to northern California, or Sedona, AZ. That's because Aiona is focused very much on alternative therapies and spiritual, as well as physical, comfort.The setting is a beautiful garden of mango and custard apple trees, with hibiscus and frangipani, too. Rahel (the owner) cooks up marvelous vegetarian ayurvedic meals, snacks, and kitchen accompaniments, which you may purchase as gifts or souvenirs for your own home. Bungalows are more than basic, with separate private bathrooms (outdoor but with plumbing). The entire property is tranquil, relaxed, and refreshing. A variety of alternative therapies are offered, from massage to yoga, to tarot-readings. Have a browse through the shell museum, if you are interested. Aiona is smoke-free and alcohol-free, but you will be so relaxed you will hardly notice the absence of these two potential toxins. And if you're bored? Slip on some fins and a mask and snorkel on the home reef right outside the beach gate of Aiona -- no joking, it is 5 steps away from the property.", "Date": "Apr 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR122078889", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "adrienne_am"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608478-d1027853-r14820776-Aiona_Garden_of_Health-Amed_Bali.html", "HotelID": "1027853", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
