I had a basement room and thought 'oh no' but it was actually very nice and did have a window. The rooms are small but not tiny and there was room to move around. Best of all the rooms are all 100% brand new - everything from the shower to the bed and carpets have been replaced very recently. There were toiletries and tea/coffee making facilities - again new. The standard was good - if you think premier inn standard you would be about right. Breakfast was continental and simple - cereals, orange juice, toast, coissant, cheese and ham, coffee. I was quite full though. On the down side, the heating is rather sparce. There was a plug in radiator in my room but the breakfast room was freezing. Also - the hotel layout is two converted town houses, both sides identical. On my return to the hotel in the evening, I asked for my key and went to the wrong side. Seeing a different room number on the door, I thought I'd asked for the wrong key and went back to reception to swap it- to be handed a second key without question. This was in fact not my room and someone else's luggage was inside. Realising I had gone to the wrong part of the hotel, I was rather embarassed but soon got my own key back. The issue was that the reception simply handed over someone else's room key to me without question and didn't check my check-in details. I'd definately book again though and would recommend a stay for the money.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Naantali, Finland", "Title": "\u201cBasic hotel in good place\u201d", "Author": "AnneJenny405", "ReviewID": "UR125935360", "Content": "First, in London there are two hotels which have same name and hotels are quite near each other.

My Mum, 2 sisters and I were greeted with a smile and a nice bright reception area. We stayed in room 109 on the 1st floor, a quadruple room with 2 singles and 1 double. It was bright with 3 windows (1 of which didn't open but wasn't a problem). I had requested room with a window when i booked. Yes, the room was tired and In need of updating but we decided to close our eyes to it as we were only needing somewhere to sleep for 1 night. The beds were clean and comfy so what more do you need?! We all slept well and all had a shower with hot water in the morning. The view wasn't good from the windows, but who sits and looks out of the window when you're there for 1 night, be realistic! The location of our room meant we could pick up wifi from the ASK restaurant below so didn't need to bother to ask for the hotels's wifi password. The staff were friendly and helpful, they bought us extra pillows on request. The breakfast room is undergoing re-wiring works so is not in the best of states but didn't affect us. The breakfast was a basic, but very nice continental with a small choice of cereal, hot toast, coissant and cheese and ham. Tea and coffee, orange juice and water were available. The waitress bought us more toast on request. Again, friendly staff. We were full and didn't need to eat again until late afternoon! At check out, we were able to leave our bags at the hotel so we could enjoy the day and collected them later. The hotel is in a brilliant location in Paddington, 3 minute walk from the station and there is a huge selection of restaurants, cafe's and pubs/bars to choose from if you're not heading further into the city. Overall, our stay was very good considering we paid only \u00c2\u00a342 each for the night! My advice would be that if you're not laid back and fussy, don't book here, pay triple the price to stay somewhere else! If you're looking for a cheap place to rest your head and can overlook the bad bits, go for it!

At one time The Rose Court was probably a quaint and elegant London Hotel, but that shipped sailed about 75 years ago. They have a lounge area that has wireless internet and a computer (you must pay to use that) and chairs and a large screen TV, that is not too bad. They serve breakfast in the basement, they bring toast to your table and they have baked beans (a strange British breakfast food), green eggs (Dr. Suess anyone?) that weren't meant to be green I am sure, tea, coffee and juice, not great, not horrible--I wouldn't write home about it.

You do have bugs and you need to close for at least one week and fumigate and kill all of the bed bugs-that is unsanitary, disgusting and you will end up losing money and maybe be closed down, so deal with it. The Rose Court has the potential of being an elegant establishment once again. But, at the VERY LEAST, close and rid yourself of the bugs! We did get our money back (although we had to pay for the night we stayed-great, I paid to be bitten by bugs!). We moved to another hotel, and paid double, a couple of blocks away, the Shaftesbury.

I'm a bachelor and it was worse than mine when I went months without cleaning it. The bedding had the odd blood stain on it, but the mattress looked like someone had been murdered on it. There was no room to walk around the room and indeed to open my bag I had to put it on the bed. The food was not good, the service was awful (the night guy looked annoyed I'd come in after nine at night) and it was a workout to get my bags in or out of the hotel. The elevator was like a coffin.

I will never stay at Rose Court again nor I can recommend it to anybody other than backpackers and desperate travelers who cannot find lodging elsewhere. Do yourself a favor and stay elsewhere. There are better hotels in London for the same price or even less. Also, do not confuse this hotel with the four-star Rose Court Hotel in Marble Arch, which appears to be nice (that was my mistake).", "Date": "September 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cTravellers Nightmare on Talbot Square!!!\u201d", "Author": "BedrockTours", "ReviewID": "UR19441557", "Content": "Arrived at Hotel expecting small, basic , clean rooms only to find an absolutely disgusting, smelly pig sty.

First thing I did upon arrival (whilst carefully averting my eyes from the grim surroundings, peeling paint, stained bedding, filthy carpet etc etc) was attempt to boil the kettle for a nice cuppa. This took an absolute age, and when the kettle had boiled, there was hardly any water in it... the kettle was leaking badly, with electric points situated precariously beneath just to add to the sense of danger and fun! As I looked from the window, I admired the view; a thirty foot drop onto what appeared to be some sort of rusting old piece of agricultural machinery, surrounded by bags of rubbish and large discarded boxes, and no visible skyline, merely the backs of other hotels, creating a sense of overwhelming claustrophobia and doom. As I peeled the paint from the window sill, I contemplated what might happen in the event of a fire, should I have to use this window as a means of escape, and hurriedly pushed the thought to the back of my head. Breakfast the next morning was very surreal. I am not sure how they managed to fry the eggs and make them all stick together in a large, (roughly) square block of congealed yolk, fat and egg-white, but somehow it worked, and would have done Tracey Emin proud as a form of modern artwork. Also on the menu was some tepid baked beans. The bacon, sausages and hash-browns must have done a runner somewhere, probably in terror at the sight of the horrifying 'egg-square monster thang'. Toast was eventually forthcoming, but the only butter on offer tasted a bit like having an affair with your aging granny; very unpleasant, and leaving a bad taste in your mouth. On the plus side, the orange juice was quite nice. In all fairness, I've stayed in a lot worse places, and I don't really mind 'roughing it', but am aware that many expect a certain basic standard and rightly so, and I don't think this place meets those standards at all. If you like your stay to be dark, dirty and dreary, then this is definitely the place for you! If not, then avoid like the plague.

We were looking forward to a nice cosy room with tea and coffee and the other bits and bobs you normally expect in a cheap hotel, after a long jouney and before a night on the town. as we turned into Talbot Square, we saw the dimley lit hotel and i commented to my husband that i had 'high hopes'. However, the frizzy haired receptionist could barely speak english, and interrupted us to answer a phonecall of which appeared to be a friend from another country. We waited patiently, and when she turned back to us, she handed us the key and mumbled directions to the room. After several 'guesses' of where the room may be, we had to return to ask her again. She finally got off her seat and waved a hand towards the door down the end of the corridoor. Upon entry, we were now feeling slightly let down. We opened what appeared to be a front door to the room, which then led us inside to our bedroom. I have to be honest it was quite dissapointing to see that there were cracks all along the walls, and there were 3 other beds in there! Our double bed was shoved up against an old fireplace, on an angle, an an old pink sofa covered the plug socket which hung completely off the wall. There was a tiny packet of coffee, but no herbal tea of milk. My hasband had to go to reception to ask for milk, were he was handed a 4 pint used carton of old milk which had a bit left over in the bottom. There was also no hairdryer and i had to go and request one from reception. There were spelling mistakes on the fire instuctions on the back of the door, but no welcome pack or introduction to the hotel, statig breakfast times and options. I also had to go and ask about this. I was extremely suprised when i walked into the teeny weeny toilet and stood on the cold, rocky, broken tiles. The window wouldn't close so it was freezing, and there was limescale and toothpaste staines on the sink and bin. Horrible!! The shower was worse. I had to squeeze sideways past it to open the door fully, and when i climbed in, i found plaster in there hangig from the walls. I had to wash away all the bits before showering. The shower head didn't work properly and water squirted from two different points on the shower which casued a leak on the floor.I could go on about all the faults of this room but breakfat was the worst In the morning we were up by half 8 and managed to find a table in the 'breakfast room' of which the tables were covered by plastic stuff and left over jam. Again, a waiter who couldnt speak a word of english, threw a pile of tatty toast onto the table and walked off. I looked around and found some beans, a pile of rubbery 'eggs' and three piles of cereal, two of which were of the same kind. I waited patiently for the rest of the breakfast to arrive, the bacon and sausages, only to find that that was it! When asked for some marmalade, the grumpy waiter rolled his eyes and gave a tut before walking off. He then went and wiped a table and didnt bother with our marmalade. We asked him again several minuites later, and he pointed to a pile of toast. After repeating that we wantd marmalade, he finally understood and went to fetch some, dumping in on a competely different table for us to go and get it ourselves. We could only laugh about this i suppose as we could see the funny side of this awful 'hotel' and went to get breakfast elsewere. We left our bags in reception for the day which were not closely monitored. I would never return to this terrible hotel, especially for 80 quid a night! it was convenient and that was it! in the future, i will not stand mouldy, smelly, dirty accomodation. ill go somewhere else next time just awful", "Date": "March 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane", "Title": "\u201cComfortable and convenient\u201d", "Author": "babyboomerBrisbane", "ReviewID": "UR10727517", "Content": "We were pleasantly surprised at how comfortable this B&B was.

There was no space in the bathroom to bend down to dry my legs, so I had to keep the bathroom door ajar, to allow my elbow to stick out and then bend down to dry myself, while at the same time planting my foot on the edge of where the bath's slate tile met the room's carpeting, to prevent the bathwater from running out into the room (the bath is built on the same level as the room floor, with no step down, so the water will flow into the room if not stopped). The room was located on the sixth floor (in the roof); the elevator only went to the fifth. I had a great view, being rather high up. There was just NO space for anything - opening my suitcase took up all the available floor space. None of the doors could open fully - the bedroom door opened halfway and hits the foot of the bed; the bathroom door opened halfway and touched the side of the bed.
