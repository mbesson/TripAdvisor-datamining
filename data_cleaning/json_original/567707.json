While the room is clean, it is very, very small. David is nice, helpful and welcoming. I would have appreciated knowing ahead of time about the cat living there since I am allergic to cats. Also, there is incense burning at all times. The location is close to the Vatican and to the Ottavio metro station (3 blocks).", "Date": "October 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Copenhagen, Denmark", "Title": "\u201cPleasant and a bit special\u201d", "Author": "joen.dk", "ReviewID": "UR6318367", "Content": "Clearly the business of a creative and quality-minded owner, this bed-and-breakfast is recommendable & I think it could be picked among the top-10 in Rome because of its originality, its location and the nice breakfast. You have a good view of St. Peter\u00b4s from your room as well as your breakfast kitchen. The building is slightly aristocratic, with a concierge, a courtyard and an old- fashioned lift. The facilities in the room are certainly above average, and its decoration will be en eye-opener, maybe even spiritually, for you, I think. The owner is friendly and efficient and his language skills are impeccable. The place is on the top floor, at the end to the right, when you leave the lift; \u00cd don\u00b4t think it is clearly signed, however. A bargain, and centrally located indeed, as well as clean and safe. ( One review on the web states that there can be a slight smell of smoke because of the owners habits, but we didn\u00b4t experience anything like \u00b4that at all ).", "Date": "December 2, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Soloroma", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d567707-Reviews-Soloroma-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Viale Bastioni di Michelangelo 5/A</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00192</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "567707", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/c1/fd/c1fdd6ce9de1040ec33d41275cbbf09a1large.jpg"}}
