They found a hotel on TripAdvisor. They were a bit concerned when they arrived at the hotel and saw prostitutes on the street. They went to the lobby which was locked; you had to be buzzed in which raised a second concern. They checked in went to the room and oh my, what a sleazy establishment!!! The mirror was cracked, stains on the pillows and bed coverlet, raw wood bed frame, closet and shelves. Towel bar in the bathroom ripped out of the wall and electrical wires hanging out of the light switch. Quickly decided not the place for them. They took pictures of the room. They went back and explained their dissatisfaction and wanted a refund. They were given a refund for only one night and were charged for two nights for two rooms on the original booking. No, problem they said, we will email the owners explain our dissatisfaction and obtain a refund. Well the owners of the property would not budge. So then they say they would have the corporate payables department dispute the charge with MasterCard. The dispute was sent off with pictures off all the things wrong with the room and a copy of the email sent to the owners. Weeks later we get a letter back from MasterCard telling us that the folio was signed and the key accepted and that constituted checking in and no refund would be do us. So, do not stay here and do not take a key, do not sign anything, use only American Express who is better with at protecting their customers than MasterCard and if in doubt RUN FORREST RUN.

First of all I asked for a room in the back and because I stayed for 6 nights I assumed that they would have given me a room in the back...not. It is true, if you have a room in the front there is a lot of traffic noise from Biscayne Boulevard. The earplugs were very welcome. Secondly, breakfast is very very simple, do not expect too much. There is a Starbucks and a Subway across the street for those who fancy a nicer breakfast. I always had breakfast in Miami Beach, at Juice and Java. Thirdly, the rooms are a bit worn out and everything is very old, especially the bathroom. Fourthly, the hotel is very far away from everything, you definately need a car and you will have to drive for about 30 minutes to get to Miami Beach! I would not recommend the New Yorker for a stay in Miami. I would advise travellers to book a B&B in Miami Beach or a big hotel in the neighbourhood of the airport if you want to stay low-budget as you have to drive to the beach anyway. Miami Miami is big, very big. You will have to drive for more than 40 minutes to get out of the city. I would recommend everybody to take a rental car with a pass for the toll and express roads inclusive. Key West is from Miami not doable in one day, you will have to stay overnight. I turned around half way and spend almost the whole day in the car. Although everone says that Miami is for the rich and famous I was not very impressed by the city. It attracts a lot of wannabees and people who like to show off. It was so now and then a bit tacky (people in bikinis in the shopping area). The shopping area around Lincoln Road is nice in the evenings. The shops, mostly small boutiques, are open till late every evening. I also went to Aventura, which is situated between Miami and F. Lauderdale. This is a big shopping mall with nice brands. If you want to shop for a bargain, the Dolphin Mall is probably better. Here you can find outlet stores from the big brands. Everglades I did the bike tour in Shark Valley and it was really nice. The bike tour will take 2 till 3 hours and bikes can be rented at the visitors center for $ 8,- per hour.

If you read the Travel Advisor reviews, they are spot-on truthful. This is a BUDGET hotel for a Miami-budget price. My 5 stars are for the BUDGET category. $150 (includes expensive daily hotel tax) is a GOOD rate during the boat show/Sobe Food & Wine Festival/Obama visit. It's a $25 taxi ride to and from ($50 total) to get to beautiful South Beach. Their newly decorated breakfast area is lovely. Breakfast is cofee, cereal, toast. No eggs or waffles or yogurt. Coffee is OK and beds are comfortable. I'll add pics when I get home. ****** oh, The shuttle service is NOT free ******** I told them I'll make that clear because several booking sites are advertising a free shuttle for them. They have a $10 (more than 1 person) to $15 (single passenger) shuttle service to airport. The employees at this hotel are VERY NICE. The shuttle driver went way out if his way to rush me to South Beach for a deadline. Then he delivered my bag to the hotel. We will stay there again simply for the nice stafff. The bus stop is across the street (1 minute) and a $2 fee + 50 min bus ride delivers you to a wonderful mall!! Hubby and I spent a full rainy day there. Lovely sushi restaurant upstairs and GREAT shopping. Every store you love is there. If you love espresso....Sur La Table is serving gorgeous complimentary ones (new brand of technology). Back to the hotel......the shower is like a sprinkle. It's completely fine for budget, but you may yell out if someone in another hotel room flushes a toilet and you lose cold water for a few seconds. Also, our room didn't have an electric plug in bathroom. No biggie for me, but I know that some people need their bathroom routine. Ot's an old hotel and you should expect that if you book.

We made sure we were back in the room by 10pm and didn't walk around after dark. The morning we walked to a Starbucks a couple blocks away we saw prostitutes and probably drug deals. The only thing that made us feel like we would be ok here was the volume of other reviews saying they had stayed there and obviously lived to tell the tale. There were also many police cars around. Like others have said, the walls are paper thin, bathrooms tiny and furnishings cheap. The bed was fairly comfortable and the TV was a nice flat screen. I didn't like the fact that I could not control the a/c. Overall I think the owners are trying but they will never be able to overcome the thin walls and tiny bathrooms unless they do some major renovations.

Becuase of our further travel plans we couldn't afford to spend a lot, and so the more central locations of Miami and Miami Beach were outside of our budget. Staying for 4 nights gave us a discount which again brought down the price meaning that our stay (booked direct) came in at just less than $50 a night including breakfast. Having done our research we had requested a quieter room at the back of the hotel which we were accomodated with and we booked a transfer from the hotel as we were not planning to hire a car in the first few days. The room was very nice and clean. The main criticisms would be, there was no phone (and they do advertise all rooms as having a phone and there was very little storage space in the bathroom, no where to put your toilettries and so forth. Also on the first night the shower didn't work, and they really should have checked the facilities when we moved in. TV and internet both worked really well. The room also had an iron and ironing board (very useful for the crumpled traveller!) and a fridge which was kept stocked with water. Breakfast was simple, but good. Bagels and cream cheese and jams, some cereals, coffee and tea making facilities. It was simple, but many US hotels don't include breakfast, and again for what we paid we thought it was good value. There is a diner and a Starbucks within easy walking distance for anyone that wants more. In terms of location, it's not in the 'nicest' part of town, some of the surroundings are a little shabby, but we never felt unsafe and being British did a lot of walking around. If you take the time to walk up the road, there are some great restaurants (including 'Michy's' which seems to be rated as one of the best in Miami, sadly we couldn't afford it! :)). There are also good bus links to the rest of Miami, including Miami Beach and South Beach. The hotel also offers a reasonably priced shuttle service so one night we booked that and it cost a lot less than a taxi. Overall we had a very enjoyable stay, the staff, including owners, were very friendly, the room was comfy and it was excellent value for money. It also gave us the opportunity to see a different side to Miami away from the obvious sights.

I informed the front office and someone was at my room within 10 minutes. In addition, the employees here were very nice to me.

The rooms are tastefully furnished and very clean, the king size bed we chose upon reservation was as comfortable as the ones you find in 5 * hotels.

The staff in the lobby is very kind helpful with whatever you may ask. The only two defects I found in this hotel are: the temperature in the rooms is far too cool ,Europeans like us cannot stand such cold,we're not used to wild air conditioned, and the problem is you don't have an individual control on air conditioned in your room so you just have to bear the freeze.I suggest anyone who's not used to heavy air conditioned to take sweatsuits with them to wear when not in bed (the blankets are soft and warm anyway); The second thing I did not like is the room maids, who are the \"tip me or I'll pretend to forget to tidy up some details here and there as I clean your room\". So be aware if you don't leave some dollars on the table as you leave your room they won't clean up your sink.

The neighborhood is sketchy, but clean. Hard to judge how safe the immediate area is. The noise is a BIG issue! The refurbished motel was probably built before the area became a high traffic street. The street noise penetrates even when it's light, and it's doubtful anything could be done to dampen the noise. The motel provides ear plugs in the rooms, but even that was not enough...and I'm a HEAVY sleeper. If you are unfortunate enough to have \"neighbors\" as I did one night, there will be even more noise, even when they are talking at normal volume levels, worse if they turn on their TV.

He also took us on a complimentary tour in his mini van around South Beach and the surrounding area before dropping us off at the Port for our cruise. He is a lovely person and its obvious that he is dedicated to providing an excellent experience for all guests. Here is an example: he spotted us out walking when he was in his car and when he realised we were walking to the Publix supermarket, insisted on taking us there! It was easy to get a bus back to the motel when we had finished our shopping. We hired a 'day room' at the New Yorker after the cruise as our flight was not until early evening. The rates were excellent and we got a discount as we had already stayed there. It gave us the chance to relax around the pool and use the room until it was time for our shuttle to the airport.

No individual room climate control. Ceiling fan lamp above beds. Told at front desk that if it was too cool in the room, they would lend us a space heater! We kept the outside door open 90% of the time we were in-room (except when we slept) because the room felt like a sauna (high humidity and hot). Bathroom toilets are institutional (no water tank). Functional but look awful. Room lighting was poor. Worst hotel experience in my life. Changed rooms because the promised bar fridge was missing (noticed after carrying our luggage & golf clubs up an exterior stairway to the 1st room). 2nd morning we woke up to the sound of a construction crew on the 2nd floor. Parking was cramped & awkward. We were fortunate to get a room opening onto the pool side rather than busy, noisy Biscayne Boulevard. Continental self-serve breakfast was available in an L-shaped room that felt like a walk-in closet (3 tables/6 chairs). Stayed 2 nights and forfeited the 3rd (refund denied).

The motel is centrally located, only 10 minutes from the airport, and about 15 minutes from South Beach, 25 minutes from the Everglades.

Modern style and comfortable, with a nice pool and new lounge chairs, simple but comfortable furniture, great pillows on the bed. The updates are still in process and everything isn't ship shape yet. We had some plumbing problems in the shower, but they plan to have everything finished by next month. The best thing about the motel is the staff. They recommended places in the neighborhood to go to eat (it's still a pretty funky neighborhood with some seedier elements, but with lots of great little restaurants in walking distance, and a feeling that it's on the way up), told us how to get around the city, what sights we shouldn't miss in Miami, and they drove us into the city, picked us up, and took us back to the airport. They were so welcoming and warm and made us feel at home.
