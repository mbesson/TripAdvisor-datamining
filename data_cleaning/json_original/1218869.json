I was initially concerned about the location, but needn\u2019t have worried as it\u2019s very pleasant 20 minute walk to Grand Via, or just 5 minutes to the nearest metro (Madrid\u2019s metro is clean, efficient and relatively cheap). It\u2019s also very close to the Park Del Retiro. The hotel is in Salamanca neighbourhood, which is a nice upmarket area with lots of high end shops and a decent selection of restaurants. We had absolutely no noise issues (we\u2019d booked a garden room, but were upgraded to a junior suite at check-in which overlooked the (quiet) road outside). The bed was incredibly comfortable and the bathroom was huge. There were no tea/coffee making facilities in the room, but a very quick and efficient room service provided tea and coffee for us each morning (free of charge \u2013 or at least I don\u2019t recall seeing a charge for it on the bill). Our suite had a large bathroom. Twin sinks, large walk-in shower, separate Jacuzzi bathtub and separate toilet/bidet area. Plenty of towels. Good dressing gowns provided. Nice turn-down service with bottles of water. We didn\u2019t have breakfast at the hotel or go to the hotel\u2019s 2 Michelin starred restaurant. We did have drinks in the hotel\u2019s garden on a couple of occasions though.

I also found the rooms to be attractive with high ceilings, hardwood floors and a nice-sized, modern bathroom. My main reason for not giving this hotel an excellent rating is that they advertise their garden rooms as being very quiet. The problem is that the garden doubled as a bar at night with loud music on two of the four nights i was there.

Later they came to deliver the luggage and my wife's bag - a Louis Vitton trolley - was missing. We came to the Reception and quickly they checked on the CCTV system that was robbed by a man inside the lobby. My wife lost all her valuable stuff and find herself with nothing to wear. The girl in the reception was very keen and full of attention to us, saying that it was the first time this ever happened there. We listed all the items in the luggage and she repeated that the Hotel would take care to reimburse all the losses. She passed us a letter confirming so. We went to the police to participate the robbery. The Director only showed up the following day, after our repeated request.

We sent all the documents and invoices to confirm the items we had lost, as requested. We had to hire a lawyer in Madrid to take care of this.
