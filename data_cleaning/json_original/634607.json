{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Good 4-stars hotel ! The Art Ohmori is a good 4-stars hotel. It really deserves its 4-stars, mainly because of the excellent rooms.I've travelled extensively, and, sometimes, an hotel advertised as 4-stars luxury is no more than an old 3-stars, if you know what I mean...Well, the Art Ohmori advertised itself as a 4-stars, and it's definitely a true 4-stars hotel. It's not really a luxury hotel, but, with some improvement, it could really become one of the best hotel in Tokyo !Hotel is situated in the Omori neighborhood.The Omori neighborhood is very good: lots of good restaurants, as well as shops and convenience stores, scattered around the JR station. Omori is a residential area, so it's very interesting to see how the Japanese people live on a day to day basis. You will never understand the Japanese way of life if you stay in Shinjuku, where most tourists hotels are situated.Hotel's staff friendly and helpful.Overall cleanliness absolutely top-notch ! One of the cleanest hotels i've stayed at !The rooms are really big for Tokyo: you have a sitting area that can be used by at least 3 persons, and there is the bed area, which can be used by other persons... Tokyo is famous for small hotel rooms, but believe me, the Art Ohmori rooms are really big !All rooms have a big bathroom, which, again, for Tokyo, is absolutely amazing !All rooms have big FLAT TV screen (mine was 37, but i saw some 32 in other rooms).As I said, hotel staff is good, cleanliness is good, room is good... But, Art Ohmori could improve on the services and breakfast sides !Services: no shops in the hotel, not even a small corner with water or postcards to buy... no bar, they just use a part of the restaurant if you want to drink something, but choice is very limited... So the hotel is very basic: it's: reception-room-restaurant on ground floor, nothing more...Breakfast: the hotel caters at 99% for Asian customers, so, if you are European, be prepared for a limited breakfast: it will be bad coffee-bad bread-bad croissant...All in all, the Art Ohmori is a good hotel, and i will happily stay again at this property, considered i've paid a good price (600 euros for 5 nights, new year time when all hotels in Tokyo are sold out!).", "Date": "Jan 12, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR616151488", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Tiquinho"}, {"Content": "Great hotel I have never been to Japan before but have stayed at alot of hotels around the globe. This trip was business and pleasure. I travelled with my wife, business collegue and his wife.Art Ohmori is located in the northern part of Tokyo and is only a few stations away from central Tokyo. My first obvious thought about Tokyo is that it is expencive. Boy, was I wrong!!! Staying at Art Ohmori cost about 110 EUR/night, double room with breakfast.Talking english with the personell was a challenge, but it was a nice room, clean and of normal size.", "Date": "Dec 6, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR841167740", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Nydet"}, {"Content": "\u9351\u54c4\u5ac9\u9287\ue0a0\u4f05\u6e1a\u57ae\u57c4\u9289\u6c47\u5153\u9289?#x201d;   showReview(22855803, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR682534387", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u9287\u693c\u4efe\u9287\u5c7b\u5027\u59d8\u5b58\u68cc\u6901\u3123\u4f04\u6769\u6219\u4eb8   showReview(20492408, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR677116695", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "mikikimi"}, {"Content": "\u9287\ue042\u4eb1\u9287\ue042\u4eb1   showReview(19689396, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR115056946", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "\u9287\u5a3f\u5116\u9289\uff43\u5142\u701b\u6129\u5057\u9289\u253f\u5122"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066854-d634607-r12549706-Art_Ohmori-Shinagawa_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "634607", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
