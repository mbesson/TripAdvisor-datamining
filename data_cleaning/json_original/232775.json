It is a very nice hotel with small but comfortable rooms. It is quite far from the city centre. We used the Metro which was great but do not use the L7 line (El Puxtet station) as they are doing construction and it takes much longer to get to the city. We found the L3 (Lesseps Station) which is about a 10 min walk from the hotel but the service is much more frequent and you do not have to change trains. Get a 10 use metro card for 10 euro. It is much cheaper than paying each time. The TV is all in Spanish but we were able to change it to English on the remote using the subtitle button. It changes the voices to the original English but only on American shows. The bathroom was very small and we found that the hot water in the shower would go very cold during high usage times. There is a safe in the room to lock up valuables but you must leave a 20 Euro deposit at reception. We tried the breakfast once and it is not worth the price at all, not enough selection and it had been sitting for a long time.

A bit difficult to find so please see directions at the end of this review. We enjoyed our stay but feel it worth being frank. This hotel is a bit dated, average, but very clean. Think of UK Travel Lodge and you will be close. Staff are all lovely and speak pretty good english, very polite and helpful. The room on 4th floor was smaller than we expected, with en suite also challenged for space. The shower had a knack of changing temperature half way through and make sure you have shower gel as those left for you in the bathroom are only about 5ml samples. Bed and towels changed and room cleaned daily to a high standard. The bed was not comfortable but that might just be us. Sound proofing would be great as you can hear most things late at night from other rooms and flats opposite. This only disturbed us on one night so its probably not a big problem. Breakfast, if you book it at reception will set you back 10 euros each plus tax. Good buffet and pleasant surroundings just off reception. The hot food choice of scrambled eggs, bacon, spicy sausage soon cooled when on the plate. The rest of the buffet was very good. If you prefer there are other places local for breakfast. DIRECTIONS to hotel from airport. Journey time from airport to hotel is approx 1 hour. Please note, there are different train companies and the train ticket you buy at the airport station will not be valid on the metro. You can easily get multi company tickets when you get into the city and onto the metro, its not hard at all, just confusing at first. Use the machines at metro stations to get tickets that last 10 or more journeys and all the train companies, very easy. Assuming you arrive at Barcelona International airport, take the train into Barcelona city and get out at 4th stop which is Passieg de Gracia station. Get onto the metro for the L3 line (light green signs). You will have to go one stop to Catalunya station to change onto the L7 line (brown signs) for the hotel going in direction of Av.Tibidabo. Its just 5 stops to El Putxet (pronounced Putchet). Come up onto the street and go down hill about 50 yards. Take first left up a short slope and then turn right. The hotel is about 100 yards down the road on the right.", "Date": "November 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Burlington, Ont.", "Title": "\u201cGreat place !\u201d", "Author": "Micki L", "ReviewID": "UR118931782", "Content": "I just returned from spending 8 days in Barcelona at this neat hotel !

( the rooms are cleaned daily). I can't say enough about the wonderful front desk staff ! They are very friendly, accommodating, helpful and informative . They spent a lot of time helping guests plan their day, best routes to take, etc. I didn't think too highly of the buffet offered for 10 Euros in the dining room, but everyone else seemed to enjoy it. It was nice to be able to use the computer for free in the reception area, or just relax there with a book , if you didn't want to return to your room just yet. I was travelling by myself, so made sure I was back in the area near the hotel before dark. Always felt safe when I was. Did a couple of city bus tours, which I enjoyed . After that, I travelled around the city by Metro ( with the help of the ever-friendly front desk staff at the hotel) . If you have trouble negotiating stairs, watch out. There are endless stairs at the Metro stations, and not all stations have escalators or elevators. But, loved this hotel and would have no hesitation recommending it to others.

Before I arrived, I was in a long sweet correspondence with the front desk staff, because my credit card didn't work out for the pre-paid reservation, and they were helping me out to make a bank transfer. When I came, they turned out to be just as friendly in person, and my check-in was smooth and fast, and with a nice upgrade as well, which made me happy right from the first day there. I had an apartment on the top floor, with no windows except for a small one in the roof. The bed was great; although the pillows a bit too small. I also had a living room with a sofa, a TV with a decent number of channels (the TV picture froze sometimes, but you just have to turn it off and on again; and anyway I didn't come to Barcelona to watch TV). The kitchen was fine; I didn't have the utensils, but I guess they can be given upon request; I just didn't need it really, because I only made some tea in the evenings and nothing more. The bathroom was small, but very clean, with fresh towels every day and all the regular shampoo/soap stuff. The whole apartment was very clean as well; maybe a tiny bit weary, and very simple and basic, but still in a perfect condition, with no dust or mold anywhere. I didn't use the breakfast there; but I did use the computer in the lobby, which was available free of charge - a nice touch! The lobby itself was also sparkling clean and pleasant to stay in, with some nice music playing. The subway trip to the city center is not very bothering; it takes no more than 10 minutes and the trains are half empty. It's probably not for those people who want to go out of the hotel and find themselves in the middle of La Rambla, but it was my 3rd time in Barcelona and I decided to go for a quiet place rather then the overcrowded center. In the late evenings I was a bit nervous returning by subway, as I was a single female traveling, but it seems that there are always some people coming off at the Putxet station, so I wasn't completely alone. On the morning of my departure, I had a taxi at about 4 am, and of course I was late for it, but when I flew down the stairs the very nice gentlemen at the reception was already holding out my invoice, so I literally didn't even have to stop to check-out, and I was immensely grateful for this care. To sum up: it's a friendly, clean, inexpensive, if somewhat basic, little place, perfect to explore Barcelona when you are not eager to be in the center of touristic life. Don't expect luxuries, and you will get a very decent room, good sleep and a warm welcome.

The hotel was clean and well kept throughout and all the staff were friendly and polite. The room was on the front of the hotel so didn't have a view but was spacious and fairly modern and was promptly cleaned and provided with fresh towels and linen on a daily basis. The overpriced mini bar wasn't working in our room but was quickly repaired when we mentioned this to the receptionist, so came in handy for storing our own drinks in! (There is a small shop on the same street as the hotel and a small supermarket just past the El Putxet station so no need to use the mini bar). The room also came with a safe which you could request the key for at reception in return for a 20 euro deposit.

The red stop is around 10-15 min walk from the hotel up at the top of the hill by the roundabout. A day pass was E20 and a 2 day pass was E26. Had breakfast there one morning - E10 each and it was OK. Filled the gap! We had a safe in our room which we put a E20 deposit down on and got it back when we checked out. Our room was cleaned everyday. There was no noise from the surrounding area at night as its a quiet area. Walls were perhaps a bit thin between the rooms and the corridor but not excessively so. Bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was lovely. The room also came with air conditioning at no extra cost. To get home after a night out we took taxis and they cost between 12 and 14 euros which is great! We generally ate in the city centre as we didnt find many places to eat in the area but since it was so close that didnt matter! Plus we found there was more of an atmosphere in the city. A few must sees in Barcelona in general: Sagrada Familia (even though we didnt bother going into it), La Ramblas, the cable car to Barceloneta Beach, Portaventura (not technically in Barcelona but only an hours train journey away-make sure you get the priority passes when going in!!trust me-they're worth it!!), The Hard Rock Cafe, The Sunset Dance Club, Nou Camp, Park Guell, The Magic Fountain, Park de la Ciutadella. Overall I would definitly recommend the mitre hotel to anyone!", "Date": "September 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Military Wife", "Title": "\u201cBasic quite hotel\u201d", "Author": "lajoa", "ReviewID": "UR19551405", "Content": "Didn't book this hotel. Was sent to Eurostars Mitre from another hotel (Gran Ducat) that overbooked and made a deal to send us here instead. I was upset that I paid city center price to then be sent to Mitre as it is about 4 train (metro) stops from city center and for the same price we get this secluded hotel. Pros: Hotel was in a quite residential area, strong air conditioner, very helpful front-desk staff, matrimonial bed is actually a real double-bed instead of 2 twins pushed together, very clean room, good quality towels. Cons: Cable worked once my husband spent a few minutes messing with the back of the TV, very small bathroom, tiny elevator, away from city center, no real restaurants or shops around there, not near the tour bus route. I really cannot fault the hotel even with the cons I listed above. Maybe I'm just more upset because I know had I booked Mitre directly it would have been cheaper than falling for the overbooking scam Gran Ducat had going on. If you do not mind staying a bit away from city center and want a quite place away from the chaos then this hotel is the place to stay. The metro stop Puxtet was just a few short steps from the hotel so not much of a hassle and train goes directly without transfer to city center. Again, many thanks to the front desk staff for being so helpful, taking lots of time to explain the metro and recommending sightseeing options. Because the hotel is nowhere near other eating places we paid the 10 Euros per person for the breakfast and it was worth it. - Joana New Yorker living in Germany", "Date": "August 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Colchester, England", "Title": "\u201cA good, clean and quiet hotel\u201d", "Author": "hill_dawn", "ReviewID": "UR17974382", "Content": "This is a good, clean, quiet hotel for those travellers who would rather spend their cash on seeing Barcelona rather than on an overpriced hotel slap bang in the city centre.

The tubes were very impressive, frequent, quick and clean. Location wise we always felt safe and the supermarket over the road from the hotel is handy. Although we didn't deal with them much more than the usual check in & out the receptionists were friendly, helpful and spoke good English. The room is clean and a reasonable size, as is the bathroom and the jacuzzi bath was very welcome at the end of a busy day exploring.

Photograph does not do the hotel justice, as outside of building is bland. Room was comfortable and very clean. If you can, ask for a room with a terrace on the top floor - the terrace was big and had a romantic view over rooftops to Tibidabo Mountain - there's a church or something on the summit which is illuminated at night. The terrace rooms are non-smoking, but you can smoke on the terrace if you want. Bathrooms had a jacuzzi-bath which added a touch of luxury. The area is perfect if you already know Barcelona and want to stay in a part of the city less frequented by tourists. It is quite high up, so feels fresher in summer, but has all the bars/cafes/restaurants/markets you could wish for. Metro will take you to centre in 10 minutes, and there are loads of buses going everywhere. We only made it to breakfast once, but it was pretty good if you're hungry - a huge help-yourself affair. Staff were polite and helpful, though not particularly chatty (we were there for 2 weeks and never really struck up a conversation with anyone).

There are few small shops nearby and also some cafes& restaurants. It is very much an area with local people (all seemed to be friendly) and i definatly felt safe here. The hotel is only a 2 minute walk from a metro station El Putxet which will take you on a direct line into the centre which only takes about 8-10mins. They come every 10mins also and the last metro from place catalunya back to the hotel is about 11.30pm. TIP: if you have travelers cheques the hotel or surrounding areas do not exchange them, we wasted about an hour going into what we now know were only savers banks nearby trying to get them changed . In the end we ended up having to go place catalunya to get them changed but later on that day we noticed a Barclays bank about 10mins walk away from the hotel so you could prob get them changed there. Also there is a bus stop at the top of the road 10-15min walk, we only found this out the day before we left, so if you need buses they are there and also there is the RED bus stop there this is for if you get the tourist bus that takes you to sights which you can hop on and off about (18euro a day) you can get off at the top them walk down to the hotel saves having to get off at place catalunya and paying the 1 euro.20 from place catalunya to El Putxet. Also i had no problems with pickpockets, i was very worried about this before i went but i think its just about being sensible, have a zip on your bags, keep it in front of you and dont open you bag/purse in a pubic place where lots of people can see ( weeven but ribbon through the zip and then around the bag stap so there was no way a pick pocket could just unzip it without having to undo the ribbon 1st) All in all very impressed and i would definatly stay here again!!!", "Date": "May 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester", "Title": "\u201cFab Hotel, Recommended!\u201d", "Author": "lee99Mcr", "ReviewID": "UR4984991", "Content": "We have just returned from a short break and found Hotel Mitre to be excellent.
