The room smelled damp and musty, with an aura of old tobacco smoke. This is a smoke-free hotel. The tiles just inside the door and in the bathroom were grimy. The furniture was of cheap quality and chipped. The smoke detector was yellowed and appeared separated from its housing on the ceiling. The worst part of our stay occurred from 3:30 until 4:30 am. We were awakened by shouts, loud knocking and banging doors. Other guests had returned to their rooms and seemed oblivious to the time or the fact that the hotel had a 'quiet policy' after 9:00 pm. We will not stay here again, nor will we recommend it to anyone.

(I was told it was the only room available, and we needed a room in that area.) The kitchenette was clearly unsanitary: dust, grime and food crumbs covered surfaces on the shelves--food particles were stuck to some plates and glasses. You felt sticky grease on the stovetop, countertops and all cupboard handles. I took a picture of the large bag of what appeared to be food/spices that was left in one of the kitchen cupboards. Disheartened, I filled the sink with soapy water to try to clean dishes and surfaces--but realized I didn't pay for a hotel room so that I could come in and clean a disgusting mess I did not make. We paid for cleanliness, and Days Inn did not deliver. The draining board was literally covered in grime and what looked like food bits. Furthermore, no dishcloth was provided. When I requested a dishcloth, I received a facecloth from the bathroom. When I showed the housekeeper the draining board she laughed. I then proceeded to show the man at the front desk. He said he was the manager, and he didn't seem to care. He stood there making excuses. Fortunately, a maintenance person, Vern, happened to pass by, took one look at the draining board and said, \"That is disgusting.\" Later, Vern knocked on our room door, handed us the draining board he had personally cleaned himself, and asked if he could inspect the kitchen. When he had a good look at it, he agreed that the kitchen was badly neglected and unsanitary. He said it was inexcusable and unacceptable. I tried writing a complaint on an online form Days Inn says it provides for its customers; but, when I tried to submit it it kept stating that the site was \"being serviced\", so could not submit the form. No where is there an address to reach anyone in real authority. I feel Days Inn is giving us false promises of cleanliness and, from our experience, lacks respect for its customers. We were charged for a kitchen we could not use due to its unsanitary condition.

The bus stop is located about 50 meters from the hotel and it is an easy hop-on and hop-off from there to the city's center. Tram service is round the clock, although frequency is much less after 8 pm. But, safety is definitely not an issue as this seemed to be a very good neighborhood. Plenty of restaurants and fast food chains within walkable distance from here. As far as the facility itself is concerned, it is alright, but not the best of the Days Inn facilities I've stayed in. The room was quite small, but clean. If you get a room facing the street, you may hear the noise of street cars through the night, but it is not terrible.

He spent 10 minutes ignoring us while we tried to check in. Our room was on the second floor and it smelled like something DIED up there. Our room itself smelled like stale cigarettes, which was gross considering it was a smoke-free hotel. The room wasn't very clean, it was dusty and I found cobwebs. The curtains were broken and wouldn't fully close (our room overlooked the main street). When one of us tried the blow-dryer it sparked. It was very noisy, people on our floor were slamming doors constantly and running around the hall. People were banging on the wall, and the front desk staff accused us of being noisy when we complained. We were called down because they had a problem processing the credit card and the front desk staff was EXTREMELY RUDE. He blamed us and said to go to the bank or we would have to leave. Nothing was open since it was New Years eve, which should have been obvious to him but he proceeded repeat the policy. The \"free wireless internet\" is a joke because it requires you to create an account on some website and give all of your personal information to them (so they can sell it to everyone and anyone who will then spam you to death). Even after all of this, we were still determined to have a good time and went out for a few hours to celebrate New Years eve down at Liberty Grand. However, when we returned and expected to go up to our room with two visitors, the manager and the front desk staff had locked the front doors and stood there with a clipboard to check that only people who had registered entered the hotel. This might seem like a good idea if we were at summer camp... or a retirement home... or even somewhere exclusive. But I've never before paid $170 for a hotel room and not been allowed to have a guest to my room. We offered the staff $50 to make an exception but they refused and just kept repeating their \"policy\" over and over again like robots. When we questioned their policy, rather than answer us they just said that its their policy (in other words, they were RUDE, UNPROFESSIONAL and UNCOOPERATIVE). They suggested we pay for another room at $160 and send the two visitors there, which is ridiculous. We asked to be reimbursed because after being offended and disrespected we wanted to take a cab home, but they refused that as well because \"it is policy.\" They deactivated our room keys so that we couldn't get back in and then the robotic manager \"Geoff\" said he'd let two of us go get all of our stuff from the room but he disappeared for 20 minutes before he did. In the end, we left without getting a refund. We took a cab all the way back to Thornhill (45 minutes away) at 4am and had to go get our car from the parking lot the next day (today). I have never been more disgusted and upset by a hotel. I want everyone to be warned about this place, it was absolutely AWFUL. Their \"POLICY\" is to offend their paying customers.

For something that I pay $119 a night or more I actually do expect more than an average motel quality. The hotel seems to be very short staffed, usually there is one guy at the front desk who answers your questions, takes care of all the check ins and check outs, refreshes the breakfast (which is nice to be included in the price but nothing to rave about) etc. The two different people I dealt with during my stay were very helpful and extremely friendly. But unfortunately this couldn't mask the fact the hotel needs a major renovation. As people mentioned before, it kind of smells stuffy, the hallway is very narrow. Everything is old and dated. Upon closer inspection it is clean, but the first impression is it is not because of the wear and tear. Our bedsheets and the cover sheet had several old stains on. Even though I could tell they were freshly laundered (the sheets for sure, the cover I am not so sure), a serious hotel would have just discarded those and brought in new ones. Our room was not facing the car wash so I don't know how that affects the rooms or not. But I can tell for sure the off track horse betting place across the street which was mentioned here before is in no way threatening or making people feel uncomfortable. If a few old men standing on the street smoking a cigarette across the street disturb you, then it might. A little bit west of the hotel it might get a bit edgy for some people, but the hotel is at the west end of one of the most desirable neighborhoods Torontos, so just keep walking east or south (that is where the beach is) and you will be very happy with the location. If they would change their pricing to something below $100, I would definitely come back. As it is, I think it is overpriced for what it offers. The only reason they can take so much money is the fact if you need a hotel and want to be in the area, this one is your only option, unless you are into the cozier, but even more expensive local B&Bs.

The rooms have high ceilings with very small windows and no ventilation. Even the ventilation in the bathroom was completely in effective. I asked to be moved to another room but all the rooms had a very musty, moldy odor like and old, wet canvas bag. This odor permeated all the fabrics in the room. I asked to cancel my reservation but they insist on 24-hour notice, naturally since I imagine a high percentage of guests wish to cancel upon arrival. After spending one night at the hotel I noticed a huge red stain on the mattress and I could not take it anymore. I left for another hotel, which easily met my requirements, but was forced to pay for another night at the Days Inn Toronto Beaches, despite my requesting to cancel at 8:30 AM of that day and despite the obvious and objective problems with the hotel. You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect much from people who would run a hotel in this manner, anyone who writes a positive review for this hotel must simply not be accustomed to cleanliness and courteous service.

Yeah- it's a typical Days Inn: consistent, clean, secure. It's in the 'Beaches' district on Queen st. East. Nice neighborhood, free parking in a secured lot, and all kinds of local stores- wine/beer/liquor, coffe shops, deli's, and a few really good restaraunts less than a block away, a really cool location. Killer selection of local restaraunts, Thai, Indian, Japanese, Deli's, Italian, you name it. Toward the beach- about 5 blocks up, lots of cool shops that way too. Great Indian food at Ali's at 2306 Queen st. E- fantastic entrees and great service. My own and my lady friend's favorite Indian restaraunt on the planet so far. So back to Anthony: Considerate, gracious, goes all out for the customer. Great sense of humor, a real lovable character! I'll definitely stay there again, My gal and i had a great time.

The staff were absolutely by far the most helpful and courteous we came across during our stay in Canada & New York. The room was clean and had everything we required. Commute into Toronto was easy by tram which was available right in front of hotel. There were lovely little restaurants within close walking distance(try the Indian restaurant next door, GREAT FOOD) and a great Irish pub about 2 doors down. Cinema's across the road and a quick stroll to the lake foreshore which was also very beautiful. It was safe, quiet and above all the treatment we received as visitors from another country was fabulous. The complimentary breakfast was also a bonus. There was only one downside and that was if your room was on level 1 there was no lift so you had to carry your bags up 1 flight of steps. The price was great and even though not in the heart of Toronto ,was such an easy 10min ride by tram it was not difficult to get there. Trams ran every 5-10 mins and also were very safe. I travelled into Toronto a couple of time alone and being female was not he least bit scared of doing this. Would recommend this hotel to anyone thinkig of going to Toronto.

The bathroom was spotless, the beds comfortable and the bagels and croissants at breakfast were fresh. They provided decent coffee and quality jams. My grand-daughter tells me that the fruit loops were good too! Based on what we had read we chose an upstairs room and had no mouldy smell. Our room was non-smoking but initially there was a smell of cigarettes, possibly wafting in from the hallway. On Saturday there was some noise from other guests celebrating that Maple Leafs had won their hockey game, other than that, our room was close to the back, facing a quiet side street allowing us to sleep well.
