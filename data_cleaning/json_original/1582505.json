We just come back from 5 days in that hostel and will never never never go back again. The \"manager\" is a bad man, to him you are nothing as soon as you have paid. He injured his employees and guests in front of us so much I would not do that to a a dog. He is a lier and some employees say to guests \"If you are not happy I call the manager and you will see what happens to you !\". Other employees are more gentle but seem very afraid of their manager who is a very bad man. If you read Victor Hugo's book \"Les Mis\u00c3\u00a9rables\", just think of \"Mr T\u00c3\u00a9nardier\" and you will have a good idea of what you will get : if you are lucky you will be only cold and hungry, but most of the time you will also be humiliated, feeling robbed and prisonner of a kind of mafia... We made many travels in our life in the past, but we have never seen such a bad reception, I have never felt so afraid of what could hapen to us with such bad people. I don't go into details because there are many one here from other guests, everything is real. In fact, each line of the description given when you book this hotel is a lie, except the good place of the hostel in the center of the city. It is definitely the worst hostel I have ever seen, it is a pity because Venice city is so nice.", "Date": "April 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rome", "Title": "\u201cDo not stay here!\u201d", "Author": "OskyR", "ReviewID": "UR122409955", "Content": "My fianc\u00c3\u00a9 and I just left ca contarini, and we were pretty disgusted with the quality of service here. First off, the price is extremely high for a hostel, and then when you get there, they tack on additional fees out of nowhere, and weren't able to explain it when I asked about it. It was probably some type of local tax, but you've really got to tell people about that when they book. Next, the room was filthy. It hadn't been cleaned in months, and had a film of dirt and grime on the floor. The blanket that was on the bed was paper thin, and also looked filthy. Luckily, the sheets were freshly washed and pressed, so we were able to sleep there. We stayed in winter here, and the outside temperatures were near or below freezing. We had two cold nights where we had to put on additional clothes because the in room radiator turned on and off at apparently random times. Now for the bed and breakfast that they advertise. This is a hostel, and a very poor one. It should not be qualified as a bed and breakfast. The pre packaged toast, croissant, and crackers that forms the breakfast are combined worth maybe 50 cents. They do provide coffee, and have an espresso machine, but it's missing the portafilter, so don't expect to use it. They also have an electric kettle, which is also broken. You can only use the kitchen for an hour and a half in the morning from 7:30-9:00 (when breakfast is served), and again from 12-2 in the afternoon. This means you're eating out for dinner. Also, the dishes were filthy. This is probably the fault of other guests, but I ended up re washing everything, and was pissed off while doing it. Contrary to their advertisement, there is no bar. Don't get your hopes up. We shared a single bathroom with six other guests, and it was pretty clean, but constantly occupied. The wifi is not usable. We could load a page about every ten minutes. Meanwhile, the guy working here is downstairs watching movies online and using up all of the bandwidth. If you use the wifi in the day, you will be able to check email, etc. but don't expect any images to load. It's too slow. The final nail in the coffin for us was that they didn't provide curtains, and shrugged at me when I asked. There was a light directly out of our window that shined 24/7 that was quite bright. It kept us from sleeping properly, and we couldn't hang anything on the window because that would mean opening them put a towel or something on them. This would let the freezing air in all night (you have to see the windows for this to make sense). I've stayed in probably about a hundred hostels around the world since I was a little boy. I'm used to the usual hostel feel, and am not new to it. I was primarily shocked by their lack of cleanliness, and also their complete misrepresentation online. The pictures they have of their rooms did not look anything like ours. They are not a bed and breakfast. They do not have a bar. They are not building a club. The attendant sat outside our door and smoked all day one day. It was not friendly, and lacked the basic honesty that I appreciate from most hostels. In retrospect we wish we would have stayed in lido. If you care about shopping in San Marco, then this is in a good location.", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bratislava, Slovakia", "Title": "\u201cIt was OK, but...\u201d", "Author": "Katie T", "ReviewID": "UR119962303", "Content": "We went to this bed and breakfast in the end of the october. Wheather in Venice was not that bad this time. We read many reviews, and everywhere they said, that it is difficult to find that place (any hotel). It is because that\u00c2\u00b4s Venice, there everything very difficult to find even with map! BUT with this one it was even more difficult, because there was no a big sign of the place (see pictures), the little sing (3x5cm) on the front doors made us sure, that is it. (We had to ask maaany locals, where it might be, and even they were not that sure) Right, when we found the right place, there was a very nice and polite guy on the little (reception) desk. Little surprising, when we have been asked to pay an extra charge per person per night as any new law stuff or what - did not really get it, but we payed extra 12 euros (3euros per person/night). Nevermind, we just did not see anything on the website. We got a room on the 4th floor, where we had to always make a little break on the 3rd, because that stairs were killing us (still do not understand, how we got up first day with our luggages lol) There is a kitchen on the 3rd floor, open certain time a day for a tea and coffee. We saw some guys cooking in it, so probably it is allowed to. We got quite spacious room, and shared only a bathroom with the other guys from the second room. But in the room was SO unbelievably cold, that first night we slept with our scarf and a hut on. We were lucky, and got an idea to ask for an aircondition remote -not like the other guys, because we woke up as someone in the other room said \u00c2\u00b4oh my god, it is so cold\u00c2\u00b4. It took us half a day to heat the room up. Then it was ok. /You dont ask, you dont get - as always and everywhere/. (There was no heater in the bathroom.... brrr) There was actually no \u00c2\u00b4internet\u00c2\u00b4, but there was only a wifi - so if you do not have any phone or a laptop, you can forget about it. Ouh, and for wifi we had to go on the 3rd floor, cause on the 4th the connection was not perfect at all. Breakfast. Again - I have to say, that management was really nice, and were preparing a breakfast on the plate. I have to have a little complain though. Everything was prepacked, no fresh butter or bread. We really missed. Now, I understand, why everyone was complaining, that it was too sweet. IT ACTUALLY WAS. And another day the same story...... We are glad, we were in a very good location, and always VERY nice staff what is a huge bonus. But probably will never go to Venice any more.

It took us an hour to find the hostel from the Rialto bridge, as the directions are useless unless you get dropped off at San Samuel. When we did arrive, the room was nice and spacious, we had a private double just off the staircase. The floors were not the cleanest, so I would advise flipflops! The location here is really good, you are about a 5 minute walk from the Accedemia bridge and about 15 minutes away from Saint Marks Square. However, a few complaints - the breakfast was horrible, I understand that B and B's have to provide pre-packaged food for breakfast but it was still not nice at all. We shared a bathroom between two other rooms and it stunk of urine for the whole of the last day we were there - even after it had been cleaned. The shower was really small and it was very dark in there. We also had a light in our room that would not stop flickering slightly as we were trying to sleep - nothing major, but just annoying.
