The hotel is basic so don't expect much however it provided us with all that we needed for our brief stay. The rate for $140/n was a bit steep for what it was, but then again all hotels in San Juan are expensive on the weekends as thousands of other cruisers have the same idea and demand is high. The hotel has two main assets... 1. LOCATION Location location! To maximise time we wanted to stay in the heart of Old San Juan and the location can't be beaten for convenience. The hotel is situated on one of the most picturesque streets in the old town, well, they're all pretty picturesque but it's a beautiful street nevertheless. All the major sights of the old town are within easy walking distance and the Pan American Pier is only a 10min taxi ride away. 2. The staff are this hotel's other main asset. They were fantastic, very friendly and made us feel really welcome. They gave us some info on where to go in the old town, held our bags for a few hours after we checked out, just very friendly and helpful guys, service with a smile :) As for the building itself, it is quite old and when walking down the hallway it looked a bit like we were heading to a jail cell! But then once we opened the door to our room gave a sigh of relief to see that the room was actually nice and clean. It was a Junior Suite so a little on the small side as to be expected and had a window but the view was of nothing interesting, just a wall of a building. Our one main complaint would be that the walls are paper thin. If the next room is occupied and they are having a conversation, you can hear every single word, it sounds like they're actually in your room. If they even breathe you will hear it! So it doesn't feel very private when you can hear each other sooo well. And if they have their TV on whilst you want to go to sleep like our neighbours did....good luck getting to sleep. If you are starting or ending a cruise in San Juan then the old town is not to be missed, it is gorgeous! We were worried we wouldn't see all there is to see in one night and the majority of one day, but yes the old town is very small and it was more than enough time to appreciate it and see all the main sights. If staying for longer you would want to venture out. The hotel was adequate for just one night, super convenient and did the job. But if staying in San Juan for longer I agree with the previous reviewer and I'd also suggest staying elsewhere, unless you are a heavy sleeper and do not intend to spend much time in your room.", "Date": "February 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bancroft, On", "Title": "\u201cClean, safe and an excellent location\u201d", "Author": "Joan F", "ReviewID": "UR124862783", "Content": "We stayed at S.J.

I researched and researched hotels, and SJ Suites kept coming up. To be clear, this is not a 5-star hotel. Do not expect Ritz quality. This is a nice and quaint boutique hotel located smack in the heart of downtown Old San Juan. My wife and I went in with having an open mind and to not expect much, because after all you are on vacation and no need to stress over the small stuff. So with those remarks, I will go into detail about the hotel. When we landed at the SJU airport, we proceeded to walk outside to catch a cab. Cab fares are regulated in Puerto Rico and if I recall, it was about $22 total to get to Old San Juan from SJU for my wife and I and our 3 bags (they charge $1-$2 per bag per the regulation requirements on fares). The cab dropped us off in downtown Old San Juan, and there was SJU Suites. SJ Suites was hard to find and see at first, but it is there. If you can't find it, just ask around. The owner buzzed us in the front door and we proceeded up the elevator to the second floor. Yes, it has an elevator people. The owner checked us in (I forget his name) but he was very very nice. I asked him about things to do around town and he spoke with us for about 20 minutes asking what we wanted to do. Mainly we wanted to taste the food and explore the night life. We dropped our bags off in our room before we headed to lunch. Our room had a King bed, 2 night stands, a big closet, a chest of drawers, and a bathroom. It had everything we needed for the 1 night we were staying there before our cruise. Again, it was not Ritz quality, but there was nothing wrong with the room. Yes, there may have been some paint cracking on the walls and the bed spread was from the 90's, but I wasn't there for that. I needed a nice place to sleep that was safe and affordable. I am not going to criticize a hotel for paint cracking or an old bed spread, who cares? I do remember the Air Conditioning being very very cold. We had it on 78 and it was still freezing. I like the cold so I was fine, but the wife just got an extra blanket from the front desk and all was fine. It is better to have an AC that works than one that doesn't right? After we checked in, we went to lunch at Raices. There special drink was a mojito type drink in a tin can, and I suggest getting it. It is the best, I also suggest the plantains food. Raices was the best food I have tasted in a long long time. YOU MUST GO AND EAT HERE, IT IS AMAZING. Back to the hotel, we had a great time and slept great. We checked out and there were no issues at all with our stay. If we go back to Old San Juan, we will be staying here again for sure. If you are going to criticize a hotel for stupid things, than go stay down the street at the Sheraton or Ritz for $400+ a night. I on the other hand will stay at the SJ Suites hotel in my nice and cozy COLD room and save my $300+ difference a night to spend at Raices. :)", "Date": "January 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cPay a little more and stay elsewhere\u201d", "Author": "Brienna_michele", "ReviewID": "UR123838274", "Content": "We booked this hotel online, sight unseen except for online photos and upon the good reviews on Trip Advisor for cleanliness and safety.

I will tell you that we SO appreciated the willingness of the hotel to store our baggage ( we had quite a bit) until check in time. The hotel also did the same after check out, and called a cab for us to the airport. To be able to know your luggage can be stored in a secure location for free.... that is a great accomodation. Ramone also told us to go to the Barachinna ( sp?) 3 blocks down the street. It is the birthplace of the Pina Colada. You HAVE to go and try one.... even though my husband does not like coconut, he LOVED this one!!! It truly was the best I have ever tasted... all on Ramone's reccommendation.

Instead, have the front desk call you a cab. We checked in and set out on foot to the left and above the hotel (not sure of the NSEW part). We toured looked at the outside of the Cristobal fort and the capitol bldg and looked at the ocean and scouted out where we'd have dinner (we decided on El Jibato - 280 Calle Sol - enjoyed our food) . The staff at SJ Suites is wonderful! The three men we interacted with were super helpful, friendly and welcoming.

I could go on and on about the area as we were not lacking for anything we would/could want. Now the few bad things about the room. 1) it was colder than we'd prefer - this was easily fixed by an adjustment the gentleman at the front door did (he also gave us extra blankets when I asked). 2) the rooms are a little darker and mostly lit by lamps - it's an older building and that happens sometimes. 3) the walls are thinner and I could hear my neighbors talking - problem solved with earplugs I made sure to bring. 4) Room/bed/shower/common areas were all clean BUT the room did have a musky smell - problem altered by a spray or two of body spray.

While we were there they had a problem with the water in Old San Juan, one morning we only had a trickle, and then we had a request to minimize our use of water. One last picky thing - during our entire stay there was a piece of gum stuck to a statue in the hall.

Between the two couples we stayed in rooms 301, 401 & 501, which are all on the street side. The first night (Saturday) was extremely noisy. People yelling, singing, fighting, cars honking, screeching, police sirens, car alarms, etc. all until about 4:30 a.m. Very noisy. I finally fell asleep around 4:30, but that's also when I remembered that I had earplugs, which helped. The Sunday that we stayed there was slightly less noisy, but still heard all of the above, except the fighting. Again I didn't get much sleep...would start to doze when a car alarm or something else would go off. I had a look at the rear rooms (which were about $300/night). They are exactly like the front rooms, except more floor space. The one I saw had no view, but I'm sure would have been quieter. I thought the beds were just ok...nothing special. If you ask the front desk to adjust the air conditioning, they will. The service and friendliness of the hotel was exceptional. The location also was absolutely perfect. We could walk anywhere in Old San Juan without any problems. We took our luggage down to the pier from the hotel on the first day of our cruise (downhill), which was fine, but hired a taxi ($12) from the cruise ship back up a week later. I don't think I would stay here again (having already toured the area once), but would recommend it for someone that could pay to have a back room. I think it's very expensive for what you get, but in comparison to all of the other hotels it's probably pretty average.

The rooms are extremely clean and the bed was comfortable. We were lucky enough to have room 501 with a street view. We never tried the breakfast so cannot comment on that. There are many restaurants and bars nearby. You can walk to the piers and the forts in 10 minutes or less. The only bad thing about this property is there is no on site parking so you have to get lucky if you decide to drive (which you should not do if you can avoid it). We were able to find street parking both nights, but if you can't then you need to park in a nearby garage (not likely to be too cheap). Just a quick tip on something to do. Take a drive to the area known as Pinones. It is just east of Isla Verde (maybe 15 minute drive from Old SJ). Here you will find dozens of food and beer vendors. It might be tough to find someone who speaks english, but you will have a wonderful time and will not spend much money while taking in some real Puerto Rican culture.

I want to avoid re-hashing the last few reviews. They all seem pretty accurate in facts, differing mainly in the expectations of their authors. Here are the salient additions from our perspective. SERVICE & MARIA . Maria is the front desk attendant from 7AM to 6PM -- incredible. She is sunny, bright, and very helpful -- both as to matters of the hotel and the city. She went out of her way to make calls in advance and have excursions, fees, transoprtation options, maps, brochures, etc., to give us when we arrived. The night staff are from an outside contractor, so their helpfulness is variable. Based on the other helpful reviews, we just figured that we were on our own after 6. I think it might be more accurate to look at the accomodations as somewhere between an apartment and a hotel. THE LOCATION. It is perfect (if you want to be in Old San Juan) -- situated right in the midst of the main street of Old SJ, Calle Fortaleza. Most of the better restaurants are on that street. The rest are an easy 3-4 block walk from there. It is very easy to hail a taxi at all hours. HOTEL. We saw two rooms b/c the first was in the back and the entire back hall was very musty at the time. We were moved one of the rooms in the front of the hotel, those facing Calle Fortaleza. I thnk there is only room in front per floor. Ours was 401. Unlike the suites in the back, this one was one large room, which was fine. Very pretty view to the street. Our experience was that as a rule, Old San Juan does not sleep. There was street noise until 4 AM each night. This did not really bother us, b/c we both like a little street noise. However, one night, the people in the apt. directly across the street from us (on the same floor) had an all night party with all the fixin's (i.e., alcohol, music, etc). There was very little sleep that night. As to the hotel itself, the hotel is pretty basic, but they have painted it in tasteful earth tones and with sparse but attractive local furniture. Neither of our rooms had baths, just showers. FINDING THE HOTEL. The hotel is near impossible to spot unless you have seen it once before. The facade is non-descript, yellow, and identified with small letters. Moreover, it is a very narrow facade and easy to miss. Would be sure to have the address handy when first arriving. It is almost directly across the street from a very nice linen store, which I believe is called \"The Linen Place.\" Overall, we liked the hotel very much and would return. Would not recommend it if you prefer resort-style service and accomodations.", "Date": "August 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Lauderdale, FL", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "mariagonzalezh", "ReviewID": "UR8128848", "Content": "My husband and I stayed in this Hotel this past month, our experience was more than great.

The attention was great, there was always someone willing to help. The hotel doesn't have a restaurant, but it has a great localitation.

Suites after trying to reserve a room at the Hotel Milano, which was booked. I really wanted to be in Old San Juan for at least part of my trip (a vacation), so I decided to take a chance on this relatively unknown hotel. I stayed in room 401, facing Calle de la Fortaleza. The windows open, fortunately, because I tend to micro-manage the temperature, and the room lacks a thermostat. Although Fortaleza has some of the best restaurants in San Juan and plenty of activity, the street was pretty quiet by 10 p.m. The room was large; the double bed was very comfortable. One reviewer said the sheets felt damp, but I didn't find that to be the case (and I'm pretty picky). The room had plenty of light. The wet bar area provided additional counter space and a dorm room-sized refrigerator. The fridge was packed with drinks, but I see no reason why you couldn't remove them and store your own items. [There are 2 drugstores and a market on Plaza de Armas if you're inclined to stock up on water and the like]. The desk was very small, more of a table. The bathroom was also small, and the shelves were quite high if you're under about 5'2\". The shower pressure was terrific, plenty of hot water, and the toilet worked fine. Sharing the bathroom could be a bit tricky, however, there's a medicine cabinet behind the mirror, which helps. The hotel did not have washcloths, so bring your own if that matters to you. I had no problems with the housekeeping service and certainly didn't see any bugs! The continental breakfast is really really basic -- coffee, OJ, cold cereal, bread for toast, small (but very good) pastries, and slices of ham and cheese. The coffee was fine. La Bombonera is one block up from the hotel, as the crow flies, and has mallorcas, eggs, and coffee con leche, plus a more \"local\" ambience. [an aside: if you've eaten at Canter's Deli on Fairfax in L.A., you'll find the service at La Bombonera very familiar]. In sum, nothing fancy or substantial about the breakfast. Ruben, who works the front desk overnight, is very helpful. It's true that the hotel does not have full time front desk service, so you do need to time your requests. Now, about some of the things people have mentioned: 1. Air-conditioning -- On the 4th floor, room 405 is on one control; the rest of the rooms are on the other control. Ruben did adjust the temp when asked, and there is a way adjust it yourself, if need be (I'm reluctant to say so, for fear that the owners will make it impossible!). 2. The rooms in back of the hotel face the back of some pretty ugly buildings. It's a good idea to ask: (a) whether your room has a window; and (b) what direction the room faces. 3. There are no phones in the rooms. Bring a cell phone! 4. Security is quite good. No one can enter the building without a key (room keys open the front door). 5. The t.v. has only a few channels. 6. The location was perfect. Close to the waterfront, restaurants, shops, everything in OSJ. 7. The rates were decent, not great. 8. It's a little tricky for taxis to find: It's across from Payless Shoes, between the Doll House and Kury's Jewelry (the Kury family owns S.J. Suites). In sum, the S.J. Suites worked fine for the 4 nights I spent there, and I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again (especially now that I know its quirks).", "Date": "January 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cDon't say I didn't warn you!\u201d", "Author": "Guliverstravels", "ReviewID": "UR6164978", "Content": "Most of the rooms have no windows (that's right); there is no control over the temperature in the room (it is set floor by floor by management); the staff are friendly however there is only a day shift (8am - 6pm), afterwards a night guard sits in the stairwell; if you have a problem after 6pm, then you live with the problem until the next morning.
