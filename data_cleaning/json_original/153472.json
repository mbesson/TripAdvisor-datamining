I found the hotel to be ok, I had no problems. The positives : Great location (less than 10min walk from the Zocalo), great price (EUR15), large room with balcony & 18' ceilings, room was quiet despite overlooking the street, hot shower that worked, room was very clean, bed was of an unusual size,somewhere between a single & a double,fine for 1 person,tight for two but it was comfortable (it did have a hard mattress but I like that). I dealt with two different young ladies at reception & found both to be pleasant & helpful. The negatives : there was a strong smell from the pipes in the bathroom, not sewage as a previous contributor mentioned, moreso I'd say just a really old piping system showing its age. The problem was solved by closing the bathroom door. The safe in my room was closed on my arrival & this problem was not solved during my stay. I booked the room via email directly with the hotel. However when I arrived I got the impression that they had no record of my booking, but because there were rooms available this was not a problem. I would like to reiterate this is just an impession I got, not a fact. They do have free WiFi but the sevice was intermittent. Overall I was very pleased with my stay, & would stay here again if in Mexico City.Bottom line, for EUR15 per night you get a clean bed & a shower & what more does one expect for that price.", "Date": "February 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Plattsburgh, New York", "Title": "\u201cNot Everyone's Cup of Tea\u201d", "Author": "Grousedoctor", "ReviewID": "UR122143338", "Content": "I'm in Mexico City twice a year and I always stay at the Isabel! As you can see from the reviews of Tripadvisor, it's not everyone's cup of tea. On the positive side, the hotel is located less than a ten minute walk to the Zocalo. I've always found the neighborhood safe and friendly. The old colonial-style building has a certain charm although a whole lot of TLC would greatly improve its time-worn appearance. Unlike some, I've always found the front desk staff friendly. The cleaning ladies have always been pleasant, leave my room is great shape, and enjoy speaking Spanish with those of us just learning the language. Finally, it's a really cheap sleep if you're on a tight budget or you just don't like spending more for a hotel in Mexico. Now, the negative! As charming as the hotel is, it is in need of some updating. Internet is available in the lobby for a fee; no WiFi. Be sure and ask for a room with a balcony. Many of these are very large, with high ceilings although a bit delapidated. Avenida Isabel is a busy street. Therefore, it does tend to be a little noisy, but that's true of most of central DF. I tend to enjoy having the windows open inspite of the car and truck noise. Unfortunately, we had bed bugs on our last stay. However, in all the times I've stayed there, this was the first time I had to complain about such a condition in my room. Sure, paint and updating could brighten the rooms, but I also enjoy the atmosphere of a place that takes me back in time to an era in Mexico City I didn't experience. My wife is picky about where we stay when we travel in Mexico and Cental America, but she is fine with the Hotel Isabel in spite of it failings. Location and price are two big pluses.

I first had room 112 and when I retruned I got room 115. Both were interior rooms, plain decor with old but sturdy furniture. I didn't care, as someone else said, \"I was only there to sleep and shower\". I was originally given room 108, an exterior room with a Juliet balcony, but the room wasn't made when I arrived and I wanted to shower and nap, so I changed to 112 (which was already prepared). If you get an exterior room, steet noise may be a problem during the day, but in the evening (past 10 PM) the area is quiet. When I was in room 112 (towards the back of the building) noise was not a problem, but when i was in room 115, along the north-wall, which is shared with the hostel next door, I heard noise late into the evening (read: Metallica, the Pulp Fiction soundtrack and ACDC...all music I like, just not when I'm trying to sleep) coming from the hostel. Other have mentioned the firmness of the mattresses...firm isn't the proper term...hard like a rock would be more adequate.

The maid service was a little slow and it is true you may have to wait some time (or ask twice) for certain things, but all truth be told, if you don't sweat the little things and be patient, you'll get what you want in the end.
