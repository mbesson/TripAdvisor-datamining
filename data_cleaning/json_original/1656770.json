We booked the room type with bed on lower level but were given another room type with bed on upper level when we checked in. The reception said it was an upgrade. As the bed was on upper level, there was plenty of space on the lower level where we could move around and placed our suitcases and things we bought. The shower area and the toilet were separated. Also the shower area is quite small (but clean and modern design though) and you don't have much space to place towel and clothes inside. Since we are going as couple there wasn't much inconvience or embarassment. But if you are travelling with friends and you are not very familiar with each other, this may not be a ideal choice to you. The stairs climbing up to the upper level are reasonably safe. You just need to be a bit cautious when you wake up in midnight to make sure you watch out your steps. However overall the hotel and the facilities are all very new and stylish. The bed was also very comfy and we felt we were home. We enjoyed our stay there. One more thing, the location of the hotel is not close to the MRT. The Clarke Quay station is at least 10-15 minutes walk along the river. We tried it once and couldn't accept the distance when our stomachs were still empty in the morning. So we used taxi and the hotel shuttle for the rest of the time. The hotel shuttle is a one-way trip and departs every hour on the dot so is still acceptable. And since it's close to Clarke Quay (10-15 minutes walk), you will find lots of choices of restaurants/pubs at night.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ludhiana, India", "Title": "\u201cA Good Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Puneet B", "ReviewID": "UR128103751", "Content": "Hotel Studio M was was my first foray in Singapore back in 2010.

Ever!\u201d", "Author": "LanPing", "ReviewID": "UR127919317", "Content": "I had been looking forward to staying here, having previously read good reviews and having thus far not found a consistently good mid-budget hotel in Singapore. I booked through my account with Booking.com and did not initially realise that this hotel was part of the Copthorne chain. At checkin I was presented with a card pre-filled out with something vaguely resembling my personal details from a previous employment, even though my Booking.com reservation recorded all my correct details - apparently, once you are \"in\" the Copthorne system. they have you, and, arriving close to midnight, I had to fill out the registration card again longhand. The hotel is set one road back from the river in a reasonably central location - 15 minutes from Clark Quay MRT, but walkable to e.g. Bugis, Raffles Quay and Chinatown. The hotel appears to be 10 - 15 years old, with an attractive outdoor dining area adjacent to the open-air pool. The breakfast buffet was good by most standards and was included in the room rate, as was wifi, which was reasonably fast and completely stable. The rooms are split level but truly tiny, rendering the downstairs no more than a corridor to the upstairs sleeping area. Toilet and shower cubicles are also tiny, the only washbasin is in the \"main\" downstairs room and the previously mentioned glass partition on the balcony is indeed more than slightly scary (with no non-slip tread on the stairs either). The sleeping ledge has a sign over the bed warning you to mind your head - it's that cramped up there. I was staying with my teenage daughter and had hoped that we could share the split-level room, but it was far too small and when I discovered that the room was non-refundable, I was forced to book a second one for her. There is a hanging rail but no cupboards or wardrobes. Room service is allegedly 24 hours, but even of you can get through on the phone, you'll discover that it only opens at 6pm. I reverted to dialling the hotel's external number (which was answered immediately) after failing to get through to either Reception or Room Service on the internal phones, and when I went downstairs to complain there were 7 members of staff idling around. When I used my mobile to again call the hotel external number, one of them picked the phone up immediately. I made a complaint to the Manager, but she really didn't want to know. When Room Service does ultimately arrive it is delivered in plastic buckets - not food containers like you would get from a takeaway, but semi-transparent deep extruded buckets with plastic cutlery. Both the Sausages & Mash and the Chicken Lasagne were vile and luke warm, though the Lamb Shank was ok - all priced at $15 + 10% Service Charge. Beer and Iced Tea at Sing$8 per can from the minibar When I checked out there were numerous additional \"Room Service Charge\" items, over and above the \"Food & Beverage\" charges which I recognised. I was initially told that these - each around S$17.50 - were a local Tax, but when I pointed out that GST Tax was itemised separately, they admitted that this had nothing to do with food & beverage, but was an additional \"service charge\" for using the room. In other words, a mandatory house surcharge, making the room 10% more expensive than the headline rate. This kind of gouging is plain cynical, and calling it a \"Room Service Charge\" is borderline deceitful, as many people would not notice it. The staff were consistently unhelpful, and I seriously would not recommend this hotel - nor indeed any in the Copthorne chain - to anyone looking for mid-range accommodation. I stayed for 4 nights in April 2012 at an aggregate cost (1 room) of S$1,000 - the Swissotel Merchant Court is far better, more central and would have cost only S$1,300. It would have been a wise investment from a number of perspectives, and I will not make this mistake again.", "Date": "April 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cIt's OK but not great\u201d", "Author": "RomaPHILE33", "ReviewID": "UR127910997", "Content": "This hotel styles itself as a boutique hotel.

Walking from the hotel to the bus stop takes about 5 mins, and the bus ride to the MRT would take another 5-7 mins.

I really love the high ceiling and it gives the illusion that the room is very spacious, although it's a little smaller than average.

The concept of a hotel room masquerading as a studio loft definitely came across creative, and quirky. After staying in it for 1 night however, I find the concept actually a bit less practical. Upon check-in, the receptionist told me I got an upgrade to a premium room, a gesture that I appreciated very much. Downstairs is the living room, sink, and the toilet/ shower that are separated. Upstairs is the bed and TV. The unit was clean, but the tabletop by the sink was heavily stained. The toilet area was very very small. I\u2019m of average frame, and when I sit on the toilet, my knees practically touched the wall (so you have to sit a bit diagonally ha ha). The shower was of decent size and the water pressure was very good. The bed was amazingly comfortable! The dark colored stairs though can at times feel a bit slippery/steep when you are going down. I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s safe to have young kids stay here. The glass protector on the upper floor says \u201cdo not lean\u201d and it does feel that you should not lean on it. The hallways felt cramp and a bit dark. I would have preferred better lighting in these areas. The view was awful. My room was facing another side of the hotel.

The check-in process was fairly fuss-free and quick. The hotel parking lots are very limited, and as I needed to drive out during my stay I enquired about the other available parking options in the vicinity. The concierge staff gave me 2 options: to either park at Quayside Condominium just across the road or at Gallery hotel, and I would be given a cash reimbursement. However, I will have to obtain a receipt while exiting the carpark, park somewhere else near Studio M, and go to the concierge to present my receipt for the reimbursement. Suffice to say I was not impressed with how troublesome the entire process was. Hence my advice is to refrain from driving if you are staying in Studio M. The weekend package promised free wifi and free breakfast. We were sorely disappointed when the wifi connection DID NOT work throughout my entire stay, and this was intensely frustrating since I had hoped to get some work done. When a LAN cable was provided by the concierge counter, we were promised that the internet connection would be instant. However, upon connecting the LAN cable, it still required a log-in process which DID NOT work in the end as well. Subsequently we found a note on the desk informing us that re-cabling works were being done in the hotel till late April. Thanks (but no thanks) for the fine-print that was never mentioned when the package was purchased. The room is of a unique loft-concept (Studio Loft), well-lit with high ceilings and modern decor. The space available , however, is limited and best for 1-2 persons. Bed was very comfortable. The walls, however, are not sound-proof at all. Hence during my stay I could hear the housekeeping staff chatting merrily (and very loudly) away in the corridors at 2+ pm in the afternoon, the traffic on the road outside, and the copulation process of a very enthusiastic couple upstairs. I was not amused. The WC and the shower units are separated, small but adequate. The ledge in the shower unit where toiletries are placed, however, is stained and dirty, which was a turn-off. The sink is at a separate area where the kettle and cups are placed, with a vanity-unit providing minimal toiletries. Bring your own if you come. On the 2nd level, there is the cabana area and a small lap pool. It was 3+ pm when we explored the area, and yet the plates filled with unfinished food from the morning buffet breakfast were not cleared from the cabana tables. Not pleasant. The area around the hotel is bustling with activity at night, with restaurants and pubs a-plenty, with a chillout vibe. It is not in the heart of the city i.e. Orchard Road, but pleasant enough for exploring around the Singapore river. As we slept at an unearthly hour the night before, we were hoping to wake up later the next day. But we were rudely disturbed by incessant ringing of our doorbell at 9am, and housekeeping lady shouting \"Do you want housekeeping?\" repeatedly. Naturally we thought that we were merely dreaming but we were jolted to consciousness when the housekeeping lady OPENED THE DOOR HERSELF, wanting to barge in and clean up our room. I have never experienced this before during my stays in other hotels in Singapore and other countries. This was the straw that broke the camel's back. Why the rush? Is this even allowed? Pray tell. Breakfast was skipped altogether because we were too exhausted and determined NOT to let the hotel staff anger us any further. Checking out was fuss-free, and we were mighty glad for this as we wanted to leave in haste. This was not the weekend escapade I had paid and hoped for. You can definitely get much better paying a bit more for the well-established 5 star hotels.

You walk in, the shower is on your right, the toilet is on your left (each has its own small room). You walk into a small sitting area (or bed depending on which room type you get) and there is a wet bar there with a fridge.

It's pretty tight for 3 people so it was a good thing we only used the room for sleeping. Its centralized location as great as it's only a 10 minute walk to the mall/train station, as well as numerous eateries in the area. As an added bonus, I have a friend who is stationed in the US Navy there and she happened to lived 2 blocks away so it was easy to be able to see her for breakfast before she went to work. The only reason I'd recommend against this hotel is if you're traveling with more than 2 people or are on the heavy side (the bathroom is extremely cramped and doesn't have much space to move around). Also if you have trouble going up and down stairs you'll want the standard room as it's hard to go up and down the stairs with the bed upstairs and the bathroom downstairs. I wasn't able to try the pool or gym or restaurant, but they were all by each other (also they're open air) and they all looked nice. The hotel does give free wifi access but it's kinda slow.

The corridor outside the room feels so dark,gotta put more light there My other complain is the amount of electric plug on the lower floor,simply not enough to charge 4 different gadgets,if i recall correctly there are only 2 near the phone and 2 near the water kettle (1 is already for the kettle) the other plug is near the bathroom/front door,its ridiculous that i have to go upstairs to charge the phones The free internet is a pain to use,it keeps asking me to enter username and password every few minutes and feels a bit slow There is no wardrobe in the room,just a railing with only 2 hangers (i think its not enough) The walk to clarke quay MRT is quite far,and the sign is minimal,its the homework for singapore government,basically its around 20 minutes walk along the river,until you see the shopping centre called \"central\" right next to swissotel merchant cour,go inside the shopping centre to take the escalator to the mrt,otherwise you have to go down the stairways (around 90 stairs..no exactly sure) the mrt is located on the other side of the river As i'm not familiar with the area,i also find it difficult to find a convenience store,the nearest 7/11 is on the other side of Moh Sultan Rd (there is a bus that goes to clarke quay mrt,the bus stop is near this 7/11) To sum up,i would recommend this hotel for those who travel light (small luggage), not too tall (the toilet might be unconfortable for taller folks),likes to walk (the mrt and bus to mrt is pretty far) and willing to try something different (mezzanine on your standard hotel room is a cool concept)", "Date": "March 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leeds", "Title": "\u201cModern and good value!\u201d", "Author": "Sylvia07", "ReviewID": "UR125710069", "Content": "This hotel is very new and the decor is very modern.

The hotel management was unable to stop the music of course. There was no bath tub (just a shower), no king size beds (the front desk staff looked as if i was an alien when i requested a king size bed.. \"we dont have king size beds, sir, only queen size beds\") In short, this hotel should reduce its rate to SGD100,and cater for backpacker tourists, but stay away from trying to be a business hotel in the SGD 200 category.

The Shower recess is to the right and marginally larger but the door has to be shut if you do not want water sprayed on the carpet.

There is a large netted window running the full length up to very ( 2 floors ) ceiling which in my case looked into rooms on the other side of a 20-30 mtr gap. Trying to pull the night curtains shut completely is virtually impossible due to the design. Upstairs the double bed is located in a recess with absolute minimum space. 30% of the bed is covered with a low ceiling such that you cannot stand up, only crouch. There is no other access to the inboard side of bed other than over the other part of the bed, there is no floor space to walk, there is no headroom to walk, there is no reading light or anywhere to put anything for someone sleeping in inboard position. The stairs are wooden, quite steep and painted dark brown and although adequately supplied with strong rail, nevertheless would not recommend this set up for anyone with kids, or the elderly, especially for those needing to go to the toilet very often. If one looks at the space occupied by the room in total it does not seem to be a very efficient use of the volume as so much is effectively open air and where you need some space, around the bed and in the wet areas...there is virtually none.

We were so disappointed that we did not choose Studio M as our first choice and spend the entire holiday there instead of Waterfront. Studio M rooms cater to Scandinavian taste.

And breakfast does not get full points as it did not serve mini pancakes (yummy!) every day and it is true that if you come around 9.30 there is not much left (e.g. fruits, only watermelon left). But the location of the hotel is good, only 14-minute walk to Orchard Road and 10-minute walk to the nearest tube station. And the beautiful river is right next to the hotel.

Here is my letter of complaint to them: Enough said: Hi, i've booked your hotel through agoda.com and my stay (day 1) has already started to be unpleasant. Read from your information booklet that you do have a nominal charge for a bucket of ice which i've found out to be $3++. Firstly, i have never encountered any hotel with reputable standing, namely 4 stars, even 3 stars to charge for a basic necessity like this. The hotel provides a chiller, which does not chill drinks to an acceptable temperature and when i called up your front desk, which took me 3 attempts before someone even bothered to pick up the call, the response was that it is a chiller hence it just cools the drink and doesn't chill drinks like what a fridge does. If a hotel cannot provide a decent fridge/chiller that chills drinks to be ice cold, then it is really not fulfilling the purpose. It is plain ridiculous to have to pay for ice as this is not a budget hotel where rates are already kept to a minimum and additional add ons must be charged due to a whole different business model, like budget carrier for example, that i can understand and accept. So i am really wondering, why does this hotel, which is rated 4 stars and under the Millenium & Copthorne group charge for something as basic as ICE??? I've stayed in Riverview Hotel and a few other 4 stars hotels and they do not impose such rubbish. Also, the lights on the upper level, at the study area, does not work. The internet connection is intermittently being disconnected, while I understand that this is a complimentary service but shouldn't there be any standard to adhere to around here? When i checked in, i requested for a smoking room and they just replied that they currently do not have any, she failed to check with me if i'd like to be availed of 1 at a later period. There is a severe lack of anticipatory service, eagerness to serve and basic follow up service.

We reported this to maintenance and he chuckled but we were without a safe. They advertise meeting rooms but, in fact, they have none. They have no business center. The restart is outdoor. The layout is dangerous, with steep wooden slippery stairs. We paid a corporate rate of $220 and it did not include breakfast! There is not one positive thing I can say about this hotel.

Why such a huge range? I can offer some reasons why this is possibly so. The price on special is around $200 inclusive of tax a night with breakfast and free wifi which, for Singapore, is very good. The location by the Singapore river for nightlife and restaurants is great. The mezzanine level loft is 'trendy' and different. Its quite new, staff are friendly, and the food I had ranged from excellent to good. The bed is very comfortable and pillows and sheets just great So why do I mark it only average? Well the location is now where near an MRT and getting taxis is hell unless you leave at 0730. The room toilet and shower (as everyone says) is a box with no ventilation and smell. The 'journey' up and down the stairs to the bathroom in the night is akin to scaling Everest - one slip and hospital awaits (no one with less than cat like agilty should consider this place)...... The TV is upstairs so you have to leave the longe downstairs and lie on the bed to watch TV. The wifi slows down rapidly, the room service was so bad on one day it took 1hr 20mins and was given free. The next day they said 45 min because they said they were understaffed and then it cam in 10 minutes! Part of the room service menu is served in disposable plastic box and disposable cutlery (on the pretext of \"hygiene and cleaner suppoundings\"!!) . The staff are friendly but the management of them is the big issue plus many can hardly speak english and this applies to front line staff. So there are great things and there are terrible things. I can see that if things go wrong for you it will go very wrong, if you love the trendiness and nothing happens to your stay you may think its excellent. For the price I thinks it average, I experienced enough of the problems to say I will not be back but its not the worst hotel I have stayed in (unless of course you fall off the desk while walking up the stairs!)

I rang ahead to the hotel and didn't know how I would fare as I had never stayed at this hotel before. Upon arrival at approximately 11:30pm, they raised my issue with me and dispatched an extremely helpful technician with his tools turned out in overalls really looking the part. He had an enourmous set of bolt cutters and was overjoyed when he swiftly removed the padlock and I could access my suitcase. I was sorry that I did not have any Singaporean currency (left it at home as well!) I would have gladly tipped him. I was impressed with the hotels design and construction, it is only a couple of years old and well maintained, I thought it had a very interesting design and execution. The loft rooms a bit of fun, the bed was very comfortable and had a massive desk. The WC and shower are in seperate little rooms, cupboards almost. I had experienced similar at Wanderlust in Little India Singapore. The main criticism I would have is that the lower floor (entry level) is carpeted, unlike Wanderlust which was tiled, so if water leaks out of the shower are, or if you step out wet, you wet the carpet. So a small thing really, I felt the ammenities were great. Breakfast was outdoor, undercover on the large deck with the pool and ponds, with great little lounge areas for groups, I thought it was all very funky and was much more interesting than staying at one of the older hotels in the area.

It is located near the banks of the Singapore river next to Robertson Quay. The location is pretty central and there are lots of restaurants nearby which cater to the tourist and expat crowd. My partner and I picked this hotel because the rooms looked cool and modern on the website and because it was reasonably located and priced at $$250 per night. The hotel has a lot of problems however: The rooms are poorly built and maintained. Modern and trendy yes but also cheap, poorly maintained and just not practical for a hotel room. Our room smelt of mould and damp because the shower is a very small enclosed room with poor ventilation. Every time we returned to our room is had a bad smell because of this. You can clearly see lots of mould growing on the walls of the shower, but they make no attempt to clean this. There is no private area to get dressed as there is no normal type bathroom in this hotel. The shower and toilet are two tiny cubicle like rooms either side of the entry door. Even the wash basin is located in the living area opposite the desk, chair, etc. So when getting dressed you must do so in the living area, and you may have to do so in full view of your neighbors, since the hotel is built in a \"H\" type floor plan. The internet is painfully slow, there is one wireless router for all guests to log onto. I called reception and asked them if I could do anything to get a faster connection. The staff mentioned that they knew it was slow and said it was because everybody was online.... so they offered to bring an ethernet cable to the room which gave no improvement to connection speed at all. You need to be nimble to get to bed. If you are older, have some mobility problems or an injury of any type that prevents you from climbing up small winding tight stairs, avoid this hotel. The bed is located atop these stairs in a mezzanine type landing, the bed is queen size, lots of headroom on one side but one half of the bed was under a pillar in our room, meaning one person has about max 1 meter headroom. TV is located updaters in the sleeping area so you must be in bed to watch it. You are not allowed to watch TV in the living area ;-) must go to bed first! If you are in Singapore on business and it's raining and you have to be at work on time in the morning, get downstairs 1 hour earlier than you normally would. This morning lots of people were waiting over 1 hour for a taxi, some people had a sense of humor failure, there was plenty of shouting going on at the hotel staff for their inability of organize taxi's. Sure it's harder to get a taxi when it's raining but all good hotels have a decent relationship with the taxi booking office and are able to get cabs in a reasonable time, thankfully I didn't have an appointment this morning... Later in the morning when I came back from a run, the hotel staff were telling a taxi who was waiting for a fare outside to leave! It was still raining, no wonder they are back off the queue.. There are very limited food and beverage options at this hotel. A coffee shop with a limited menu, a average restaurant that is open for dinner, no bar or entertainment available. There is a 25m lap pool. Lap pool means it is very narrow. There is a small gym with 5-6 items. Service is OK and staff are friendly enough although they are poorly trained. They make plenty of mistakes with orders and it's all down to lack of training and management. It seems to me that there are 3 major issues with this hotel: 1. Poor design layout of the rooms. 2. Lack of decent facilities. 3. Poor management of the hotel and staff. At the time of writing this review, the hotel ranked 85th in Singapore, which I guess is about right.

I mean I had the tight pants and a pair of trendy RayBan wayfarers going for me. But honestly, the Studio M hotel leaves much to be desired. About the Studio M hotel: - The shower area is like an enclosed box and I couldn't detect ventilation. If you're tall, then you will feel cramped. Without ventilation,it's humid, so the usual suspects of soap scum and browish/greenish mold is highly visible. So do the uncool thing and bring some shower flip flops. - The pool area houses a bar/\"cool\" hangout place, complete with nightly BLASTING music. Even after repeated phone calls to the front desk, the noise issues will not be solved, the bass beat noise will make it hard for you to sleep. - Try calling front desk ( there's no direct housekeeping line) for service, and your phone will get automatically cut off at times. I suspect that if too many people call and no one answers, the system just cuts you off to discourage you from calling. - The Airconditioning opening is very close to the bed, so with the aircon on ( you have no choice, it's Singapore, you don't turn the ac off when it's 30 degrees outside ) , your face and head will be greeted with cool breezes all night. So your face will be perpetually cold. I guess Eskimos would feel right at home. - Location - it's a good location with nice restuarants and bars close by if that's your gig. Beware though, if you have early morning meetings at 9AM, then you may encounter long lines in the lobby for taxis, as they are hard to come by. Over the years, it's been harder and harder to get or call for taxis because the pSingapore is booming with tourists and business people. Second of all, the location of the hotel doesn't help when it comes taxis. Finally - with the premier loft, the bed is on the 'second' floor of the room. So if you need to go the bathroom in the middle of the night, you will have to navigate down a set of narrow stairs. Make sure you avoid getting drunk or partying too hard before going to bed. Only a hip high glass divider separates you and a skull cracking 14 foot fall.

From the hotel's glossy website, we thought it looked alright and so we made the booking. For the price we paid, i wished now that i would have read the reviews beforehand. I don't want to sound like a broken record but the hotel is as what they say. The good is that it is an interesting modern concept which is great for travellers in search of something different. Besides that location was good as it was a nice leisurely walking distance to Clarke Quay/Roberston Quay. Breakfast was just alright and al fresco. And yes, rooms are unusual and it is indeed a loft with split level floors. Although it may seem spacious at first because of huge windows giving it an airy feeling, the design and layout of the room was just awfully awkward after a while. The upstairs of the loft had a sofa and a writing desk which was just redundant. Hate the tiny shower room (bad if your are claustrophobic) while their sink was outside in the room underneath the stairs. Service was substandard and as mentioned, be prepared to wait long to be checked-in. Noticed that there were many other travellers waiting around too and there was a whole pile of luggage bags laying in the corner of the lobby as the hotel has no place to store them.

If you don't mind something different & are game for a change, this place is right for you (as it was for me). The check-in/check-out counter is an island. Customers can be attended to from any direction. This was the first interesting feature for me. It's unlike standard hotel counters. The reception area/ lobby is compact. The corridors are narrow, narrow but for me, this isn't a big deal for me. By now, you get the idea that things are going to be 'smaller'. I like the room design. The room they upgraded me to has a loft concept - bed & TV upstairs, everything else downstairs. What other reviewers wrote about the toilet & shower are accurate & sadly, true. #1 they are separate so you have to walk across from one to the other (unlike in normal hotels, both are in the same space) #2 the shower cubicle is 3 feet by 4 feet by 6+ feet (see attached photo) #3 the toilet is small enough that it's a challenge to bend over completely to pull up your pants. Here, I don't spend much time in these 2 places, so they don't bother me.

The toilet is very cramped and no room to move in, even smaller than shopping centre toilet cubicles! The shower is extremely small, with the normal white room door which makes you feel horrible while showering, instead of relaxed. A couple of steps from the entrance door on the left (after the toilet) is a small bench space which is located under the staircase, that small bench space has a sink which is the only sink in the room, so no sink in toilet , no separate bathroom.

Bad points: The design of this hotel , in it's attempt to be cutting edge, has sacrificed all comfort to the point of being ridiculous. My room had a double bed; shower room; separate toilet; and sink on the first level. The stairs to the second level or mezzanine are so steep I think they are dangerous. If you were to slip on the last step where the stairs make a 90 degree turn almost against the huge window, you'd be lucky not to go hurtling to the street below followed by a trail of broken glass. The main feature of the rooms is the massive window, but just to close the curtains to the hundreds of office and apartment windows looking straight in to your room, you have to crawl along the boxed window ledge, which is also doubles as the side of the bed, with nothing to hold on to, and only the glass to lean against! Hence closing the curtains presents the same risk! The shower is a tiny room on it's own right next to the entrance to the room. The toilet is a separate room opposite the shower and on the other side of the entrance. The toilet is so small that a tall person's knees would easily jam against the wall which is about 6 inches from your face when in a seated position! It is claustrophobic in the extreme! The basin doubles as the sink and is located outside of either the shower or toilet and can be found at the foot of the bed. Because of the layout, there is no privacy at all in the room. There is not enough room to dry or dress in the shower room, so you must put the bathmat on the carpeted floor in front of the main entrance and step outside to dry and dress - which is where the necessity to close the curtains to the hundreds of windows looking directly into the room comes into play!

I mean it looks sturdy, but it didn't inspire alot of confidence in me! This hotel has some great features though, like the beautiful, large pool and lounge area on the 2nd floor that is quiet and cool. It has decks that meander around pools of water, on which large white globes float. Large overstuffed, upholstered sofas and chairs are settled in little sitting areas where you can have a nice private spot to relax and have a drink. The pool is long and narrow but perfect for swimming laps. There's a smaller pool on the side for relaxing. There are rows of lounge chairs facing the pool. The fitness room next door is well-equipped and supplies thick towels. The small restaurant on the first floor has good food, with indoor or outdoor seating along the sidewalk.

We found it easiest to leave the door open to avoid claustrophobia and then needed to scoot sideways into the entry to pull pants up. To go number one in the middle of the night it is best to do that from the room entry (just outside the toilet cubicle) which is easily done for a male. Adds to family bonding and reminds me of camping with the family. 4. The shower that we had was a thrilling experience. Once the water temperature was set the water stream would switch between the temperature you had set and scalding hot. This would happen on a random yet continuous basis, averaging about every 30 seconds. I can only assume that this was the effect of other rooms turning taps on and off. I am not exaggerating and I know that this would be unacceptable if not illegal most places in the world. Because of this, my young children refused to take showers and had to be hand washed for the entire week long stay. Much to my childrens' amusement I braved the shower but there were plenty of screams and jumping out of the water stream to get washed. I have never encountered this before in 22 years of traveling the world and staying in hotel rooms 6 months per year. 5. The swimming pool is good for laps but no good for children. No shallow areas and very high sides. The \"spa\" was the same cold temperature as the main pool. Pool towels often unavailable. 6. High curtains make it impossible to completely close them. This creates privacy issues for the inwards facing rooms unless you like sitting in the dark. This also provided us with some interesting entertainment a couple of nights from opposite rooms in the building. Very much at he expensive of other unsuspecting hotel guests. 7. There is a master switch to turn off the room lights from the bedside upstairs. The problem with this is that it means that if anyone gets up in the night to use the toilet they have to do it in the dark, as the individual light switches will not work. Alternatively turn on all the room lights and disturb other sleepers. We generally chose the dark option but ensure your travel insurance is up to date as those stairs are steep! 8. This location is Robertson Quay close to Clarke Quay so there are plenty of good outside and riverside dining and bar options. It is also too far in my opinion from the MRT. Took about 25 minutes walk between hotel and MRT station in the humid heat each time we did it. It is also on a different line to the majority of other attractions. This involves a long underground walk to change lines to go one additional stop. Fortunately taxis are cheap. 9. Hotel cleanliness was average with he mandatory black hairs in the basin and bed sheets. 10. Other reviewers have mentioned unsmiling service. This is standard in Singapore in my experience. No bad intentions meant, I don't think, just busy trying to make another buck. We had an enjoyable time in Singapore overall.

The room lacked any colour, it was pine wood, some glass, and white. This might sound picky but take my word for it when I say, it felt cheap and uncaring - Two words come to mind when I think of the interior design. Ikea and Rice - The euro-styling might have been forgivable if it had felt like it still had class, elegance, or some level of care to it. But everything about the rooms screamed economy. - Perhaps the thing that I find most unforgivable was that the in-room dining. The in-room dining is supplied by a couple of different cafes surrounding the hotel. Pizza is available 6pm-10pm along with other main meals. Other dishes are available 24/7. The food was not at all objectionable, how ever! They are served in plastic containers with plastic forks and knives in packets. These take-away options took half an hour to arrive and were often luke-warm and destroyed by the sealed containers which did not allow moisture to ventilate. The evening I left I was served an hour after ordering, I was literally picking up the phone to find out what had happened to my order when the door rang. In her arms she had 4 other plastic square contained meals that she was taking around to others in the hotel, balanced vicariously on a small plastic tray. I was surprised she was actually capable of producing the receipt I needed to sign considering she had her hands so full. There was no smile, no apology for the time delay, she hardly said a word and it was obvious that this was not due to any language difficulties. - When asking for some ice to use for drinks a colleague was going to be charged $3 if he wanted it delievered - When asking if we could drink our own alcohol around the pool side we were told yes by reception then no by the staff on the recreation floor, then yes by reception again, then when arriving back we were restricted to only drinking on the poolside recliners despite the presence of lounges and sofas scattered across the unpopulated deck. - When wanting to order a poolside drink I had to search to find a waiter. I stood at the greeting desk for 2 minutes watching him tinker on the piano to pass the time, he seemed very bored. - Finally he got up and without glancing towards his work station, dragged himself away to the bar where I finally stormed over to deliver my order. - The poolside food is limited to 7-8 japanese entr\u00e9es and 7-8 japanese mains. So you'd better like japanese if you should like to eat by the pool. - The pool itself is well sized considering the rooms. It has a nice outlook and remains out of the harsh sun for most of the day, yet presenting itself at times as it passes over the H shaped design of the building. - There's only JUST enough deck chairs so you best be okay with lounging next to a stranger - The gym is well appointed with everything you might need including provided towels. There's one of everything except the treadmills of which there are two - One evening we felt like some drinks at the bar, only to sit there for 15 minutes ringing the bell obnoxiously. We could hear people chatting away in the kitchen but not a soul came out to serve us, despite a chef eyeing us off as he walked back in presumably after a break. we gave up and went and grabbed our own drinks. - With night service so bureaucratic and unreliable, it was astonishing how efficiently they managed to end the buffet service at 10:30am sharp. Much of the packing began before this time in fact, and the staff seemed only too ready to pounce upon the food as the clock struck 10:30. One felt rather confronted as the frenzied stuff hustled plates and cutlery away. - The buffet food was quite enjoyable on an up note, and the outdoor undercover eatery is very pleasant. - The first thing you'll notice in the foyer of Studio M is the pungent fabricated floral smell, I apologise for not knowing the particular flower. There are orchids around however I'm convinced that they alone could not produce the slightly dizzying effect I experienced every time I walked in the door. - The staff are young, fluent in english, and featured in the most faux pas uniforms, consisting of transparent white shirts and grey vests that would make Kate Moss look fat. - The complimentary wi-fi had the \"umph\" and reliabilty of a budgerigar - Please note the plants featured in the rooms on the online pictures are NOT present - The beds are luxuriously comfortable, a serious upside to this hotel, though the radio/ipod clock was so extremely bright we has to use the complementary Bible to block it each night. In finishing, the attitude of the hotel was sadly economical, and efficient. In an asian hotel I relish the thought of their unsurpassed service, their beaming smiles, and humble offer to do anything necessary to make your stay more accommodating. In a european hotel one expects a particular level of class, knowledgeability, and elegance. Studio M's staff appeared as if they'd extracted the most undesirable parts of both services and combined them together, perhaps symbolised in their \"Eeyore grey\" uniforms. Their air of education came through as an inability to work beyond the framework of their clinical hotel policies. Their elegance came as silver coated plastic forks and knives, their class came in uber-modern interior design that was so white and clinical one felt oddly as if inside a designer hospital. The only staff member to make my day EVERY day, was the dear housekeeping girl who didn't speak a speck of english but went about her work with a genuine beaming smile, admirable diligence, and a serving attitude that made your heart melt. Out of sheer protest I would not recommend this hotel, it's plain, new, and efficient if you need a good stop over experience. However to stay there is to fund Millenium Copthorne and their endevour to create an asian hotel that symbolises values only europeans know how to execute. Asian hospitality is second to none, and it was very sad to see this product so clearly designed to make money with efficacy, rather than a hotel experience full of people passionate about the concept of their service", "Date": "July 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Thailand", "Title": "\u201cA pleasant stay, recommended.\u201d", "Author": "EnglishGirlinBangkok", "ReviewID": "UR115321667", "Content": "We stayed 7 nights here and was a little worried by some of the reviews.

I slept like a baby because no bathroom of neighbors adjacent to my wall or other noisy facilities. The shower is pocket-size and in a sort of closet but of good quality while the toilet is in another small, similar closet opposite the shower. Biggest issue is where to store your towel because inside it's so small everything will get wet (outside the shower closet, there are 2 hooks). If you have a bit of a belly, you won't be able to make the turn into the shower. There was a small wash basin located at the left wall of the room, reinforcing the message that you shouldn't expect your usual hotel room set-up. I liked it. The fast and free Wifi worked splendidly but, as with many hotels nowadays, only allows one device to be using the wifi connection; as soon as your log in with your laptop, you mobile phone's wifi connection is gone. Didn't use the breakfast (too expensive) but there is a good Australian bar (Boomerang) next door that provides everything (and with A/C). The open-air terrace and pool are very nice in the evenings for a drink, a chat, and some surfing. The only set-back of this hotel is its staff. The reception staff is curd and provides the basic service, and employs a no-smile policy, bordering on snotty - are the customers there for the staff, or the staff for the customers? If you want something out of the ordinary, you will get it after some insistence. Might be that they are under-staffed (on several occasions there simply wasn't even a doorman/concierge to be found) but the Copthorne management has a job to do on the HRM here. I concluded that I was on my own in this hotel, and took it from there (= call my own taxis, and sort out where/how to walk/find things around the place).

I had read the reviews of this hotel so I was expecting the room to be small but they are VERY SMALL. With that being said the rooms are an interesting set up. The check in process wasn't a swift one. Even though I has prepaid the room it still took a while. The front desk staff were not friendly at all, they were not rude but they for sure didn't greet me with a smile or make me feel very welcome. It doenst seem like this hotel likes children and I don't recommend it for families with young kids. We chose this hotel because many hotels in Singapore only offer 1 King bed or 2 singles and that just dosent work for a couple with a child (unless you want to share a single or put the child on the floor). The Studio room we had had a queen size downstairs and a pull out sofa bed upstairs in the loft. As the stairs are very steep its just not safe for a child to sleep upstairs but the pull out sofa is very small and hard for an adult. I asked the front desk to set up the sofa bed and when they did they put a horrible scratchy thin blanket instead of a nice down one that was on the main bed. I called the front desk to ask for a down one and they told me they couldn't do that, I told them that they must have a spare one somewhere and they told me that they didn't and were really rude about it. I called down again to tell them that this was totally unacceptable and the girl said \"whats unacceptable\" like I was being unreasonable. I explained that I am in the hospitality industry and that I know they could find one off another bed in the hotel. Finally housekeeping brought me one, they were super apologetic and really nice about it in the end. If you stay here be warned, I thought I was opening a closet and it was the shower, then I opened what I thought was another closet and it was the toilet.

Studio M is just too noisy which is a shame as otherwise it's a stylish hotel with friendly, helpful staff and great facilities.

Although you can enjoy peace and quiet by the pool during the day, at 6pm prompt, loud music starts to pump from about 8 speakers and this continues into the night. I spoke to staff several times about this and always got the same response: the music was turned down for 5 minutes then up went the volume again! Luckily, we were on the 9th Floor so found it possible to sleep and watch TV without too much bother. I pity those with rooms lower down. My only other niggle really was with the pre-booked breakfast which was let down by the quality of some of the ingredients (decent fruit juice would have been nice). Staff were friendly but unversed in spatial awareness and seemed more focussed on clearing tables (sometimes before guests had finished) than creating a pleasant atmosphere. That's not all the staff, by the way. The omelette staff were brilliant and a couple of the guys on checkout were ace as well. Finally, we visited the Ritz Carlton on our trip and were impressed by the fantastic (hot) jacuzzi. At Studio M, the jacuzzi is cold which (to me anyway) seems downright weird!

Terrible! Carried my heavy bags down once again to change the room, the concierge looked at me, offered no greeting & offered no assistance.

Never mind, but the reception told me i had to get my cutlery on my own at the cafe as it was not under them! And that room service was only for food! Outrageous!

The open-sided terrace restaurant is a revelation of modern Japanese cuisine, with a range of delicious tapas, mains and original Asian-inspired cocktails. The service in the hotel was impeccable, the staff were unfailingly friendly and attentive and picked up on my habits. For example, every morning I drink a cup of hot water and lemon; after the second morning, I only had to set foot in the restaurant before my drink would appear. There is a lovely open decking area next to the restaurant which is filled with comfortable seating, water features, tropical foliage and cosy nooks, with a decent lap pool and jacuzzi at the end. There is also a very small but decent gym (which sadly lacks a/c). Among my few gripes: * Reception, which was typically understaffed for checking in and out, and where some staff were less helpful than others. * Far from the MRT station - 10-15 minutes walk, which is tiring at the end of a long day lugging a laptop and bags, walking through the bustling Clarke Quay in 70%+ humidity. Cabs are not easy to come by at the station unless they are pre-booked. * The split-level rooms may not be for everyone - I'd be surprised if the stairs had not caused previous accidents. *I forgot to pick up some items from my room when I checked out, and I was unable to recover these afterward - even though I knew exactly where I had left them, the staff told me they had not been found.

The hotel is new, however, my particular room already showed some signs of wear. The location is good; walking distance to the Clarke Quay and Boat Quay areas, where all of the restaurants, shops, and night life seems to be. Some of the taxi drivers still don't know where this hotel is so I suggest that all guests carry the address along with you. The service wasn't too terribly bad, but personally, I am not particular type who really likes a lot of pampering. If you're looking for a lot of extras, and top quality service, you probably won't find it here. That's all I really have to say that is remotely positive about this hotel. Studio M in general has a very awkward and hard to use layout. It looks modern and sleek at first glance, but after about an hour of being in the room, you start to discover how user-unfriendly the place really is. And the longer you stay, the more frustrated you get with some of the oddities that this room has. For example, in order to activate the power to the room, you have to slide your key card into a little slot in the light switch located by the front door. I found this to be quite convenient, because I tend to lose my key all the time. This way, I always know where to find my key. However, the bad part is, that every time I leave the room and take the key out of the slot, it shuts down ALL power to the room. The air con, clock radio (which is really annoying because it never keeps the right time, and is much too bright. And since its glued to the desk, you can't turn it away from you. Get rid of it! Its out dated, not compatible with new iphones and ipods, and just place usless!) , the lights, all wall sockets -EVERYTHING! That means that every time I return to my room, the room is really hot and humid and takes a while for it to cool down. On top of that, the air con's temperature settings always resets itself to 22 degrees which is much too cold, especially when the vents are right above my bed blowing frigid air on me. This means that if I forget to raise the temperature before I go up to my loft, I have to climb all the way down the really scary stairs again and set the temperature. Another thing is, I have a lot of electronics with me (my laptop, iphone, digital camera, etc.) so since the whole room powers off when I leave, I can't charge my devices while I am away. The room's layout is little to be desired. I thought it was interesting at first, but after about the third day, it got to be a real annoyance. I really don't don't get the loft concept because in my opinion, it is a really poor utilization of available space. I think it would have worked much better if the loft was a full sized floor, hence a two story room instead of a one and a half story room. This way you have some storage space for suit cases or perhaps a more spacious living space on the second floor. Instead, I get a very small sleeping area, and a small living area. But the one thing I found to be more awkward than anything else were the stairs. This is an accident waiting to happen! There were times I thought I was going to trip and fall. And since the bottom of the stairs is basically the top of the writing desk (which is also very odd) and the big glass window, it just screams serious injury for those who aren't too coordinated. Another accident that is bound to happen sooner or later is the glass partition next to the bed that keeps you from tumbling to the ground below. Well, its pretty useless. Although there is a sticker that reads \"don't lean against the glass\" someone is bound to do it, and if that glass gives away, there will be serious injury (just a heads up to management if you're reading this). Replace the glass with more sturdy railing. Or better yet, expand the floor space a bit more so that you have more space to walk. Overall, I wouldn't say it's a horribly bad hotel. If you plan to stay for only 2 to 3 days, don't really care about service, and just want to be within walking distance of all of the action, then maybe its worth a go. But any more than that, I would suggest finding a more conventional hotel with more conventional layouts (unless you like stuff like this).

Of the three quays (Clarke and Boat being the other two), Robertson offers the quieter and more attractive experience. Studio M is on the corner of Nanson Road and Mohamed Sultan Road. The latter is relatively busy 24 hours a day so the hotel is subject to traffic noise. It also suffers from what I can only describe as the sound of extra-loud karaoke. From where this emanates I don't know but it is quite intrusive. Demolition and construction is a national pastime in Singapore and many buildings are deemed ripe for demolition after about 15 years. As such everything is built to last for about that period. This is particularly apparent in the rooms in Studio M. In terms of the bathroom fittings etc, it is clean but the formica fittings are covered in extensive scuff marks making the entire room look dirty. There is a shower cubicle, a separate toilet, with a sink in the main room itself. So three locations for bathroom fittings: very odd. The shower is small but ok. The toilet is tiny. Pulling up your pants in there is next to impossible! The room itself is on two levels with the upper part consisting of a little office and sofa. I liked this layout very much but, if I had been travelling with a partner, there would have been next to no room for luggage without dragging some up the stairs to the upper level. The choice of cable channels is very limited and the wifi (free!) connection is very slow. The room service prices, on the other hand, are (for a hotel) very reasonable and the food is very good quality. The hotel staff are very polite and helpful and I was particularly impressed with the maid on my floor who knew my name and was always keen to help point me in the direction of wherever I was going. Having read my review you may think I did not like this hotel very much but, all in all, the plus points outweighed the minus points and I did enjoy my stay.

One of the reception staff was courteous but the other more senior staff seemed to hate her job and didn\u2019t mind showing it throughout our stay. Up to the two-storey lofted room I went and found an aircon system on the fritz, and the desk phone out of order. Now, having to climb the stairs to the loft, to find the other telephone, I called reception for resolution - my luck, I got the unhappy one. After waiting 15 minutes, I called again, and was told they were on their way. Another 2 minutes passed and two maintenance fellows turned up with a ladder and into the ceiling they went. At this time the phone rang and because the loft stairs are so narrow, as is the overall room small, I was blocked by the maintenance men on the ladder. By that time they had somehow short circuited the lights and they all went out. Now, trying to navigate my way down the stairs, around the maintenance guys, and in the dark, I had had enough. I went back to reception, and asked for a new room, and was given one begrudgingly. Finally getting into my new room I found it less than clean, the bathroom and shower are literally smaller than 1X1 meter separate closets, the dreaded stairs to the paralyzingly small loft where the bed is is a nightmare when you need to make the trip to the toilet in the middle of the night. Curtains are floor to ceiling and you need to walk across the top of the desk to draw them fully!... you really have to see this room to believe the design.

Other bad features included S$3 for a small bucket of ice, no closet but instead two hangers on a rod, mold/mildew on bath tiles, about a dozen pinch points between getting in the main door and into the bath and shower and a car park system that frequently charges your cash card when using the complimentary car park coupons.

The whole area comes to life at night and is really buzzing. Robertson Quay has lots of bars and restaurants and is a little cheaper than Clarke Quay. Recommend Boomerang for happy hour. We were room only so used a couple of nearby supermarkets to stock up the room with breakfast treats. Free wifi in the room which is super quick. Loved the pool.

We were concerned before we arrived as we had booked before it opened and then some of the previous reviews were less than glowing...but we needn\u2019t have worried, it was A* from start to finish! We arrived at the hotel at 9am in the morning, yet the friendly reception staff said that we could have our room if we waited an hour. I think that\u2019s pretty impressive given that check in isn\u2019t until 2pm! We had breakfast/coffee in the lovely Coffee Shop on the ground floor. The quality of the food and drinks was superb and the service was quick and friendly \u2013 a great start to our trip. Okay, it wasn\u2019t that cheap, but only like Starbucks prices and much tastier! Once we got into our fabulous room we were delighted! I don\u2019t know how people can moan! Yes, it is compact, but in such a cleverly designed way that you never feel cramped or claustrophobic, the layout is really brilliant. The floor to ceiling windows are stunning and the quirky two level aspect to the room is really unique. We had the bed on the ground floor \u2013 and a desk and sofa bed upstairs (which we mainly used for storage/drying clothes/shopping bags etc!) The shower and toilet are in separate \u201cwet room\u201d style cubicles on either side of the entrance door \u2013 and previous reviewers really did over exaggerate, they are lovely and plenty big enough! (I am 5ft9 and my boyfriend is 6ft so we\u2019re not small either!) The shower in particular is amazing, with a big marble bench in there to put all your toiletries in \u2013 and always plenty of hot, powerful water (which is much needed in Singapore!!) The air conditioning is powerful \u2013 but easily and quickly adjustable should you need to change it. You get complimentary water every day too which is a nice touch. The free wi-fi is a very useful too! Rooms were serviced carefully and thoroughly everyday, and everything used was replaced for us. ...Oh and the bed! The comfiest ever!! We slept like logs every single night for the 13 nights we were there, it was a paradise! The pool area is really beautiful \u2013 a lovely way to spend an afternoon if you\u2019ve worn yourself out with all the sightseeing! I would say that they should implement some rules for the pool...as there was a rather loud/rowdy Australian family in there a few occasions we tried to go, which spoilt it somewhat for us \u2013 and the other families with sweet young children, or other couples \u2013 who wanted a bit of calm! But if you get civilized other guests it is wonderful!! Normally, we do not eat in a hotel restaurant on holiday, but my partner was unwell one evening \u2013 so I ate there. The food was spectacularly good!! It\u2019s Japanese style, but cooked to perfection and really very good value. The drinks/cocktail menu is excellent too (although a little expensive). I really do recommend trying it out \u2013 I had the steak and it was delicious!! All of the staff you encounter \u2013 be it on reception, the maid service, the wonderfully helpful concierge, the restaurant/bar staff \u2013 are all smiling, attentive and helpful. We did not have a single issue and were treated like kings and queens! They were helpful with both enquiries about the hotel and about Singapore itself and made our stay very pleasant. Only one little tiny thing which makes it a 4 star rather than a 5 is that it is quite a way from the MRT station. We are young and active, so thought the 15 minute walk would not worry us \u2013 but Singapore is VERY hot and humid so it does take it out of you a little bit and feels a lot longer than it is! It\u2019s a pleasant, nice walk \u2013 but just a bit far (especially at the end of a long day sightseeing!) Also, when we were there, there were loads of events on at Clarke Quay for the Mid Autumn Festival and the Grand Prix \u2013 so it was crazy busy trying to get through the crowds every night (took over 30 minutes from the MRT station!) Also 95% of taxi drivers do not know this hotel!!! We were taken to the Hotel M across town on several occasions \u2013 even when we gave them the street address!! The only way you can get them to take you to the right place \u2013 is to ask for the Gallery Hotel next door and point on a map. However, taxi\u2019s are very reasonable \u2013 and it only costs $20 from the airport to the hotel. Definitely give this hotel a try \u2013 you will get a contemporary, funky, relaxed hotel \u2013 at very reasonable rates.

The only negative I have to comment on is the evening I arrived hotel staff seemed very thin on the ground. There was no-one in the lobby to help with my heavy suitcase and bags, then later when I wanted some concierge advice about local restaurants the desk was empty. However at all other times during my stay there were adequate and attentive staff. I thought the rooms were cleverly designed with plenty of storage space and drawers, cupboards etc. The mezzanine level provided plenty of extra space and comfy seating / desk but as a lone guest I did not need to use it. I liked the style & decor a lot. The bed was really comfy too. I used the pool everyday and thought the pool side area looked cool, the pool was not too busy either and very clean. I did not eat here but had a very good cocktail in the outdoor bar one evening. Free wifi was very welcome after prior stays in other hotels who charge hefty daily rates.

Service in general was more or less non existent. When we arrived 5 people from staff stood at the counter and no one even cared to help bringing in our luggage. Through the whole stay no one ever was of help, greeted or even looked up from their computers at the counter when we entered or left the building. All together you got the impression, that the staff really doesn't care about their customers or who is going in or out of the building. They rather prefer watching videos on Youku on their iMacs. Luckily the elevators are secured by your key card. Otherwise I would have even been concerned about my valuables in my room. Best part was, that on our third day the fire alarm went off. Through a speaker we were advised to stay calm in our room until the situation has been investigated. After at least half an hour and no further information, we decided to get our most important stuff and exited the building using the fire escape. When we came out, all the staff was standing outside of the Hotel, smoking and chatting and again no one even noticed us. So we went to the front desk and asked about the situation. There we were told, that all of this was just a fire drill which should be over soon. When we asked why they didn't inform us, they just said that we should have gotten a circular the day before. Sadly the maids simply forgot to clean our room the day before, and even when we complained about that, no one thought of telling us about the drill. We didn't even get an excuse from the guy at the front desk, that this has happened. All in all you feel treated like in a youth hostel. Actually I even stayed in youth hostels with better service.... None of the Staff seems to feel responsible for anything there. Regarding the rooms. The design and layout is nice but impracitcal. You don't even have enough space for storing your luggage in the room. The rooms themselves are tiny and at best good for one person. They really are way smaller than it seems on the pictures. Although this Hotel is only open for a few months, it already shows first signs of beeing run down. I won't stay in that hotel a second time and I wouldn't recommend it to anybody.

After receiving the keys to my room, upon stepping out of the lift, I was greeted with a narrow passage with clear glass views of the surrounding and the hotel swimming pool on level 6. It's simply amazing. Once i opened the door to my room, it was as imagined, a SOHO type of studio apartment with a mini pantry corner, a business desk and small bench with open concept closet. The room is a split level designed concept with brilliant contrast of colours. The bed is located on the second floor. Not a big room in fact, but cosy enough for a relaxing stay. The bed is VERY Comfortable. Definitely one of the best beds I have slept. So soft and fluffy. My sleep quality was amazing! The bed and pillows are comparable to another boutique hotel I stayed in New Zealand, Hotel SO. Can't say much for the customer service as I only stayed one night. The hotel is brand new with good facilities.", "Date": "July 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cDon't stay at this hotel\u201d", "Author": "Lesleywakeling", "ReviewID": "UR70260568", "Content": "We arrived at approx 4.00 p.m. We had a long wait for check in, desk staff not adequately trained, took forever. There were 5 in our group. We had booked a superior room and a studio loft. Were allocated two studio loft rooms despite paying for a superior room, when staff were alerted of this after some discussion, we were allocated a \"superior room\" (no different to studio loft except for the bed configuration). The superior room was booked for 3 adults, there was no second bed made up, no provision for towels etc for 3. Had to ask front desk several times to make up divan and arrange for additional towels to be provided. This was done after some time. However, the cleaning staff never left 3 towels after cleaning, it took several days for that to sink in, BUT we were never left 3 teabags or coffee sachets. We had to leave a note for the cleaning staff to remind them that there were 3 occupants of the room, we did finally get the right number of towels, however not tea or coffee. One day we even got a towel that had a big hole in it and a tear. The rooms are not hoovered every day, we had the same crumbs in the same location on the floor for 3 days running, The rooms are small, not suitable for any more than 2 persons and not large ones!!. The shower and toilet are really small, once the divan bed is made out, there is no room downstairs for any type of movement, do not take large suitcases, no sufficient room for those! We had to leave a deposit of $200.00 per person, we were not advised of this at time of booking. The service of the front desk is not good, more training needs to be given especially on PR issues. Key card did not work on several occasions, had trouble getting it re-programmed, the desk staff blamed a mobile phone for the card not working, however the guest did not have a mobile phone. It had to be re-set 4 times during a 10 night stay. Shuttle Coach driver pleasant and helpful, staff who arranged taxi's etc also pleasant and helpful as were the porters. It would seem that the front desk is where most of the issues lay. Definitely more training or new staff that are competent We asked about booking tours, the front desk were unable to help, there is no tours that can be booked from that hotel, they have no information on any of the attractions available in Singapore, no information on tour operators either. No promotion of Singapore at all. Overall a bad experience that I will not repeat, next time I will book another hotel that caters for all my needs such as tours, friendly and efficient staff and more room to move in.

Where would the baby sleep if one is not available? Lots of people have complained about the size of the toilet and shower room. The toilet was the perfect size for what we had to do in there and it was nice to have a wet room rather than a shower. There is a bench in the shower which is good as I could sit the baby on my knee to wash her and not worry about her slipping. There are definately a few teething issues for the hote which I am sure will be sorted out in the coming months, mainly to do with house keeping, not the cleaning which we could not fault but things like leaving us with no toilet roll and forgetting to replace tea and coffee.

Room is very small, once you walk in you will see the bed. Not more than 10 steps to the bed. Toilet and shower stall is also restrictive and tiny, not for European or US travellers.

Only 3 pathetic bottles of shower gel, shampoo and conditioner, nothing in the minibar fridge & washing sink is outside from the toilet and shower stall, nowhere to hang the towel in the shower stall. There were dust on the round lamp. The study area can double up as an extra sleeping area when you pull the sofa out to form a rather awkward bed. This would make an ideal bedroom for a single, but not so ideal for a hotel room for more than 2 persons. More suitable for the typical single business traveller who does not need much space. Pool area is nice, but pool is very small and easily overcrowded. plenty of deck chairs for people to sun bath and people watching. 1.2m in depth and 25m in length. There were more people talking about how nice the Gallery Hotel's pool than actually using the hotel's pool because it is so small. Breakfast was also a letdown Service was extremely disappointing.

Well, everything good pretty much ended there. When we opened the door, we were greeted by an overwhelming whiff of STRONG STALE SMOKE smell (despite it being a non-smoking hotel and the cleaner told us she just tidied up the room for us), we called the reception to alert them of this anomaly and they finally sent someone up to check on it. The service staff himself claimed to be a smoker and was shocked by how strong the smell was - well, that makes 3 of us. He switched on the air purifier machine and told us this wasn't good for our bodies (over-ionises/purifies the body it seems) so we should get out for a while. We did. When we got back after an hour, expecting the room to be CLEAN, NICE-SMELLING and COLD (since we left the a/c on), the smell was gone no doubt (in a sterilised industrial cleaner way) but the room was HOT (29.5 degrees celsius to be specific). The a/c was spoilt. Anyway to cut a long story short - it took them 5 visits to the room (technician and whatnots) asking us to \"wait for the air to circulate\" for 45mins to an hour at a shot. After the 3rd try, we were incredibly frustrated (and waiting to go out for dinner) thus we requested for a room switch. Asliza (?) the receptionist told us firmly that there were no more rooms available (hotel was fully booked), said theres nothing they could do (with NO inkling of apology AT ALL) and requested for us to wait till the technician arrived (he eventually did at 9pm - how ridiculous is that?? It was a sauna for the entire day). So we left him to fix it, stepped out for dinner, came back at about 11+pm and THE BLOODY A/C WAS STILL NOT WORKING. Called the front desk (they changed shift - thank GOD) and after the technician conceded defeat at 12 MIDNIGHT - we finally got a room change (yes, in that fully booked hotel room). This was something they could have done A LONG WHILE AGO instead of forcing us to spend the entire day in a sauna or asking us to \"step out for a while while the a/c resumes\" (for 4 times) - WHO BOOKS A HOTEL ROOM TO SPEND THE ENTIRE DAY OUT??? We finally got a half decent room post 12midnight - HOW TERRIBLE IS THAT? And I haven't even started on the lack of amenities, how SMALL the bathroom and toilet is (yes, separated - smaller than one normal cubicle each). The last straw that broke the camel's back was the INSANELY LONG checkout queue at 12pm. We took about an hour to get to the front of the queue. It was THAT slow. Thanks to unprepared staff (only 2 at the front desk, both serving only 1 customer at one time). And the horrible attitude Asliza (?) showed when she realised we got a room change thanks to her understanding colleague. It probably caused her 5 seconds of inconvenience in checking out and she showed it - by tsking and slamming papers down on the table. Not obvious but we were most certain not oblivious. Parking was another pain. They had a pathetic number of parking lots for the number of patrons (<20 for hundreds of patrons?? They could have planned better.). They advised us to park across the street and told us it was only 2bucks. Turned out it was yes, 2bucks for 7pm-12midnight. And 2bucks for every hour from 12midnight to 6am. So we paid an additional 16bucks. NO attempts to reimburse us for our inconvenience. DISAPPOINTING. Never going back there again.

Simple , a rather bad hotel experience for the family , we would NOT come back and would NOT recommed it for anyone .", "Date": "April 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "bali", "Title": "\u201ctiny and cramped with not much service....\u201d", "Author": "kodyandko", "ReviewID": "UR62461657", "Content": "We stayed at Studio M hotel whilst in singapore celebrating a friends birthday and ended up checking out after 2 nights.... Whilst i can appreciate the uniqueness and the concept, etc, i think the rooms are more like cabins on a sleeper train than a comfortable hotel room. Everthing is packed in tight, so much so that i just couldnt get comfortable in my room..... ohhh yes the bed is comfortable, but dont get up too fast in the middle of the night as you will probably bang your head on the low roof... and make sure you turn the lights on before you make your way downstairs to the bathroom ... as one wrong step (which is possible after one too many singapore slings) you will fall face first down steep skinny staircase...... There was nothing luxurious or comfortable about my room...........whist the entrance is alive and has a fun vibe... the room i stayed in was dull, boring and bland. I appreciate that i was there (even though i was not told this when booking) during their soft opening stage... but the service was slow and in most cases i was given the answer no to most things i requested for , ie. i asked for an adaptor.... couldnt get one.... i asked for champagne glasses.... was told no we dont have them.... it wasnt untill i insisted they send someone over to their sister property 10 minutes down the road that they agreed they could provide me with champagne glasses. Wish i could comment on the restaurant, gym, cafe etc, that they tout on the website... sadly all closed when we visited..... sorry to say the service was average and we checked out 2 nights into our 4 night stay - went to a trusty bigger chain where i knew i could get champagne glasses if i asked for them. wish studio m much luck .... but they have a long long long way to go ps. if your thinking of taking your partner to studio m for a romantic weekend.... think again... its about as romantic as a concrete paver.", "Date": "April 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubai, United Arab Emirates", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel in good location\u201d", "Author": "M111111", "ReviewID": "UR62177679", "Content": "A nice new hotel in a great spot.

We paid extra for the premiere suite which, apparently fits 4 people but practically, doesn't fit more than 2. The sofa, which opens to a single bed, doesn't cone with sheets or a blanket. When we asked for some, the concierge said it doesn't come with the room. My mom protested and eventually a maid came with a sheet and a pillow. Once again we asked for a blanket and pillows and she said she had to check since the room doesn't come with them. Someone finally brought us a blanket and being that we were three in the room, it took 4 attempts to get a third towel delivered. Our second night we asked for a sheet and another blanket but they ended up bringing us 6 pillow cases instead. The pool to the hotel hasn't opened yet but it seems they were testing it's soundsydtem at 7am this morning. We were on the 6th floor and it was blaring in our room. The whole experience wasn't very nice. I think they have a few growing pains to get through before I'd reccommend it. Ps. They have a sister hotel call Hotel M on Anson road- not to be confused with this one... Studio M on Nanson road.

Interesting room concept as described by previous reviewers. At first I was unsure about a number of features / lack of storage etc but a quick exploration revealed an adequate amount of storage for clothes and a sliding door to which sealed off the bathroom / shower area from the rest of the open plan room. My only issue was the need to be very careful coming down the stairs from the bed -esp if you have enjoyed some wine! The hotel is located in the Robertson quay area - a very short walk from Clarke quay which is great for clubs, bars & restaurants, but there are numerous cafes, bars and restaurants beside the hotel which are great value for money. Free wi-fi but seems to be capped at a low bandwidth rate (100kps). Breakfast was good but the coffee machine was a bit of a nuisance. Most of the staff we met were very helpful and friendly. We did encounter a few small problems but to be expected with the newly opened status of the hotel. I would really like to get back again once the bar and pool are open - would definitely recommend to anyone planning a leisure visit to Singapore.", "Date": "March 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Shanghai, China", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyed this New Hotel\u201d", "Author": "crotats", "ReviewID": "UR59701199", "Content": "This Hotel just opened a few days before I arrived, so price was extremely attractive.
