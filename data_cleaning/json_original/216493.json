It was the cheapest place in Kissimmee and we have mixed feelings about the place. Check in was absolutely perfect and the guest clerk answered all questions that we had. They gave us a pamphlet and accommodated us since we were handicap. Parking was an issue up front since the restaurant Angels was up front so beware if you have a front room. Once we walked into the room, it looked like a standard hotel room with an apartment fridge and a microwave. They did supply us with 4 pillows, 4 towels, 4 washcloths, one bar of soap and a roll of toilet paper. When we went to the front desk for a trash bag and another roll of toilet paper, we were told it was not part of the short stay policy. We did have to dump our own trash daily and no room service was given the three nights we stayed. The room was clean and we did have cable and free wireless internet. it was quiet and not too many complaints. We just wanted to make sure that if you decided to stay here, bring your own supplies because with three people in the room it does run out. Bring plenty of quarters if you want to wash your towels daily too!! Overall we were ok with the room since most of the time we were in the parks.

Things that bugged me: No alarm clock. Only one layer of curtains, so our room could either be dark, or else people could see right in; nothing translucent. Big electric sign out front advertises $49/night, desk clerk claims they don't offer that rate any longer (but for a five day stay, the weekly rate was cheaper than that anyway). Had to get our keys redone twice, probably a computer issue. Unlike other reviewers, they did not give us a hassle for asking for a new roll of toilet paper, nor did we see or hear any altercations or police visits.

They didn't even have a coffee maker in the room. When I asked about it they told me that they regard this type of a room as a suite. To me a suite has a bedroom, kitchen, and living room. After we checked in we found out that they only offer housekeeping once a week and it is light housekeeping at that. We asked for our sheets to be changed and the maid gave us sheets, but she told us that we had to put them on ourselves. All she did was provide clean towels and sheets and then she left. She didn't even vacuum the floor or clean the bathroom. She didn't even take out the trash. She told us that was our responsibility. No wonder the place was so dirty when we arrived. While we were there we saw two cockroaches. Further, there was no hot water, so we had to take cold showers. The heat malfunctioned on our second day there, but they did send someone to fix it and they had it working within an hour after we called. At least they did something right.

We were not informed that we would be required to supply our own toilet paper and garbage bags. We only got 5 towels, and 3 wash cloths which we had to wash in their machines which we paid them to wash their towels!!!! I reserved a first floor room with a sofa sleeper and poolside. I arrive after being on a plane all day only to find out that its a first come first serve basis. they already took my payment (in advance) 3 weeks before. To me, that would imply FIRST come first serve!! The bed spreads had cigaratte burns in the along with the sheet on the sofa sleeper which was broken by the way. The guest is required to strip our own beds and put the sheets in the tub if we wanted them changed. I worked in a hotel as a maid for years and this is the first time I've ever heard of such a thing. Its the hotel and the maid's job to strip the bed and change the sheets NOT the guest!!! Your pamphlet that they gave me upon arrival states that there was a bath mat supplied. I come to the office only to find out that's not the case and they don't even have them! Yet another deception. They stated their rooms are deep cleaned after every guest thus the reason I have to pay 35.00 upon check out. We got out of our already dirty shower (which was deep cleaned before we moved in right?) only to have our feet get dirty for the deep cleaned carpet!!! Not to mention that there were flea's in the room. One of my daughters had so many flea bites on her it was pathetic and I pulled a flea off my foot while sitting on the bed!!! The wall's had cracks in them, some of the HUGE ones like in our room, mold in the broken molding behind the bathroom door. I'm informed by staff upon arrival that the problem with taking reservations over the phone is that you dont have time to inform the guest that they will have to supply their own toiletries and to be specific about what those are. Toilet paper and garbage bags would have never crossed my mind since that would be the hotels responsibility. They treated their temporary guests like permanant one's and to me, that's unacceptable. I will never stay in this hotel again or ever recommend it to anyone. In my opinion, the health department should shut them down based on the condition of the rooms, pools and grounds. The pools were so dirty that my teenagers wouldn't swim in them! And just so everyone understands, my kids are fish, they love to swim and would be in the water all day long if they could!!!

This place is the worst place that you can possiable stay in the orlando area. If you are on vaction, do not even think about it, you will not save any money. If you are in transit, keep going down 192, there are several place's that are 100 times better for the same money. I had to move out of the cottage I was renting for the last three years and I went here because of the cost and the discount I got for being a Disney Cast Member. Little did I know this place is run by slum loards. I am not lying. When you arrive and go into check in you are greeted by bulit proof glass. There are two of Home Suite Homes in the area and they both have this glass, the only hotels in the area that uses this. (should be your first red flag) The staff are extrelly rude and unprofessional. They are very dirty and shady. I was in a bnd so I thought I would suck it up and give it a try. The grounds are filthy as well as they laundry room. I had a room with a king bed and it was not kept up at all. The shower head was broken and remained that way till after I left. The bathtub had peeling paint and was un kept. To give you an idea of the type of service I recived. During my stay my TV went out and I called the front desk multiple times and they said they would send some one up. This was at 1:00pm. No one ever showed. A day latter at 11:30pm while I was sleeping there was a knock at the door and it was two very unkept guys that clamed they were with maint. Against my better judgement I let them take a look. They smelled to high heven of alcohol and cig smoke. The looked at the TV and everything else in my room and said they would call the problem in. Long story short it took three days to get a replacmen TV and they refused to give me any type of credit. On my second night I arrive home at 2:30am after I got off work to be greeted by not one, two or even three but 9 police cars and a polie helicoptor above. The next day I talke with a orange county officer and found out they are called to this hotel on a nightl basis. No matter what time you arrive you are greeted by people lotering outside there rooms drinking beer and smoking. Oh, BTW, this is against there rules. People have parties out side there rooms and when you call security to assist, they are actully friends with every one so they join them. If oyu do not beleave me take a drive bu around midnight and see for youself. It is very scarry. The staff is there for one reason, to take and hold on to your money. They charge a $100 deposit if you pay cash and they hold on to it for over two weeks to collect the intrest. Oh the house keeping is a joke! They come once every two weeks and your lucky if they clean the toliet and vacume. The staff again is extremely unprofessional and they do not care about your stay or your safety. When you go to they with a problem they blow you off and ignore you. This place is really for the homeless as its run by slum lords and should not be used for vacation at all. DO NOT be fooled by the cheep price. Go accross the street to Knights Inn or even Motel 6. They have the same so called amminites. Or go further down 192 and there are multiple places that you can stay at for extened stays. Oh if you must stay here, DO NOT use you credit card! Pay Cash. I am not accusing anyone but I had some one gethold of my debit card number and make a bunch of charges. I can not prove anything but I have heard that I am not the only one that it has happen too.

Friends of theirs had stayed there years ago and said it was a great place and great rates. We looked it up on the internet and looked at pictures and said, well, looks a bit out dated but looks okay other than that, so we reserved this for two weeks. When we got there, it was a different story. By the time our plane landed, and we got our car rental, and got to the motel, it was around midnight, the doors were all locked up, there was no one around, we had to use the outdoor phone to call the motel manager to come and give us our keys; we had booked two different rooms which were supposed to be side by side. Our rooms ended up being wayyyy at the other end of the motel wayyyy in the back, which was veryyyy skechy and dark. We walked up the creepy, dark, dirty stairway, and the locals that stayed there year round were leaning over the balconies staring at us, and asking us what rooms we were in. Did not like the sounds of that at all, but they knew right away which rooms we were staying in as they followed us down the hallway. Once in our rooms, we locked our doors and pulled the curtains across as fast as we could. Looked around, the place was disgustingly dirty, smelly, moldy and just plain gross. The carpets were dirty and disgusting and stained, everything you touched, like the lamps, the t.v, the night stand tables, whatever you touched was sticky, not even washed or cleaned ever, the bathroom was old as the hills, it reminded me as well of right out of a horror movie, like someone was watching me from a hole in the wall or something, none of us showered, used the facilities, nothing.. we just climbed on top of the bed, didn't dare get in the sheets, but we were tired, by this time it was around 1am, so we just got on top of the bed and slept like that. I slept with one eye open the whole night, got no sleep. The other couple that came with us, they had a young child with them as well with severe asthma, she couldn't handle the smell in the room nor the mold growing everywhere, she awoke the next morning with a big rash down both of her legs. They had also awoke in the middle of the night because of some big scuffling and fighting right outside their door. Needless to say, we woke up as early as possible, headed down to the front desk, and told them the accomodations were not very accommodating, the carpets were dirty and there was mold everywhere. The hotel was not going to give us our money back as we had booked for two weeks, but we were not giving up. We asked to speak to the manager, they said the manager wasn't in until whatever time, so we hung around until the manager came in. They gave in and gave us full credit and we got the heck out of there. As we were leaving, the sheriff was pulling in and patrolling around the building. We were never soo glad to be out of there in all our lives. We did not feel safe, there was no security that we could see, the place was dirty, dark and full of bugs, and cockroaches and whatever else we couldn't see, we will never step foot near that place again.

To save the big bucks, we had no problem buying our own soap and t.p., we were just interested in a clean place to shower and sleep while we did Disney for a week. Given all of this, at the current rate of deterioration, (and we have stayed at this hotel many times in the past 7-8 years when it was a Holiday Inn) we probably won't book here a year from now unless we find out they have made some updates to the rooms. It is \"ok\" now, but it is going to need some updating (carpet/furnishings/ paint/upkeep) before I would stay a year from now.", "Date": "July 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sault Ste.

No it's not fancy but it's clean and the people are nice. we stayed 4 nights and it was spring break week too. The hotel wasn't extremely busy. we reserved the kids suite which was suppossed to have 2 sets of bunk beds and a gamecube which is why we got it. I traveled with 3 kids and myself and my mother. we paid $90 per night and when we got to the hotel it had one set of bunk beds and a single bed in the kids part. the kids beds are VERY small so if your child is over 9 or 10 I don't recommend it. We mostly got the room for the gamecube entertainment for the kids. well every room has a gamecube built into the tv but they don't tell you until you ask that it's $7 an hour to play!! I thought paying extra for the kids room would include it but no it doesn't. we called the desk and switched to a cheaper 2 full size bed room. The rooms are nice and clean and they all come with a microwave and fridge which is GREAT with kids. The bathrooms are the smallest Ive ever seen but they aren't to bad if you open the door after you take a shower and get dressed in the doorway. we took showers when the kids were sleeping so it wasn't to bad. The pools are nice there are a lot of pools. they weren't crowded. only the hottub was busy of course with spring break. The kids loved it. the restaurant at the hotel called angels was nasty. not worth the high price at all. we had the breakfast buffet and it just wasn't very good. the ihop down the street was actually the best place we ate at. stay away from ponderosa that was horrible and I wouldn't recommend that to anyone. the pizza hutt in the phone book is cheaper than the hotels and they deliver too. the hotel staff was very friendly. there is a car rental place in the hotel that we used and I don't recommend that unless you're desperate and cant get another one. the man in there is rude and tries to rip you off. he claimed the gas was at half a tank when I picked it up which it was certainly not. it was at a fourth and I couldn't believe they left it so low. He tried to charge me ten bucks for that until I gripped. I left the gas higher than it was when I got it too. Overall I would recommend this hotel. the price at about 60 per night for the 2 beds in a room. wasn't bad for what you get. It is a clean hotel and no bugs or anything. that's all that mattered to me. the kids had lots of fun.

My last count puts it at (22 hotels). Most of them after I was out from under my parents wings. Some of them were just okay and some are still my all time favorites. With the advent of the Disney\u2019s Value and Moderate Resorts (was that the 1990\u2019s?) it was obvious that Disney was trying to capitalize on the Resort/hotel/Motel market. Personally I prefer to stay on the grounds, but barring winning the lottery there are limits. Currently our favorite off-site resort/hotel (old conventional doctrine would call it a motel \u2013 but we\u2019ll refer to it as: resort) is the Hilton Nikki Bird Resort. It\u2019s the closest off-site resort from the Southern entrance than any other. In fact (only because some weird folks would take the time to find out) it\u2019s just as quick to get to the Magic Kingdom (MK) main entrance (by car) from the Nikki Bird Resort as it does from the \u201cLove Bug\u201d building at the All Stars Movies Resort. The Nikki Bird was the first to introduce us to the \u201cKid Suite\u201d room. The first photo posted is of our first stay in Jan of 2002. The rate was a little less than the All-Star-Disney (the AAA discount helped), but because we knew it\u2019s location and because we were on a budget and the Nikki Bird Resort includes a small refrigerator and microwave and gave it a whirl. The second trip in Oct05 the AAA rate was $45/night, Friday and Saturday was $54/night. We enjoyed our first stay and our kids loved it. Our second stay this past October of 05 was similar. We happened to arrive in anticipation of Hurricane Wilma and where present during her passing (Eye-wall passed 25miles south of us). The Room was clean (on both visits). The cleaning staff was attentive and personable. Most of our interaction with the resort was directly through the cleaning staff. The restaurant is designed around the buffet but you can order off a menu. The buffet is adequate for breakfast. Lunch we haven\u2019t attended. The Lobster Dinner we had once but the price to quality ratio was too high to warrant a repeat. The bar staff is good and I had a few evenings relaxing there after the children were asleep. The swimming pools are above average. They are heated, numerous and well maintained. From what I can remember, there are 3 main pools, 3 whirlpools and 2 wading pools. Our family swum in all 3 main pools, the wading pools and 1 one of the whirl pools. All of them were warm and clean. There were no life guards and only a few times we wished the parents of the some of the children present would have been there to take corrective action. The first time we stayed in Jan of 2002 it was off season. The second, med season, was Oct of 05 (Hurricane Wilma). Because of the weather most of the people were staying because they were heading north or moving inland. The service staff didn\u2019t seem overwhelmed either time. Only during peak seasons have I\u2019ve noticed the service staff anywhere in need of their own vacation. Go figure. Ever been on a Spring break looking for a quite beach? It took a few adventures beyond the hedgerows and some friends in the business for me to understand. Tip the maids! Leave a note addressed to the staff with cash (a couple of bucks is all it takes, sometimes more) thank them for their service. If they go unnoticed and you never had need to call upon them, it means they\u2019ve done their job better than most of us have done our own. These folks have access to whatever you leave in your room and can make or break your stay. You trust a waiter with your food and credit card. You confide in your bartender and sometime require their discrete advice. You trust in your driver to deliver you at the appointed place at the appointed time. All these people provide necessary and important services. When you return to your room, over tired, worn, weary yet happy because you were served well while you dinned, you took the advice of the bartender and your driver got you to where you needed to be. What then of the tip you only leave in advance. You might find only a clean room, maybe a thank you card. You might find your covers turned down, you might have an extra regular coffee packet, your children might find their stuffed animals arranged for a tea party, something pleasant, unexpected. Your stay may be worth the trip and you might have something to write home about or better yet, to smile about when you remember. I venture to say the price rendered in the service industry can easily exceed any investment in a greater proportion than any other. It doesn\u2019t matter where you stay; it only matters on the last person to have access to your day. Our favorite Disney Resorts are: Wife\u2019s choice: Polynesian Resort: Relaxing/Pools. Dad\u2019s choice: Contemporary; Location/The best bar: Outer Rim \u2013 say Hi to Bruce, She\u2019s the best! The pre-seating service at the California Grill needs work.

No decent bar at this hotel, just an overly bright bit of the quite awful \"angels\" restaurant. Didn't have dinner but breakfast wasn't great value for the money, was cold, with poor quality ingredients. Staff on reception weren't particularly welcoming.

However, there are many reasons why I would not stay again. We had a room that had a seperate section for our son. It was an enclosed, three (very small-short) bunk beds area. The beds did not even have a bottom sheet on the bed. I didn't really notice until I woke my son up in the morning. He didn't say anything that night because he is young and was excited about the Game Cube in his area. I thought maybe housekeeping overlooked it, but that day when housekeeping came in they just made the bed back up like it was. Also, every morning housekeeping would bang on our door at 8:30 wanting to come in and clean the room. I tried saying loudly \"we're sleeping\" but, she just kept pounding until I got up and answered the door; thank god I wasn't showering! The toilet had a hard time flushing because of the water pressure, but once it flushed it would run until you jiggled the handle. The shower turns hot and cold when the surrounding rooms are using water also. The Game Cube is set to charge $7.50 an hour so make sure your kids know how long they've been playing. Also, we made a toll free number call and the hotel charged us an $8.00 phone fee and to call locally to Arabian Knights (5 minute drive) cost us $1.50 each time. This hotel ran about $115.00 each night. We went on a Disney Cruise and then stayed here for 2 nights. On the way to the cruise we stayed at the Howard Johnson Enchanted (about ten minutes down the street from this hotel). We were just sleeping the night so we got a cheap hotel, $54.00 per night, but we got what we expected. The Hojo was AS NICE AS the Holiday Inn NikKi Bird and it cost half as much!! Just FYI...Arabian Knight's had horrible food. It was so bad that the guy next to me sent his back and asked for a plate full of only mashed potatoes. My prime rib tasted like dog food. It is \"all you can drink\" wine or beer, but it's a very cheap wine and busch beer. It cost about $47.00 per person and that does not include tip. The show was alright. Mostly horses running around in circles, but my 7 yr old seem to enjoy it. However, after the show he said \"I can't believe we paid that much to see that.\" I know I sound like everything was bad, but this is actually the first review I've ever written. I told my husband that if I had read a review about this place and the show...that I wouldn't have wasted my money.

This was our first time in America and didnt know quite what to expect. After a 10 hour flight with MyTravel (the longest flight weve ever been on) we arrived at Orlando-Sanford Airport at 5.30pm and we were in a tropical storm (the rain and the thunder is much more powerful here than at home) Also because the luggage belt area was so busy and crowded we got delayed getting our luggage and so missed our coach transfer to the Nikki Bird which panicked us a bit, anyway the friendly staff and the Airtours reps arranged for us and other holiday makers who had missed their coach to travel on another coach to get to our hotel. We arrived at Nikki Bird and first impressions were good-it looked clean and welcoming. The check-in procedure took about 10 minutes and just after we had checked in (being very tired-we had been awake for nearly a day) we were shocked to hear loud sirens with flashing lights with people running around. (this turned out to be a fire alarm test) We just stood at reception/the lobby with our 4 suitcases wondering what the hell we had come to, but...We got to our room and found everything to be clean and of an average standard. The only problem with the room was that we couldnt really use the draws to put our clothes in because they were damp and smelly and so had to leave our clothes in the suitcases for the 2 week stay. The pool shaped as Mickey Mouse was excellent and it was heated which was very nice and you could use the pools in the evening too, the other 2 pools looked nice but we never used them as our room was nearer to the Mickey pool. The Diner and breakfast buffet was good and reasonably priced. There was also a small gift shop on site. We used the Pizza Hut quite often and the food was always very tasty. The kids enjoyed the outdoor playground. We didnt find the Nikki Bird rooms to be old or dated we just found them different as we were used to apartments in Spain, Turkey and Cyprus, we actualy found the rooms nice it wasnt dirty at all, anyway we werent going to be spending a lot of time in the room-it was just somewhere to sleep and get changed,(After all you dont go to Orlando to sit in your room all day do you?) The hotel was in an excellent location just 5mins away from Disney (probably about 10mins away if you use the shuttle bus) The shuttle bus was always on time but got over crowded and therfore was slower. Seaworld and Universal are about 15-25mins away. The hotel was within easy walking distance to shops, restaurants, fast food outlets, bars and nightlife. I would give the location a 10 out of 10, brilliant!. The Holiday Inn Nikki Bird has lovely surroundings. The staff were great and most were VERY friendly. You get value for money. The broucher says its a 3* and I would agree. Its not 5* luxury but it is a wonderful place to stay and when we eventuly go back to sunny Florida we will certainly go back to the Nikki Bird. Its a great place for a family to stay. The Airtours holiday reps were helpful and were there if we needed them.

We had to throw everything away...even though nothing was left open the ants found their way in anyway. It was really hard to sleep knowing that insects were crawling everywhere.

The computers had been down until 3pm that day so as you can imagine the atmosphere at the check in desk was rather tense. No need to have worried, after a few false starts Brian del Toro and his team pulled off a marvelous job and got our room etc sorted, along with complimentary vouchers for Angels Diner....excellent food & service. All in all a wonderful 14 night stay and I would recommend this hotel without hesitation.

The rooms we booked werent available when we arrived so we were immediatly upgraded to a kids suite which pleased the children. They were impresed by the pools and being able to play in them when it was dark.Also the bubbly hot one were mummy can put her feet (description of a hot tub by a 6 year old).The rooms were clean service second to none. The diner was superb and the food excellent also the price was excellent. If you go watch out for pops my 6 yearold thinks he is in love with her. There is also a regular courtesy bus service to WDW four times in a am and the same at night. so no need to hire a car. All in all a thourghly enjoyable stay in fact so much so we are now busy saving up to go again soon", "Date": "August 11, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indiana", "Title": "\u201cVery Nice Hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2427119", "Content": "Just got back from a week long stay at the Nikki Bird. Really sweated it out after reading such negative reviews. We rented 8 rooms for our group and not one complaint. The hotel is nice and clean and the rooms were more than adequate. The staff was very friendly from top to bottom. The kids loved all of the pools and the arcade. Laundry facilities were wonderful. Great location for Disney. About 20 minutes to Universal. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. If you are looking for extravagant then stay somewhere else. If you are looking for pleasant, clean and comfortable..stay at the Nikki Bird.", "Date": "August 6, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "HomeSuiteHome Nikki Bird Main Gate", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g34352-d216493-Reviews-HomeSuiteHome_Nikki_Bird_Main_Gate-Kissimmee_Florida.html", "Price": "$75 - $110*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">7300 W.
