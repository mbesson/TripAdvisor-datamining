Nice restoration, helpful staff, a big (fake) fire to keep you warm in the Seattle chill and lots of comfy grouped furniture for chatting in the lobby, fast and free wifi throughout. Our room was big, with a chaise lounge in the bay window, a bathtub, a designer desk/chair, king sized bed and lots of TV channels. The windows opened, which I always think is nice, and tea and pods for the coffee maker got replaced every day. The only thing we were missing was a fridge. The great thing about staying here is that it's a block from University Ave, where you'll find lots of indi cafes, restaurants ranging from vegan pizza to spicy ramen and an eclectic mix of stores (vintage clothing, books, sports etc) catering to the university population. Lots of cheap eats and great coffee. It's also a short walk to an arthouse cinema, a mainstream cinema and a massive art supply shop. We also made good use of the cab rank, right outside, and the Tulley's Coffee and District Bar, right inside. The upgrading looks to be ongoing... the hallways outside the rooms have seen better days... but otherwise this is a great hotel in a great location in Seattle.", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Burnaby B.C.", "Title": "\u201cForm over Function\u201d", "Author": "DocHoliday62", "ReviewID": "UR126781949", "Content": "We stayed two nights here because we were attending an event at the University of Washington. Our first choice, the Silver Cloud Inn-University District, was fully booked. The place is nicely decorated, and the beds are comfortable. However, amenities like a fridge and a coffee maker (standard even in budget hotels) are lacking here. During our stay, this facility demonstrated a number of peculiar (and irritating) inconsistencies. An iron and ironing board were provided, for instance, in a large closet, but it had no light. So it was necessary to grope to find it or to hang or retrieve clothes. Further, that was the ONLY place to store clothing because there were no dressers. Although they offer WiFi, and it was easy to access, there was only one chair at a glass table filling in for a desk. Unfortunately, a mouse doesn't function on such surfaces. The bathroom had lovely deco fixtures and hardware, but the stopper in the basin didn't work. A narrow, sloping shelf with a gap behind it couldn't accommodate toiletries for two (or one, for that matter, because they kept slipping off). Re: the rest of the hotel: the restaurant had a very limited menu with nothing we could eat (we're vegan). Consequently, we had to trek several blocks to find breakfast. And, while there are plenty of good restaurants in the area, it's nice not to have to search for one first thing in morning. (Again, a small refrigerator and microwave would have allowed us to eat in the room.) Style definitely trumps substance at the Deca. Important practical considerations have been ignored, and maintenance could also be improved. I like a pretty place as much as the next person, but not at the expense of functionality and convenience.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Camas, Washington", "Title": "\u201cAnother excellent stay\u201d", "Author": "Donna W", "ReviewID": "UR126693429", "Content": "We have stayed here multiple times per year since 2007 when our daughter started at UW.

Hotel Deca is decorated a lot more nicely than it was when I stayed there 20 years ago when it was named University Tower. The staff is to be commended for excellence. I wish all hotels had staff that good. The downside is that the rooms and the bathrooms are very small. We had a King with city view, which means the parking lot, mostly. The sound insulation between the rooms and the hallways is very poor. I would not suggest this for a family unless you prefer multiple rooms. Likewise, the rooms are a tight fit for a couple.

They were also very helpful in providing us suggestions for going out to places to eat and shop around town. It was very clean; I felt so good being there. Even the cleaning staff were friendly.

The staff was SO accommodating! I have never, ever had such a pleasant experience with hotel staff anywhere! Most special was the surprise gift basket that Tanya sent up to the room with a card wishing me luck on my interview at UW the following day, a box of chamomile tea (my favorite!!), a print out of interview tips, and some chocolate candies. They provide a complementary shuttle service anywhere within a 5 mile radius of the hotel. That service was excellent - very timely, clean, and with safe drivers. It was a pleasant surprise to have this service available, especially since it transported me to my interview in the rain - I don't know what I would've done if I had to walk! Also, I really enjoyed the fitness facility (the treadmill and tv were great; very clean; great to have water, towels, and clorox wipes) and wished I could've taken advantage of the passes to go to the outside gym, too...Next time! ;) I had an interview at UW until about 3:30pm and our flight wasn't until 10pm on the night of the day we checked out. Staff was so accommodating - they let us have a late check out, store our bags, access our bags when we accidentally forgot to unpack/pack something, and hang out in the lobby and have a light dinner while we waited for our (non-hotel) airport shuttle.

First, I called a week before explaining that my single occupancy had to be changed since I had a friend coming to stay with me. They immediately made the change for me with no additional fees. One of the main reasons I chose Hotel Deca was because of it's close proximity to the Neptune Theater. I had plans to see a concert there, and it's across the street. When we arrived, we met with Front Desk clerk Emily. She was friendly and personable, and made sure that we had a room with a great view of the city skyline. Later, we learned that they had a shuttle service, and another clerk suggested we eat at Ivar's Salmon House for dinner. He drove us there, and later picked us up. The dinner was delicious. The next day, we met with another clerk Ryan. He, also, was very helpful in providing suggestions on where to go. Our room was great! Clean, spacious, and comfortable. The only downside is that taxi service from the airport to the hotel ranges up to $50-60. Hotel Deca does have a car service which comes at a flat rate of $50. The car service was prompt, and the driver was very friendly. I do recommend that you call ahead of time to make arrangements for the service.

We made reservations for 4 (two adults, two children). We arrived in the late afternoon (so not too late, but not too early). We had a junior suite reserved which has a king bed and a pull out couch. The gentleman at the desk asked us if we wanted to have the pull out made up or if we could do it ourselves. We are easy going and said we could handle it. We went to our room. Changed and went to a wedding. We got back at about 11:30 at night. We went into the closet and found one pillow and a comforter. No sheets. Opening the bed we found the most lumpy, disgusting mattress. It was just plain gross. I went down and asked for sheets and something to cover the mattress. They sent it up promptly. We were only there for one night, so we didn't notice until the end, but there was only one wash cloth, two hand towels, and two bath towels. A couple other things - they give you ear plugs - something I've never seen in a hotel room. They must have known that we would be able to hear our neighbors - even their snoring. My guess is the walls are thin, not that we had particularly loud neighbors. On the plus side, they gave us free parking (we changed our reservations, so we were paying the maximum - not their fault - so I thought it was nice that he gave us the parking for free). They promptly resolved our problem as much as they could, but nothing could make up for that horrible mattress. The people who worked there were very nice. Three stars might be a bit harsh, but if you are traveling with children, I wanted you to know about the completely sub-standard bed.

The bathroom toilet, showerhead and sink were new, but were of a historic 1950s style. Quaint blue art-deco arm chair and odd long cylindrical art deco pillow on the bed.

The dead roses really should have been the signal to find accommodations elsewhere but I gave them the benefit of the doubt. Bad decision..... Getting off the freeway, the hotel looms tall, old and tired (it was probably nice in the 80's). The lobby, though very dark, gives one hope that the rooms will be equally as decent. Not even close. This is a rundown facility in need of major renovation. A flat screen TV does not make the place modern and upgraded. The carpets in the hallway and room are filthy. The room and bathroom are small. There was interesting patchwork done to the wallpaper in the bathroom. The bathroom ceiling and windowsill have lovely peeling paint. The towels are one step above threadbare. The smell is odd throughout. Quite musty. On the pro side: the bed is comfortable and sheets are soft. Just don't look too closely at the cloth headboard...anyone who is a bit of a clean freak and has a vivid imagination may lose some sleep wondering about what the stains are. If you have any electronic devices, good luck charging them. It takes an enormous talent and creativity. There are two outlets (lower than knee level) on either side of the room. They are so old that the chargers constantly fall out. Try the outlet in the bathroom - it is slightly better. One would think that there might be an outlet near the desk - not the case here. They boast free wifi. Service and reliability are spotty. You get what you pay for, right? Skip the \"restaurant\" in the basement if your frat/sorority days are well behind you.

We are frequent visitors to Seattle and looked forward to staying at the Hotel Deca as an alternative to big chain hotels downtown, especially since we really like the University District. But the Deca feels like a hotel run by people who thought it would be super fun to decorate a hotel...but don't actually know anything about running one. The service is nice but ineffectual: it took eons to get us checked in (albeit to an upgraded room...which we would have appreciated if we hadn't run out of patience before we got to it), the bell man never brought up our bags, and there was no way to get a drink or food at 10:30 on a Friday night! While the rooms are cute in a let's-be-clever-about-decorating-on-a-tight-budget sort of way (I can just hear someone saying, \"hey, we won't have to pay for closet doors if we hang nice fabric across the opening!\") they are actually not well laid-out (one of our beds was right next to the door to the room, the other beside the door to the bathroom; the TV is really too far from the bed to view comfortably). The hotel is also in very poor repair. The vending machine beside our room was so loud that it woke our kids up...but since nobody answered at the front desk, we just unplugged it ourselves. We couldn't get the shower to run anything except scalding hot water, and we couldn't get the water to shut off after the shower. The air conditioning was broken in the fitness room so you couldn't really work out for more than a few minutes without risking heat stroke.

It is an older hotel which has been renovated in which they have tried to keep the \"boutique\" feel. The entrance, lobby and other common areas therefore are appealing because of interesting design or furniture elements. A drawback of this approach however is that a number of less attractive or convenient features were also kept. I stayed with colleagues on a business trip and we had a number of rooms in the hotel. The rooms were relatively small,somehat too small for some, and the bathrooms tiny. So you might want to check on the size of the room before you accept it. My room still kept it's old sink, which was cracked and chipped. The very thin shower curtain was insufficient and couldn't keep the whole bathroom from getting wet during showering. Views varied. Some were great with a view of Mt Rainier on a clear day. My room viewed the rather unappealing University of Washington district area. An absolutely big plus for this hotel is the very friendly and attentive staff. Check-in and check-out were very efficient. The manager was very present and attended to our needs. The free internet worked well. The restaurant was again fairly small and the breakfast below average. Don't even try the 'fresh'OJ. However, this was made up by the great Tully's Coffee store which can be directly accessed from the hotel. In summary, if you are looking to get away from large chain hotels and stay in an interesting place, and have business in the University area, than try the Hotel Deca.

Don't get disappointed when you enter the room as they are not the biggest ~ like most hotel unless you pay for them (e.g., rooms vs. suites), but the closet is huge for luggages and comes with the safe deposit box - useful for people needing it ~ although I did not use any of the goods in the closet (e.g., iron, ironing board, dresser, and hangers). I actually like the layout better as the the room is for sleeping and not for storage when on a trip which for travelers knows exactly what I am referring to ~ limited room storage and leaving clothes/luggages on the floors. Hotel DECA may not be the top hotel chain with the limited facilities (e.g., pool), but the location has easy access to everywhere. The Hotel Complementary Shuttle ~ within 4 miles radius can get you to most of the tourist places ~ including the Northgate Mall or Downtown ~ job well done! Only wished it was complimentary parking or included in the hotel price. However, once I parked, the hotel shuttle took me everywhere I needed to be ~ as suggested or as the staff recommended I drive and enjoy the best of Seattle has to offer ~ scenic view. I had my roof off my Jeep Wrangler and with clear sky ~ what better way to see Seattle! The best part... the staff were all amazingly helpful since this was my first time to Seattle. They printed me maps even with other guest standing behind me which they immediately call someone in the back or one of the Shuttle drivers to assist me while they helped the other people in the line-up...that's service! You see ~ lots of time I feel annoyed when the hotel reps don't care to help but needs to which you can see it on their faces while the people in the line up gets annoyed. I witnessed first hand for the first time what teamworks mean in a hotel environment when 4 hotel reps at the first desk are assisting/helping 4 guests at the same time for a smaller 'boutique hotel' ~ lucky to have 2 working at the desk.

The bed was comfortable with plush bedding and clean crisp sheets. The bathroom was very cute with a true art deco throwback theme. The staff were super helpful and polite. The view was superb. The location awesome. But there was a gaping fault: cutting corners in maintenance that gave the place a \"cheapness factor.\" Under the exterior window in my room was significant water damage. I don't know if the window had been left open during a previous rainstorm (or a few storms) because the wall underneath it was disintegrating. The drywall was crumbling and I could see deep into the wall. It really looked bad. I could say it started to spoil the stunning view out the window. It wasn't a small spot that could be overlooked. The damage covered several feet, the whole wall sagged and there was damage to the window sill as well. I can't imagine this had just happened (it wasn't wet) or that the management didn't know about it. This sort of dilapidation is something you find in a roach motel not a 3.5 star $150 dollar room. The thing that was most incongruous was the fact other parts of the room were very nice and well maintained. Why the blinders to this gaping fault? Was it cheapness? Some other things that might drive customers away. The upholstered furniture in the common areas of the lobby should be shampooed more often because there were darkish dirt spots on the top of chairs where people's hands often touched (you know... those pink squarish chairs in the lobby photos). Again... gives an impression of cheapness and isn't that tough to make right! Exterior paint on older wood-framed windows of basement bar was rotten and looked bad... Repeat... cheapness factor. (To give the hotel credit on this one... they mentioned on the website that there is a future 5 million dollar exterior renovation scheduled!) Having said all this, I would like to emphasize that with a little attention to detail this hotel was just inches from being an EXCELLENT experience.

I saw its major renovation 20 or so years ago and have stayed many many times. PROS: This is quite a nice hotel with a long and flourishing history. It must be called a Seattle classic--would be nice if the hotel could provide photos of the old Meany and Towers hotels with some information on its history in the lovely lobby, particularly for old Seattlites who loved the old hotel. The hotel has a beautiful stylish lobby with great atmosphere and boasts a convenient location for a U-area hotel (easier \"in and out\" than the nearby Watertown Hotel). It is a quick trip downtown by car or bus. One can reach the Fairview/Mercer area downtown by means of easy-to-travel charming \"lesser roads,\" if one is not inclined to take the busy and crowded freeway. There is a coffee shop in the lobby although it is quite a chilly place on a winter morning, so we took our coffee to go. There were complimentary newspapers and a very kind and friendly staff at the front desk. The beds were very satisfactory, although our quilt was worn and too thin to suffice. We added one from storage and were able to manage. The TV was a flat screen and very good. There was a nice desk. (The lamp light in the room was a little dim overall for one doing heavy reading.) The views in this hotel are truly wonderful, although the traffic noise is a little loud given the convenient location at a busy intersection with buses. (One must be careful to turn on the ventilation; this prevents a headache or similar from the occasional fumes rising from the street.) We used earplugs which we bring when we travel. We had no issues with noise from adjoining rooms or those above: this was great! CONS: The room was adequate although definitely appearing more aged and frayed than it appeared perhaps 15 years ago. The level of \"clean\" was good. The decor is now a little old; there was some peeling wallpaper in the small but adequate bathroom; we noted that the bathroom shower head had separated from the wall. There were several bugs in the bathtub on arrival (easily remedied). The old taps in the tub did not work well (stiff and hard to control) and the shower head dripped for long periods even when the shower had not been touched. There was no ventilation fan in the bathroom--unless we missed the switch somehow. The most significant \"negative\" was the lack of satisfactory and continuing wireless receptivity in the room we occupied. A family member reported the same in the other room we occcupied, although the wireless was better at one corner of that room. The rooter and the system were both cheerfully rebooted on two occasions by the accommodating staff but to no noticeable effect. I had to re-enter the password as well many times and had frequent error messages asking for a different password. Another inconvenience was the lack (on 3 nights) of sufficiently hot water in the shower and tub. Baths were therefore not pleasant as the water quickly cooled from \"barely hot,\" to too-cold-to-stay in the water. The tub in our room was semi-blocked and very slow--a minor issue. A function-check of all fixtures in the bathrooms would be recommended. All and all, the hotel was advertised at a good rate, and even with the above reservations, I would possibly stay again if the hot water issue could be remedied and the wireless service strengthened.", "Date": "January 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Eugene, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cMixed Review\u201d", "Author": "Tabihaku", "ReviewID": "UR91041454", "Content": "This could have been a nice stay at a nice hotel in a nice location (close to UW), but it was marred by a bit of scam-flam that misrepresented the actual cost.

This is an old hotel that has been restored. It's LOVELY Art-Deco style -- so well done, with such fine pieces of art and functional furnishings! The theme is carried through all the rooms, as well. We just enjoy walking around, enjoying the ambiance.

Our only problem ever experienced in all our stays was the heat in the winter. All the rooms face an outside wall (extraordinary views from every room ) - and it can be cold and windy in Seattle. The thermostats are poorly located in the room -- the heat vents runs inside the wall behind the thermostats, so when the heat blows, the thermostat picks up that warmth and shuts off. Arghh! Maintainence did their best by adding insulation behind the thermostat - but we found the only way we could resolve the problem on several below-freezing windy nights was to unscrew the thermostat from the wall and leave it dangling where it didn't pick up the duct heat. Worked perfectly then! They need to relocate all the thermostats. Maybe they've resolved the problem by now -- this was a year ago.

The kicker of disappointment came after our wedding, we were opening a bottle of wine, it slipped and fell onto the glass counter top of the bar. You would think the bottle would break well it didn't the countertop did. My new wife cut herself on the broken glass and we called the front desk to tell them about it and they acted very non-chalant \"Oh we will have our engineer look at it when he's in.\" OK, having broken glass all over your room is ordinary and not having anybody come look at it or even come and clean it up is that customary hotel service. Anyways nobody came to look at it, we checked out and 2 days later I notice that they had taken $1500 out of my acct for the damage without approval, without an invoice and without even contacting me. I had a great wedding and Hotel Deca is well decorated, but the people who manage that place do not know how to communicate or make guests feel very welcome. We made that hotel a lot of money by staying there and inviting all our guests to stay there, but they did nothing for us, I mean they didn't even clean the penthouse properly and they basically stole money out of my pocket.

It was about a 10 minute drive (or $18 taxi fare, but I'll get to that later) to downtown Seattle. Now I'm not normally a fan of \"modern\" decor, but the Hotel Deca pulls it off. Their property is clean and comfortable with some rooms that offer good views of the Seattle Skyline. Our room was a corner studio with a flat screen TV, but oddly, no microwave or refrigerator. Free Wi-Fi is also available, but very weak in the location I was in. They also offer a complimentary shuttle which we decided to use the second day we were there. We had them drop us off at Pikes Place Market at 9am and the driver said, \"Be sure to give us a call by 10pm if you would like a ride back\". We spent the rest of the day enjoying Seattle, and even stumbling on a great little blues bar (Hwy 99 Blues). At around 9:52pm, I called the hotel for the shuttle back, but was denied simply with \"I don't think we can do that for you\" (verbatim). When I asked why, their response was, \"Well it's getting close to 10pm\" (once again, verbatim). We went back and forth with this, with both of us highlighting the fact that it WASN'T EVEN 10pm YET! The strange part about it was the fact that at no time did they ever give me a reason that they wouldn't pick me up.. just an almost robotic \"I just don't think we can do that for you\". The conversation ended with them telling me to get a cab. Without any other options, my wife and I got a cab back to the hotel, an $18 fare that I didn't have cash for. I almost asked the desk to reimburse me, but I didn't want to push the issue with someone who obviously didn't care.

There were a ton of cute little shops within walking distance of the hotel and a good variety of places to eat. The district lounge is in the basement of the hotel and the food was great.

I was alarmed by some of the negative ones but I discovered they were unfounded. No hotel is perfect, but Hotel Deca is a solid choice for travelers interested in staying in or near the University District. PROS: 1. The bed - the mattress and pillows on my king-sized bed were unusually comfortable, and I'm a picky traveler. In fact, I had a better night's sleep at Deca than I've had at many five-star spa hotels. 2. Other room amenities I enjoyed: Flat screen TV, windows that actually open for fresh air (be alert, if traveling with little children) free wireless internet. 3. The food in the basement-level restaurant, which is also the room-service kitchen, is surprisingly great. I ate breakfast in the restaurant and it was really upscale, fresh and delicious. Room service was prompt, also excellent, and not as costly as it could have been. 4. Staff - Every single employee I came into contact with was friendly, warm and helpful. 5, Location - Right on 45th and Brooklyn Ave - a great intersection with pedestrian traffic, shops, bus lines, etc. This is a bustling, student-oriented little pocket of Seattle. The guests in the hotel were divided between business travelers, academic visitors and families of students coming to UW for the new semester. Oh, and for what it's worth, a few other guests at the hotel were cast members from \"The Real Housewives of Orange County.\" Ha - that's either a plus or a minus, depending on your tastes... 6.

In some hotels you feel really self-concious sitting in the lobby, but here you feel completely at ease. 3)The free shuttle made it really easy to get downtown. The first day we took the car downtown and had to pay $18 to park - this was a great alternative. 4) Spacious room. We were in 1507 which had two queen beds and still enough room for 3 chairs, a desk, and a tv stand. It was comfortable for our family of 4. 5) Views, views, views! Nice view of downtown, the Space Needle, and the mountains. This was a big hit with the kids. 6) Price. The hotel was about $40 lower than the same level of hotels we considered downtown. We used the money we saved to go on a seaplane ride - a better investment if you have kids! Cons: 1) Bathroom is small. If i was traveling by myself i wouldn't mind, but with a family it took a lot of time to get everyone ready. 2) The room has a DVD player but they don't have any DVD's to loan you. They should have a library if they are going to have a player, 3) They don't have a kids menu. All in all the restaurant didn't cater to kids very well. We didn't see many other kids during our stay, but still... 4) could be more \"green\".

When I went down for dinner, I commented to the desk clerk about our noisy neighbors, and she said, \"Sometimes things like that happen.\" I was speechless, but took that as a cue to seek dinner outside of the building.

A small piece of grilled salmon was served over a large bed of lightly sauteed sliced onions and peppers. With 2 drinks, the total tab for the two of us came to over $30, and we left hungry. I also might add this hotel has no room service, so forget about breakfast in bed or late-night munchies in front of the flatscreen plasma TV that was in our premium room.)

It's about a 5-10 min drive downtown depending on traffic, but its nice because you miss most of heavy downtown traffic.", "Date": "August 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Costa Mesa, California", "Title": "\u201cconvenient\u201d", "Author": "andyinaz", "ReviewID": "UR5487025", "Content": "Comfortable bed.

The cab ride downtown to eat was around $16 each way, but the money saved on the room fee makes up for being a little out of the loop from downtown.

The bath was small and the limited in counter space as it had a pedestal sink and small shelf. The bed was comfortable. I agree with the complaint about the a/c. We too faced the west and had to draw the heavy curtains and turn the a/c on to make it even bearable, never cool. We would have opened the window at night, but the street noise from 45th was loud and constant all night. You might get less of a view, but also less noise if you are located over the parking lot.

The University Hotel was surprisingly a lot nicer than I thought it was going to be and the hotel staff were very friendly and professional. We checked in at around 1 a.m. and the front desk staff was surprisingly very pleasant at such a late hour. The decor reminded me a lot of what you would find in a Kimpton Hotel and had a boutique feel. Unfortunately the location is not all that great if you do not have a car with you and want to be in downtown Seattle; although the drive is only about 5 minutes. There is however a bus stop a block away you can take downtown. Also another great thing about the University Hotel is that they have a binder filled with take-out menus, from which you can order from local eateries and have it delivered to your room to satisfy whatever cuisine you crave. I would definitely recommend the University Hotel for the great rate I got, which I think is a lot nicer than a hotel you would get at $129/night in downtown Seattle. The rooms were very comfortable and clean with a boutique feel; they also come equipped with a refridgerator and microwave.", "Date": "May 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Munich, Germany", "Title": "\u201cGood value\u201d", "Author": "kilian2004", "ReviewID": "UR5183587", "Content": "We spend three nights in the UT Hotel and did not regret it.

A bus stop is just round the corner which takes you within 15 minutes to downtown Seattle and if you feel like dining in the University District I can recomment the Indian restaurant which is just round the corner (behind the hotel owned parking lot).

There is a great bar in the basement of the hotel, a coffee shop on the first floor, a great lobby, and a place near the reception to check email which was great. My only complaint was that the walls were a little thin and I could hear my neighbors talking at times throughout the night but it may be because it was adjoining rooms. I'm not sure if all rooms are like this. Parking is free and it is about a 10-15 minute ride to downtown Seattle from this hotel during the day (maybe longer, traffic can be pretty bad).
