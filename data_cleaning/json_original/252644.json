I have to say, it exceeded my expectations. The rooms were very clean and the maids left two bottles of water for us everyday. The room wasn't exactly spacious, but they definitely weren't cramped for two adults and one young child. The pillows were a little harder than what I prefer and the mattress was a pillowtop that was softer than expected. The soap and shampoo were horrible, it dried out our skin and frizzed out our hair, I would recommend bringing your own or bring lots of lotion. The showers were refreshing with nice hot water and strong water pressure. One thing I didn't like about the rooms is that they get stuffy fast. The ceiling fan worked great, but I would recommend leaving the window open a few inches to get some fresh air. The windows were thick and they did a good job at keeping the traffic noise out. Another thing, keep kids away from the window, there is no screen and it could be dangerous to not watch your child in the room with the window open, especially on one of the higher floors. I was very happy with the staff. Anytime you passed them in the hall they said hi. Check-in and check-out was quick and any question you asked was answered enthusiastically. We were especially happy when we were informed that internet was free, we weren't charged one peso for access. That was a huge convenience for us. When we reserved our room online, we requested a quiet room and we were thrilled to find that they accommodated us by putting us on a higher floor, farther from the traffic noise. Sleep came easy to us all. The location was great. The hotel sits on one of the corners of a 5-point intersection and there are plenty of different restaurants and convenience stores to chose from. It is close to Chapultepec Park (less than 10 minutes by taxi) and the Angel of Independence as well as some good shopping malls. Also, there were a lot of interesting bars around in the area, but we didn't try out any of them because it was a family trip. The hotel restaurant was convenient and the menu provided plenty of options to keep all of us happy. After we looked at the prices, we made the mistake of assuming that the plates were small and we ordered too much food. Just one bowl a soup filled me up since a bread basket came with it, and it the best tortilla soup I ever had. The breakfast menu was a great thing to look forward to in the mornings. They are open late so when we got back from touring late, we could order some good, hot food from the restaurant. They deliver it to your room free of charge, just make sure you tip. Overall, we were extremely satisfied with Hotel Roosevelt. The value was excellent and we would have stayed longer if our bodies weren't so exhausted from dragging around an energetic 4 year old for 2 days straight. We would recommend this hotel to anyone and we hope to return again soon.", "Date": "May 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Carolina", "Title": "\u201cUpdated and Immaculate\u201d", "Author": "SouthCarolinaMax", "ReviewID": "UR81967899", "Content": "Hotel Roosevelt is beautifully located on Insurgentes Sur, within 100 feet of the Metro Bus stop.

The neighborhood behind the hotel (Condesa) is upper class urban, young, and filled with great restaurants and parks. The hotel is older and basic business but has been well updated and pleasant upstairs. There is a large (but just adequate) restaurant downstairs and the lobby is very small. The rooms are sleek, and antiseptically clean. The bed was really hard (a warning for those predisposed to soft pillowtops) but I found it good sleeping. The bath was very nice with great tilework. My room on the Yucatan Street side was on the third floor and despite the double paned windows and heavy drapes, the traffic noise was annoying. Since there is no ceiling fan or AC, the guest faces a dilemma: open the window and endure the noise or keep it closed and endure the stuffiness. We finally compromised: open during the day and then late in the evening for awhile before trying to get some sleep. The staff was extremely cordial and helpful.

It is in a centralized location, right on Insurgentes, and is easily accessible to the bus and taxis, and there is even a little grocery in the gas station across the intersection which is great for late night snacking. Staying for 6 days, we never saw a cockroach, bug, or had something stolen. We loved every minute of it! The one major problem we had at the hotel, and this goes for any hotel, is that the tax is 10%, plus the tourism tax is %25.

There's sort of a fusty, never been remodeled, aired-out, or exposed to sunlight smell and look to the place. The maid service was excellent though, bottled water was provided each day, and the guys at the front desk are very helpful if you speak Spanish. Don't let them call a cab for you, though, as we got charged 70 pesos for a three or four block drive to a breakfast place (they told us, for whatever reason, that it was too far to walk!) Unlike other reviewers, I didn't find the location particularly great. Sure, it's close to bus stops, but so is everywhere in DF. The nearest metro stop is very far away, and there's no restaurants or cafes within the immediate vicinity.

I was able to make our reservations online. When we arrived the king room that I had reserved for my aunt was not available for the first night, but she didn't really care and decided to stay in the double bed room for the entire stay. The hotel is in the midst of renovation and both our rooms had already been renovated. Although we were not bothered, they were in the midst of renovating the floor my aunt was staying on and she said she was woken up a couple mornings to banging. The bed was firmer than I prefer but not rock hard, the bathroom was modern and new with a huge shower and the location is within walking distance to the hip area called the Condessa. The only problem is that our cab driver from the bus station wasn't immediately familiar with it but luckily found it with little direction (at the intersection of Insurgentes and Yucatan) and our bus driver for the pyramid tour got lost trying to find it in the middle of payday rushhour, so I guess it's not a well know hotel but I thought convieniently located to what we wanted to see (the hotel, archeological museum and Zocalo formed a convienient triangle). The hotel restaraunt was decent although the morning staff was pretty slow. The evening staff was friendly and prompt. There is internet access in the restaraunt and although it says $50 pesos for 15 minutes (still cheaper than cafes) I was never charged. Considering that for 4 nights we paid $178 U.S.D. the Hotel Roosevelt was an amazing deal in a great area of Mexico City.

The public transport is excellent (Insurgentes Metrobus stop just up the street with good connections to the Metro). The service was excellent (both housekeeping and the front desk). The on-site restaurant is satisfactory, but is pay-as-you-go since it is independently managed. I took most breakfasts at a nearby branch of the excellent Bisquets Obregon chain. The hotel laundry service is good, but there are more economical choices in the neighborhood. The main problem with the hotel is traffic noise (noted in other reviews). The rooms on the southern side of the hotel are somewhat quieter than on the (Yucatan Street) north. Best for quiet are the interior rooms which I routinely request from economy hotels in Mexican cities. A plus is that the hotel is convenient to the restaurants and other action in both the Condesa and Roma neighborhoods. I walk, but others may want to opt for a short taxi ride--especially after about ten pm. On that topic, my impression is that the security situation for tourists is considerably better that it was five or six years ago.
