{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Swimming with dolphins Main reason to stay here is of course the \u9225\u6e1fwimming with dolphins\u9225?opportunity. The chasing dolphins in the sunrise thing is a bit lame once you had the chance to actually get close up with the dolphins. And the dolphins want to get really close up\u9225?br/>Average double room at an average hotel overlooking the dolphin pool for 50US$ per night including free entrance to dolphin shows and zoo and a discount on the swimming with dolphins. Lots of fun watching people swim with the dolphins.Having dolphins and a zoo at a hotel is a bit dubious. At Melka it looked like they took good care of the animals although the cages/pools are obviously not very large\u9225?br/>We walked to \u9225\u6e04own town\u9225?Lovina for dinner/lunch once, took about ten-fifteen minutes, took a taxi the other times. Also some nice local restaurants close to the hotel, only took lunch once at the hotel restaurant, overpriced and nothing special.Didn\u9225\u6a9b try swimming at the beach (five minutes walk from the back entrance of the hotel), not bad looking but not specially great either.Cut our planned one week stay short due to massive renovations making the place less suitable for small kids. Although once that is finished it should be a nice family hotel.", "Date": "Jan 3, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR995647842", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "sigsap"}, {"Content": "Dolhpins in the pool We stayed for four long days at Melka.

We decided to stay at the Melka hotel based on an ad in HelloBali magazine. At the Melka hotel they have a pool where you can swim with dolphins - sounded like fun and it was an interesting experience. We ended up not staying. First, the hotel was distasteful on the basis of decor. The main reason we left though was the fact that they not only had dolphins ( at least they were busy interacting with people) but they had a bear and a chimpanzee in small barred enclosures. It was an animal cruelty issue for us.", "Date": "Nov 11, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR548168002", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "deanovancouver"}, {"Content": "A unique place We (family of 5) found this hotel on the web as we realised that it was the only option the get a close look at dolphins when visiting Bali. The plan was to stay there for two days, but we ended staying more than a week. The zoo with butterfly garden and all kind of animals were a great success for our children. As a guest we were allowed to see the dolphin show for free whenever we wanted - a great and unique experience. The room was fine and very clean and also the food was very good (a good mix of local and western dishes).The children are already asking me when we can go back.", "Date": "Oct 6, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR604234245", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Balifreak"}, {"Content": "The hotel changed our reservation without a prior notice. We just returned from an 8-day trip on Bali. One of the nights we stayed in Lovina at Melka hotel. I booked a specific room there a few months in advance. The room I choose was actually a suite with two rooms overlooking the pool. Both factors were very important to us because we were traveling with our 12-year old daughter.However, to our great surprise and disappointment, when we checked in, we realized that we got a different, less expensive room. It was just a single room with an extra bed for our daughter, facing the wall of another building. We brought this to the management\u9225\u6a9a attention. The manager explained that the owner of the hotel is German, and that after we made our reservation, some tourists from Germany requested the same room. Therefore, the owner instructed the manager to move us to a cheaper room to make room for his friends. As an apology, the hotel gave us a discount (approx. US$15). Obviously, we were not very happy with such explanation, and could not care less about the US$15 discount. However, there was no point in continuing our complaint since the type of room we originally booked was not available, anyway. We felt a little insulted that our reservation was changed without a timely notice. I strongly believe that hotels can not kick their guests around at will. If a hotel confirmed a booking, it should be true to its word, even if later it gets a reservation request from a more profitable or better connected guest. To be fair, I must state the things I liked about Melka. The hotel has a small zoo. Our daughter fell in love with a very friendly orangutan, who would shake her hand. Also, she loved swiming with dolphins in the hotel's salt water pool.Much-advertised early morning boat trip to see dolphins was less fun than expected since we could hardly see any dolphins (they are not stupid and, just like most of us, don't like the engine noises of tens of boats chasing them along the coast line.). Furthermore, we arranged for this trip throught the hotel and not directly with any of the many fishermen at the beach trusting that hotel would guarantiee the safety and the quality of the trip. However, to our great surprise, we were met by a local fisherman in a very small spider-boat that could barely fit three of us. More importantly, we were not provided with any life-jackets. So, booking this trip through the hotel did not give us any advantages. To the contrary, we paid much more than we would have had we hired the same kind of fisherman directly. We expressed our concern to the hotel staff, and suggested that they corrected this in the future. They appeared to agree. I must say, though, that the early morning boat ride was a great fun, anyway.The service, in general, was very good. However, on Bali, great service is a norm.The food at the hotel was good, but the neighboring warungs were even better and much cheaper. We had very fresh baby tuna grilled for us in one of them. The spa at the hotel is also not bad and inexpensive. The hotel has a very good pool.In conclusion, I would recommend this hotel to families with children. Besides the zoo and dolphins, there is not much to do. The hotel is not at the beach, you have to walk for 5-10 minutes to get to the beach. However, the beach is not much fun as it is rather dirty. So, a one-day stay was enough for us. However, I suspect that the risk of being cheated of your reservation is particularly high if you make just a one-night reservation.", "Date": "Aug 5, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR356609763", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "grib"}, {"Content": "Vorsicht im Hotel Melka auf Bali!!!!   showReview(18899759, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 12, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR884710447", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Kuense"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608483-d668974-r23229918-Melka_Excelsior_Resort_Hotel-Kalibukbuk_Bali.html", "HotelID": "668974", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
