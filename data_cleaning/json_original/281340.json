When I booked the room, the web site didn't mention a fitness center, but there was a small one, with a stairmaster, a treadmill, and an exercise bike. There was a computer and printer in the lobby, and free wi-fi (log in with your name each day and start a 24-hour timer.) They also offered to print a boarding pass and slip it under your door the morning of your departure. There was a pile of free USA Today newspapers at the desk each morning, and warm cookies at some point in the afternoon. The shuttle to Midway is shared among a half dozen hotels located adjacent to one another. In one direction, it picks up near one of the baggage claim stations; in the other direction, it drops you off at the checkin area for your particular airline. While it runs 24x7,they advised us to phone the hotel to trigger it. The shuttle does not go to the Orange Line Midway \"el\" station per se, but there's a (longish) indoor walking corridor between the Midway terminal and that station. We were able to visit a variety of Chicago attractions by public transit. The 54B bus stops on Cicero Ave near 65th St, just outside the hotel complex, and runs to the Orange Line Midway station (and beyond.) The Orange Line takes you to the Loop (shopping, Art Institute.) The 55 bus takes you (slowly) from the Orange Line Midway station to the Museum of Science and Industry, the Hyde Park area, U of Chicago, and the Frank Lloyd Wright Robie house. By transferring from 54B to 54 to the Green Line, you can even get to Oak Park where the Frank Lloyd Wright home and studio are located. I bought a CTA pass, good for one person for 72 hours from first use on buses and the \"el\" (but not on Metra trains, which are not CTA); I bought mine from a machine at the Amtrak station, but they're also sold at CVS and Walgreens. Employees and passengers alike were helpful when I had questions about public transit, and it was a relief not to deal with traffic, unfamiliar streets, parking, and gas. It was also cheap! The downside, of course, is that it takes longer. However, the trains and buses I mentioned above run so often and are so well coordinated that I spent very little time waiting to get on; the extra time was due mostly to frequent stops on the buses. There's a printable route guide on the CTA web site, but I found I needed to use Google maps (clicking on the \"public transit\" icon) to figure out which buses and trains to take and when they arrived.", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat breakfast, decent rooms\u201d", "Author": "Crusha", "ReviewID": "UR119953854", "Content": "Had a one night stay here, with an early flight out of Midway Airport.

Two minor complaints: The climate control / air conditioner cycled on and off throughout the night and was pretty noisy. It did not make for a restful sleep. Also, the hotel charges for parking whether you have a car or not. Its only $10, but for me, this is the difference between an above average rating and just average.

With the shuttle bus running every 20 minutes, we were able to jump on the Orange line (Midway airport) to head downtown and switch to the red line to get to Cellular Field. Got to know the Chicago Transportation very well during our 3-days. Granted we had to add about an hour each way but considering everything, this was the best route to go as we didn't have to worry about the traffic and then finding/paying for parking. As far as the rooms at the hotel, the rooms have seen better days. Everything worked, ie. a/c, lights, tv, etc. but they were dated. As we didn't spend time in the rooms, it was fine. As far as the posts on bed begs....no sign of them as the room was clean. Breakfast in the morning was typical for this type hotels (ie. waffle maker), although the pancake/sausage roll was different. My only comment was on the microwave they have was a commercial one that really didn't have any clear direction on the buttons to push for how long items needed to warm-up/cook. There was one staff person that did a great job manning this area.

We came into town with no reservation and first tried the Holiday Inn next door ($200 a night) - similar for the Marriott and HIlton here - all these hotels are in a hotel 'circle' right next to each other. The Fairfield Inn was $170 a night (with AAA discount) and all the properties charge for parking ($13 a night) - they claim it's due to airport regulations. Which is why I only gave it an average - the value is inflated due to location. The room was fine, but an extremely small bathroom area - only about 6 inches on either side of the sink for your 'stuff'. There's a small pool/jacuzzi and fitness area. The breakfast is very nice - they make waffles for you, plus have egg sandwiches/omelettes you can heat up in the micro along with all the standard continental breakfast items. The staff was nice. I used my own car, so can't comment on the walk to the El, etc., but this is really not such the 'bad neighborhood' that everyone seems to comment on.

The business center consists of ONE computer so don't expect to use it very often. There is no view to speak of from any of the rooms, unless you like watching planes land. Speaking of planes, although the hotel is within shouting distance of MDW, I never heard an airplane from my room. Traffic on Cicero is horrible at times so don't expect to get anywhere fast. However, Giordano's is about 2 blocks away which is a nice little treat for this part of town. Also, a White Castle is 2 or 3 blocks away. The bad news...my room had several spots of damage. The wall next to the computer chair had many tears in the wall paper, I guess from the chair bumping against the wall. The soap dish in the shower had mold all around the caulking.
