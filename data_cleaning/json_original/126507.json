We wanted a place with a pool, a place to do your laundry, breakfast included and a snack bar. Best Western Key Ambassador fit the bill exactly. We were between cruises out of Miami, and decided to book a few days in Key West. I'm happy we read the reviews and chose this hotel. It isn't too far from downtown, however, you'll need to take the shuttle, a bus, or drive, its too far to walk. Our room was very clean and large with two queen beds and a large flat screen tv. We even had a small screened in balcony we sat on occasionally. No view, except for trees covering the next door apt building. The laundry was near the office, I forget the cost, not expensive. You can also buy detergent at the front desk. The pool is large and free form. Perfect for an evening swim after a hot day walking around Key West. At the pool area, is the Cheekie Hut, where you can get cocktails and food. It closes early, no dinner, just lunch and snacks. There are TV's at the bar to watch sports if you like, or you can sit by the pool, drink in hand and enjoy a swim. The people who work here are very friendly and drinks are very good. I did two loads of laundry and spent my waiting time at Cheekies. Breakfast was continental, including hard boiled eggs, fruit, all kinds of toast, jams, butter, cereal, yogurt, coffee, tea and juices. Perfect! It's served in a nice little breakfast area, which was in the building where we were staying. A simple walk down the stairs and there we were! We drove into town during the day and had no trouble finding street parking. Be sure to pay in the machines! We walked all over and saw beautiful homes, shops, bars, restaurants, museums, and of course had lunch with Conch fritters as a starter and Key Lime pie for dessert. We were happy to return to the Best Western Key for a swim, drink and relaxation each day.

Well it did have water views but I had to stand very close to the window whilst standing up. I wouldn't call this habour view. Anyway, I didn't bother to complain as we didn't plan on spending too much time in our room. The room itself was huge. With a very comfortable King size bed, couch, table with two chairs, TV, Microwave and fridge. The walls were a bit thin, during one night our neighbours were very noisy we could hear everything. The pool area was nice and I spent many hours there. The water is also heated in winter. There is a bar selling snacks and drinks. Yes, there are planes going past but it didn't bother us. I actually enjoyed watching the various planes taking off. Outside the hotel there is a nice walk along the ocean. It was great for early morning walks and to watch the sunset. Downtown Key west, including Duval street is not very far by car. It took us 5-10 minutes to drive and parking was not an issue. There is also a beach within 2-3 minutes drive. Breakfast was standard continental breakfast with fruit, pastries, bread, waffle, yoghurt, tea, coffee, juice. The only bad thing about breakfast time was the size of the room, there were a small number of tables. If you turn up for breakfast at 9am expect to wait for a table. Overall our stay was pleasant.

We needed to extend our stay there by one day as someone in our group became ill and they were able to grant our request.

Our housekeeper, Leanora, thoroughly cleaned our room each day, and patiently waited for us when we wanted to sleep in. Many hotels don't clean your room when you're there for an extended stay - they just make the bed and get you clean towels- but Leanora kept our room very clean. The room had a fridge (a must for saving money in Key West) and a microwave and is soundproofed for not hearing your neighbors. The room was very spacious (not like many of the B&Bs in town) and had a beautiful sunrise view of the water. You are literally just steps from the Atlantic and the beautiful paved boardwalk. The pool was huge by Key West accomodation standards, and there were plenty of chairs to go around. The grounds were very well manicured, and there was even a little bridge through a mangrove area where you could get an insider's view of how these Key trees grow. Some of the reviewers foud the airport to be a problem, but not us. The planes were infrequent, and most of them are smaller, less noisy crafts. There was ample free parking (another Key West anomaly). The front desk personnel / concierge service were cheerful and helpful. The only negative for some travelers is that you cannot walk to town from here, and driving and parking in downtown Key West is next to impossible. We are avid \"scooterers\", so we just rented a scooter for the week, and rode into town. A scooter is definitely THE way to get around Key West anyway (just watch where you park). There is a tour bus that has regular stops right in front of the hotel, so you can hitch a ride that way also. The breakfast is a little better than the inns we've stayed in, since they have boiled eggs and make your own waffles, but is still a challenge for the carb conscious or the diabetic.

First of all this is not a resort. It is an older Hotel that is maintained very well. The rooms were clean and well kept. The outside was landscaped and well kept. That is pretty much all of the positive stuff. The downside includes a salt water pool which leaves you feeling sticky after swimming. The pool is closed at dark (7:00 to 8:00) and the gates surrounding the pool are locked. If you are on vacation (which we were) and you wanted to sit around the pool and visit with friends you are out of luck. You are forced into your room after dark. I thought this was completely ludicrous. You cannot sit on your balcony either with you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re A/C running. The A/C backs up to your Balcony forcing the hot air to where you are sitting. You also cannot bring \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Any\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd beverages to the pool area. You must purchase all beverages from their Tiki hut. Mixed drinks can run you $8.00 and beer is $4.00 each. The service at the Tiki hut varied on who was running it. One day there was an older lady running it and she played music from the big band era. That in itself was rude and made you want to shoot yourself. Eating breakfast was a treat. They serve it in a room that is located on the opposite side of the property. It was about a 1/2 of a block from where our room was to the other side of the hotel. The room had a vanity with one sink. For some reason they installed the miniature refrigerator on a pedestal under the sink right in the middle which was fun stubbing your toes on. They could have easily put it down a little in the space away from the sink. I saved the best for last. You can forget sleeping late anytime. At 7:00 -8:00 a.m. every morning you are awakened to jets taking off from the air port next door. It sounds like they are coming through your room and we stayed on the bottom floor. I would recommend this hotel for business travelers, but not if you want to take vacation in Key West.

I had trouble finding a reasonably priced single room with two queen beds and this hotel fit the bill. They offer a great service of picking you up at the airport. We then had the scooter rental place pick us up at the hotel to get our scooters. This transportation plan worked fairly well. The continental breakfast was nicely setup with indoor and outdoor seating. They had waffle makers, french toast, muffins, cereal, bread, English muffins, hard boiled eggs and more. They kept the place fairly clean for the huge number of people that were using the space. We went at around 9:30 each morning and the place was very crowded. Might recommend going earlier since they close this up at 10 AM and there would be less people. Another thing that was upsetting was that a little kid had parents that let him feed several raccoons that had showed up outside for handouts. The coons got in a fight over the food and caused a big disruption. No one said anything and I guess the parents weren't up to speed that you don't feed wild animals where people are trying to eat (especially when the coons didn't pay to stay there!). Check-in and check-out went very smoothly. The hotel let us check in early...a nice feature. We did use the pool, which has two waterfalls and is fairly large. A nice cool down after a hot day. However, almost none of the pool rules were being followed and there were a number of foreigners that decided to take over a huge section by tossing around a soccer ball. They weren't very accurate and the ball kept splashing people in the pool that were trying to relax. Kids were diving off the waterfalls, splashing everyone around them, even though there were signs that indicated no jumping or diving from it. I guess if you go to a bargain resort you are going to end up with people that have little courtesy or maybe they couldn't read the signs. Another issue was that there were almost no chairs left. Now for the room. Had a nice size screened-in balcony with chairs overlooking the pool. The TV in the room is horrible..maybe 19 inches and basically had no clear channels and poor reception. The beds weren't fancy, but we were so tired from the days events that we really didn't care. The bathroom had two annoyances...the first was the tub didn't drain (how do the cleaning people not notice this?) and the second was the toilet kept getting stuck open until you jiggled the handle. The hotel is across the street from the ocean...however, there is no beach; only a nice concrete walkway that can be used for taking walks (although it is alongside the road) or jogging. I would only recommend this resort to people looking for a bargain and that don't mind staying far away from the main entertainment area of Key West.

We got one of the full oceanfront rooms with a marvelous 180\u00c2\u00ba view of the water. True, the motel is across the road from the water, but this is the *best* view on Key West for the fairly reasonable price of $130. Other hotels were at least twice that amount or more for the same type of view. This side of the island is not nearly as busy as the north side, where all the stores are, so traffic noise was not intrusive. The room was quite large and spacious. It looked NICER in person than on the motel's website! It was very light and airy. We had a microwave and fridge, and they even included plastic cutlery and paper plates. Our room had both a table and a desk, so the laptop could sit undisturbed on the desk. There is good, fast free wifi service. The outside private balcony had two chairs and a small table. This motel has a large selection of types of rooms. The full oceanfront are the most expensive, but they have many rooms which are partial oceanfront, or ocean view. They also have rooms with no views, which are probably extremely reasonably priced. This is not a new motel, nor a \"5 star\" hotel, and there is no elevator. Our room was fresh and spotless and was kept that way throughout our stay. Outside, the maintenence crew was constantly working - cleaning, painting and doing yard work. Everybody was very polite and friendly. The lobby was pleasant and comfortable. The local paper was available as well as all sorts of local information. The desk staff was always patient and helpful to us, as we contacted them numerous times asking questions about local attractions. They even provided a vase for us to borrow when my husband bought me flowers :-) Breakfast is an expanded continental and was quite good. Everything was fresh. The pool was delightful and surrounded by trees, however, it does close very early at night - 8:00 pm. The little \"Cheeky Hut\" was enjoyable and we had lunch there one day. It was pretty good food at a reasonable price with friendly service. The only thing that was not great was the guest laundry. There are two washers and two dryers for the whole motel. They are outside, near the housekeeping supply and laundry rooms. There is a big noisy compressor right there, so if you're waiting for the dryer to finish, it's kind of unpleasant :-( At the back of the motel, there is a semi-tame raccoon which seemed to be there on the lawn every day. We also saw two iguanas or some kind of huge lizards there. The motel does back up to the airport runway, so there is some plane noise, (as there is throughout Key West) , but the airport isn't very busy. The local island bus stops right outside the lobby door so if you don't want to drive into old town, you don't need to. The bus is quite inexpensive and stops by every half hour, I believe. [ I notice the review below rated this motel \"terrible\", but I wonder if they stayed here or at the other, older BW in town? There are no \"bathroom windows\" in the oceanfront rooms here.

Don't get a room on the 2nd floor if you have mobility problems or heavy suitcases as there is no lift. The room itself was very big but dark, badly decorated and very badly maintained. The surfaces are clean - the cleaners (who are also very kind) do a pretty good job but there's no scrubbing away the mould, caked dirt and rust. A particular low point was the bathroom: the ceiling actually had large holes in it, through which we were treated to first a dead millipede in the bathtub, and subsequently a series of creepy crawlies on the towels. I tried not to think of what else was up there, ready to drop into my hair. There was a terrible smell of dampness from the bathroom aswell, which did not go away after I sprayed the place with Dettol.

Given the Key West prices and our short stay there I wasn't looking for luxury - what bugs me is that they have done just the barest minimum amount of maintenance they could get away with. The 2 star motels I've stayed in show that it is possible to offer a basic, but well-maintained room. I recommend that you pay a bit extra and try one of the other hotels - or hold off booking until you have seen the room yourself. In terms of location, it is away from the town but there is a bus which stops right outside the reception (ask for a time table at check-in as it doesn't come very often). Last service is around 7.30pm so you'll have to get a taxi back to the hotel.", "Date": "June 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cincinnati, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cGreat Budget Hotel\u201d", "Author": "SnCollins", "ReviewID": "UR29453794", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here for three nights recently and really enjoyed our stay. Having stayed in both high-end and budget hotels in the past, I would consider this a clean, comfortable, well-maintained budget hotel. The location is just a few minutes into Key West, near the airport (the noise was not bothersome to us- we only heard a few airplanes the entire time). The hotel consists of a u-shaped building that surrounds the pool/tiki-bar where most rooms would have a partial or full ocean view. Our building was a short walk from the pool across a small parking lot. Though this building was quieter and closer to the continental breakfast room, it did not have an ocean view. (Not a complaint- we requested quiet) The breakfast was good for a continental breakfast, though on three mornings we opted to eat out because the restaurants on Key West are so great. The pool was wonderful...not too full or loud with plenty of chairs and a bar. The pool closed at 9PM, which was a little annoying. To be clear, there is NO beach at this hotel. The hotel sits on one of the busier roads in Key West. Directly across the road is a boardwalk wide enough to bike, rollerblade, etc. that drops off immediately to the water. No sand. On the bright side, it is absolutely beautiful and great to walk at night- we felt very safe. If you are looking for a beach, there is a nice one about a mile down the street and several closer to Duval Street. We did not miss having a beach at the hotel, however, we did have a car which made it easy to navigate the island. Duval Street is wonderful. The nightlife, shopping, and restaurants were all great. We had fabulous food the entire time. My top recommendations, along with a ton of others on here are: Blue Heaven, Salsa Loca, and the Rooftop Cafe. The hotel is not within walking distance of Duval Street (for most). You can rent scooters to get around the island. We did not do this, but will next time. They are not only fun, but easy to park, and parking is scarce and/or expensive near Duval (we spent anywhere from $10-$30 a day to park if we did not get there before 5PM when non-paid parking is more readily available). The trolley tour stops outside the hotel every half hour, but does not run late into the evening, and costs $29 per person per day. Taxis are available in a pinch but are also expensive. The only three small negatives I had for this hotel were: -the location (which is okay if you have a car and don't plan on drinking much). I am pregnant, so my husband had a designated driver. Next time I think we would stay closer to Duval and not rent the car in order to be closer to the nightlife and restaurants. -the rooms are a dated with no-frills. I can't really complain about this based on the price we paid, but don't go expecting anything luxurious. (the beds are very comfortable though!) -the beds.....though they were very comfortable (think NOT firm) they were also very small. I have never been to a hotel where 'two doubles' means 'two full beds'. My husband and I usually ended up in separate beds by the end of the night because we like our space and are used to a queen bed. Amusingly, the rooms are absolutely huge and could more than afford two queens. The television was so far from our bed that it had to be turned up extremely loud to hear it 'all the way over there'. Overall, if you are looking for an inexpensive hotel with close access to active area of Key West without the cost, this is a great option. I would recommend it, however, next time I feel that we'll splurge for a closer hotel and save on the rental car and parking.", "Date": "May 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New England", "Title": "\u201cGood Choice for Key West Newbies\u201d", "Author": "ddad", "ReviewID": "UR28560057", "Content": "We choose the Best Western Key Ambassador Resort Inn for an overnight stay in Key West on a Thursday night in March after because our first choice (Best Western Hibiscus) was unavailable. This was our first visit to Key West and we were very happy with our hotel selection. The room was huge (seemed large enough for a square dance), very clean and full of amenities such as bottles of water in the fridge, a coffeemaker and toiletries. It had a bath and closet area, king bed, sofa, table/chairs, bureau, and large flat panel TV. There was a wall with windows and sliders out to a long balcony that faced the ocean. It was great to sit on the balcony and watch the sunrise with our morning coffee. The only staff we interacted with were the front desk supervisor (I think her name was Kate), the tiki bar server and the breakfast lady, all of whom were extremely pleasant and helpful. The breakfast was a wonderful expanded continental breakfast that included French toast (heat up yourself in the toaster). The airplanes did not bother us. In fact, we enjoyed watching the fighter planes from the nearby military base practice while we sat at the tiki bar. We didn't use the pool next to the bar but several groups, mostly families with young children, seemed to enjoy it. Right after getting our room, we caught the Olde Town Trolley tour. The trolley stopped right in front of the hotel lobby (stop #8). We purchased e-tickets tickets online before we left home and saved about $3/person. Since we got on in the middle of the route, we switched trolleys in Mallory Square to finish the tour. The 1 \u00c2\u00bd hour tour is a great way to get acquainted with Key West. The drivers are very entertaining and informative. You'll need a car to get around the island when the trolley isn't running, but parking was not a problem. We paid $10 to park in a lot off Duval Street for the evening while we did the usual touristy things \u00e2\u20ac\u201c eat dinner and take in the entertainment at Sloppy Joe's, have a drink at Irish Kevin's and walk around Duval Street.

It was the largest hotel room I have ever stayed in, with two large queen beds, plenty of storage, just newly renovated, good quality furniture, a desk for the free high speed wireless internet access for those of you (like us) who may still ahve to work while on holiday with our laptop. The balcony was lovely with very nice furniture as opposed to the usual plastic chairs on balconies and the view was amazing of the Atlantic Ocean. The continental breakfast included was lovely and surprisingly plenty of options, just expected coffee and muffins, but a good selection of cereals, breads, muffins, cakes and fruit was supplied as well as hard boiled eggs. There was also a resident friendly racoon outside on the deck who waited every morning for tit-bits from the children. We chose this hotel because it said \"Ocean front\" and it certainly was Ocean Front but we thought it meant on the beach, unfortunately what we did not realise was that Key West did not have any real beaches as such, only a couple of man-made ones. The pool was lovely and again the photos on the web site did not do it justice, it was large, with plenty of sunbeds, pool bar with a great selection of food on offer and free pool towels which you got from reception. Although the hotel was a little way from the ation and the centre of town i.e. Duval Street, it was only a 5-10 minute beautiful drive to there so was not a problem. Also there are buses and the local tour guide bus which stop directly outside the hotel for hose of you who do not wish to drive. Duval Street was great to see with it's restaurants and bars and Mallory Square was great fun with it's sunset view and street entertainers. We spent 5 nights on Key West at the Key Ambassador and really enjoyed our stay there, would definately recommend this hotel. Staff were wonderful too, immediately helpful and polite from the recption down to maintenance and cleaners.", "Date": "September 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago,IL", "Title": "\u201cWonderful\u201d", "Author": "jjrugs88", "ReviewID": "UR8139288", "Content": "This was a great hotel.
