VERY small rooms, plasticky furniture, quite close to the freeway. It's noisy. Lots of kids. Breakfast is about what you'd expect at a family motel. The shuttle service is nice, and the parking is cramped but free (similar hotels in Seattle charge about $30 per day).

Hotel Nexus was a perfect spot for us. It is not super high end, however, it was very clean and staff was very friendly and they have done a good job restoring what looks like an older motel. The price was fair, for what it was. The location is just north of downtown, by about 15 minutes or so. However, they have a free shuttle to go pretty much to any of the tourist areas. I do suggest scheduling your shuttle pick up in the hotel BEFORE you depart. They took my husband and I downtown the evening before we left on our cruise, and to the pier 91 for the cruise and picked us up after the cruise also!! We did tip the driver a small amount, but didn't see too many other passengers do so. But, we figured a small tip is still cheaper than a taxi. I would suggest if you want to go to Pikes, not to go to their recommended drop off of (I believe it was 6th), but to go to the Pier 66 stop (I think that was the stop), and walk up to Pikes, vs. the 6-8 blocks that they recommended. The pier 66 stop seemed closer!! But both were fine. The breakfast was decent, beds were comfortable, staff friendly, good shuttle. I would stay here again without a second thought!! I didn't notice any traffic noise, but our room was located on the back side. Starbucks was right across the street (fairly busy street), and it shares a parking lot with a restaurant, which we didn't get to try to our dismay!

Maid service was efficient, but spastic. That is, while my room was cleaned every day, I kept getting fewer and fewer towels restocked. On the last day, there was no bath mat. This is not a problem, just odd. I do applaud this hotel's efforts to be more \"green.\" WIFI was a significant problem. One would expect that staying in or around Seattle, the Paris of personal computers with Microsoft headquartering here, Internet would be ubiquitous, fast, and efficient. Not so much. I was able to pick up a signal in the room, but had very, VERY sporadic service. I often had to refresh pages to get them load correctly. Even GMail was having trouble connecting.... There is a restaurant in the parking lot, Saffron, which serves Mediterranian and Middle-Eastern food. Room service from the place is also available in the hotel.

The potential is here for a retro \"boutique\" style property; but at the moment it is far from retro, unless the definition of retro is tired and worn with slaps of 60's style colors. It resembles a motor inn and not a hotel style at all. The rooms are very basic: with a crowded sink/microwave/mini-fridge area, old style TV's, very spotty WiFi connections and the old fashioned heater/ac units under the window.The bathroom is small and when we checked into our room, towels and hand soaps were missing. I do have to give kudos to the staff for getting our missing amenities to the room very quickly. While we were there, a group of teens were there for a conference and over two nights, it was ridiculously noisy with running on the outdoor hallways late into the night and van alarms going off at 7am. My sister was a few doors down and was up til 3am listening to a ruckus on the floor above them; she finally went down to the front desk after repeated calls to the desk didn't address the problem. We did use the shuttle to get to Safeco Field and it was great getting there. Coming home, there seemed to be some confusion as to how many were going back, with not enough vans or seats available to porter us back. We stood around while the hotel staff tried to figure it out and finally after about 20 minutes all were accommodated. This shuttle confusion continued the next day when we tried to use the shuttle to get to Pike Place Market. I had put our name in at the front desk about an hour prior to the scheduled departure and when the time came, again the staff seemed confused as to where they would put the people in the couple vans that were going to various places. Had they kept us all updated of what they were trying to do instead of running in and out of the hotel lobby and looking confused, it would have been a lot less aggravating standing in the driveway awaiting some kind of direction. When they asked where we were going and what our room number was, the driver couldn't find it on his clipboard and this seemed to confuse them even more. We finally gave up after waiting 30 minutes and took a cab into Pike Place Market. They really need a more organized method for their shuttles so they could run more efficiently. We decided to cut our stay short by a day and checked out the third morning; the front desk staff did seem slightly apologetic but basically said that the noise they had with the teen group had cost them some business and remarked to me \"I guess we won't be seeing you at this hotel again.\" No, I don't think you will.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "usa", "Title": "\u201cLarge rooms,free shuttle service\u201d", "Author": "3bear", "ReviewID": "UR115828163", "Content": "We stayed here before and after a cruise.

So for this reason, I would definitely not recommend staying at this hotel. Which reminds me, why is it a hotel when the doors are on the outside? The comforter had a stain on it in plain sight that looked like seman or some other bodily fluid. Now I always take off the bedspread immediately anyway because I know a lot of hotels do not wash these in between each guest but come on...if there's a stain in plain sight i think you should wash it. Also, I don't even think they wash the blue blanket on the bed because when I saw them cleaning other rooms they did not take away the old blankets and they did not have any clean blue blankets on their carts. The good news is they were changing the sheets at least. The bathroom had strands of hair on the shower walls and on the bathroom floor (wasn't my hair), and all around the ledge of the tile was built up dust. The toilet was also not thoroughly cleaned...the part where the toilet seat and cover is attached to the toilet had some kind of white crud caked on it. Also, the hair dryer had dirt or makeup smeared on the handle, so they obviously do not clean this in between guests either. So, overall I guess it just depends on what your definition of clean is, but this hotel was unacceptable to me. We had room 303 and our other family members had the room next door (to the right from the outside). We paid $100 per room for one night. To be fair, our family who stayed in the other room did not have any complaints.

Everything was accessible from the computers to the breakfast area. After we found our rooms, my daughter found the joy in jumping from one bed to the other. (she can't do this at home). Everything in the room met my needs especially how clean the room was. This hotel had some of the softest beds I've slept in for a hotel. I was pleased. The next day, we experienced the breakfast. This was Sunday and on this day, they serve bisquits and gravy. There was also a choice of 3 cold cereals, yogurt, assortment of bagels and bread, fruits, juice, coffee, milk, and of course the famous belgian waffles. This was the best breakfast I've ever seen in a hotel for not being a restaurant. Before leaving our room for the day, the maid came by. I asked her not to worry bout the beds but we needed cups and the garbage taken out. She didn't quite understand what I was saying, a little English/Spanish barrier, but she was incredibly nice. Sunday night, my daughter (my valentine) went to the restaurant in the parking lot. Saffron Grill. The food was amazing and we didn't have to walk/drive anywhere. After going to bed, I did have a neighbor above me that would fall down every 5 or so steps with a loud \"thud\". This happened most of the night but I reminded myself we were in a hotel.

The rooms are very large and we had plenty of space to put out 4 suitcases and carry on's and spread out a bit even. Bathroom is a bit small, however there is a 15 minute timer heat lamp for when you get out of the shower or bath which is very nice. Water pressure is great and temperature can be as hot or cold as you want it. The vanity area is nice, but the sink pressure is a bit weak and the water is split out into a lot of small jets instead of one stream. Big plus in the room is the small refrigerator and microwave along with a coffee maker. We did not use the last 2 items but the refrigerator was great! Airco/heater units are a bit dated, but quiet and cool or heat your room pretty fast. Check in was simple and fast even when arriving at 8pm at night. The first room we got had a problem with the bottom of the door,which the maintenance guy on duty said he could not fix on his shift and went back to the front desk and got us another room within 5-10 minutes. We had 2 other minor issues which were responded to quickly during the day. Houskeeping starts at 8am, but does not check occupied rooms until after 9am. Very friendly staff and they keep the rooms spotless during your stay. Check out was fast, but the bell carts were nowhere to be found and a housekeeping person had to go look for one which took 10-15 minutes. That was the only down side. Wireless internet is fast in the room with excellent signal strength as there is a repeater on every floor. There are 2 older desktop pc's in the lobby that are free to use, however being public pc's there is no privacy programs to erase your history or filed in field entries. The CPU fans get very noisy when there are a lot of graphics being displayed. However web browsing is very fast! No charge to use them or to print documents out. A very nice thing to have. Lobby was spotless and modern and lots of daylight. Continental breakfast is good, you can make you own \"Belgian\" waffles, fresh fruit, eggs of various styles each day and bacon or sausage to go with them. Menu varies each day with waffles being the main item. Coffee and juice are also available. Wireless internet if you need it, with plug in's around the walls. Big screen TV's tuned to CNN. Breakfast is from 6-10am each day. We did not use the restaurant. Location is great, just off of I-5 at Northgate. Short distance to the mall from the hotel.

I am a big Seahawks fan and had a friend coming in from the UK that is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153massive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd NFL fan from afar. She had never been to an NFL game so my wife and I wanted to take my brother-in-law and her to Seattle for an experience. My wife and her brother are no football for sure but this experience had both of them wanting more. I had been sourcing tickets through e-bay and Craig\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s List but was looking at about $100 for any ticket no matter its location in the stadium. Adding hotel on top of that and we were getting to be very pricey. It was only in the eleventh hour that I Googled \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Seattle Seahawks game and hotel\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and came across a couple of options including this package offered by Nexus Hotel. The others were over priced and just out of my range. I called the Nexus and spoke with Sarah who was more than helpful and accommodating with my questions and requests. It was when she said that it would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153$213 per couple\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that I asked how much was the hotel on top of that assuming that the $213 was for the Seahawks tickets. I was pleasantly shocked when Sarah stated \u00e2\u20ac\u0153that includes a night in the hotel and transport to and from the game\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Getting to Seattle and finding the Nexus was easy as pie using Google Maps. The Nexus is right off of the I-5 and can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be missed. With the Seahawks package we all received a collector\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s glass (nice touch) and a coupon for a free beverage at the Saphron restaurant next door. Now this is a motel set up with each room having a door to the outside world but it met expectations and passed them in terms of cleanliness and the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153continental breakfast\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. My wife checks for bed bugs wherever we go and this place was clean and had a recent remodel it looked like. We had two rooms for the four of and each of them had queen sized beds, a fridge and a microwave (those two were bonus items to us). Parking was ample and again\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 location, location, location! The next day was the Seahawks game and it was a bit confusing to find out when and where the bus left from as some of the staff had no idea but in hind sight the bus leaves at 10:30am and it goes from right out front of the hotel. On the bus is where we met our self-proclaimed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153party hostess\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and she had the most-est! Randi-Sue was a big Seahawks fan and it showed, she was enthusiastic and excited and she got the bus going and ready for the game. The fact they also brought along some beers for all of us to enjoy on route the game was just another bonus that we hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expected. It was a short 20 minute ride to Qwest field but longer would have been ok too as the beer was cold and FREE! Randi-Sue took an interest in everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s experience and when she learned that I had three NFL virgins with me she offered us her discount card at the merchandise shops that offered us 15% off of souvenirs. Thanks again Randi-Sue! My English friend and I made good use of it and spent a couple hundred dollars on jerseys, towels, scarves, a jersey for her dog and countless other souvenirs. The fan experience at Qwest Field is second to none and my voice was horse for days after yelling and having a wonderful time for four hours during the game. The Seahawks were horrible this game but the experience of an NFL game at Qwest Field made for some awesome memories and my wife and my brother-in-law are asking when we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going again already! We got back to the hotel after the game (thanks for waiting for us Randi-Sue while we shopped) and went to the Saphron for our free beers. We were expecting to have a full meal there as it was dinner time but when we walked in the owner and the staff were meeting and the owner looked at us like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153how could you come in the restaurant right now\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. We sat at the bar and ordered our drinks and spoke with the bartender who was less than impressed with the owner. Most of the other staff were moping around like their dog had been shot so needless to say we had our drinks and left. We asked the staff at the Nexus where we should go next and they pointed us in the direction of the Ram Pub. Awesome place to have some great bar food, some cold drinks and the service and atmosphere was what we were looking for. Upon check out the Nexus could have some more staff (more than one) at the counter for 11:00am on a Monday but I finally got my receipts only to have a phone call hours later that I was under charged. As it turned out they had over charged my credit card but when I called Sarah to sort it out she again was more than helpful and had the charges reversed in an instant.

There are some good things and some not so good things about this hotel. I chose the hotel primarily for the location and for the fact that they provide a shuttle to the Childrens Hospital (as well as other area hospitals and attractions) where I was visiting. The good things about the location are the proximity to the freeway, and the Northgate mall. Also there is a very good restaurant next door. The bad things about the location are the proximity to the freeway (noisy) and the fact that the hotel is located on a busy road that connects to the freeway. The best thing about the hotel itself was the housekeeping staff. The room was very clean, the housekeepers were friendly and I never woke up to the sound of housekeeping calling to each other or vacuuming next door like I have had in some hotels. In fact, the housekeeping staff were the friendliest people at the hotel. The front desk staff, one in particular, were cold and not so efficient (almost as if they just didnt care) and unfriendly to the point of being rude. I noticed this with all the guests, not just myself. The other not so good things about the hotel was the look from the outside - very like a budget motel, with the rooms on several levels with their entry doors along a corridor on the outside facing the street (which is not always secure) and the outside just had a shabby tired look. One of the most frustrating incidents involved the internet access. The hotel boasts high speed internet in all the rooms. I was able to get online on Thursday but not at all on Friday or Saturday - it seems the hotel was full and the internet was busy and the signal was very weak. It was very frustrating as I was not able to be online again until Sunday morning. The hotel was very noisy, you could hear the guests in all the surrounding rooms, and while this is not the fault of the hotel, I had an upstairs neighbor who paced his floor (my ceiling) ALL NIGHT LONG for both Thursday and Friday night. Overall, I would not recommend this hotel. I was not in one of the premium rooms with the soaker tub however, but for the amenites and room I had here, you could get a room at another hotel for a better price, like an 8 or Motel6.", "Date": "May 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Victoria, BC", "Title": "\u201cPerfect for the game\u201d", "Author": "Victoria_BCMark", "ReviewID": "UR12475419", "Content": "My son and I stayed at the Nexus overnight from Victoria BC.
