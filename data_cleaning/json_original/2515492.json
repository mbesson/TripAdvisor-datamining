The hotel was recommened as it was close to the wedding venue and affordable. It was a place to sleep, and that was fine, but the trip could've been better. The directions on the website stated to exit the I-15 at Rancho Bernardo Drive. We figured that you must be able to see the hotel from the freeway, which you can, if you're heading north, which we were not. Also, the hotel is not located on Rancho Bernardo Drive, but Bernardo Center Drive...did I mention that every street in this town has the word Bernardo in it? Good thing we had GPS in our phones. The Hilton is located in the same center as a spinal rehabilitation/hospital place, and some restaurants. After a nine hour drive, we just wanted to put our things down and get a late dinner...except the check in parking was blocked by Hilton shuttles, left unattended. We trudged up to check in, and the woman was nice, but not helpful. After telling us our room was located in \"the middle of the hotel,\" she told us we could park \"anywhere.\" Mind you, this hotel is in a complex with other businesses, so after being reminded of that, she suddenly remembered that Hilton parking was \"that way,\" with a friendly point. These spots are very small and close together, so I would not park directly next to another car unless you must. After getting to our room, I realized we would need a late check out, as the wedding didn't start until three. When asked if we could have a late check out, the clerk answered, \".....ummmmmm.....\" and twirled her hair. I asked if we could leave at two, and she said, \"Yeah, that could work. Two!\" and that was that. No note on the computer, no reprogramming my key, nothing. The room itself was fine. The carpet was a bit stained, but the beds were clean and I slept fine. The walls were thin, but our neighbors were quiet (I actually feared that we may have bothered them, instead). Busy wedding morning, and we came back to our room to change. Except our key wouldn't let us back in the hotel. Because we had a late check out, but no one made a notation of it. Back to the front desk, where we asked for a new key. Didn't ask our names, didn't ask for ID, just reprogrammed the key. Finally, time to check out. But, alas, we had already checked out. At noon.

There were a couple of other problems, the auto closing bathroom doors can be an annoyance until I figured out my shoe would stop it, the bathroom sink drain ran real slow. The room was located so I got great deal of noise from the freeway and it was not a peaceful rest. The morning breakfast staff was attentive and the food was very good.

An unexpected glitch happened our first evening, Thursday, when all our guests wanted to stay in our suite and talk and we had no food for the mulitudes' suppers. We called The Pegasus Cafe across the street and they hurriedly put together a wonderful and memorable Greek feast for all of us within a couple of hours. Much later we went down to the bar which is very comfortable , quiet and intimate.The young bartenders were fantastic dealing with our group.

You can also at no extra charge, get made to order gourmet omelets with a variety of herbs, cheeses, meats and avacodo. I also saw other people ordering pancakes and bisuits and gravy with sausage and bacon. It was also nice that although you kind of serve yourself, there was a waitstaff providing you with coffee and hot chocolate with refills. Anyone with children like us can always appreciate a hotel like this. The only negative thing I have to say is the hotel is not romantic, which was fine since we had our two kids.

We were in San Diego for a week & needed a place for two nights before moving to Coronado for a business conference. Knew the Rancho Bernardo area as we had been several times before to visit family. We had a car & wanted to explore the coast on up to Laguna Beach. This location suited us for the short term. All that being said..... If you are coming to San Diego to tour San Diego I would not stay in this location. It is far from the tourist action as in Sea World, Old Town, Coronado, Balboa Park etc.... This hotel is better suited for the business traveler, large groups, or someone with reason to be in the Rancho Bernardo area. The hotel was a typical Hilton Garden Inn. The lobby was bright & attractive with several seating areas. The rooms were new & fresh. Nice size bathroom. Friendly staff The downside was the NOISE! Very loud place to be. The freeway noise was terrible. We could not see the freeway from our room as our room faced an apartment complex. Even with the buffer of another building the noise was horrible. In the past I have lived close to an airport as well as a freeway & the noise never bothered me. In this location the freeway noise was loud & constant to the point of bothersome. As far as restaurants, the hotel has their own restaurant. There are two chain restaurants in the same complex. Souplantation & Stir Fresh (a Mongolian Restaurant). We ate at Stir Fresh and enjoyed it. Overall we liked the Hilton Garden Inn.

But the noise level from both the freeway outside and the hallways inside drove us crazy, so it was a disappointing stay. Without the noise, we would have rated it about average. The hotel is smack-dab right against a huge freeway, and even having a room away from the freeway side didn't help much. During our weeklong stay, the housekeeping staff were incredibly noisy, talking and even routinely yelling up and down the hallways at all hours (including at 7 am, waking up everyone within earshot). The location is remote from most things you'd want to do in San Diego (we grew up there and go back frequently). It's nearly an hour from La Jolla, 45 minutes (depending on traffic) from downtown. The suburban neighborhood is about what you'd expect -- shopping malls, chain restaurants, lots of big parking lots. It's also a very hot, inland location -- averaging 10-15 degrees hotter than the coastal areas.
