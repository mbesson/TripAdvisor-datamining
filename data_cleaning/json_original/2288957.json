The next morning we left round about 8am and clearled the room hoping that upon our return we will find a cleaned room. This was not the case when we came back for the evening at around 9 pm. The floor was clearly not hooverd and pieces of paper were evident on the dusty carpet. Glasses that we had used the previous night were still unchanged on the table where we left them. The bathroom wasalso dirty and unmoped with no evidence of any effort at cleaning whatsoever.We appreciate as Premier Inn suggests we could re-use our bed linen and towels , but the utmost disregard for even the most basic of room service was trully astounding. Because it was already late anyway when we came we did'nt bother calling reception to 'fixit' as this would have caused us unnecessary inconvience at that hour. As an asthmatic I kept sneezing all night from the clearly dusty environment I and my fiance found ourselves in. This continued right to the next morning when we finally checked out. To compound our already nasty experience , when we reported our concerns to the lady at reception (Lucie) she seemed clearly unbortherd and dimissive and seemed less intertested in hearing what we had to say showing an atitude similar to the one conveyed by her colleague (a bearded gentleman who walked away from the post and clearly disinterested in what we were sayingto his colleage when my fiance was still talking).

Finally i got seated next to the kitchen and I had to wait another 10 min before somebody even comes and hands in a menu. Drinks took ages to to come although 3 restaurant staff were polishing knifes and only one was serving customers. Drinks finally came and starters took another 20 min to arrive. I tried to talk to somebody about the delay of service but nobody would even listen so they kept on telling me your food will be with you shortly. For main course I had a mixed grill and went for the option of getting large chips for the price of 95p more and requested not to have grilled tomatoes and pees and have more mushrooms instead. When the order came 15 min later the meal came as standard, no large chips with pees and grilled tomatoes. I asked them why r they serving me this and the waitress said that there is probably a misunderstanding in the kitchen a she took my plate away and I had to wait another 10 min to get it back. Meanwhile I also ordered another glass of wine and it came when I was just about to finish my mixed grill. While all that chaos was happening around there was a waitress which was not even thought to walk properly as she was walking to the kitchen every time I was having the feeling that there is an earthquake. Ordered the desert and it came fairly quick (bout 5 min) and this time was the right thing. When I requested the bill I had to wait for about 10 min and when it arrived it was wrong, they tried to charge me for 3 glasses of wine rather than two and for two LARGE mixed grills. This is when I wanted to talk to a manager about the service but there was none around so they corrected my bill and I went to my room.

As there was myself, my husband and my 15 year old son, this represented great value. Many London hotels are only for two or kids are classed as under 12. We arrived at Liverpool Street Station so great to jump on the Central line straight to Stratford. We got to Stratford just before 10pm so shops were shut, therefore it was easy to get through mall with luggage. As other reviewers have said it is a decent walk but that was ok for us. Also, as others had said it was hard to find I rang the hotel the day before to let them know we would be a late check-in and get directions. I was told the entrance was on the ground floor-it is in fact on the lower ground floor but this is the level you enter the mall on from the tube. It is past Waitrose and follow signs for car park A. Turn right instead of entering car park and go around the corner to entrance.Do use the lift between the entrance and reception as it is 25 metres up with over a hundred stairs.Couldn't use self-serve check-in but was checked in really quickly at desk. Room was on fourth floor-all brand spanking new and this made the price we paid even better value-there was a bath instead of just a shower which was lovely to be able to have a soak after lots of walking. There was a soap dispenser for the sink and body wash for the bath, both of which were well-known and popular brands. We had taken our own toiletries as I didn't expect there to be any, but used these too. We went straight down to bar as food was served until 10.30pm. Bar food prices were reasonable- about six pounds for paninis and baguettes, add a bowl of chips for 1.50. Food was fresh, hot and tasty. Had ice and water from the bar to take to our room. Key card operated the lift from Reception to rooms which made us feel safe. Rang Reception to ask for an extra mug, towels and milk-they were sent up very quickly. Only asked for one key card but needed a second one on the second night when hubby and son went to cinema-this card didn't work properly so was changed at Reception.Missed breakfast on the first morning by the time we'd had a lie-in and all had a shower. Lots of places to eat in mall, so this wasn't a problem. However, next day had breakfast in the hotel-very busy and had to queue. As breakfast was served till 11am and it was getting close to that I asked George who was on the till if we would still be able to get everything. He explained that as it was so busy the chef would keep cooking until everyone had eaten. It was difficult for the staff to keep up with replacing everything-bowls, plates, juices and cooked items but they worked really hard and some people may have got annoyed but hey it's half term weekend so it's just best to be patient and understand that the staff can only do so much. Without exception, all the staff at this hotel were pleasant, sociable and an absoulute credit to the company they work for. We are quite well-travelled both in the UK and abroad and quite honestly I cannot give enough praise both to the staff and this hotel in general. I would recommend it to others without hesitation-just remember it is not a central London location but within easy reach. The mall has everything you could need-we shopped here for clothes for our son, ate on our first morning, went to the cinema, bought drinks for our room and food for while we were on the move and our journey home from Waitrose and Greggs. Whilst there is still a lot of building work going on around the hotel we weren't disturbed by this at all. We all slept well in our comfy beds, my son even wanted to take a pillow home with him!

What I didn't know was that it was going to be about 1/4-1/2 mile walk either through the mall or around the mall through the outside shops. I wish I had known this and I might have gotten a taxi.

You have to take the elevator to the reception area. Reception was quick and painless and the people very friendly. Internet is 3 pounds a day or 10 pounds for a week's worth (you get a code on a card). You can share this card between a family or friends in the same room. Rooms are somewhat small but we had a nice view of the Olympic Stadium. Bed was super comfy. Food- We didn't eat the breakfast because 8 pounds works out to be 13 dollars a person for Americans and we didn't want to spend $26 on breakfast. McDonald's and Subway are open inside the mall for breakfast and both of us together had breakfast for 7 pounds. There are many many other restaurants in the mall during the day, I recommend \"Tortilla\" it is a Mexican place (Intl food court) reasonably priced that is like a \"Chipotle Mexican Grill\" and the Chicago Rib place had decent ribs but not with a sit-down price.

Tricia in particular was really helpful and genuinely interested in how we were enjoying our break; my husband asked for soya milk at breakfast on our first day and she remembered the next morning without being prompted. Such a small thing but it made us feel special. Like other visitors we probably would have struggled to find the hotel but there's an information point just inside the Westfields shopping centre and we simply asked there and found the hotel no problem. We came on the Circle line tube from St Pancras and had no problems getting to the hotel. We took the high speed train into London one day just to check it out but it's cheaper and more fun to catch the tube, probably quicker too as you can get a direct tube into the city centre without having to go to St Pancras, where the high speed train goes to. The Westfield Centre had a fantastic selection of food outlets and restaurants; they've really gone for the Olympic theme with food from all over the world - only problem you might have is trying to decide where to eat. There's also a cinema and casino and one of the restaurants even has ten pin bowling lanes.

In no way do I mean it in a negative manner. This hotel was by far the cheapest of the well known brands within London. I stayed with my wife for her birthday, and the criteria for the hotel, was for it be located in either zone 1 or as close as possible to it and in a quiet location. The latter is going to be rare in London. This hotel was in zone 3. Its a slight problem, but not a major issue. For the difference in price, I think the distance is compensated for. It is very quiet, but may not be during the olympics. The hotel isn't a 5 star hotel, and no way does it try to be. It is very clean, very quiet and just like any other Premier Inn hotel. No issues with the hotel. The room The room itself was clean, well maintained, in a good condition of repair. Just what you'd expect. No moans about the room, besides a couple, which is personal to myself, therefore will not be mentioned on here. Premier Inn have been made aware of it. Despite the smokescreen I have left above, it does not detract from me ever staying at a Premier Inn hotel, and nor should it stop others. I have stayed on numerous occasions, and this would be by far the best room/hotel I have stayed in, within the Premier Inn hotels. Really couldn;t complain about the room. Food Only had breakfast, which was satisfactory. Not as good as other breakfasts I have had at other Premier Inn hotels. The buffer bar, for the first time I have seen unmanned. Other Premier Inn hotels, (in which I have stayed at), have always been manned. Not a gripe, just an observation. The buffet bar seemed to have less choice than other Premier Inn hotels. Maybe a company policy change, or just this hotel. Food was not great, but for the price, it was OK. Staff Cannot fault the staff at all. All very polite, well dressed, approachable. Not much more to say about the staff. Didn't need to speak to them about any problems/faults, so cannot say how they would react or respond when things aren't as smooth running. Overall, the Premier Inn Stratford is good. Not great, as I believe you need to be a good 5 star hotel to achieve a 'great'. Its location is ok, if your prepared to catch and underground and a DLR, at the minimum to get it, and still a 2 minute walk from the station. Its right next to the Westfield Stratford shopping centre, which is massive, and has pretty much everything you need, in terms of retail/clothing/banking etc etc etc. I'd definately stay at this, or any other Premier Inn hotel again. Its probably a definate if you have young kids.

This needs to be resolved as there is no mini-bar in the rooms to store milk (can be purchased for \u00a31 per glass) and also there are no self service heating facilities which makes it highly inconvenient if you have young children that demand warm milk at silly hours, like mine!", "Date": "December 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Corby, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFantastic location, great budget hotel\u201d", "Author": "michelle w", "ReviewID": "UR122190875", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel on 22-24 December for an xmas break in London with our two children.

I had read the previous reviews and so headed to the Waitrose end of the shopping centre. Following these instructions, we found the hotel very easily. You simply walk past the supermarket and outside to the right. As previously mentioned the reception is on the first floor. As soon as we alighted from the lift, we were greeted by Sue, who processed our booking efficiently and with excellent customer care skills. I had asked for a high floor and the room we checked into was perfect, large with a big window. The car parking was a bit of a nightmare. As we had arrived around 16.15, we initially received two hours free parking until 18.00 hrs. It then costs \u00a32 from 18.00 hrs until 07.59 the following morning. We then had to set our alarm clock for this time in order for my husband to take the car off the car park and re-park it, when you then receive a further 2 hours free parking. For a full 24 hr period, it actually costs \u00a326 and there is no free parking allowance for the disabled. As we were travelling into London for the full day, Sue (receptionist) had instructed us to leave the car on the Premier Inn car park at Redbridge, which has free parking. We then caught the tube into London and as we did'nt return until after midnight, parking the car again at Stratford only amounted to \u00a36 overnight, when we then removed the car again at 09.00 and replaced it for a further two hours free parking until checkout at 10.30. As I previously mentioned, you can get round the high parking charges, but it is quite stressful, which is not really you want on a relaxing break. Breakfast each morning was very good. Plenty of selection and you could order eggs of your choice. My only disappointment, was the beds. Nice and large, but very hard. I myself suffer with a bad back and have a memory foam topper at home. Although I am used to a firm mattress, it really was very uncomfortable and I did'nt sleep well at all. When however I mentioned this to John on reception the next morning, he immediately apologised and refunded me for one of the nights. I would definately stay at this hotel again when visiting London, though I would probably not take the car. The shopping centre is brilliant and visiting the cinema was a great experience. I cannot fault any of the staff who dealt with us, they were all extremely friendly, whilst professional. I must apologise to John for not tipping him on departure. I had every intention of doing so for his excellent services, but unfortuanately the nuisance car parking machine had taken the last money I had in my purse.", "Date": "December 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baltimore", "Title": "\u201cNeeds to work out the kinks\u201d", "Author": "bmoregirl", "ReviewID": "UR121973005", "Content": "We stayed here for 3 nights in late October. They had just opened the month before so the entire staff was extremely nice and helpful. Check in was lengthly but pleasant. Would definatley try to use the kiosks for express check in next time, but we had booked the breakfast and dinner combo and needed vouchers. We reserved two beds, but when we got to the room there was only one bed. Calling down to the front desk they said they would send someone up to give us keys to another room with two beds. 30 minutes later no one came, so we went back down to the front desk. We got a new room and when we entered again no second bed, but a sofa. Calling down again confused, they said the sofa was made into a bed. Housekeeping came about 15 minutes later and put a sheet and pillow on the sofa. It is not large but can fit one person. Breakfast was delicious definately worth the price and dinner was good as well. We had booked the dinner/breakfast combo for all three days but we decided to not use this on the last day and getting refunded became quite a hassle and confusing process. The credit went to a different room and receptionist kept asking a receipt which was never given to me, because they like to email it to you directly. After about an hour of working through getting a refund we were successful but was quite time consuming. The area the hotel is in is great as there are lots of dining and shopping options. The transit is also wonderful as it is on the tube and has a train that goes right to St. Pancreas. So fast and cheap to get from the Eurostar to the hotel. Beware on Sundays if you're trying to get to St. Pancreas for an early Eurostar that no local National Rail (Southeastern I believe) does not run before 10am.

We found the hotel easily as we had done some prior research to find out which car park was closest to the hotel (car park A). We soon found a space as on each level had a board telling you how many spaces were available per level and they also had lights on the roof next to each space that changed colour as to the availability of a space, green for available and red for taken. We entered the hotel on the ground floor and then went up to the first floor in the lift where the reception and the restaurant are located. They have lectern style check in desks and they both had customers at them being served so we used the self-check in units behind the two desks. The self-check in was an ok but we had to input details of all four of us and the machine also issued four keys. It would have been better if we could have been asked how many keys we required and why they need all of the people names in the room. I have stayed in many hotels and only premier inn ask the names of all of the occupants. We made our way up to our room on the 9th floor, we had a good view over looking the station and forthcoming Olympic site but we had an even numbered room, I think if you have an odd numbered room you will be over looking the stadium with central London behind. The room was nice and understated. Premier Inn seemed to have toned down the purple and brown wood branding into something a bit more contempory; there were white and beige walls with a painting on the wall. We stayed in one of their older properties last year and the room did look quite old fashioned. The room also had air conditioning, which was a bonus. The room was a good but not over generous size with a king size bed and two separate beds for the children all lined up next to one another, like one massive bed. There wasn\u2019t much noise apart from the high speed trains going along the rail link to Europe about every hour or so. There is quite a lot of constriction around the site at the moment but the railway track was between the athlete\u2019s village and us so we didn\u2019t get any noise from the there. We had dinner at Giraffe restaurant; one of many in the Westfield centre, there is lots of choice there so you don\u2019t have to dine in the hotels restaurant. The hotel is part of the complex but you still have to go outside for about 25 meters to get inside so you still may need a coat if it was very cold or raining as you will get wet if it is raining. It would have been better if you could gain access without going outside like so many shopping malls in North America. We all had a good sleep, as there were blackout curtains in the room and nice comfy beds. The breakfast was good and fairly good value at \u00a37.99 each for adults with under 16\u2019s eating for free. I don\u2019t know how easy it is to get into central London by tube but if you are planning to leave your car there you will be charged all the time the car is parked. Our charge for 21 hours was \u00a314.00 with allegedly two hours free parking and a \u00a32.00 overnight charge; I did not get a receipt so the charging structure is a bit of a mystery. The hotel does not have its own car park so you will park with all of the shoppers. The staff were all very good and very professional and the hotel easy to get to. I would recommend this hotel for its ease of access by car and the additional shops, restaurants and leisure activities (cinema, ten pin bolwing, ice rink in winter & a really good free Santa\u2019s grotto) if you need to be in East London and can get a good rate.", "Date": "December 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow, Scotland", "Title": "\u201cPerfect London Base for a Mini Break!\u201d", "Author": "JulesMcC78", "ReviewID": "UR121945320", "Content": "We stayed with the hotel for 3 nights over the last weekend in December before Christmas and we had a great stay. We wanted somewhere that had good transport access and as we would be out and about we didn't need to spend needless pennies on accommodation to be in the heart of the city. The location was easy to get to, we flew in from Stanstead, took the National Express coach which drops you off at the main Westfields entrance, easy! You can then either walk round the side of the centre to the hotel ot through the shopping mall like we did, if you do that aim for the John Lewis/Waitrose side of the centre. The centre is mammoth and it took us a moment to get our bearings. You can exit the centre on the ground floor close to the Waitrose entrance and head to the right, the Premier Inn Entrance is just outside. We arrived earlier than the check-in time and met by really lovely check in staff who were happy to take our bags for us and store them until we came back. So it was easy to have a shop wander, grab some food then go back to check-in. We made a request to be in a room with a view of the Olympic Stadium etc and the staff were glad to assist. For reference the odd room numbers have the view and our's was excellent, we were on the 10th floor. Our room was perfect for our stay, not lots of clothing storage but to be honest no big problem there. Bathroom was a good size too and was well maintained. On the whole clean, tidy and ideal for what we needed. The public areas of the hotel were really nice and plesant to sit in. We didn't do breakfast in the hotel but did grab a pizza and some drinks on one night and it hit the spot! Really liked that they had a nice festive drinks menu and again the staff made sure they checked that we were happy with everything we had. During the stay the staff couldn't have been more accommodating or helpful, all seemed happy to be there which always helps in the hospitality industry!! Transport wise, the rail/underground links were great, access to the DLR and the central line. Stratford station is approx 5/10 min walk through the mall, it doesn't feel long at all as like me you'll probably be window shopping en route! All in all a really good base for our trip and it was a bonus being able to wander the mall and see what it had to offer too.

If you come by car the hotel is hard to find as the online directions do not give enough detail of how to reach the car parks, exactly where it's best to park and how to get from the car park on foot to the main hotel entrance. If you approach from Car Park A round the outside it is quite gloomy and badly lit, which doesn't help. The hotel entrance is anonymous - no staff, no welcome signs - unlike other Premier Inns. The lift to Reception can take ages to arrive but don't use the stairs, which, as they warn you, have well over 100 steps. When we arrived at the upstairs Reception, the 'lectern' style reception desks were empty and staff preoccupied with other people's problems. However, when we did meet staff later they were very friendly and helpful - and the best feature of our experience here. The automated check-in works best with the booking reference, not your card! The two rooms we used were smaller than expected and did not match the expectations fostered by current advertising. One of them was badly designed and laid out so we didn't have room to store more than cabin sized luggage. It was uncomfortable for more than an overnight stay, rather claustrophobic, with a very narrow window, low ceiling and not enough space for Lenny Henry to swing a cat! Even the bed seemed smaller than in other Premier Inns. The 2nd room was also a bit cramped for a family. The cot we booked was in a small space by the window. In trying to move the over-long net curtain to keep our grandchild safe while letting her see out of the window, the curtain pole sprang loose and hit me in the head causing swelling & bruising that took 3 weeks to subside. The fact that this could have happened to a small child - or pierced my eye, which it just missed - concerned me greatly. I spoke to a member of staff who promised to notify the management. She was friendly, efficient and prompt in offering a full refund. None of us had slept as a result of the shock of the accident and the overheating. However, no-one contacted me subsequently to check that I had recovered fully or to reassure us that steps would be taken to fix the sprung-loaded curtain tracks properly to avoid injury to other clients. The midweek prices are often over \u00a3100, which, for staying next to a (current) building site and shopping centre with teething problems, feels a bit steep in view of the advertising strap-line that implies high quality but budget pricing.

It needs to be said though that its almost impossible to find without directions. Its near the Waitrose - but you have to go out to the left towards the car parks and around the block - and there is ABSOLUTELY no signage from Westfield which is ridiculous as its the only way to the hotel from Stratfield Tube and Rail stations. The poor people at the Waitrose customer service desk must be fed up with lost Premier Inn guests as it was the only way I could find it! Check in was a surprise as Premier Inn are now yet another company charging and profiting from a premium (or Premier...?) surcharge for use of credit cards. The inside of the hotel is not bad - the usual anonymous purple colour schemes which I am heartily sick of. View from the 9th floor was pleasing. I checked in at 6.30 pm and thought the room was more than a bit hot. I turned the thermostat down to the minimum and waited for the temperature to drop. 3 hours later and it seemed to be getting even hotter. I checked the window which stated that opening had been limited for safety reasons - quite reasonable for 9 floors up. However, the window did not have limited opening, it was locked totally shut so totally impossible to get any cool fresh air either. By this stage the room was getting worse but naively I thought it would get cooler later in the night. I would estimate that the room temperature was in the upper 80's. By 1am I was still hoping the heat in the room might lessen, and when I did finally give up and go to bed, I slept without a cover over me at all (not a pretty sight!) as I was boiling hot. I hardly slept all night. I never expected that anyone would be able to help with the problem at that time. As an aside it was a cold foggy November night so there was not possible reason for the room being so hot - other than faults in the hotel heating system. This is a brand new Premier Inn so this should never happen.

The room would of cost \u00a3103.00 which is pretty steep, but was in a good location however thanks to their offer it was free. We were in the Stratford area at around 5:30pm but thanks to the hotel being new and on a new road in the Olympic Park no sat nav or Google Maps could pick up the address. After ages finding the entrance to the shopping centre we parked up and went in and asked the touch screen machine where it was. Even after that we were confused. It was round a corner outside, behind the shopping centre. Once in, we were greeted with a warm welcome and checked in swiftly. Our room was 414 facing the train station and general grounds of the Olympic Park (not the stadium, however). The room itself was nice enough I suppose, the bathroom was small but clean and there was plenty of storage space. We booked a family room with a main double bed and single bed in the corner. We returned from dinner at around 9.00 exhausted and went to bed. First of all, the room was very hot as was most of the hotel so it took ages to get the room to a decent temperature. After over an hour it was getting cooler but still warm. The problem was the beds were very hard. Not at all like any other Premier Inn I have stayed in. Perhaps because the hotel was new, it was very uncomfortable, coupled with the fact that the pillows were lumpy as well. After 3 hours of trying to sleep and it was quarter to one in the morning, it was clear we wern't getting any sleep so decided to pack up and drive 90 mins back down to Brighton, to home where we could get a proper night's sleep. Thank goodness we didn't pay \u00a3103.00 to stay here! After what seemed an age trying to check out with one member of staff, going to fetch another to try and cancel breakfast for the following morning and all the fuss with that, it was 1:30 in the morning and by the time we got home and got to sleep it was gone half 3. So summed up - if you are used to hard, lumpy beds then you should be alright staying here, but we found it awfully uncomfortable and we couldn't get a good nights sleep, as well as the fact it was far too warm, no matter what you did.

First off, getting there is a doddle, Circle or Jubilee line to Stratford City, and a reasonably short walk through Westfield towards the Waitrose end (note: it gets busy in the evenings). Or take the DLR to Stratford International (which exits at the hotel door!) Sorry, I can't comment on parking or driving through the miriad of building works going on for 2012. This is a great base for exploring London, why pay \u00a3100+ a night more to be central when this is just a tube ride away? Well, the tube does get very busy and if you can't stand for more than 30 minutes you might want to look elsewhere for accomodation, but that's London. You might find the DLR a little less congested, but I can't really comment. The hotel itself was only 4 weeks old when we visted and it is very nice for a budget hotel. I must admit I am a little biased, I like PI, I know pretty much what I'm going to get before I arrive and I know I'll be able to sleep on the \"strange\" bed. When travelling with family, it's nice to be able to sleep in the same room and the cost doesn't ruin your weekend. Stratford is no exception, if anything, it's a little better, it had the feel of a business class hotel, like a decent Hilton. We had a great room with fantastic views of the Olympic stadium and pool, It was again, as expected, clean and with good air con. although I find the milk tubes they provide for tea and coffee a little miserly. The restaurant is not the usually attached pub, but a proper hotel restaurant. There are some great views of the Olympic village and the staff are superb. I really can't praise the staff enough. From entering the lobby (on the first floor) you are greeted with warmth and genuine good nature. I was genuinely interested in the Olympic works going on and everyone I asked could impart a little snippet of information. I was really impressed on our last morning when it looked like the whole hotel had come down to breakfast at the same time. The restaurant manager was very apologetic and the staff very helpful, we still managed to have a very enjoyable breakfast, without feeling the stress that the staff were obviously under. Well done you guys! My only critisisms would be 1) the lifts seem to take for ever, they seem to always go to the top floor before coming back down. Maybe it's me, but I did have to wait 12 minutes to get a lift back to my room one morning - they did come, but were always full! and 2) No free wifi - this is the 21 Century.

I have stayed there on 3 occasions and have always been impressed by the friendly service and obvious cleanliness with it being new. The rooms are standard Premier Inn fair and none the worse for that. Everything is new and fresh with comfortable beds and functional bathrooms. The flat screen televisions have access to all UK Freeview channels and many radio stations. You could never describe the hotel as luxurious but it is comfortable enough and I would make special mention of the staff who are very friendly and helpful. You may want to try for a high room (floors 7-10) on the south side of the building to benefit from some very good views over London. There is some construction work for the Olympic site (next door) and so there is a little noise but I didn\u2019t find it too intrusive. The hotel did have one or two teething troubles as might be expected. The self check-in facility now works fine it would seem. However, when my air conditioning did not work for example, I was immediately offered a full refund for that night\u2019s accommodation as the hotel was full. Excellent customer service indeed. As has been mentioned, it takes a little finding if you\u2019re coming by underground. Basically, get off the underground at Stratford and head for the Westfield Shopping centre. It\u2019s about a 10 minute walk through the shopping centre at a leisurely pace or with luggage. You need to walk right through the ground floor of the shopping centre to get to the hotel. You\u2019ll pass Marks & Spencer on your left and keep walking past the food court on your left until you see Waitrose (handy for essential supplies). Then head out of the shopping centre doors and you\u2019ll see the hotel. The West End is around 25 minutes away on the Central Line. Stratford International Rail Station is much closer to the hotel and a train from there gets you to Kings Cross/St Pancras in less than 10 minutes. There is a restaurant and bar one in the hotel which offers UK pub-style food for less than \u00a310. A walk into the adjacent Westfield Centre (open until 9pm on weekdays) offers a food court on the ground floor with a range of fast food restaurants such as KFC, McDonalds, Subway, Chinese, Caribbean etc. Venture upstairs in the Centre and there\u2019s an even bigger choice of restaurants with everything from the usual chain restaurants to Thai and Japanese cuisine. The Shopping Centre itself has a fantastic range of designer and chain stores. All in all then, a good choice balancing value for money and comfort if you don\u2019t mind being a little out of town or are visiting either the Olympic Stadium or Westfield Shopping Centre.

A colleague of mine had stayed at the hotel two weeks before and had told me that the hotel was a little difficult to find. When we got there we did have to ask a couple of people for directions before we found it. Follow these directions and you will find the hotel in no time: Coming out of the tube follw the Westfield Stratford City signs, enter the shopping centre on the left and walk straight down that floor until you see the Great Eastern Market/Waitrose. Turn right and out of the doors and Premier Inn will either be on your right or left side, depending on which exit you come out of. In terms of where we wanted to stay in London, Premier Inn was the cheapest at \u00a3118 for two nights and we booked it from their website. When we got there we found out we were on the second floor and as it was a birthday trip, asked if we could have a room on a higher floor. The lady who served us was very helpful and accomodating and not only gave us a room on a higher floor, but gave us a room on the very top floor, the 10th floor! We were very happy as you can imagine. The room had a great view of the Olympics Stadium and two other venues, one being the Aquatics Centre. The hotel offers self-check in, however, we were served by a staff member. When we asked for an Iron on Friday evening, as we entered the lift we met a member of staff on on his way to our room to give us the iron. Service was very good. Obviously as it is within the Westfield Centre it is ideal if you are visiting for shopping, however, like us, if you are just looking for a nicely priced hotel near the centre-ish you can't go wrong with this. The bed was one of the most comfartable we have slept on and it is fair to stay we would definitely stay at this hotel again.", "Date": "October 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hillsborough", "Title": "\u201cSurrounding facilities great.

Within minutes of my request, an ironing board and iron had been sent up to my room. No charge for freephone numbers when using the room phone! Breakfast abundant.

Complaints: toilet paper is 1-ply, easily solved by buying a packet from Waitrose next door! Security: Never felt unsafe in the vicinity (and if you read my other reviews you will see I give this due attention) Restaurants & Shopping: Spoilt for choice at Westfield next door. Transport: Bus D8 every 12-15mins from stop W 3mins walk away (at the end of the shops' loading bays) goes to Canary Wharf and Crossharbour Asda. Jubilee and Central tube lines pass through Stratford Station which is just 10mins from Stratford International by DLR (or walk right through Westfield). Transport zone 3 (slightly more expensive but well made up for by the cheap night rate - distance not an issue due to good tube/DLR/bus connections).

The staff were very helpful and friendly. The price for the room was great and offered good value. A little hard to find by road, but the Stratford International Railway Station is right next door to the hotel, which makes for a departure to St.Pancras for the Eurostar to Paris, even easier. The local tube station Stratford is on the other side of the Westfield shopping centre and very well integrated into this busy hub. Westfield Stratford City is an amazing shopping precinct and the largest in Europe, so it was a real treat to see the opening of this new London icon too. Having the hotel next door to the centre is very appealing and suited our needs very well. The room was a little small, but the beds were comfortable. I was fortunate enough to get a room overlooking the new Olympic stadium, so ask for this if you can at the time of the booking. As you would expect all the facilities in the room were modern and well presented. One big mistake the owners have made though, was that there was no bar fridge or mini bar. It would have been nice to be able to place some items we had such as water & milk in a fridge. The breakfast is superb, and if you are travelling with children, make sure you pay for the premium breakfast which means that kids eat free. You can even request an omelette instead of the scrambled eggs on offer. The bar is well stocked but unfortunately this is where the hotel fails to deliver. Opening days are the most testing times for staff, but having dining room waitresses behind the bar serving is an obvious mistake that should not happen. Not knowing how to pull a beer is embarrassing for staff and worse for the customers. Patrons were forced to show staff how to pull a beer, so there was an obvious lack of staff training which I am sure will be rectified in the future. All in all, a good experience and this will be the hotel of choice when staying in London, purely for its location and good value.", "Date": "September 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milton Keynes", "Title": "\u201cYou pay for the location\u201d", "Author": "BeachBlondie23", "ReviewID": "UR118746335", "Content": "I can confirm along with the previous reviews- this hotel is situated on the site of the new Westfield Stratford shopping centre and adjacent to the Olympic Park.

Anyway, I can vouch for the fact that this hotel is in east London, and is well worth a visit. We stayed 16-18 September on the first weekend after opening, and we had a great stay. \u00a3134 for 2 night, and I can see it cheaper for future bookings. The hotel is built right on top of the Westfield Stratford City shopping centre, and is next to the Olympic Park. So easy to get to thanks to the new infrastructure being put in place for the Games - you have a choice of tube lines into the newly upgraded Stratford underground, overground services to Stratford International, or DLR into the new Stratford International stop. Just note you need a Zone 1234 travelcard to get to Stratford. We had no teething troubles on our stay - room was spotless, beds comfortable, bathroom with shower gel/shampoo/soap - was very impressed to find air-conditioning. Worth asking before arrival if you could have a room on the higher floors with a view of the Olympic Stadium (I can't remember which side of the hotel looks out where...). There's a nice bar, and a restaurant serving well-priced food - we didn't eat in the evenings so can't comment on the quality, however downstairs in the Westfield centre there are all manner of restaurants, fast food takeaways, food courts etc to choose from. Breakfast in the hotel is a good option, certainly for Sundays, as the shopping centre doesnt open til 11am, and there didnt look to be many cafes open earlier. It's \u00a37.99 for a buffet, with 2 kids per adult eating free. Good value. Nice safe area, lots of security around til late, and no need to wander the streets unless you chose to. Doesn't look like the sort of Premier Inn that's going to attract the stag/hen night crowd so potentially quiet at night... it was last weekend anyway! The hotel really is fantastically served by train/tube - you can get the Jubilee Line direct to the O2, Greenwich, Embankment/Westminster, Green Park for Buckingham Palace - Central Line takes you to Oxford Street etc. Our kids loved the driverless DLR which takes you to Tower Hill/Bank, or down through Canary Wharf to Greenwich. My recommendation for a different route to the centre would be get the DLR to the O2, then get the Thames Clipper river bus to Tower Pier or the London Eye pier.
