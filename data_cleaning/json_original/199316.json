{"Reviews": [{"Content": "poor serive and will over charge for anything in sight Plus points as follows: the room was clean and spacious and the location was good for me.There were problems however. My wife and I stayed for six days and they asked we pay 32 Euros per day for breakfast. That is equivalent to 192 euros for 6 days of breakfast! We made a five minute local call in frankfurt after being told it was 30 cents per minute. They somehow charged 10 Euros. When asked to explain after settling the bill - the reply was to have a free breakfast on the day of checkout!Internet access was 10 Euros an hour!! Basicaly you will get overcharged if the hotel can find any opportunity to do so.The bedding will not get changed unless you ask, i was told on my fourth night.Finally, the reception desk is only open to 10pm or 11pm. I will not be staying here unless i'm really desperate. I suggest you do the same :-)", "Date": "Dec 23, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR667249841", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "londoner76"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187337-d199316-r11913008-NH_die_Villa_Frankfurt_Messe-Frankfurt_Hesse.html", "HotelID": "199316", "Price": "$190"}}
