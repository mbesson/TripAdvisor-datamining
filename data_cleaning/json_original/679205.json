Usally they cleaned our room at 3 pm. The cleaner seemed EXTREMLY stressed and was almost running between the rooms looking like they really tryied but the time could not reach. - For two days we didn't have any soap because they didn't refill when they cleaned the roonm.

I choose this hotel because the price of stay was low and its location was good. The KaDeWe, Berlin's premier mall, is only a ten minute walk from the hotel.

The location is good, especially for the cost of the hotel. I had the bad luck of staying here as a heat wave passed over Berlin. With a third and fifth floor room, neither with air conditioning, this was pretty hard on my family. The hotel did provide fans, but this did not really helped. I got the feeling that the design of the hotel did not allow heat to escape it very well. It was often much cooler outside than inside. The design of the hotel was decent at best. The hotel is a converted apartment, so finding your room is like going through a maze. I was lucky to have a room at the end of the hotel, but if you get one in the middle or at the beginning, where everyone walks by, you are out of luck. The service was good and the breakfast expensive at \u20ac7.50. Your best bet for breakfast is to walk to Dunkin' Donuts or the bakery. The cleanliness was passable. I found several long hairs in the sink and shower, none of which were mine or my family member's. On the beds you could feel the springs, and my mother's actually broke. The furniture is a little flimsy too. The table in my room almost lost both legs, just because I moved it slightly. You have to pay for parking and Internet.

The hotel suffers from a terrible conversion job, its an amalgamation of two buildings, which leads to the confusion of trying to find your room it this is numbered between 09-17 on most floors. Be prepared to go via numerous corridors to find your room. Was allocated room 208 which was at the end of one building but right next to a heavy door to get to other rooms. Result was every time that someone from other rooms entered or exited their rooms they had to pass by mine and slam the door, so this was constant at all hours resulting in very disturbed sleep. Walls are paper thin, the corridors have no soundproofing or underlay on the carpets so passing traffic could be heard at all hours. Reception when we arrived and decided to check out was not manned, so again no good first impression. Beds were springy and worn, pillows were useless and general cleanliness was not that high (lots of dust in rooms). Bathroom was tiny, the shower would definately not suit any person who was is a size 14 or 34 inch waist or higher as they will have trouble trying to get into the bathroom. Windows didn't close properly and as it was in the minus 10 range it means you need the heating on all the time.

What we do when we travel is have a big breakfast at the hotel so we can save money on the lunch and use it for something more interesting. Both of us are quite husky.

However, we didn\u2019t go back to see our new friend. When we walked past the restaurant the next two mornings we saw no one inside, so we wondered whether he had been rude to more people. Another problem we had is that our room was very dusty. Not a single time throughout our stay did anyone dust the furniture, and the dust was clearly visible on the desk and the bedside tables. Both my partner and I are allergic to dust, so this was no good for us. There were also cobwebs in the ceiling. We also ran out of shampoo in our last day, meaning that it had not been replaced from even before our arrival. The bathroom itself was pretty clean though. Other than that, the hotel is good value, and the staff in reception was always nice and helpful. The wireless Internet was not that expensive and it was really fast and reliable too.

The way to the room was a bit funny and like a walk through a labyrinth, however, but that doesn\u00b4t matter if you are not a handicapped person (who would have problems, indeed). The staff was very friendly and helpful even after I had complained about the other room (the one for my daughter) which was on the ground floor in the rear building, with the door/window directly at the parking lot (room 015, don\u00b4t take it!). During the night she would not open the window or dare to withdraw the curtain. Moreover, the tiny room was filled with green neon light from outside which is not something you\u00b4d like to have at night. After our complaint they gave us single room Nr.415, directly beside my room - and this one was very nice, too. Breakfast was extra (6,50 EUR) and was served at the Bistro next door. It was definitely OK for the price and I missed nothing. I have to say that I spent nights in hotels for three times the price - without any better accomodation.", "Date": "August 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Malta", "Title": "\u201cStylish hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Gugu_85", "ReviewID": "UR17805774", "Content": "Been this hotel in June 08.

The only drawback was that we had to go up a couple of steps to reach our room as lift stopped at intermediate floor. Rooms quite stylish as well and beds quite comfy and clean. Overall it was a very good hotel, very close, [like a 15minute walk], to ku'damn, which means close to shops and restaurants; 3minute walk to a train station. A very good standard for its price!!

Hotel itself is on a mainly residential street but there is currently building work going on opposite - there was no work going on Sunday morning or Monday morning when we stayed but was quite noisy on Tuesday morning - probably best to ask for a room at the rear of the hotel if you prefer to sleep late. The rooms was obviously recently refurbished (appears to be an old building but freshly done up) and reasonably spacious with comfortable bed, flat screen TV and clean, bright shower-room.

The location is also very good (only a couple of stops away from the Zoo Banhoff). It is situated in a quiet street near a kebab shop (if you get the munchies later!). We decided on this 3-star hotel...as it didn't work out much more than it would if we had roughed it in a hostel (with a shared bathroom). Unfortunately, at the moment there is building work happening right outside the hotel and the builders tend to start work early around 7am. So do expect some disruption. This also meant that the view out of the window was not exactly a picture postcard. The hotel is pretty clean and the receptionists are efficient and friendly. There is internet connection. Though they charge 2 Euros an hour and you cant get it any cheaper if you want to go online for less time. Breakfast is available in the clean and modern bistro (complete with white retro chairs). Breakfast consists of a buffet of cold food (salads, meat, bread)...and is an extra 6.50 Euros per person. We had it for the first day...and made sure that we piled our plate with as much as possible. Though some old German woman kept giving us deathstares as if to say how disgusted she was that we had so much. I say...for that price you want to try and get as much as possible!!! The buffet is not that sumptious...and if you want anything hot (e.g. scramble eggs, etc) you have to pay extra for it. It's better to eat elsewhere. The double room was large (though the matteresses were actually 2 single ones joined together). The bathroom was clean (and unlike others we DID have hot water throughout our stay). The TV has many cable channels though only CNN and BBC World are in English. One negative aspect was that there was no tea/coffee making facilities in the room. Nevertheless, the overall experience was good...and we would go back again.

The room was very large and neat ... just like the photos on the website, but the closet was very dusty and the walls could have used a bit of cleaning. The bathroom was very clean and well maintained. My friend booked a single room, which he said was not nearly as nice as my double and extremely small. The hotel staff was friendly for the most part, but wasn't very helpful when it came to accomodating my cold room when the heaters barely worked or cold water in the morning for showers. I stayed at the hotel for seven days and had lots of baggage upon check-out; however, the elevator was broken and I had to carry my two large suitcases down several flghts of stairs.

The price ranged from EUR59 to EUR29 per night. As others have mentioned the hotel is brand new and offers a boutique atmosphere. It has a good location in the west of the city close to the Ku'damm and the gay bars of Fuggerstr. It certainly had a gay-friendly feel, which is a definite bonus. The rooms are decently sized and the bathrooms are fine. In-room wi-fi is offered at an excellent EUR4 per day. Staff range from very good to extremely surly. The place is however somewhat basic and this gives it more of an insitutional feel, with the lack of small details such as a light switch to turn off the main room lights next to the bed. It feels more like a 2* pension than the 3* hotel it claims to be. The main problem I had, and this is why I have given it 2/5 is something another reviewer alluded to - the hot water situation. I stayed for a total of 3 nights and did not have hot water on any of the mornings, though it did work in the evening. I was obliged to take a cold shower every morning, adding to the institutional feeling. I know for a fact that I was not alone as when I went down to reception, the receptionist was getting very upset when another client could not understand why she had to wait an hour before having her shower because the hotel could not provide her with the hot water she should have been able to expect. I found cleanliness to be an issue. While the room was spotless when I arrived, by the time I left, I was able to write my name on the desk for all the dust that was there. I would certainly consider staying here again if the price were around EUR30-40 but wouldn't pay much more.
