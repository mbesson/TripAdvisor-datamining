We'd booked the suite. The room was alright, but when you book something called a \"suite\", you probably expect more. A coat of paint would have done a lot for the room, along with some logic in the light switches. But the expectations were saved by the size of the room and the view. The staff was nice, and the breakfast alright for a country that isn't exactly known for its breakfast habits.

The large majority of hotels are built in very old and cramped buildings and as a consequence space is of a premium. You will be able to 'swing a cat' but not much more. The space available, means space in the bedroom is at a premium and even more so in the bathroom. The staff are not unpleasant or unhelpful but not do they create a overwhelming air of welcome. They are polite and helpful but not outstanding. The breakfast is typically European; cereals, croissants, bread rolls, jams and coffee and they are all fresh, but that's the choice. Ok so I guess that's the negative side. On the positive side, the rooms were nicely appointed, clean and small but not tiny. We had a room on the third floor that looked directly down one of the canals, so no complaints on the view. We had friends staying on the same floor who also had a balcony. The bathroom was small but held a toilet, basin, bidet and small but powerful shower and all were spotlessly clean. All in all once you accept the size of the rooms, they were comfortable and perfectly adequate for two travelling adults. What makes this hotel worth while? Location and and value. You're not going to break the bank and it's in a great location; neither too busy nor too far off the beaten track. Coming from the airport take the water bus orange line and dis-embark at the Pont de Guglie, you'e about 5-10 ten minute walk away. We most certainly recommend this hotel, and would stay again.

This time my stay was not so good. I originally booked a standard room and when I got in the room was so small that there was hardly any room between the end of the bed and the wall to pass. We had 2 suitcases and 2 carry-on bags with us and there was absolutely no space where to put them. Even if we had tried to put the suitcases along the wall, we would have had to jump over the bed to go on the other side of the room. Plus the room was dark and looked over a wall, basically an Anna Frank view.... So I called the front desk and asked to be given a larger room. I was told there would have been a supplement of 20 euros for a superior room. Ok fine, what could we do? The new room was more spacious, it had an entrance where we could put the suitcases and there was actually room to go around, but when I got into the bathroom another bad surprise: there was no shower cabin: just a shower head. No shower curtain or dish.No soap dish either, so we had to put the soap on the window sill and the shampoo bottles on the toilet lid. Whenever we would take a shower the whole bathroom flooded. Water everywhere, on the toilet, on the bidet, on the floor. In order not to slip and fall we had to put the bath towels on the floor. How can it be possible that a 3-star hotel has a bathroom with no shower cabin or even a curtain? Last time I had gotten a room with a shower cabin, and this room that allegedly was a \"superior\" room had not even a curtain.

I must have scoured over 100 hotels on tripadvisor, looking for somewhere that offered the perfect balance of being picturesque, romantic, and gave my girlfriend (who had never been to Venice) the perfect impression of why Venice (to me) is the most romatic city in the world. This weekend meant everything to me, and I wanted it to mean everything to her. La Forcola did not disappoint! From the pictures on Tripadvisor, it quickly becomes apparent that all hotels in Venice have quite small rooms (it is the style of the city), so people who complain about room sizes have a lot of misconceptions about what is available in Venice. The room in this context is perfectly sized. Most Venetian hotels pride themselves on Venetian styled decor. I personally find thhis style a bit gaudy, an La Forcola is a perfect alternative. The rooms have a baeutiful finish to them, and are perfectly clean. The bathroom had not a trace of damp, which is often a problem in Venice. I paid slightly extra for a double room out of all the options available to me, in the hope that I would be allocated the room which is pictured. To my delight when we arrived, I found out that I had indeed been lucky enough to have been allocated the room I had fallen in love with on the website. Our room was on the second floor, in the corner, and as a result had two balconies - the first above the entrance of the hotel and looking down onto the little bridge over the canal and onto the street below, which is beautifully busy, and you can people watch and enjoy the gentle burbur of the people walking by below through all the little shops. The second balcony overlooks the canal which the little bridge crosses, and therefore, depending on which romantic scene you prefer, you can watch the hussle and bustle below, or the water and the boats. I was slightly concerned the noise from the street might be intrusive, but not a bit of it, it was a lovely happy people noise, and never loud - and even if it were, both balconies had double glazing which effectively shut out any noise from outside. The staff were friendly and polite (staff rudeness at other hotels seems to be the biggest complaint for Venetian hotels) and there was never any noise from any of the other guests. The hotel is a beautiful picuresque setting, with elegant decor within and is very well run. It is a short enjoyable walk from all the places of interest, but has enjoyable surroundings on its doorstep. This weekend went perfectly, and I was able to make my new Fiancee very happy this weekend, and I owe a huge portion of this to how happy we were with the hotel. There will be other more grand hotels in Venice, but I could not think of a better one to stay at if you want to capture the essence and romance of Venice. The room I booked with both balconies was room 206 and I booked it as a Double Superior room if you also wish to have the room that is featured.

Don't take too much baggage since you need to walk over cobblestones and stairs from the bus boat. The best shopping is at the Rialto bridge, with much better prices than Murano Island, the glass factorY. Leave room in your luggage for souvenirs.
