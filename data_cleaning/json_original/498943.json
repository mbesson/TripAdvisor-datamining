When we landed at 9:00 PM and followed the signs in the international terminal for TAV Airport Hotel, we were led out a door to a curb. We asked around when there were no more signs and they told us to walk to the other end of the terminal on the curb. When we did, we found that there was a phone to call the shuttle. What?? Why take a shuttle when it is listed as Terminal 1?? We called, got the shuttle, and it took us just around the corner to the hotel. Sure enough, it is connected to Terminal 1, but there is no way you can get there by foot, which is ridiculous. That defeats the sole purpose of an airport hotel; you should be able to get there easily inside the terminal. Once there the rooms were very clean, but the noise inside the hotel and outside the windows (two men talked very loudly at 1:00 AM) made it difficult to sleep. All in all, I would say it is an average airport hotel due to the inconvenience of its location and the noise factor.", "Date": "April 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bucharest, Romania", "Title": "\u201cPerfect if you don't wanna waste time\u201d", "Author": "Andreea2503", "ReviewID": "UR127743334", "Content": "Stayed in this hotel 4-5 times in the last 2 years.

At 135 Euro per night for a double, it's expensive, but then again, so is staying elsewhere in Istanbul, without the worry of transportation in this bustling city. The breakfast buffet is outstanding, and in my most recent stay, included smoked veal tongue, lentil soup, camenbert and gouda cheeses, eggs made to order, grilled tomatoes with cheddar and an amazing variety of jams, juices and spreads. All of this was also extremely elegantly presented, with individual porcelain coffee pots brought to the table.

I stayed at the one inside the departures terminal as I had several hours to kill between flights. I was slightly confused about so many negative reports, until I realized the majority of the reports were for the hotel that is just outside the terminal building. The one inside is a short walk from the departure gates, 5 minutes gets you to most gates. Check in was friendly & despite turning up without a reservation, the hotel was full at the time. Told to come back after 1 hour. Just enough time for a Starbucks coffee, right outside the entrance. Check in was quick, room was already cleaned so no more waiting & because I had stayed there several times in the past they had completed most of the registration card. Just had to sign & confirm departure time. The room was light with a huge window looking out onto the other side of the Airport Hotel. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if I am lucky or paying extra but every time I stay in this hotel I get a window. Bed is really comfortable & the room quite so a good sleep is possible. Reception staff are friendly & very helpful. I needed a socket adapter to recharge my laptop. Within seconds one was brought to my room. When I checked out I handed it back & no problem. Other hotels have tried to charge me rental or even to buy yet another one at over inflated prices. Been inside the airport there are plenty of food and beverage places open all the time offering a wide selection of food. The only down side for me is that the hotel can work out to be expensive especially if staying for a short time. It cost over $180 for 6 hours, but when the other option is sitting in caf\u00c3\u00a9\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s or bars then its worth the money. For a reasonable length layover its worth paying just to have a bit of privacy, shower & sleep before another long flight.", "Date": "March 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel if you have an early flight!!\u201d", "Author": "horadam1", "ReviewID": "UR53977532", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel at the end of our Turkey trip.

In the evening, checkin is easy and also passport and security controls are without queues! The rooms are next to the gates, so from bed to gate it's a matter of minutes.

Also there is no entrance to the hotel from the airport (even though it is part of the terminal), and you can not walk to the airport either.
