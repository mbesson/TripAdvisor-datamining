We caught the train to Penn Station and with suitcases were able to walk to the hotel in about 10-15 minutes. Penn Station is on 31st and the Flatiron is on 26th, which was a few blocks over. The room was beautiful with a TV in the bathroom mirror, remote control curtains and a great iPod docking radio. Bathroom was really nice and everything was really clean. We arrived in New York around noon and were allowed to check in early and get our day of shopping started. The general manager George Sallee was fantastic and recommended several restaurants and tourist attractions. They told us if we got lost to feel free to call them and ask for help, and I believe they really meant it. The Toshi Lounge had happy hour with two for one drinks and we were able to meet with friends, talk and drink in the fabulous lobby and Toshi area lounge. The fish tank is beautiful and Jessica and Ldeka were very helpful. I would recommend this hotel to the pickiest traveler, as I am. I've stayed at the Gansevoort which is double the price, but service was not as great as the Flatiron. If you are looking for an outstanding boutique hotel, this is it! I haven\u2019t been to a Marriot, Westin, W, Hilton or Sheraton that was better.

The hotel is new and still in its opening phase, so there are a few hiccups here and there, but the overall experience FAR outweighs any negatives. The lobby is lovely with a huge unique saltwater aquarium surrounded by a transparent spiral staircase. There is live music at night with a great jazz ensemble. The room itself is wonderfully apportioned and the bathroom has a TV in the mirror. We had some difficulty using the Wi-Fi and had to be in certain places in the room to get it, but I'm sure that's a minor kink to be worked out. The thermostat settings were a bit touchy, so we found it better to leave it alone. There are those who complained about the subway noise - and while noticeable, I have to say my take was \"Welcome to New York City.\" There's nothing they can do about that now.. and if anything, if you want to visit other parts of the city, you know that the subway is close by!

The hotel is in a great location - a block from one of the subway lines, and walking distance from A LOT of sights. Our room was very high tech with remote controlled window coverings and a television built in to the bathroom mirror. Cool stuff! The Toshi suite is a corner room with windows covering two walls and it was worth the little bit of extra cost because it was a lot of fun watching all the New York sights below us.

The room we stayed in was a tech-geek delight with remote control curtains, iPod dock, HD TV, complementary Wi-Fi, touch controls for the door signs and the much mentioned 'TV within a bathroom mirror' (which is just cool, no two ways about it!). A decent size, too. A clean, comfortable bed and a really nice shower unit sealed the deal. The staff were very friendly and incredibly helpful. One day after an lengthy sight-seeing tour, we got back to find they had very kindly taken our luggage (lost at the airport for one day) up to our room so we had it waiting on our return. It's all in the little touches, and it was very much appreciated. If you're looking to get out and see the sights, the Flatiron Hotel's location is really second to none. Close enough to the main sights and attractions of Manhattan, but far away enough to be a little haven at the end of a long days sight-seeing or shopping. Yes, you can hear taxi horns and sirens at night and the occasional rumbling of a subway train, but we certainly didn't find it unbearable by any means. Plus, you just have to remember this is NYC... Tip: As it's a relatively new hotel, a number of the taxi drivers and shuttle bus employees looked puzzled when you gave them the name. Best to make a note of the address if you go out and about. I'll be recommending this hotel to friends and family, and given that it's still in the 'soft opening' stage (although the bar adjacent to the lobby is now open and looks great) it can only get even better.

If they claim I didn\u2019t stay there a second time, I assume they\u2019ll give me a refund? I booked a stay at the Flatiron on 2/17. The dates I booked were 2/22 to 2/24. After booking the hotel, I made flight plans and unfortunately had to book a redeye flight. I then contacted the Flatiron by phone and very clearly offered to add one night\u2019s room on the beginning of my stay so that a room would be ready for me when I arrived at 7AM in the event that an early registration would not be possible. Jessica, who I spoke with, said that she \u201clocked\u201d that room and that an early check in would be possible. Again to be completely clear, I offered to book another night\u2019s stay to ensure early check in, but was told by the Flatiron not to do so. Upon arrival early in the morning on the 22, I was informed that no room was available and that the room had been rented the night before\u2026I would have to wait. I went to a Starbucks and waited about 2.5 hours until they had a room available. Not a huge inconvenience. Unfortunately that was pretty much the highlight of my stay there. It became such a comedy of errors that I ultimately suspected that they were messing with me intentionally. - I went to the front desk in the evening of my first day and extended my stay one day. The clerk made the change and told me I would receive an email confirmation. When it had not arrived by the next morning, I again stopped by the front desk to confirm. Either of those interactions would have been idea times for the front desk staff to offer to redo my key entry card \u2013 on three occasions the last two days of my stay, I couldn\u2019t get into my room and had to go back down to the desk and reques that the key card be adjusted. - The WiFi service ONLY extended to the 8 to 10 inches closest to the room door. I called the front desk two nights in a row and both times and was told that the \u201cweb guy\u201d wasn\u2019t on duty, so please use the business center. - The Jacuzzi tub in my room did not work. I called the desk on the first night, no one ever came up. - When I got to my room on the third evening, it had not been cleaned. Had to ring the front desk two times requesting service. When they did service the room, they neglected to leave any bath towels. There\u2019s more but that\u2019s about all the space I have. I understand errors and I also believe that often times when one error occurs for whatever reason, seems like chances are something else will go wrong.

None of the housekeeping/maintenance employees were in any kind of uniform, the \"General Manager\" gave me his card in which his former title \"Housekeeping Manager\" was scribbled out and \"G.M.\" was written above it. He also gave me his cell phone number (which he had to look up on his phone?) to call him next time I was in the city and he assured me \"he'd take care of my visit\". Not once was I offered an upgrade for my inconvenience, any kind of refund, comped room, or anything that would have made my stay more pleasant beyond the vague \"call me and we'll take care of you\" thing.

We end up getting a small cozy king bed room on the 8th floor in the hotel. We still were able to hear the trains passing through, but the bed was so comfortable and my added exhaustion from traveling the city, we were totally out and sleeping like babies. The room was very modern and clean, we had fun with the remote curtains and the TV in the washroom mirror, but had a problem setting the alarm. Wish there were instructions on how to use the alarm clock in the room. As the alarm would set off the curtains to automatically open and the heat to turn on.

So, we end up taking out some cans to cool our own items and placing them back when we left.

When we checked out, we were charged for the cans, but the clerks removed the charge, as we told them we didn't consume the drinks and only use it for fridge space to put our own items. So, we will see later if they still charged us for the items on our credit cards. We had trouble controlling the temperature in the room. It was either too cold or too hot.

Very light sleepers probably have a problem with everything in NYC. Pros: for NYC the room is good sized. people not familiar with NYC might be shocked by room sizes here, but it is new york. I saw the queen size rooms, and they are much smaller than the king. The bed was comfy, room was clean (we were nervous about bed bugs - no issue at all), the tech features were cool. Ipod radio was nice, the black out shades worked really well. bathroom was large/clean. i wish our room had the cool showers i saw in the queen room (I peeked into a few other rooms during the mid day while housekeeping was cleaning). but the bathroom with the tub was much bigger. The hairdryer was a real hairdryer, not the typical hotel crappy thing (wish i knew ahead of time, i could have packed less). the tv in the bathroom mirror was a novelty, but not really my thing. the location is AMAZING!! this is exactly where i want to be in NYC.

It's not like a big corporation is running this show - it's small and getting attention from the owner. Thats nice to see. Room safe is so well hidden, we had to call the front desk to find out where it was... but it's there. Meh?: the lobby is interesting.... clean but a bit over the top for me. Is this a con? probably not, but not anything special for me. The decor overall is not exactly my taste, but at least more playful than most hotels. there weren't any places to really hang out in the lobby other than just some couches. it wasn't the type of place i would like to just hang out. Not bad for sitting and waiting for someone, but not a \"place\" yet. Other hotels do this much better. Cons: wish there was a mini fridge in the room. it has cooler selling water/soda, but no space for our food. The bar just opened while we were there. The liquor selection is not great. the bar tender gets an A for effort, but not execution. I'm going to assume they just need some more time and experience. and some nibbles. Another Con - the hotel doesn't yet have any thing other than just rooms. No cafe, no food, etc. However, starbucks is right next door and the neighborhood has so much. All in all, for the cost savings, i would prefer to spend the extra money on doing something outside of my hotel than just paying for hotel accoutrements. overall, i highly recommend this hotel. we were very happy with it. our \"cons\" are minor, while the pros were great.", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Detroit, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cWhat a terrific hotel!:)\u201d", "Author": "jvincent44", "ReviewID": "UR124865003", "Content": "Booked this hotel through \"Hotwire.\" Terrific price and fantastic room (great location, too)...

The cylindrical aquariam is really something to see! The rooms were quite nice, size was typical of other NYC hotels. Great things about the room were the electronic curtain/window shades, the TV in the bathroom mirror, the shower stall with all the spa jets was really nice after a long day in the city. Probably the most amazing thing about the room were the comfort of the beds!! I have never slept on anything like that before and it was truly an amazing experience. Somethings that could have been worked on...the heater is pretty loud and blasts hot air into the room. It was hard to get a stable temperature in the room. Also, the tile floor in the bathroom was freezing cold on barefeet. It would have been nice to have heated tile floors or even provide guests with complimentary slippers. Also, there were no towel racks at all in the bathroom! After showering we would just throw the towels on the floor or leave them on the counter. Sometimes I would hang them on top of the door. i think this is something they perhaps missed??? It also would have been nice to have real glasses to use in the hotel room, rather than the flimsy plastic cups sealed in celophane that they give you. That just makes the room look cheap. They also need to upgrade the quality of coffee in the room. While it was nice to have the coffeemaker and complimentary coffee, the quality was very poor. We walked to Starbucks in the morning to get real coffee. I think that fixing up these little snags will make this an even better hotel than it already is.

The iconic Flatiron Building can be seen from the end of the street, and there's a great park nearby to have a picnic or to rest up. Dillon was so nice during checkout. We left our bags at the hotel since we had a late bus. When coming back for our bags, Dillon saw that we had some food and offered us the lounge area to eat and rest before traveling, which we took up on.

My stay there went ultra smooth, it was a great location and I felt safe. My stay was from Friday - Sunday. The Flatiron is shiny and new but there are a few improvements needed: Cons: 1. Sensitive to noise, I specifically requested in my reservation booked weeks ahead, NOT to have a room by the elevator, and they did the complete opposite. My room literally faced the elevator. Takes literally just one leap from the inside of the elevator into my room. I called down to the front immediately realizing this and they said they'll check and call me back if anything. So they called back literally 1 whole minute later and said there wasn't anything available. Seriously, they could have waited 5 minutes to pretend they tried. This showed me they are not accommodating and do not care to show they want to make an effort! I was ready to look for a new hotel at this point. 2. Since there was nothing they can do about my room situation, and i was in a time crunch, I just sucked it up and stayed. I got there on Friday afternoon and I needed to work a bit before the weekend. For a few hours I was working in my room and all of a sudden someone opens the door into my room! The voices of two adult men were behind my door about to walk in! I quickly said \"HELLO!\" They stopped opening the door halfway and did not see me but heard my voice. I panicked!! I thought I was getting robbed or worst going to be assaulted!!! So I quickly grabbed my laptop ready to whack the people coming in. Then they said \"um, are you decent? we're here to check something!\" Are you kidding me? I could have been in a very vulnerable situation! Oh, and the room I was in did not have one of those long hook locks that keeps people out even if they have a key. So this is a very unsafe situation for a single female traveling alone. I put down my laptop and walked to the door to see what they wanted. And they said they just wanted to check to see if something in the bathroom was fixed. So one guy peeked into the bathroom and said it was. I was just still in shock and disbelief in what was happening. So the shorter guy saw this and asked \"what's wrong.\" I'm like \"um. well, most people knock before they just walk into someone's room\" And they explained that they thought no one was checked in yet and the other guy said a matter of factually \"you just checked in like 5 mins ago right? so ...\" I'm like I've been here, working! Jerk! God the rudeness of this hotel at this point was almost too much to take. If I didn't have to finish a report and meet someone soon I would have packed my stuff and moved to another hotel. 3. The noise level is outrageous! I can sleep through fog horns and earthquakes but this room was beyond those things. I heard the TV of the room next door all night long and loud too, the walls are thin. The trains are also passing by every so often. Because my room was so low in the building, I can hear every honk, siren, and crazies shouting! Oh and people in and out of the elevators didn't help either! Those noises went on all night long. 4. One ice machine for the whole hotel, in Mezzanine level and no vending machines for softdrinks or water. (they are working on setting up minibars in the hotel rooms) They did suggest we go across the street to the liquor store to get water/softdrinks, which we did and it was convenient enough. Pros: Everything is new. The curtains are electronically controlled, you open and close them with a remote!!! Really fun. The curtains keep the light out very well. So even if it's super bright out, the room can be dark. The phone in room is cordless. The TV was crisp (but it is digital so a lot of channels didn't have signal, since I don't watch much tv, I don't consider this too bad an issue) The desk was good for working (though there were no power outlets where the desk is so my cords were connected to the walls on the other side, not too big a deal for me) Two new bathrobes. The shower was awesome, it had a total of 8 spouts and 7 running at a time so you're getting sprayed from head to knees with multiple spouts, LOVE this feature. There's a TV in the bathroom mirror (which can be a good or bad thing, I didn't like it because it got in my way of seeing myself since I'm short. And it's not facing the toilet, so you can't watch it from there. You can see it from the shower but can't hear it since shower is so loud) I think they tried with this but it ultimately does not make much since. Lighting in the rooms are well situated and can be adjusted for bright to dim to romantic. Electronic control for Privacy and Maid Service. The lobby is very nice, with cool furnishing and a large cylinder aquarium. The doorman/luggage guys are very nice and quick to come to help me. Girl who checked me in was also nice. The location, right by beautiful Madison Square Park (depending on the type of person you are, it can be a shady spot at night, but I liked it because it was walking distance from all the places I ate at in LES and East Village. Don't expect upper east side or midtown when staying here. There are characters and you should be alert as you walk through the neighborhood) Two short blocks from the Subway station. Very easy to catch a cab. They have car service if you need it ( i didn't use it but looks convenient) All in all, my stay (after my first few hours of weirdness) went smooth. I would stay here again, but I would definitely call ahead to make sure they won't put my room in front of the elevators and hopefully by then, they would have installed long hook locks so strangers can't just bust into your room if you're in the shower or doing something more private!", "Date": "January 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California, United States", "Title": "\u201cFantastic week at the Flatiron Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Hillary P", "ReviewID": "UR123031773", "Content": "I just finished a 5 night stay at the Flatiron Hotel while visiting NYC on business.

I proceeded to tell the man on the phone that was an absurd allegation and that we absolutely did not steal anything. The man said someone would call me back and that he could not address this personally. After I did not receive a callback, I proceeded to call again and was able to speak to the person that was supposed to return my call. I again told him that they were wrong and that we absolutely did not steal the bed spreads and demanded a refund of the $200.00 or we would dispute the charge with the credit card company.

Overall, though, I would have preferred it if the hotel had splurged less on electronics and other special effects, and more on practicalities that travellers actually need. For example, I would have traded the TV in the bathroom for a fridge, especially since there is no restaurant in the hotel. Worst of all, the hotel has a 4pm check-in time, probably because it doesn't have enough cleaners to turn around the rooms fast enough. I arrived at around 3pm and had to step out anyway to meet a friend, so it did not inconvenience me much. But if you are arriving in the city in the morning, this hotel would be the wrong choice.

We were absolutely impressed with every aspect of this hotel. Very clean and well appointed rooms. Great size room (for New York). The beds were amazing, the best sleep I have had in a long time. Great location. I have a background in travel and have stayed in many hotels all over the world, the Flatiron by far exceeded our expectations in service, cleanliness, and decor. As indicated in other reviews the hotel is still in its soft opening stage and may be lacking in some of the service areas however, this did not affect us in any way because if you required anything, the staff was \"on it' . The Hotel Manager - Steven Meyer - definately made our stay unforgetable! From the moment we arrived, Steven greeted us, spent time with us to provide us with information on sites, shopping, getting around, and even made dinner reservations for us. The hotel was very busy upon our arrival, check in was at 4 pm. I needed to have the room available for 3 pm. Steven took care of us immediately and ensured that we were comfortable, satisfied and had everything we needed. I can't say enough about our experience in New York. Having worked in the service industry for many years I can only say that good service is what keeps people coming back. I have to go back to New York in a few months and will definately be back at the Flatiron. Since my return 2 days ago, I have already recommended the Flatiron to a number of people travelling to New York in the next little while. I recommend this hotel to anyone who appreciates good, beyond expectations service, a good night's sleep and a friendly environment. Hope you enjoy your stay as much as we did.

The bathroom had a TV built in the mirror and the lighting and curtains were all controlled by a remote. The room was small, but very nice. The location was OK.

Staff should just be direct and honest about the missing amenities: we were told by two different staff members that the gym wasn't finished, but they had an \"arrangement with a local gym\".

I assume this will not be the case forever, but if this matters to you, check before you book! The room itself was quite spacious, with glorious high ceilings and warm Venetian plaster walls. Wonderfully comfortable queen bed. Coffee maker on the compact desk but no electrical outlets on it, or nearby, for recharging phone, iPad and laptop. Push-button controlled draperies but no full-length mirror. There was enough space for an armchair, but there was no armchair. (These last two are the kind of things I expect they are still working on. I hope.) The bathroom was small but had good counter space and lighting. And a TV screen in the mirror. The shower was very small but had an amazing array of shower heads--an overhead rainfall head, a hand spray, and six body jets. Took a bit of experimenting to figure out the controls on the shower, however. Staff were friendly and helpful, although I think they are still figuring things out.
