It reminded me of the little one star hotels where we would stay when we traveled over 20 years ago. The staff was friendly and helpful, spoke English and recommended a great restaurant. We had a very large room with bath, overlooking the beautiful courtyard. There were not many amenities so if you have to have a terry cloth towel, bring your own. The linen towels the hotel provided were very large and clean and sufficient. Of course the age of the building means it is care-worn, but I found the place charming. It is in a great location near the Pantheon and the Piazza Venizia. We walked everywhere from here. We were here in the off season and really enjoyed our stay.

We would definitely return here. Perhaps chosing the private bath option though. We picked the hotel based on reviews here. Staff: The staff was generally friendly, knowledgable and helpful. They let us store bags here for a few days trip to pompei Location: As many reviews state, the location is a bit noisy but is very safe. There is easy access by express bus to Termini station from nearby. There's about a 10 min walk to a good gelato place however. That's probably my most serious criticism. Noise: We had a room without bath on the exterior wall. The courtyard outside the hotel tended to cause noise out there to echo a bit. It did not disturb our rest however. If you are sensitive to the noise, contact the staff and make sure you're on an inner room. The staff was very easy to communicate with by email to straighten out details before the trip. If you are sensitive to noise, you may want to reconsider visiting Rome anyway. Scuzi! Cleanliness: The room was quite clean. The bathrooms were clean as well but were a bit on the musty side odor-wise. Bathrooms: There were 3 common baths all with Toilet and shower. I'm 6'2\" and used the showers. It wasn't the most ergonomic experience of my life but it was ok. The baths are all different so you'll probably find one that is to your liking. There was no soap in the bathroom -- this baffles me. I tried to leave a soap there but for whatever reason it was gone the next night. If there's no soap, then no one washed their hands before touching the door knob. Bring soap and a tissue perhaps if you're sensitive to this. We washed out hands at the sink in the room after. Towels: Italian towels are like a nice Americal tablecloth. If you think you might have a problem with this, I recommend trying to dry yourself with a tablecloth at home before deciding to bring your own towel. It was fine for me. I might switch to tablecloths at home now! (they don't use the American Towel for the Italian Tablecloth in case you're wondering about that) Room: It was plenty big (14x 16 approx) there was a chair, a wardrobe, a bed, a sink. 12' ceilings approx. It wasn't decorated recently or perhaps even well. I couldn't care less about the decor. Who goes on vacation to complain about the decor of the hotel? I doubt those people can have a good time. Access: There is an elevator that is small and also a wide stairwell. There is a step up into the building from street level. I wouldn't recommend this hotel if you have a disability that limits your mobility in tight places. Food: Breakfast was fine. Nothing special but a good cheap start on your day. you can have as much juice and milk as you want. There are numerous cafes around to get better food and more coffee.", "Date": "February 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gloucestershire", "Title": "\u201cGreat value hotel in Rome\u201d", "Author": "sjsaville", "ReviewID": "UR6594360", "Content": "I had a wonderful stay here with my 8 year old son.

Plenty of room considering how tiny European hotels can be. Not too expensive. A hop away from the Pantheon. Close to some good resturaunts. I was able to walk everywhere I wanted to from the hotel (except for the Vatican) with 2 strollers. Friendly staff. Clean room every day. Private bathroom in this room (but not all rooms). Allowed us to keep our own food and baby bottles in the office fridge. Cons: Difficult to reserve - sent multiple emails without response . Finally I had to call it in - they said they'd email me a conformation. Never got it (didn't matter). Towles are like tablecloths. Breakfast is slim pickins. Set wake up call for 6am and received one promptly at 5am. Overall: Pros outweigh the cons. European small hotels can get creepy. This was nice, in a great location, and for a decent price. Tip: When you come out the door onto the street - careful, you're one the street; no sidewalk - look up and to the left onto the ledge fo the building across the way.

So even though it doesn't have all the modern luxuries, it was a really nice place to come home to. The rooms are huge and everything is super clean so the oldness just gave it a bit of charm. The staff is super nice and helpful (gave us great recommendations for where to eat/party/sights to see), no rude attitudes at all which is more than I can say for a lot of places. As two single girls, it can be a little sketchy walking home alone at night, but this hotel is in a well-lit, safe location and there are police officers stationed right outside.

General Hotel: Like others have said needs a refurb (and a touch of the How not to Decorate people) but it is 2/3 * remember and to be honest you shouldn't be spending that much time in the room anyway. Staff: All staff were pleasant to us, and more importantly could speak English, which was enough for us as none of us spoke Italian. One guy with sideburns was particularly friendly. There is one oldish man who serves the breakfast and cleans the rooms, he does a good job and we were not kicked out of our room too early on New Year's Day - as we did not know that check out was at 1130 they let us go when we wanted (obviously wasn't that busy). Breakfast: A cup of tea and a big roll and cereals if you want it, the bread roll was enough to fill us up till lunchtime and after all you want to enjoy the food in Rome so maybe its no point bothering with breakfast? Other Facilities: Most European 2/3* hotels I have stayed in don't have tea and coffee facilities or tvs - not that you would be able to understand them and again as I said we didn't spend that much time in the room anyway. Towels - the 'linen sheets' are standard in a lot of Roman hotels, we met some guys who were staying in a 4* hotel and they had the same. The location of the hotel is the most postive thing about this hotel, but I can only deduce that some of the reviewers on here just had negative stays there - luck of the draw it has all happened to all of us - even me, but I would recommend this hotel to anyone, just remember the following: 1) It is a 2/3* hotel. 2) It is on the 3rd Floor of the building (this is a VERY important piece of information to note as we walked into someone's house on the ground floor and as you imagine she wasn't too happy... oops When you arrive - take the lift to the 3rd floor immediately! 3) Take a towel!

Firstly, the services information as advertised and posted on the internet is misstated. It states that the hotel offers an internet service, laundry service, 24 hour room service, lounge, TV room, shared kitchen facility, etc. When we enquired about these services, we were told that the hotel does not have an internet facility for guests and the closest internet service is down the road toward the Pantheon. The person at reception also did not know where the closest laundry service was. I did not see a lounge or TV room in the hotel, unless the small breakfast room with the small TV on a shelf is regarded as the lounge and/or TV room. I can't see how they can offer 24 hour room service if they do not have a restaurant or cafeteria on the premises. The shared kitchen is indeed not a shared kitcken as there is a large 'Private' sign on the door of the kitchen and the hotel breakfast is prepared in the same kitchen as well. The room (room 34) was in serious need of maintenance as the paint was peeling on the wall. What was also very interesting was the 'airconditioning'. This consisted of a free standing airconditioning unit of which the hot air outlet needed to be placed manually outside an open window. With the effect that hot air and noise filtered into the room. No towels were provided in the bathroom, but merely linen sheets (that reminded very much of table cloths) to dry ourselves. This was quite an interesting exercise, expecially taking into account the hot and cold water fluctuations in the hand-held shower. The breakfast was below standard and we went out for breakfast everyday. Taking into account the additional money spent on breakfast for the four of us, we could just as well have booked into a better hotel for the same cost.
