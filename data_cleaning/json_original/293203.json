Stayed there on a Saturday and Sunday night. Had a 4th floor room facing Kinzie Street and was disappointed that my room had absolutely no view - just the ugly building across the street. I was also all the way down the hall, closest to the Public House bar/restaurant side of the building. On Saturday night, the Public House music was so loud and it went on till 2 a.m. I couldn't believe that I could hear the music that much from my room. The evening reception on Saturday night was so crowded, there was no place to sit or stand. I ended up taking my drinks and antipasta back to my room. Sunday evening wasn't as crowded, but they had the same antipasta spread. One thing I will say was great, was the alcohol selection and drinks. That was a definite plus. I also loved that Harry Carey's does the room service for food. Love Harry Carey's! As far as breakfast, I'm not a huge fan of cold breakfasts, so I thought the breakfast in the morning was just okay - a variety of pastries, bagels, cold cereals, yogurt, coffee, milk, juices, and fruit. The room amentites were fine, the furniture is kind of old - the dresser was pretty beat up as far as the drawers. The location of the hotel was outstanding - so much within walking distance. Would I stay there again? Probably not. My favorite boutique hotel in Chicago so far is the Dana Hotel & Spa. Now THAT place is a absolute treat and worth every penny and then some. The rooms are so modern, you get a lovely cooked breakfast in their restaurant, and their 26th floor bar with an open patio and fire pit is awesome. Loved that hotel so much better, I stayed there the next night which was my last night in Chicago (Monday).", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chevy Chase, MD", "Title": "\u201cGood location, great staff, great value\u201d", "Author": "PhilandSaraF", "ReviewID": "UR126098824", "Content": "I was in town for the International Home & Housewares show in March 2012.

Very nice, very helpful, from the doorman to the concierge. The breakfast, available on each floor near elevator was continental, nice selection of cold items as the name would suggest and the coffee was pretty good - even for a coffee snob like me.

Pros: Great location. Only 1.2 miles away from Union station; we walked to our hotel when we arrived in Chicago. Within walking distance of Millennium Park, Hard Rock Cafe, Rainforest Cafe, Gino's East. Two blocks away from the L line and also close to the Orange line. Great Appearance. The lobby is not as small as some people seem to be saying. It was never overcrowded. Great rooms. The room was spacious enough for me, despite what some people have said about the size. I had no trouble fitting four people in my room with me, but I suppose I can see how many more than that could get crowded. Great service. The employees were very attentive and whenever we requested something, we got it very quickly. They suggested great places for us to eat and visit, and even gave us coupons for some of the attractions we decided to see. We were greeted every time we walked into the lobby and were wished a nice day every time we left. Great price. Compared to the other hotels that I looked at, the price was quite nice. $50 cheaper than anything else I looked at, at this level of quality. Definitely worth every penny. Open Bar. I did not believe for one second that they offered a free bar every night from 5.30pm to 7pm, but they did. Not only that, their assortment of food and alcohol is not small. The bartender was amazing; he recognized who we are and what sort of drinks we would order after the first night, and he always asked us how our day had been. This is a great place to mingle with other guests of the hotel, too. Cons: The shower. The water pressure was not great, and I feel like two shower heads is kind of wasted when the water pressure is so low. Also, I feel like I may have been sharing my water with at least one other room. Almost every time I showered, the shower would randomly turn very cold. I would have to turn up the heat. A few minutes later, the shower would turn extremely hot and I would start to burn. I also noticed water pressure changes at time. Perhaps my shower was just broken in some way; the person I took with me said that his shower was fine. The breakfast. I'm not hating on the food per say, although I feel maybe there should have been a bigger or better selection. Mostly I'm hating on the toasters they provide. I burned myself trying to fish my toast out because it was broken. The noise. I requested to be put up as high as possible; they managed to put me on the 5th floor, which isn't bad when there are only 6 floors to begin with. The noise from the street wasn't bad at all, although I could hear the occasional honk. I should also warn you that this hotel is close to a fire department, so anytime there is a fire you will hear sirens and lots of them. This didn't particularly bother me either to be honest. My biggest complaint is the noise of other guests around you. I couldn't tell if it was the people staying next to me or above me, but whoever they were, they had kids, and those kids were very loud. You can hear the noise most clearly in the bathroom, but sometimes in the middle of the night I could hear very loud voices and moving about around my window. Overall impression: Would I recommend the Amalfi Hotel to someone else? Absolutely. The location, service, and overall appearance of this hotel makes it amazing. The price makes it a bargain. Would I stay at the Amalfi Hotel again? You bet. Prior to this I had only been to Chicago one other time, and I had stayed in the Silversmith Hotel. That was out of my price range this time, but I hoped to run into something that I could afford that would be just as amazing. In ways, the Amalfi surpasses the Silversmith. I intend to stay here again when I return in may to see Shpongle at the House of Blues, which is right down the street.", "Date": "March 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "oshkosh", "Title": "\u201cThe most helpful staff ever!\u201d", "Author": "toddc101 Posted by an Easytobook.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR125794781", "Content": "Our stay at the Amalfi Hotel was one of the best ever!

As has been said before, the rooms are small but sufficient, the breakfast is plentiful and well-presented. There was a good deal of street noise, but it is a city hotel and that is to be expected. The evening 'happy hour' offered a good antipasti and drink alternative to a heavy meal in the evening. We took advantage of it on two of our nights and found it to be quite good. The service was good, not intrusive. The lack of lobby space meant that you were in your room or on the street, but this is Chicago, and we wanted to be on the street.

Happy hour was also a very nice surprise. When I read about it, I expected a tiny glass of wine in a plastic cup as well as some chex mix. That couldn't have been farther from the truth. They have set up a big room with some tall tables, comfy chairs and a big screen TV to make it more of a lounge feel. (This means that there isn't a hotel lobby bar. But really? People are complaining about that? There are fantastic bars/restaurants literally RIGHT next door.) The hotel then offer an open bar as well as a big spread of Italian appetizers - breads, meats, cheeses, olives, etc etc. You could easily make a meal out of it. I've found this alternative to be a great way to cap off my work day by kicking back with a free glass of wine (or 5), chatting with other guests and relaxing while not having to be holed up in my room alone.

The only option he offered was to move us to a different room. We suggested the alarm might need a new battery, but he said it didn't have a battery. He didn't do anything about the alarm! It had by that time stopped making noise of its own volition, but what was to guarantee that it wouldn't start again? Moving us to a different room wouldn't protect the people around us from being woken up by a smoke alarm again. We ourselves unscrewed and unplugged the alarm and the hotel employee took it. The following day, we were told by a maintenance guy that the alarms did have batteries and that these were replaced once a year and the alarm would go off if the battery went dead. If they know this, why don't they replace the batteries every 6 months, like we all do at home? The thing that really got us is that no one at the hotel even so much as apologized for what happened with the alarm. Let alone that they offered any type of compensation or good-will gesture! We had another experience with disorganization of the hotel staff relating to the temperature in the room. This was set at 68, which was way too hot for us to sleep the first night. The buttons on the thermostat in the room wouldn't let us lower the temperature. The next day, when we left for the day, we asked someone at the front desk to work on getting the temperature lowered. When we got back, we asked if something had been done about it, and the answer was no, so we asked them to do this again. When we got to the room, the found that thermostat had been set to 72! When we tried to lower it, it would now go below 68.Problem solved, despite the front desk person telling us it hadn't.

We requested two rooms, one with a king bed and one with two queens. When we checked in, we were told there were only king rooms available. I realize this happens at hotels sometimes, but I have never had a hotel treat the matter so callously. Any other time I have had this happen, the hotel has offered an upgrade the other nights or some kind of amenity. We got nothing. Just a \"Sorry, there's nothing we can do.\" Wow. What ever happened to making the customer happy? We went up to our rooms and I called Orbitz to see if they could help. They spoke with the front desk staff and advised me they were told something was being worked out and the front desk would call us in a few minutes. We waited half an hour and had to leave so we could get to dinner. We stopped at the front desk on our way out, and the two employees said someone had mentioned the matter to them, but they did not get all of the details. We then told them what was most frustrating was that no one seemed to care that we were inconvenienced, and most hotels would have offered something. At that time we were told they could send a bottle of wine or some other amenity to our room. Not wine drinkers, we asked to hear the other options. We settled on chocolate chip cookies, to be delivered to our room the next night. The next night, there were four tiny gingersnaps waiting in our room. Since we don't like gingersnaps, I took them back to the front desk and told them we had requested chocolate chip. I was told we would have chocolate chip cookies in our room the next night. Did we ever get chocolate chip cookies? Of course not. Did we ever get anything for our inconvenience? Of course not. We did get our reserved rooms the second and third nights, but the first night my friend had to sleep on a roll-away in the corner of the room. Classy! If we hadn't been treated so poorly, I would stay here again in an instant. The hotel is beautiful. The rooms are nice. My friends enjoyed the breakfast every morning. (I don't eat breakfast, but they were very happy.) We went to the appetizer/drinks hour one evening. It was fantastic. Much nicer than I expected. And the fitness room was one of the best I've seen in a hotel. It really is a nice hotel.

My stay was completely pre-paid, so I got a little panicked when I was contacted regarding my reservation and queried as to whether I wanted it... I was told that was due to a computer glitch, maybe so. Pros: Concierge (day), rest of staff, bed, convenient location, breakfast buffet, evening reception, well-appointed fitness center, real glassware in the rooms (no champagne out of plastic cups). Cons: Bathroom, airflow, curtains, spotty wifi, dying remote batteries, evening reception... Check-in was easy, after I got past the massive group checking in ahead of me -- the concierge kind of threw me in the middle of them (in a good way). The room was a little disappointing, much smaller than I had anticipated (I should know, by now to not go by hotel pics...), and the bathroom was, well... I'm afraid hotel bathrooms are just one of those things for me -- and this one wasn't. While it may seem odd, the bathroom will be enough for me to NOT stay there again -- certainly not at $200+ per night. I'm not sure the purpose behind putting a two head shower in a standard bathtub, shower curtain set up -- you can't really use it without watering down the floor. The bathroom was dark and cold; no heat lamp, no exhaust fan. And holy cow, I thought I was going to have to get up to get the TP (it really IS too far away from the toilet, bathroom designers). The amenities were fine -- I did joke that I would be smelling like a lamb chop (rosemary and mint shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and lotion...), but they seemed to do the job. The aveda soap was nice. The bed was comfortable (very much so, actually), as were the pillows. There were real glasses in the bathroom, glass coffee mugs, and actual wine-glasses -- a nice touch. TV controls... omg are fresh batteries too much to ask for? Also, regardless of the temp on the thermostat (and we had it cranked to 75), it was cold in there. The fan runs continuously and, as with most heat pumps, the air is not warm enough to feel warm when crossing the skin -- furthermore, if the curtains are moving, then there is too much fan going on... Speaking of curtains... The curtains are pretty much useless. There are \"black-out\" curtains next to the windows, sheers, and then drapes. The drapes didn't close, the sheers -- you had to search for the opening, and the black-out curtains didn't come close to meeting (and staying) the edges of the windows, if they did, we couldn't find a way. So no black-out. No do not disturb signs??? yes, we were disturbed by housekeeping. In their defense, we should have had the bar lock on... But after that, and being sent away the next morning, Don't you think she could have found a Do Not Disturb sign? They have them, I saw one on a door. I liked the breakfast buffet -- there was not many folks around when I went out there, the coffee was good and hot -- the selection of pastries was great (croissant, pain au chocolat, danish, banana bread, regular bread, bagels, english muffins, do nuts, etc), although the toaster was all but useless (what is it about hotel toasters????). Tea, fruit juice, yogurt (fruit and plain), fruits (apples, bananas, oranges), and a variety of cereals. We were there early each morning but it was always stocked. The evening reception seemed pretty good -- we only went once, on a Friday night, and we weren't over-impressed (far too many people, not enough places to congregate) -- but really, it's an \"open\" bar with cold-cuts and chopped vegetables. And they were fresh, and plentiful, and free. So, that all seems pretty good to me. I thought the wifi as also not great -- but I didn't come to use the computer, and so I didn't sweat it too much -- annoying yes.", "Date": "November 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Swansea, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel in great location\u201d", "Author": "HFP52", "ReviewID": "UR120274244", "Content": "We were in Chicago recently and stayed at the Amalfi Hotel. This is a Boutique Hotel and is smaller than many others in Chicago, however, it is certainly one to consider. It is in an excellent location, very central. Easy walking distance to most of the attractions, shopping, and restaurants. Our room was a good size, (room 230) spotlessly clean, and the bed was probably the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in! Good pillows too. The bathroom was also a good size, very clean, plenty of towels, and flannels. The double headed shower was also good. There is a hairdryer in the bathroom. Also in the bathroom there were usual nice soaps, shower cream and body lotion, shampoo and conditioner etc. A nice touch were the robes and slippers. There is also a safe in the room. One reviewer has mentioned that the lobby is tiny. Ok, it is small, however, what it lacks in size it makes up for in quality, it is nicely decorated, and the staff we found to be friendly and efficient. We didn't use the weight room so cannot comment on this. The buffet breakfast which is on each floor by the lifts was fine for us. Plenty of fruit, bagels, breads, some cheese, cakes and pastries, orange and apple juices, yoghurts and coffee. It seemed strange at first to pick this up and then take back to your room. But it was ok, and actually quite nice. You could help yourself to as much as you wanted, so you need never go hungry. Also, coffee, hot chocolate and tea in the room. There is a mini bar/fridge in the room, and also bottles of water, should you want to purchase them. These, as in all hotels, are expensive. But most people realise this anyway. Another bonus for us was the fact there is a full size ironing board and iron in the room. There is a good television with plenty of channels. A few people have mentioned the fact that the WiFi was poor. That wasn't the case for us. We found it to be excellent. Whether it was sheer luck or not I don't know, but it was fine. A great bonus was the Cocktail Hour, which actually ran from 5.30pm to 7.00pm. You could have virtually anything you wanted, from wine, beer, shorts to cocktails. There were nibbles too.

Having spent a fair amount of time traveling to Chicago over the last year, I've stayed at 9 different hotels, and wish I'd found this one sooner. This was the lowest star rating of hotels I've stayed at and found it to be second overall only to the Trump (if you don't take price into consideration!) The quality of hotel in every respect was above par. Housekeeping was thorough and extremely attentive. The complimentary breakfast was excellent. Always stocked with coffee, juices, milk, teas, a variety of cereals and breads/pastries, cheese, yogurt, and fruit. Very convenient to grab on the way out, located on every floor at the elevators. The room quality itself was excellent. Bigger than average for the typical room in Chicago with adequate and modern furniture, and a comfortable bed. The gym is clean and modern with updated equipment. Overall, I cannot understand what makes this only a 3.5 star rating. While the location of this hotel is fantastic for restaurants, shopping, bars, nightlife, my one concern is that it is a very busy area at all times of day and the Amalfi is only a 6 story hotel. I would think it is hard to find a quiet room. I requested a quiet room and thought it was great when I saw that my room backed not onto a street, but into the alley. However, it seemed I was woken for an hour or so every night to trucks emptying the dumpsters. A minor complaint to an otherwise quiet room. The wi-fi is frustratingly slow, so be advised to bring an ethernet cord, as the direct connection is MUCH faster!!

I ended up getting here at midnight and didnt check in until 1 am. This is my first time staying at Amalfi, the previous time I stayed at Affinia. The location was great, a few blocks from Magnificent Mile, Subway-Clark/Lake station and other attractions were within walking distance. Check in took a bit of time since I wanted to put incidental deposit on a different card rather than the one I used to pay for room charges, the front desk was quick to accommodate this request and sped me through the check in process. I was exhausted and starved and they gave me menus of nearby restaurants that were still open and deliver to the hotel upon my request, that was very neat. The room (209) was probably the worst room u could get, of course i wasnt expecting a spectacular view since i didnt request and paid for one. The view of the brick wall of the building next door wasnt a problem. However I felt like I was staying in a matchbox because my phone cant even get any reception. The room itself was spacious but outdated, the bed was comfortable and I loved the 2 shower heads. But the room wasnt spotlessly clean since there were strains of hair spotted in the bathroom sink and on the bed. I decided I wasnt going to be a pain over that stuff. Free wi-fi was painfully slow even though I didnt use it much. I wont complain since it's free, but if you're going to offer it to your guests as complimentary, wouldnt it be more useful if the guests can really benefit from it? It's pointless for the hotel to offer it if the guests cant really use it. I woke up late and didnt make it to complimentary breakfast which front desk later informed me that it only last until 9:30 am. I requested privacy so the maid didnt come in and clean the room but they were curteous in leaving me a note that if I wanted the room cleaned they were still available. The next morning I did make it to breakfast and it was great, not a lot of choices but they were enough to get me through the morning.

The Amalfi is centrally located and very near the river, Michigan Ave, the riverwalk, etc. The staff couldn't be more helpful, and the bellmen were especially good. We're not fans of valet parking, but even that was OK. The rooms are luxurious, and it's really convenient to have breakfast on each floor and not have to dress to go to the lobby. They encourage you to go in the provided robes, which are very comfortable. A couple of things to be aware of...since the hotel is downtown, the views are not so great as it is surrounded by taller buildings. But in Chicago, most people don't spend much time in their rooms anyway. One other caveat...we bought tickets to a show through their concierge about a month ahead of time which were, of course, nonrefundable. After a couple of days, I went directly to Ticketmaster and found that I could have gotten the same tickets for over $100 less. Oh well, lesson learned.

We booked one of their King Suite rooms and it was just what we wanted. It was much larger than it appeared on their website and had wonderful curved windows in each room. While the room was very nice the furniture was a little tired however it wasn't an issue just an observation. The check in was very quick and the bell staff are wonderful. Whenever we had any question or needed local advice someone was always available and gave us what we needed. The morning continental breakfast was a great touch and sometimes we had to go to other floors to find specific things we wanted but that is understandable. The evening reception was just OK. I say this because I think they need to do something different. It is conducted in a small room with limited seating and dimly lit. If this is something they are going to continue to do I would change the venue. This is also the only area where I felt even a little bit of attitude by the staff.

In short, we would not hesitate to return to this place that doesn't skimp on the essentials, but doesn't go overboard with unimportant extras. Except in one respect, and here's my gripe: the bedside table is provisioned with four bottles of designer water priced at between $5 and $7 per bottle (see photo). Why? Is the Chicago drinking water unpalatable or dangerous? Is this something that most guests want or need? Or does the markup on this item make a good money-maker for the establishment?

We chose the Amalfi because we felt the rate we got was a good value given that it included valet parking and complimentary breakfast (all rates include the breakfast). Really glad we chose the Amalfi. We had a corner king room on the top floor. It was an odd shape for a room, but there were basically 15-20 feet of windows that provided an interesting view. The bed was comfortable and the television large, although we never could find the TV remote (only the DVD player remote). I think we could have easily had this taken care of, but we weren't too worried and didn't feel like dealing with it. We had brought some movies from home, so we just watched those. Bathroom was nice and well lit for a hotel in a city center. The theme, a modernist take on the style of the Amalfi Coast in Italy, at first seemed strange for Chicago, but in reality it's a nice way to give some more character to the urban-modern style -- made it feel unique and added charm. The thing about the Amalfi though that really made it worth staying there was the amazing service. For it's class (upper mid-range) the service was better than I would say we normally recieve. Easy check-in, easy check-out. Really polite, friendly and helpful staff. Excellent breakfast and complimentary cocktail hour (good quality on the beer and cocktails). A nice free perk for our anniversary left in our room. Can't say how impressed I was with the service given the value of the hotel. Finally, for those who are going as tourists, the Amalfi's location is actually really good. It's on a quieter side street, but the walk to Loop and Museum area attractions is not bad at all (10 mins depending on lights), while it also has proximity to Michigan Ave and the Magnificent Mile.

I really wanted to love this hotel. There are so many positive things about it but the negative aspect is too important to simply sweep under the rug. First, the positives! 1. Location! This hotel is in a perfect location to most of the popular sights and attractions in downtown Chicago. Great restaurants such as Sunda, Mastro's, etc are just around the corner. The nightlife around the hotel is close and happening, if that's what you are going for. More on that in a bit. 2. Transportation. The hotel is very close to the loop so if you need to take the CTA, you are very close. 3. Shopping. The Magnificent Mile is just a short walk from the hotel so you don't really even need a cab to drag all of your spoils back from an epic shopping trip! 4. The Hotel. The hotel itself was nice with great people working the doors and very nice people doing the check in. Jose was our guy and did a very quick, friendly and efficient check in upon our arrival. The one exception was the person we talked to about the noise in one of the rooms next door (see screaming wedding shower below). She was nice but fairly indifferent. I suspect it is because the hotel was full (I was told that by one of the doormen) and she really couldn't do anything about it. It was OK though. All I was really concerned about was whether they were checking out or if we were going to have to listen to them all night again. Negatives. 1. Noise, noise, noise. The location is VERY noisy. There are a few clubs that are very close to the hotel that were thumping until almost 5am. The PublicHouse was the insanely deafening culprit down on the corner of Lake/State, just below the Amalfi. Between the clubbing out on the street, the screaming drunks, the multiple wedding parties staying at the hotel, the SCREAMING gaggle of women in the room next to us holding a bachelorette party Saturday night then a wedding shower on Sunday morning, as well as the dozens of kids running up and down the hotel halls early in the morning while their brain dead parents were preparing for checkout, I could have gone to a Cubbies day game and tried to take a nap amongst the bleacher bums and had a better chance of getting some peace and quiet. It wasn't just a weekend thing, either. The area was just as noisy on Thursday night as it was on Saturday night. One of the problems you have with the hotel is that it has just 6 floors. Even though it looks like a high rise on all the photos you see, it isn't. There are what seemed like offices up above. So even if you get a room on the \"top floor\", you are still going to hear all of the chaos going on down on the street all night. That being said, I know that the club noise and the street noise is not the fault of the hotel. It's just something that is going to happen when you are staying in one of the most vibrant neighborhoods in the 3rd largest city in the US. I only mention it here in this review in case someone is choosing this hotel thinking that they are going to get a good night's sleep. It's not gonna happen, people... If the loud, drunken nightlife is what you are after, then this place is good for you.

The red line EL and the museum campus bus are only about a 5 minute walk from the hotel and are very convenient. We walked to Willis Tower and Navy Pier and both took about 20-25 minutes or so. On the walk to Navy Pier you cross over Michigan Avenue for some fantastic shopping on the magnificient mile! It is about a 10 minute walk to the Hard Rock Cafe and about a 5 minute walk to the Chicago Riverwalk. House of Blues is about a 1 minute walk from the hotel. There are a ton of restaurants, pharmacies, bars, starbucks and cafes all around. Harry Carry's is right across the street. Cabs are plentiful, though pricey, and a welcome relief for a ride back to the hotel! Taxi from O'Hare to Amalfi was $45, from Museum of Science and Industry to Amalfi was $20 and from Hancock Observatory to Amalfi was $12. We bought 3 day passes for the CTA for $14 and used that to get around town as well. The pass was well worth it and can be used on the EL and on the busses. Lou Malnati's pizza delivers to the Amalfi and eliminated an hour or more wait at their restaruant. Order early and request a set delivery time. They do not include any silverware or plates, so ask for paper products if you need it.

It is set up by the elevator and served coffee, tea, juices, bagels, donuts, breads, cereal, whole fruit, yogurt and string cheese. Being able to get your breakfast and bring back to your room was so nice. The room was clean and contained the usual hotel stuff, including the $8 bottle of water! At least they marked the bottle with the price. There was a refrigerator/mini bar (that took a key) in the room but we did not open it for fear of being charged for something that we did not take, but may have moved or looked at. The hotel has computers and printers so that you can check on your flight and print out your boarding pass. Three of us had iPhones and we had no issues with the internet connection or speed. Newspapers are available in the lobby. Ask at the desk for maps and they will give you a ton of maps of the area and brochures on things to do in Chicago.

We flew into O'Hare, took the Blue Line subway (about 30-40 minutes, depending on the stops, it isn't an express by any means, but is certainly cheaper than a taxi ride); we got off on the Clark St. stop and walked north across the Chicago River bridge a couple of blocks, then another couple of blocks east to the Amalfi Hotel on West Kinzie Street. It was rather hot that day, but as long as your luggage is wheeled, it is certainly bearable and worth the savings of either a taxi or a rental car (and they do have high daily charges for parking at the hotel). The lobby is small but nicely decorated. There are generally two staff on duty and I always found anyone there very helpful and friendly, more than happy to help you arrange reservations or give you ideas for excursions. We checked in without any trouble, though they do get a bit insistent on wanting you to have a key to the bar/fridge combo, since you CAN use what little room is left in there for your own food or drink. They also insist on a credit card in case you do use something out of there, even if, as we did, pay our bill upfront through Expedia. We had no problems with them upon checkout, however (no bogus claims of eating a candy bar or guzzling down one of the little alcoholic beverages). There are two elevators, both in good shape; our room, a queen bed (non-smoking throughout the hotel) had an absolutely lovely view of a roof and watertank eastward. I'm not complaining, mind you--it was just rather dominant, but if we'd wanted a fantastic view, we'd probably could have asked for a change, but no particular reason to. The bed was comfortable, though there seemed to be an awful lot of sheets fitted to it. The air conditioning is quite easy to set and very efficient, which was welcomed on the hot July 4th week we were in town. The bathroom was nice, with Aveda products available, along with a hair dryer. The closet, while not large, could have used some more hangers, but it did have a free safe for valuables and had a irorning board and iron, along with a complementary umbrella and a couple of robes with slippers (however, the ads for Amalfi seem to encourage going out into the hallway to get the free morning breakfast in your robe and slippers; as a 6'2\" fella, I don't recommend it, as the exposure from the rather smallish robe would probably have gotten me arrested in most states). A LCD TV was provided with a DVD player; while the hotel does offer HBO, the other choices on their system outside of local channels, usual network offerings, was a bit on the sparce side, but you don't come to Chicago to sit in your room and watch TV, do you? It would have been nice to have a little more selection in the evenings when we were resting, however. The hotel has free internet wi-fi service, though you can also plug into their network as well. I never had any problem in getting service, though it does apparently require relogging in ever 24 hours or so, which is a bit irritating, but manageable. My Nook Color reader, which also has wi-fi capability, hooked up into the network as well with no problems. If you do not have a laptop or e-reader with wi-fi capability, there is a business center on the 4th floor that has both PCs and Apple systems with a laser printer. I was able to access my e-mail account and my business e-mail with no trouble and had no trouble printing out airline passes. As indicated, the hotel offers free breakfast every morning on each floor in front of the elevators. It is continental with cereal, juices, yogurt, muffins, danishes, croissants and the like, along with coffee and tea. Don't bother with the in-room coffee maker or the \"Wolfgang Puck\" brand coffee; it is absolutely terrible. Fortunately, the coffee at breakfast was quite good and the staff keeps it full during the breakfast service. The hotel also offers an early evening \"reception\" on their 6th floor lounge, which is essentially just a large room with a bartender. They offer a number of drinks, alcoholic and not, particularly their two house drinks, which they are happy to share the receipies for. There is also an antipasti layout and the days we went it was well attended; the food was fresh and quite good. The Amalfi is across the street from Harry Caray's Italian Steakhouse, which does provide room service upon request; it also has Keefer's Steakhouse on the first floor. Keefer's appears to have a good reputation, but the prices aren't for the faint of heart. There are, however, many restaurants within close walking distance of the hotel, any many of them are quite reasonable. We ate at Xoco (Rick Bayless' Mexican street food--very good), Maggiano's Little Italy (good), Rock Bottom Bar and Grill (good burgers and on-site brewed beers), Ben Pao's (Chinese--very good) and the Public House (brew pub with an excellent beer selection and very good food) which is a few steps away from the front door of the hotel. The Amalfi itself is basically between the Miracle Mile and the Theatre District; you can walk to many things without a problem (like the Art Institute) or you can use Chicago's excellent bus and train system. Just make sure to buy a multi-day pass when you first get in, don't lose the card and get a map; it is easy to use and we never felt endangered at any time. We took in the Chicago Chocolate Tour and the Architectural Cruise, both of which were fun (though again, for the time of year, rather hot and steamy to participate in). The hotel staff again would have been more than happy to help arrange any number of activities and they had an entire file of pamphlets to hand out. All in all the Amalfi was well worth the trip. It may not necessarily be the most luxurious or best appointed, but for the value it was good and very comfortable. We've stayed over the years in bigger-name places and not been as well taken care of. We even had one repair necessary to our toilet which was taken care of quickly and an minor emergency (lost prescription glasses) that they helped with as well.", "Date": "July 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint Paul, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cGreat place for a getaway\u201d", "Author": "Robert801", "ReviewID": "UR115306666", "Content": "Stayed here for two nights on a getaway.

One morning no letter was left and the notices were not displayed so we had to ride the elevators floor-to-floor to look for where breakfast had been laid out.

I could not wait to share my favorite two amenities. First, the Amalfi has a complimentary Manager's Reception, every evening, with appetizers and drinks.The bartenders serve high quality liquors and manage the lounge-like area. My second favorite Amalfi amenity is the complimentary breakfast. This breakfast is not like most hotels where you have to put on a pile a clothes, stand in line in a lobby dining area and wait for milk for your cereal. If you are not the cheerful morning person, that is not the way to start your day. The Amalfi sets up breakfast on every floor. Oh, what a treat!!!!

The bartenders have ingredients cards so you can experience these cocktails at home. http://myalistlife.blogspot.com/", "Date": "June 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbus, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cNice boutique style hotel, Great Rate, Good Location\u201d", "Author": "IvanhP", "ReviewID": "UR111906567", "Content": "My wife and I spent one night here over the Memorial Weekend.

Complimentary continental breakfast is served on every floor in the elevator hallway. Very convenient to grab a quick cup of coffee and bagel to go on the way out into the city.

There is also climate control that you can control via a digital display so you can be comfortable to your personal preference. The rooms also have a mini-bar fridge and flat screen tv while the wireless internet was extremely fast. The business centre is also a nice place to be in with large screen monitors and a printer to print all your travel itineraries. They have a boarding pass computer/printer near the lobby which is a nice touch although I didn't try to use it. A nice touch from this hotel is the complimentary breakfast which is served buffet style on each level so you pick up what you want and enjoy it at your leisure back in your room.

It's next to some awesome bars and restaurants and within walking distance to the river. Our room was nice with a King size bed, but we had a view of the alley way and brick building next to us. The view didn't phase us too much, since we had the room for free anyway. I was excited to hear that the hotel provided a free happy hour time, but was disappointed with the food - just salami slices and veggies and dip. The drinks were great though, and I thought the Amalfitini was pretty good. If you like Irish food, I suggest Fado - just down Clark street-best bread pudding I've ever had. I had a little trouble sleeping at night because I could hear the sirens from outside very clearly through our windows...we were only on the second floor, so I'm sure that had something to do with it.

The room was nothing special, but the location was great! Lots of walkable restaurants and nightlife nearby. Easy walking distance to all the tourist attractions, subway, etc. Tip: if you arrive by train, be sure to take the $2 water taxi from the train stations directly to the Trump Towers next door to the Amalfi. What really set this hotel apart from others was their free happy hour! They served up good drinks made from top-shelf (well, at least mid-shelf) liquor, along with a couple of signature drinks. They also had a good selection of cheese, bruschetta, meats, etc. to snack on each night. Yeah, the lounge got a bit crowded, but never uncomfortable. We were always able to find a seat. The free breakfast was fine, but not as good as it looks in the pictures. It was convenient to have it set up on each floor, but it was definitely \"continental\", with few choices for protein. Tip: grab a couple of pieces of ham and cheese from the happy hour, throw 'em in your mini fridge at night, and you can create your own breakfast sandwich in the morning when they put out the croissants and bagels. Oh, one more thing... Before we arrived, we posted to their Facebook page. Our first evening, they hand-delivered a plate of really good chocolate chip cookies and a handwritten note thanking us for our Facebook post. I don't know if everyone gets the cookies, but the personalized comment impressed us. Comparison w/ Embassy Suites Chicago Downtown: Amalfi had a much better happy hour and better service. The free internet was nice, too. Guests at the Amalfi were definitely younger and more \"professional\", and the decor was more upscale.

The desk-side check-in (rather than a typical counter) is a nice opening touch, feels a little more private and upscale.

Actually, I had my best night's sleep there year-to-date during my recent visit (yes, better than home -- no pets or people to wake me up!).

Their signature drink, the Amalfatini was delicious! The concierge and front desk staff was so extremely helpful with it being my first time in the Windy City. Last year, I had a business trip planned and I knew my hotel would be the Amalfi. I was not disappointed! The stay was awesome, immaculate rooms, the reception hour was great, nice fitness room. The continental breakfast on every floor of the hotel is a nice touch and was great for when I needed to run out for my daily seminars. I have another business trip next month, unfortunately the Amalfi is over a mile away from the venue. Not sure I'm up to walking 1.5 miles everyday...then again it's the Amalfi!

The hotel was suitably quiet despite the location in the heart of downtown. I did make use of the business center, which was great for printing boarding passes. I also made use of the fitness center, which isn't huge, but has a nice enough selection of cardio equipment and weights/machines. There is a free nightly reception, and in the morning breakfast is laid out on each floor, rather than making you go to a central location. (The breakfast offerings were just so-so though.) There is free wi-fi throughout the hotel, which was also great. The room itself was clean and reasonably comfortable. The rooms aren't huge by normal standards, but for downtown Chicago they're pretty nice. The TV was a little disappointing. They're on the small side, the TV reception isn't very good, and the remotes are pretty terrible. The clock/radio appears to have many features, but it was actually kind of difficult to use.

The week of October 18th required travel with a hotel stay. I am a very particular person with an attention-to-detail. I booked a stay at the Amalfi for 3 nights on business. At first impression, I was impressed by the reception staff dress in their sleek attire with very cool hats for the bell staff. It reminded me of something very fashionable and current. The front desk area was something that totally surprised me as it resembled a reception area of a bank officer with just desks and chairs. The lobby area was very small but just the same, very comfortable. Check-in was completed in less than 5 minutes max with a reservation. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153experience designer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (desk clerk) was somewhat unreceptive, but I too was very short due to my own issues with airport travel. Nonetheless, if you choose to work in customer service, exceeding the customer expectations is the difference between thriving in business today and closing-up shop tomorrow. I stayed on the 5th floor (hotel has six floors) with a horrible view but I suppose it is impossible for all rooms having great views since the hotel is situated in downtown Chicago with tall buildings all over. The room was very small but surprisingly very stylish & comfortable. The bed was average but I did not have issue with the sleep quality. The iPod docking alarm clock was a nice touch. The shower was fine with plenty of hot water and had a double shower head that I liked very much. The bathroom amenities in my opinion were very nice products. I rarely use products in hotels but I found these products of a very good quality. The desk area was comfortable, adequate to do my work, and great internet connection (complimentary). Overall lighting was an issue but I just removed a lamp shade to get lighter. The room has a very nice bar setup that is well stocked with over priced items but does have free tea and coffee. The TV is a 26-30 inch flat screen with the standard hotel channels and overpriced movies. I did like the added DVD player with free movies at the front desk for your convenience. My only really negative was the carpet in the room. It was filthy and embarrassing. A major carpet cleaning is definitely needed. The exercise room was below average but I improvised and good in a fair workout daily. Finally, I very much liked the idea of the continental breakfast on each floor where you did not need to get dressed to go eat and the complimentary cocktail hour (5:30-7Pm) every night with light snacks.

Both times my experience with the hotel was superb. Reception, and front desk in general, couldn't have been more friendly and helpful. Among other things, on several occasions we received excellent recommendations for dining -- not so easy, because we required restaurants that were vegetarian friendly and not too noisy (since one of our party had hearing problems). However the task was made easier by the fact that the Amalfi is surrounded by many restaurants of all types. The favourite restaurants of those we tried were Mercadito (Mexican -- real Mexican, not Tex-Mex), Hub 51 (varied cuisine, heavy on Tex-Mex), and India House -- all in very easy walking distance from the hotel). The hotel itself is very attractive -- the lobby, the hotel rooms, the bathrooms. Only the lounge in which the hotel serves the free happy hour is somewhat dark and uninviting . . . though the drinks and appetizers are extraordinary considering that all is offered for free and with great friendliness by the staff in attendance. The breakfasts that are served in the well outfitted elevator lobbies on each floor, offer a wide variety -- coffee, tea, juices, milk, fresh fruit, yogurt, a variety of Danish, muffins, bagels, and sliced bread (with 2 toasters on each floor). And everything is frequently refreshed by staff who seem to continually move thru the floors to make sure everything is available. I have to say that I found it very pleasant in a hotel setting to make a quick trip down the hall in a bathrobe kindly provided by the hotel, to get my breakfast. The business centre offers four computers and a printer -- very convenient and very rarely fully occupied.

The hotel offers a lovely continental breakfast served on each floor, which we found both convenient and welcome, so we could relax and get ready in our room and enjoy it privately. The nicest feature was the lovely evening reception offered for guests, featuring antipasto and excellent drinks, including their signature Amalfitini - it was fabulous! The hotel staff were all exceptionally accommodating; they kept our bags after we checked out and even allowed me to use their business center afterwards, even though technically, I was no longer a guest.

Some may complain that it doesn't have a big enough selection, but the evening reception more than made up for anything missing in the morning. My only complaint on the evening reception was the crying kid in the small room. Yes we have a child and a little sympathy, but when your child is crying and everyone has to listen to it gets annoying quick. Leave the evening reception to the adults, the parents can always get their drinks/ food and take it back to the room to share with the kids. Free wi fi was appreciated when looking for a place to eat, things to do, and which blues club to go to. The beds/ robes were comfy, the rooms were quiet.

I had stayed at a few other hotels prior to our first stay at the Amalfi. However, once we stayed here, we've never thought about another hotel while in Chicago. The location is wonderful (and easy to get to). We typically just go up there for 2 - 3 days at a time. We just bring carry on luggage and hop the train from either O'Hare or Midway. It's only 3 blocks to the hotel once you're downtown. Once you are there, great restaurants, museums, Jazz or Blues clubs, etc. are all within walking distance. There are also free trolly's to get you around. On a couple of occasions I've purchased the 3 Day Metro Pass that allows you unlimited bus and train for a set fee. On some occasions we've been able to check in early (or to check out late). Even when that option is not available, they are always able to put your luggage in a secure area while you go enjoy the city. I've seen so many people mention the free breakfast on each floor. Everyone has their own opinion, but for me it is perfectly suited to get the day started. There is too much good food in Chicago to want to load up for breakfast. A piece of fruit, a muffin, and a cup of coffee and you're off to explore. On this latest visit I did notice that the nightly cocktail session has eliminated the top shelf booze that was previously provided. The hors d'oeuvres also were \"toned down\" a bit. I'm sure that is in line with the economic conditions throughout the US. Even so, stopping in each night for a cocktail or two and a little snack surely saves some decent $$$ prior to heading out each evening. There's not really much of a view from any room I've stayed in. On the other hand, the rooms are clean, nicely appointed, and comfortable. Just remember: Location, location, location. Of course all the nice things about the hotel would be of little value if it were staffed with an incompetent or unfreindly staff. For sure that is not the case.

I heard no noise from the other rooms; the only time I heard a shower from an adjoining room was when I was in the bathroom. The fact they have a strip across the bottom of the door from the room into the hallway definitely helped block hallway noise. However, unfortunately the hotel can't do anything about outside noise; i.e., kids yelling on the sidewalk, especially at Harry Caray's across the street; idiotic cabdrivers who have to honk their horns for the heck of it; sirens; etc. If you're a light sleeper and have a room facing Kinzie those noises can definitely wake you up. It didn't seem like the room was as big as advertised; to me, it seemed small. However, everything was clean and the room smelled fresh. The double shower was definitely nice! The bellmen recognize you pretty quickly when you're going in and out and greet you with a smile and a warm hello every time! They definitely seem like they enjoy helping visitors. The front desk personnel were also very friendly and greeted with smiles. I loved the breakfast on every floor! Normally I don't get up in time, but I did 3 out of 4 days this time. It was so nice not to have to get on the elevator and go down to a breakfast area. I wish other hotels would copy this! The croissants were delicious! I'd like to see the yogurt colder, though. I don't drink coffee, so I can't comment on that. Went to the manager's reception 1 night. I don't drink, so the bar wasn't a big deal to me, and the only thing I ate was some cheese with the little toast bites. My friend had several pieces of the meats, some of the tapinades, and the artichokes, which he went back for seconds on. I would agree...it is a small room, and would get tight pretty quick. I prefer the spread Homewood Suites puts out...and they change the food every night. I wish the rooms had little refrigerators, and that newspapers were sold in the lobby. I always buy newspapers wherever I go. A USA Today was hung on my door every day, but it would be nice not to have to walk around the block to a 7-11 to get the Tribune and Sun-Times. Housekeeping had some quirks. The first day she put the dirty plates from the breakfast and green coffee glass cups on the floor outside my door. While the plates were taken, the green cup was left there until my last day there...2 days later. I just waited to see how long it would stay there. Dirty glasses were not always replaced; coffee and tea packets also were not always replaced. I always take the toiletries for the Ronald McDonald house; these were replaced every day. However, when I left a note asking for extra towels & glasses, 2 extra towels and 2 extra glasses were left. The first day when I was leaving I happened to see housekeeping go down the other hall, and told her she could do my room any time it was convenient. She went straight to my room to take care of it! I felt very safe here (am a single female). The halls are very well lit, and you have to walk past the front desk to get to the elevators. I do wish the rooms had brighter lighting, though. Even with all the lights on in the room it was hard to read on the bed. And the chair is more decoration than functional; my friend said it was very uncomfortable. The Wi-Fi in the room was slow sometimes, very fast others. But I had no problems logging on and staying on. Alarm clock was very easy to program. FYI: parking rates in Chicago went up again! The self-park garage at State & Kinzie is $37/day. I moved my car down to the garage on Kinzie just west of Clark (a little over a block away). It's $28/day. The lots on Rush & Wabash also went up to $35-$38. The only place it's less is on Wabash just behind that big church on state; it's $25/day there (probably not for long, though!)

The front desk is also the concierge and they were very knowledgable on the sights I wanted to see. You check in sitting down and the staff seem to remember you, due to the small room numbers I imagine. During my visit they were experimenting with drink 'coupons'....going to the happy hour which were given to me upon check inthey had discontinued it a day or so later, I still have them as a souvenier. I think they were trying to restrict some guests for ordering too much of their top shelf liquor. I enjoyed their italian beer and their house drink, a lemonish martini. Worth the dollar a drink tip, not required. My son would order a coke but he didn't like the evening offerings. That could be changed around a bit, more finger food as the offerings could be messy when socializing. Perhaps gourmet pizza bits. I only was at the hotel for two nights during the manager welcome so not sure if they switch around the menu. I did notice some 'hoarding' at the continental breakfast, excellent. good quality baked goods, juices and coffee/tea. Also very nicely presented. I did see many people unaware that they could go to another floor if they were out of something, perhaps a note placed on each floor explaning this to alleviate frustration. Also I was able to use the free computer and printer in the business center with two macs and 3 windows and no wait there either. What I liked best was the close proximity to Andys jazz club around the corner. I read in other reviews about the location. It's not bad, a little scraggly but being improved and the proximity to Trump tower it should even become a better area. My room was on the sixth, top floor a nice view, directly across from the lounge. Very nice and quiet after 8. If I return, I would stay somewhere else but I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Chicago. Also our flight was to be later in the evening and the bell hop watched our luggage.

It is an absolutely fantastic boutique hotel because of location, friendliness of the staff, d\u00c3\u00a9cor, convenience and overall great value for the money. The name Amalfi is in reference to the Amalfi Coast in southern Italy, hence a lot of the decor and theme of the hotel is Italian based. The hotel is centrally located to most of the major attractions. It is about a block to the north of the Chicago river and a three blocks to the west of Michigan Ave, also known as the Magnificent Mile where all the trendy shops are located. This is the southern end of the Magnificent Mile, and if you walked a mile to the north end you would be at the Hancock Observatory. The hotel is about a 20 minute walk to Navy Pier. If you walk to the south, Macy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is about 10 minutes away and Millenium Park only about a 15 minute walk. Ther are many fanatastic restaurants within several blocks of the Amalfi such as Joe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Crab, Shaws, Harry Caray\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Webers. The staff are extremely friendly and knowledgeable and they helped us with some of our reservations such as the Architectural Boat Tour (a must for tourists to Chicago). The beds were the most comfortable beds we ever slept on and the bathroom was large with high end toilietries. The breakfasts are served on every floor. It consists of bottled juices, coffee, teas, pastries, yogurt and bagels. The only disappointment was that the only protein was cream cheese. I wish they would have had an assortment of hard cheeses and maybe some hard boiled eggs. Every evening from 5:30 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 7:00 pm they have Italian antipasto hors d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122oeuvres and unlimited cocktails and beer.

We were there from July 31 - August 4. We had two days that we paid full price for; the other two nights we got a discount online. I will give you the pros and the cons: PROS: (1) Excellent location. You could go for a leisurely walk at night time without there being 400 tourists in your face, unlike the places right on Mag Mile. It was in a safe neighbourhood and close to a ton of great restaurants in the Gold Coast and River North. If you are taking the boat tour, it was about 3 minutes away. We walked everywhere. Our room was facing Harry Carey's, and on the 2nd floor, so I was worried it would be noisy, but it turns out it was completely quiet. (2) Best beds EVER. So comfortable I was sad to come home. (3) Great breakfast spread. They had bananas, apples, oranges, yogurt, coffee (decaf and reg!), tea, juices, bagels, muffins, donuts, danishes, crossiants, etc. It was really fresh, too. (4) AMAZING evening lounge. For free! Get there for 5:25, because the line-ups are pretty intense. They give you free drinks, generous (tip the bartenders) amounts of alcohol in the drinks, and have a wide selection for the open bar. We went every night we were there (actually from 5:30 - 7, despite what the website says). The food spread was really good there, too, they had sliced meats, cheeses, breads, and some antipasto. This was a good idea to do before dinner, so you could relax and then go out for dinner a bit later. (5) We checked in early and they had a room ready for us. CONS: No real complaints. The only thing is housekeeping (I seem to have bad luck with housekeeping!). The first time they did maid service on our room, they didn't give us any more toilet paper, even though we had about one more use left on our roll. They didn't refill our Kleenex, either, even though the tissue was orange (indicating the end of the box). I called down and asked for another roll of toilet paper, and when we returned five hours later - still no toilet paper. Later, we had the sign on our door that said \"do not disturb\" -- and when we returned they had made-up our room, meaning they entered without permission. I called and asked about this, and they said that the maid had been confused by the sign on the door. It wasn't a huge problem but it creeped me out because I had stuff lying around and wasn't expecting them to enter.", "Date": "August 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cAbove and Beyond\u201d", "Author": "NikkiG1133", "ReviewID": "UR36084417", "Content": "We decided to stay at Amalfi on Sunday, July 5 since we were in town to attend a Cubs game.

The cocktail reception was very good, but our advice is skip the signature Limoncello Martini, we and not anyone that was around us cared for it, and we love lemoncello! We would have much preferred a cold limoncello shot the way they are actually served on the Amalfi Coast. Breakfast was also good with tasty options, but not having a simple toaster, was a drawback. The rooms while small are very comfortable, and very nicely appointed. There was a party in a room adjoining us, which sometimes got loud, but the room was really pretty soundproof considering the noise of the party. As past visitors to the Amalfi Coast, why this hotel is named after that area was beyond us. Besides a couple of pictures, there was absolutely nothing about the hotel that resembled the Amalfi Coast,. We kind of expected the bright blues, yellows and whites that adorn most of the decor of that area. Not even one ceramic piece of decoration for which they are famous. The Amalfi Coast should complain, really if anyone travels their expecting boring beige, browns and dull burnt orange colors, they may be overloaded by the spectacular beauty of the region. We went over to HUB 51 for lunch, which is a wonderful alternative to the touristy joints, like Harry Carry's. It is also across the street, just the opposite corner and down a block.

Each morning we had a USA Today hanging on our door. The bed in the rooms are so comfortable, I didn't miss my own at home! Remember to bring your ipod, they have an iHome that you can use. They have a makeup mirror and hair dryer in the bathroom. The bathrooms are stocked daily with Aveda products and if you choose to have the key to the minibar, which is also stocked daily. It was refreshing to have breakfast available on your floor that you can just run down and grab something to take back to your room. Coupled with the happy hour in the evening, it was nice to enjoy drinks and great food without putting a hurt on the wallet. Our room was close to the lounge where the happy hour was, once we were in our room, we couldn't hear a peep. We look forward to coming back to this hotel again and cannot say enough how much we enjoyed staying there. Based on another review, we ventured over to Rockit Bar and Grill - fabulous.

We lucked into finding this hotel through a Travelzoo top 20 deals email and only paid $94/night for a king. Reading the previous reviews on this site it seems we got a great deal. Our stay was amazing. The renovation is now complete and the lobby and rooms are gorgeous. The mattress and sheets were very comfortable. A few others remarked on the size of their rooms. I felt our room, 633, was more than adequate. I did not feel the room was at all small. But perhaps that is because our room was a king versus two doubles, perhaps? The room included a nice lounge chair and lamp by the window which was nice to sit back in and peruse the Chicago publications the hotel offered in the room to read. The double headed shower was warm and powerful. We probably showered about 10am on Monday morning, and hot water was not an issue. The Aveda bath products were a nice treat. The bathroom, and the room in general, looked and smelled very clean. Now that I think about it even the hallways of the hotel smelled wonderful. Just a nice clean smell, nothing heavy or like perfume. The complimentary reception for guests on the 6th floor was a nice touch. A tip jar was present and we gladly tipped with each trip to the bar to get another delicious Amalfatini, their signature drink (although they offer many other drink choices...I saw quite a few cosmopolitans). The food offering at the reception was adequate, but nothing spectacular. A selection of meat, cheeses, crackers, and a vegetable/dip tray, if I remember correctly. But we weren't looking to fill up as we had reservations at The Prime House for 7:30, which was about a 8-10 minute walk away. The 55 dry-aged steak there was fabulous! The complimentary continental breakfast was also appreciated. I wasn't wowed by the offerings which were kinda standard cold fare selections (pastries, bagels, fruit, yogurt), but hard to complain about a free breakfast. What I was wowed by were the staff members. Everyone we interacted with were very friendly and helpful. It's amazing what a difference that can make on your overall impression of a hotel, or for any business for that matter, I suppose. Simply put you just felt very welcomed. It was a nice change of pace from other Chicago hotel experiences we've had. Our family travels to Chicago 1 to 2 times a year for just a small get-away and to take in a few of our favorite eating destinations. We usually try to find accomodations for about $100/night. We enjoyed our Amalfi experience so much we will probably be back irregardless of cost, as I don't imagine our $94/night offer will be often repeated unfortunately.

If you're at all familiar with this hotel, you know they went through a remodeling. It's finished, and it's terrific. Very tastefully decorated lobby, hallways, and rooms - particularly the bathrooms. Loved the complimentary continental breakfast, and what a cool idea! Each floor has its own setup. You go out and get whatever coffee, tea, juice you want, plus pastries, fruit, yogurt, bagels, etc - then take it all back to enjoy in your room...then of course back for more anything you need. (And I haven't run across many breakfast setups that have pain au chocolat, but the Amalfi does). Then there's the nightly complimentary reception - wine, beer, and cocktails to accompany an Italian-themed appetizer buffet, loaded with tasty choices. We loved both ends of the day! One last word about the location. It was such an easy walk to our favorite activities - the Art Institute, the Cultural Center, and of course shopping. Never needed a bus or a taxi. In fact, we love to take walks on trips like this as a form of exercise (though there is a very well-equipped health center in the hotel) and we had to go out of our way to make them longer - all of our spots were just too close to the hotel.

Went to Chicago for a romantic weekend with my husband; our only solid plans was to see Wicked. We booked through Orbitz ($246 final total for 2 nights) since they had a 20% hotel sale and then had a 15% coupon code in January. The hotel will match any internet price and give you a free upgrade (but couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t match all the discounts we got). I chose the hotel since it was centrally located and had complementary breakfast and cocktails. Even though I had called a week before about our dates, the hotel failed to mention that their lobby was closed & being renovated. They did everything out of this small hallway by the elevators. I inquired about the cost of upgrading and the guy went into a long speech about how they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know Orbitz price so they wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how much it would be. Usually I either simply get a complimentary upgrade or just pay a small set fee. Oh well. The room was somewhat small (it is downtown Chicago) and if we were in a room anywhere lower than the 5th floor we would have had a view of a brick wall. The room was nice and the beds were VERY comfortable. In our bathroom there were a couple dark hairs in the tub that I have a hard time believe the cleaning staff could have missed. If it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t already midnight when we arrived I would have probably gone down and complained. Everything else seemed very clean. The breakfast is simple coffee, bottled fruit juice, and pastries. It was great to be able to throw on a robe, go into your hallway, grab a cute tray and bring back food to your room. One of the other reasons that I choose this hotel was their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153experience designers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. We started by searching for a good sushi restaurant for lunch. The guy wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very helpful other than giving us a print out of the address of one nearby. I was so disappointed with my experience designer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lack of energy or care, that I ended up going to their business center and using TripAdvisor to find a good place for dinner. On the point of the business center, it is free, had 4 computers (1 mac) and a printer. Two of the four were frozen, but it is still nice to find a hotel in Chicago that isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to find every little thing to charge you for. They also had free wireless internet and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget the free breakfast and cocktails. In terms of the cocktails, we never took advantage of it. We arrived too late on Friday night, and Saturday we were out exploring Chicago from their 5:30-7 timeframe. All in all, the breakfast in bed and the location can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be beat.

The moment our car pulled up to the curb, two helpful men were there to take our luggage into the hotel and valet our car (valet survice is offered). It`s true that the lobby is small compared to most hotels, but what it lacks in space, it makes up in quality. The whole hotel smells like fresh flower and zest, and the bright, modern colours really add a nice touch. The conceirge booked us into our room right away, and we had staff bring our luggage up to the room. Our room was on the top floor of the hotel (there are other businesses on the higher floors), and the best place to be. The room was quite small, but it was very clean, comfortable and had a pretty good view from the window (not like it matters all that much). There were many new magazines like InStyle, ect on the desk, which was great. The bathroom stocks the most amazing Aveda products, which I admit to taking a few home with me. The two-headed shower is lovely and the bathroom is overall very clean and modern. Our room was right across from the room where they offer free happy hour and light food at night. You would think it would be noisy, but from in our room, you could hear nothing. The happy hour was great, you could go in (even with your children, but bringing young ones could be a problem) and get whatever drink you like (tip if you want), and there were an abundance of breads, cheeses, meats,ect. Very nice to go to before dinner. In the morning, they offer breakfast on each floor, right outside the elevator. I went in my PJ`s every day, and they had a good assortment of fruits, juices, coffees, teas, croissants, buns, pasteries, bagels, ect. The only thing my family complained about was the lack of hot food or a toaster for bagels, but I think it wasn`t such a big deal. If your floor was out of some pasterie or whatnot, you could go to the floors below and take one of theirs. The Amalfi offers a \"business\" center, which is basically a very small room with two computers and a printer. That is fine since the internet is free, and almost always the computers are empty, so you don`t have to wait. The fitness room is large and well-stocked, though we didn`t use it. For restaurants in the area, try Harry Caray`s across the street (great bar food), or for a really hip, cool environment try the restaurant which is right behind the hotel, called Rockit Bar and Grill.

The service, from the General Manager to the marketing people to the general staff, is simply wonderful. They all make the guests feel very welcome. The rooms are nice, with comfortable beds, flat screen T.V.'s and recently updated bathrooms. Each level of the six floor hotel includes a continental breakfast, which makes it easy to pick up your food and bring back to your room to enjoy. In the evening, they offer a fantastic hospitality suite with drinks and delicious appetizers, the perfect place to relax after a long day. All this is included in the room price, an extraordinary value for any hotel. The Amalfi is ideally located with many fine restaurants in the immediate area.

Soft robes and slippers, aromatic Aveda products, comfy pillow top mattresses and silky sheets! We slept like a dream! I also loved the ipod alarm clock that I could plug my nano into it. The continental breakfast on each floor was nice to wake up to and roam out in our robes to. And the evening hors-deuvrs were yummy and almost a light dinner in and of themselves! Chocolates on our bed at night was nice! One of the very best things about this hotel is the staff. They are so helpful and Olga, the Information specialist you talk to on the phone when you stay there and need information about the hotel or the area is the sweetest person in all of Chicago! The Amalfi is in a great location, close to everything, including Harry Carry's restaurant which is right across the street and yummy! You can walk to the Magnificient Mile and to Navy Pier and just about anywhere downtown. It's also easy to access from the Blue Line Rail that comes straight from the airport for $2! A super deal! The Amalfi is all in all luxurious but not 4 or 5 star. It's a great place to stay, but not high-end. It's electic, comfortable, and very accomodating. One more thing: don't miss eating breakfast at the Bongo Room about 3 miles from the hotel...it's not quite walking distance (unless you want to jog there like me and my girlfriend me so that we could eat a bigger breakfast).

They had nice touches like updated flat-screen TVs, DVD players (with loaner movies available in the lobby) to suppliment the standard pay-per-view and CD clock radios. They also had CDs and used books in the room if you wanted/needed them. The Aveeda bath supplies were a very nice touch as were the quality towels.

While we were disappointed in the view, it was not a major problem. What was a major problem was that during 4 nights of our 7-night stay, we could clearly hear the bass from the nearby nightclubs. I am pretty sensitive to sounds and it was practically impossible to fall asleep with the *thump-thump-thump* of dance music reverberating through our room. This was sometimes interrupted by trucks emptying the dumpsters during the middle of the night, which at least broke up the monotony of the music. Our last night there was the worst, as several patrons of the nightclub ventured into the alleyway for smokes (I could see them clearly from my window), so we could hear human voices in addition to the music. This is very unfortunate, as the hotel was pretty wonderful in every other aspect. The staff there was friendly, the continental breakfast was the best I'd ever seen (coffee, orange and apple juices, fruits, and many great pastries), the rooms were comfortable (I even looked into buying a pillow), the bathrooms clean and spacious with a double shower head (although no blowdryer), free happy hour cocktails and snacks every day (yes, free alcohol!!), the turn down service provided free Ghirdelli chocolates, and the location was great, just blocks away from the Magnificent Mile and subway stops. The hotel, in and of itself, was really well put together, and impressive in its own right. All that being said, I would not stay at the Amalfi again. In my opinion, it doesn't matter how great the hotel is - if you can't have a restful sleep at night and you get out of bed cranky in the morning, then nothing else matters. I've stayed at a 2-star hotel that literally had prostitutes hanging out in the lobby in the middle of the night, and had a better night's sleep. If you go and you luck into a room that is not facing the alley, perhaps you will not have problems with the noise, and your stay will be enjoyable and restful. I would also recommend the hotel for those that are going to be out partying all night regardless, and who would thus not have concerns about late night noise. But for those that need some measure of quiet at a reasonable hour in order to fall asleep, I would most definitely recommend looking elsewhere, or at least ensure that the room you book is not facing the alley and is on one of the upper floors, before you confirm your reservation.

My boyfriend and I both agreed one really good thing about this hotel is that it is in a really good location. Most everything is within walking distance with the exception of the main tourist attractions (museums, navy pier, aquarium, etc). To see those we had to take about an $8 taxi ride. The hotel staff was nice...not over the top accomadating, but nice. The entire hotel has a modern feel to it. The rooms are really nice, clean and simply decorated. The bathroom is a good size with lots of counter space (which is important to a woman...at least me). I have to say, I travel quite a bit for business and normally have a hard time sleeping, but the beds there are very comfortable. One thing that bothered me about the hotel was their room service...they technically don't have any. There is a restaurant next door called \"Harry Carry's\" which they order room service from. You place your order with room service in the hotel, they place the order with Harry Carry's, and bring it back to you. I ordered room service both nights I was here alone and the food was marginal if that. My food arrived luke warm (if that), it arrived late (they quoted me 30 min...took almost an hour), and the dinner rolls were hard as rocks (both nights). On top of all that it was very expensive...over $30 for a plate of spaghetti, a salad and glass of water. If room service isn't important to you...I reccomend staying here.

Mediocre points: For the price and all the glowing reviews I read, I fear it's not quite up to snuff. The service wasn't exactly what I'd call \"European\" or \"upscale\" as some other travelers have noted. It's more like a very nice Holiday Inn. The staff is friendly (except for the doorman, who was always excellent), but they don't really go out of their way to make you feel welcome or particularly pampered. All in all, it's \"fine\" but not $400-per-night worth of fine. Bad points: We had room 311, which backed up to an alley filled with dumpsters. OK, you're not looking out there, but you will hear the garbage trucks emptying every one of the 35 dumpsters at 2am. Not exactly restful. On the first night, we thought, \"well, what bad luck but now that's over.\" The garbage trucks returned the next night for another two-hour crash BANG BOOM fest. We asked to be moved the next day, which the hotel did. We also asked for an adjustment to the bill (they took off $20 for each of two nights), which they did less readily.

The only thing I would say on this matter was that we weren't offered anything like this service at all, it was only when we were checking out that I heard someone asking about the shuttle bus service the hotel runs, but I guess if you don't ask you don't get! We found the rooms smart, modern, clean and comfortable and the turn down service offered of an evening by housekeeping is a nice touch. The bed was large and very comfortable, the bedding was non-allergenic and a 'mock' down. The rooms were spacious and stylish and the Aveda toiletries a very nice touch. The room looked just as in the pictures on the site. I was a bit wary of the breakfast service when I read that it was served in the lobby areas of each floor, however this was not a problem at all. Hot coffee, water for teas and a selection of bottled juices were offered. There were plenty of pastries, muffins, breads/loaves and bagels but there are no toaster facilities. Unfortunately we did not take advantage of the evening cocktail reception as our time in Chicago was very limited. The location was great, the area is on the quiet side and the views weren't amazing but Harry Caray's is opposite and Lou Malnati's (absolutely divine pizza pie!) is within a short walk. Magnificent Mile is about a 5 minute walk to the left and the the Chicago River and access to the Loop about a 5 minute walk down the road. If you're looking for places to go I would recommend shopping at Magnificent Mile, there are some good souvenir shops too in the malls, you could finish up having lunch in Pizzeria Uno or Pizzeria Due which are both toward the farther end of Magnificent Mile. The Cheesecake Factory at the bottom of the Hancock tower was really nice, we originally intending on having drinks in the John Hancock Tower bar to take in the views but my boyfriend's vertigo got the better of him on the 96th floor!

If you do decide to go to Chicago I would recommend a restaurant called Rose Angelis, it was in a converted house in the suburbs (1314 W Wrightwood Ave) and it took us a few minutes walk to get a taxi back when the city was on stand-by for snow storms but it was well worth the taxi ride. 10 Pin is very close to the hotel and we had cocktails here and a game of 10 pin bowling and Chicago Blues is within the same complex.

The lobby was really weird,with a mixed array of colors,like orange,green,yellow..it felt like a Brasilian hotel. The only nice person seemed the bellman. Rooms. We booked a non smoking room,but it seemed the room had 20 heavy smokers in there for 2 days and never had a window open for vent. Even the sheets stinked smoke...disgusting. The mustard colored carpet was pretty worn and cigarette butt burned. A nice touch were the books and the room size,but it all appalled compared to the general feel of the room. And here we go again those weird colors. The bed was very comfy,except for the conforter wich was made with a very cheap material that turned the bed into a hoven. Maid service was really weird. They left every single day some water filled in the bathroom sink..what for ??? Weird. And turndown service was only for one night....no need that...just skip it,don't do it for just one night.... The bathroom colors all added a feeling of dirty and worn,they need to replace those red/grey/yellow thing with a more traditional black/white/grey. The breakfast on each floor was not bad,really. Bottom line,if you look for a cheap place to stay then go for it ,but do not belive their overhyped self written reviews ( yes,they write their on reviews on Tripadvisor..and they know it ) It was cheap tho because of the low season. I really doubt seeing myself paying more than what'ive paid ( $ 129.00 per night ) for this joke. And also go for it if you don't mind being trated like you are not cool or not hip or not whatever they stand for....", "Date": "February 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada_is_Home123", "Title": "\u201cGreat Little Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Canada_is_Home123", "ReviewID": "UR13367136", "Content": "My fiance and I visited Chicago for a long weekend back in May.

If the weather is bad, a cab ride would be short and cheap.. much cheaper than a cab ride all the way from O'Hare! The train, FYI, was $2 one way.. great deal! Views from the rooms won't be too special, as the rooms only go up to the 6th floor and taller buildings are all around. Oh well, get out and walk!

Nice to see! Perks: The evening reception was EXCELLENT! Very decent selection of comp drinks, including some well drinks, wine, beer, and sodas.

We walked to the Taste of Chicago, and took the free trolley around the Loop and to the Navy Pier and the Field Museum. The hotel was spotlessly clean, and every single person we met was helpful and cheerful. Our luggage was lost by our airline, and though we checked in at 11:30 at night, we were quickly given toothbrushes, toothpaste and deodorant! Our 6th floor room faced Kinzie St., and it was at the end of the hall (612) so our location was quiet and had a nice view of the city skyline. There was not much construction going on in the museum building going up across the street, and the Trump Tower going up in the next block, so we were never inconvenienced. We enjoyed the quiet and we loved the contemporary decor. Nice touches: incredibly well-stocked honor bar, books, magazines, CDs and nice clock radio (tuned to a jazz station.) My husband had ordered champagne and candles for our anniversary (which we spent chasing our luggage and arriving in Chicago 8 hours later than we had planned) and they were waiting for us...but the ice had melted and the candles had burned out. But it would have been really cool if our plans had worked out. Thanks to the hotel staff for taking care of that for us! It was great that there were very few children in the hotel...and the few we saw were teenagers. The continental breakfast was good, though not filling. We were able to get coffee (which was quite good) and fruit before heading out on foot to get a real breakfast. The white wine at the \"cocktail party\" was bad, though. And it is really weird to go into this room with Muzak playing and strangers standing in line only talking to the person they came with. (And one couple brought their child.) To make this a party, one really needed a social director kind of person to get people to mix. Everyone got their drinks and went back to their rooms. Weird. We only tried this once. After that, we went to a real bar. My only complaint was that at 9 p.m. we had to call and inquire where our laundry was, after we had been told it would be delivered to our room by 7 p.m. And the laundry service was incredibly expensive. If we had known that at first, we would have just bought more clothes to wear instead of cleaning the ones we had used. (Luckily, our luggage arrived before we left Chicago.)

Also, there was a problem with our toilet that was resolved promptly to our satisfaction. Things to note: VALUABLES~There is no in-room safe. If you need to stow something of value you have to use the hotel's safe deposit box. I find this unacceptable for a hotel of this level in Chicago. NOISE~As another reviewer noted, there are MULTIPLE construction projects going on next to the Amalfi. It begins early in the morning until around 6pm, including Saturday mornings. If you want to sleep in past 8am or want a nap during the afternoon you may have problems. FOOD/DRINKS~The continental breakfast and free cocktail hour make this hotel a good value. We saved on breakfast by staying here and enjoyed the \"Amalfitini\" as our pre-dinner drink. I liked the Amalfi, but I wouldn't return until I knew the construction projects were over since I like to sleep late when I'm on vacation.

After reading some of the reviews, I sent an e-mail to the hotel to request a quiet room, facing the front, rather than the back side of the hotel (where the loading dock and dumpsters are located). I received a response very promptly and was told that a room on the fifth floor with view on the city had been blocked for us. The room was extremely nice: king-size bed, big windows, very nice soothing decor. The first impression was one of cleanliness. The room smelled good, and everything looked impeccable. The bed was extremely comfortable, the linens of excellent quality, the bath products very nice. Little details I should mention: nice lamps, nice TV with CD and DVD player (DVDs can be borrowed free of charge at the front desk, and some CDs are already in the room), in-room coffee maker, nice closet with iron and ironing board and full-length mirror, magnifying mirror in the bathroom with different light settings for make-up, hair dryer, curved shower curtain rod that allows for more room in the tub/shower and makes it possible to take a shower without ever being in contact with the shower curtain, certificate showing the room is an allergy friendly room. In addition, the manager's reception with great cocktails (Amalfitini and Amore for example) and a buffet with roasted vegetables, tapenade, cheese, foccacia, and a variety of Italian cold cuts is a really nice touch after a long arduous day of shopping! Of course, the lounge is small and seating is insufficient (especially on the weekend), but if you plan it right (arrive there early!), it makes for a very pleasant hour and a half. The breakfast buffet is another nice perk. A buffet is set across from the elevators on each floor: coffee, tea, juices, a variety of pastries, croissants, bagels, and fruit are available to take back to your room on a little tray that is provided. Very convenient! All in all, I would highly recommend this hotel: friendly associates, quiet and comfortable rooms, convenient location with lots of restaurants in the vicinity (Avoid Redfish at all costs. We waited 55 minutes to be served after we ordered, the food was bad, the service inadequate, and our check --as well as the checks of our neighbors on each side-- was inaccurate. We could not wait to leave!) Good restaurant choices are Brasserie Jo for French food and Joe's Seafood Prime Steak & Stone Crab, among many others.

Lastly, the concierege and basically anyone working at the hotel are so friendly, kind and informative. Is there anything wrong with the hotel?

We had never stayed there before, but after reading the excellent reviews on sites like this one, we decided to give it a try. The staff was very courteous and helpful. After we checked in and got settled into our room, we were amazed that the interior looked exactly like the photos online(which is not always the case)! The rooms were a little small, but we found them roomy enough for downtown Chicago. We were a little disappointed with the view from our first room (basically just dumpsters and a brick wall outside our window), but our request for another room was accomodated quickly, and our second night was spent in a room with a much better view of the surrounding skyline. This hotel is not a great place to go for views, because there are only six floors and it's almost completely surrounded by taller buildings. Don't let that discourage you, though, because it really is a very nice hotel for the price! We found that we were walking distance from the Magnificent Mile, and we even trekked all the way north to the Hancock Center for supper at the Signature Room and back again! We were surrounded by great restaurants, shopping, and entertainment. The bed was EXTREMELY comfortable! I have never slept better in a hotel before in my life! The hotel offers an excellent breakfast each morning on every level so you don't even have to take the elevator. There is also a nightly cocktail party with complementary beverages every night, but we didn't get to attend because we had dinner plans both nights. The rooms were very quiet, thanks to the thick walls and central heating and cooling (no noisy wall unit). The TV and DVD player were satisfactory for viewing a movie from the front desk, which proved to be a relaxing end to a day of shopping. The valet parking service made our stay convenient, and for $37 a day we were able to come and go whenever we chose. My wife and I are very frugal when it comes to travelling, so we usually stay in a hotel in the suburbs and drive in to downtown Chicago for sightseeing. After calculating the cost of driving all that distance and paying for parking, along with the hassle that comes with it, we've decided that the Amalfi is definitely worth the price.", "Date": "December 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, great staff, great place!\u201d", "Author": "footballfrk", "ReviewID": "UR6358463", "Content": "My wife and I traveled from Michigan to spend a weekend in Chicago for some Christmas shopping and R&R. We have previously stayed at the James, Hyatt Regency, and the Hilton. This was our first stay at the Amalfi and we will surely be back. It is rather small and unasumming, but easy to find on Kinzie, directly across the street from Harry Carreys. The doorman and bellhop were extremely helpful and friendly. The check-in was quick and painless. The experience planner was just that, she had answers to all of our questions and was eager to please. She most certainly went above and beyond what we have experienced with other concierge services at other hotels. The room was nothing extraordinary. It was clean and spacious. The kingbed was nice and comfy with lots of pillows. The bathroom was a typical hotel bathroom except for the 2 showerheads and Aveda bath products. We did not have any noisy neighbors but the ice machine sure cranked out some db's when guests were filling their icebuckets. One of the highlights of the hotel is the complimentary happy hour each evening from 5:30-7:00pm. The snacks and top-shelf drinks were a great way to wind-down as well as to prime the pump for a fun evening on the city. The continental breakfast was also a wonderful way to get your energy for a long day on Michigan Ave. The views are not very desirable, but we didn't really visit for the Amalfi for the view. Check-out in the morning was quick and as painless as the check-in, I had forgotten about the $34.00 per night valet parking and had spent almost all of our cash.

My husband and I checked in 2 hours early and perhaps we caught the reservation desk between shifts. Instead of being greeted by our \"experience designer\", as cited on the web site as being someone who will go above and beyond to execeed expectation, we were given a key to our room and a half-hearted \"welcome to the Amalfi\". We were not told about the manager's reception or the breakfast on our floor. I had to call the front desk to find out the time and location. The room was fine... small and tidy and suited for a single business person. The bathroom was above average. However upon removal of a towel, the towel bar fell off the wall. It was incorrectly mounted and needed repair. We reported this problem directly to the staff at the front desk. Three and a half hours and a second phone call later, the problem was remedied. The manager's reception on the sixth floor was bizarre. Located in a small conference-type room, about 30 people were not so much mingling as they were being hearded into a single file line headed by a staff member with a large plastic pitcher of \"amalfitinis\" in each hand yelling out \"who wants what\". A large flat screen was showing a football game and a dozen people balanced tacky, frosted martini glasses and plate fulls of supermarket deli meats and stale focaccia on small, dimly lit tables. Awkward and not tasty. I don't blame the manager for not attending his own reception. The bed was reasonably comfortable and the sheets were above average. Upon attempting to close the drapes, we were schocked to find this was not a possibility. There is no way to block out the morning light. Maybe this is a tactic to encourage early check out.

They had a player piano that was playing music, and it gave the ambience of elegance and class to this hotel. As I soon discovered, this ambience does not end there! You do not check in at a traditional \"check-in desk\". Instead, it is more like a concierege. I arrived rather early (12:30pm), and in most hotels they will not let you have a room until 3pm at the earliest. NOT HERE! After giving you your room keys, they ask if you will be needing dinner reservations or show tickets. They then offer the services of the bellman to deliver your bags to your room. I politely declined this, as I only had a small weekend bag with me. I entered the room and was instantly impressed! The room and bathroom were HUGE! There was an Amoir with a 27 inch widescreen television, a Dvd player, and a built in wet-bar! The king size bed with a pillow-top matress, and 500 thread count Egyptian Cotton linens, made me want to sleep all day! It was the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept in! The bathroom was HUGE! It had a beautiful black granite countertop, with a fogless, lighted makeup mirror, a tub/shower with dual shower heads, and the type of shower curtain that bows out, so it doesn't stick to you! And the maid comes back in the afternoon to offer turndown service, and to freshen up your room. Just another fine example of how immaculate the service is at this hotel! But it still does not end there. Every day between 5:30pm and 7:00pm, they have a complimentary Managers Reception in the lounge up on the 6th floor. In addition to free drinks, they have a wide array of complimentary finger foods: cold cuts, cheeses, breads, stuffed olives, olive oil, etc. This was one of the minor areas that can be improved upon, as the lounge is quite small, and only open for the duration of the reception. It would be nice if it were open later, even if they charged for drinks after 7pm. Most of us were just starting to enjoy ourselves, when we had to leave. And in the morning, they offer a very nice continental breakfast on every floor next to the elevators. They offer a wide variety of pastries, breads, fresh fruit, juices and coffee. It would also be nice if they also offered milk and cereal, but this too, is a very minor area which can be improved upon. The location is perfect as well.

Plenty of great restaurants around. Try Giordano's pizza and for a quick lunch grab a sandwhich from one of the many Potbelly's around. There is a fun bowling alley across the street by the House of Blues called 10pin. It is a swanky matini bowling alley. Also, if you have a chance, check out Bobby's bike and hike. There are a couple of three hour bike tours available and it is the perfect way to orient yourself with the city and see about seven miles worth without wearing out your feet. Keefer's is excellent as well as the lunch version of Keefer's cafe (which is right outside the door of the hotel). Two hour waits are common at Harry Carry's so we just stopped by for a drink one afternoon. The Redfish is a little overrated (they are owned by Friday's so what do you expect). Take the el to a Cub's game or go check out some of the young and trandy neighborhoods like Buckstown. I guess the best thing about the hotel is the location, not in the middle of the Magnificent Mile madness but gets you close enough to everything.

The Amalfitinis and the small but well-chosen antipasto bar were exactly what we needed after a long day to gear up for a night on the town and a late dinner.

The central location meant we could easily walk to shopping on State Street and Michigan Avenue, as well as restaurants in the River North area. We also walked to the Field Museum and Millennium Park. More ambitious, but still do-able. Cabs were everywhere, and bus stops just a short walk. Staff was adequate. Check in and check out went smoothly and quickly. However, when we asked about suggested restaurants, we were told 'anywhere!\". Hmm, not exactly helpful. On our own, we discovered nearby restaurant we enjoyed--Harry Carays (better than expected, and the chopped salad delicious), Frontera Grill, Brazzaz (new Brazilian place, where even a vegetarian could have a fabulous meal from their 'salad' bar), Smith & Wollensky (old-school steak house). The small annoyance of no local daily paper was more than offset by the free in-room wi-fi. We brought our laptop and read our news and planned our day online each day.

The hotel is in a great location - easy walking distance from the State/Lake \"L\" station where we rode in from Midway, the Grand station from which we rode to Wrigley Field, and several restaurants (Morton's and Coco Pazzo were the two we tried). Our \"Experience Designer,\" Juan, was absolutely terrific - when we arrived we told him that we'd love to see a Second City show and get tickets to the Bulls playoff game if at all possible, and by the time we got back from a walk in Millennium Park he had taken care of both for us! He was also very helpful with transportation recommendations and dinner suggestions. Everyone we encountered at the hotel was super friendly. Our room offered a nice view of the Marina Towers across the street, and the bed and bathroom exceeded my expectations. The Aveda bath products and dual shower head were a nice touch! The complimentary continental breakfast on every floor was a nice feature, and the food was better than most continental breakfasts I've had at other hotels.

No doubt an unlimited budget obtains luxuries not available at this hotel.

But Amalfii is not utilitarian by any means. If you're looking for a generously-sized, nicely furnished room and gracious low-key service while you're doing other things in the city, the Amalfi is truly great. My wife and I found it was close to everything. We left the car parked, except for one excursion so we could have saved money w/o the valet service. We were advised at check-in that self-park was available ($22) but without in-out privileges. We did receive assurances about security for the extra $13/day but you need to allow about 15 minutes for retrieval.

We we had our two little dogs with us, and the staff even made them feel special. They even gave us little bottles of doggie bubble bath for them when we checked in. We had three, long hard (but very successful!) days at the show, and the warmth of our room was very relaxing. We got back to our room too late to take advantage of the cocktail reception, but we will be staying again in July (just for fun!), so we hope to try it then. The warm colors of the rooms and deep, soft carpeting were very comforting after a long, hard day showing dogs at McCormick place. The rooms are very sound proof (within the hotel) which meant our dogs weren't hearing all kinds of noises. This helped them (and us) settle down and relax for the next day. Being in River North made it easy for us to find a place to eat dinner...even when we didn't get out until nearly 11 p.m. one night. Try Vong (VTK) one block north. It's very stylish, French/Thai. A nice place to relax. Mambo Grill, two blocks away, features Latin American cuisine. It also was very good and hip. If you are traveling avec chiens in summer, Brasserie Jo (country French/Alsatian cuisine) will let you dine with your dog at their sidewalk tables. They even serve complimentary steak tartar to the canine clientele. It's very popular treat for area dog lovers and you will likely see all shapes and sizes of dogs dining with gusto, some being delivered to the restaurant in limousines. I have only two minor complaints regarding the hotel. First, (and this is mostly my fault) I forgot to take the privacy sign off the door when we left. I asked one of the desk people to please tell housekeeping I had made this mistake. Unfortunately, the request wasn't communicated and we came back after a long, hard day to a dirty room. I mentioned this to the front desk and they soon sent someone up to empty our trash cans and freshen our towels. I guess the attention to detail and, as one reviewer mentioned, the concierge, are the only things that may be a hair overstated in the hotel promotions. The other small complaint is that on a late Fri. night, the streets around the hotel can still be very noisy...one downside of being in a hot nightlife location. I woke up a couple of times from car alarms, loud voices, etc. on the street. But I have to say I was restless and overly tired, so I may have been oversensitive at that point. The next night, I slept fine. Before I sign off, I have to mention the Aveda toiletries and thick, soft towels. They were a very appreciated respite after a tiring day. I really get the impression that this hotel is trying do do things a little bit nicer than the average chain hotel. There are a lot of reasons to try it, or to return again.", "Date": "March 9, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cStrong candidate for a solid night's sleep, but not really a hotel\u201d", "Author": "cwpnewpaltz", "ReviewID": "UR3260992", "Content": "This hotel is a very mixed bag, wildly over-rated by most reviewers, but still offering some real positives for the consideration of a traveler to Chicago. It's on the fringe of River North, just opposite Harry Caray's and a block and a half from the W River North (the former Nikko). Consequently, it's within walking distance of Oak Street's fancy shops to the North and the Buckingham Fountain and everything in between to the south. A stroll to the Shedd Aquarium on a nice day is well within reason. And there's a multi-line subway/L stop three blocks away at Clark/Lake. Positioning is thus great, although anyone who stays here should also understand it's down below Michigan Avenue, an area known for bars, adult book stores and so on, just like the hotels south of Geary (Hilton, Nikko) in San Francisco. It's not a big deal, but it's there. The rooms are of decent size and have the best beds and pillows you'll likely ever encounter. Fabrics are new and attractive. Sheets aren't bad at all. There's a real closet, deep enough to hang your clothes and your carry on bag, but not a week's worth of wardrobe. TV is enormous, clear, and has many interactive amenities. Air conditioning is highly responsive and quiet. It's a great night's sleep. The big negative about the room is the bathroom. Perhaps I'm one of the few people in America who cares about baths, but I don't think so. I didn't know they still made 9\" deep bathtubs, but the Amalfi has managed to find a whole warehouse full. I find travel tiring and take a bath every night out of town, and I object to a bathtub so short and shallow that I can't cover both my knees and my private parts with water simultaneously. The bathroom is also dark, with little light, and the same might be said of the room as a whole, but it's more of a departure from the norm in the bathroom. I found the breakfast and the cocktail hour, both free, to be a plus. Didn't like the lobby, which is so basic that it makes the hotel seem even less fancy than the above review would suggest. Where I came out is that the price is good, and if travelling alone (which I was) and intent on some sightseeing, it's a fine choice, but I'd rather not bring my wife.", "Date": "March 9, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Swansea, IL", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely loved it!!!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3223184", "Content": "What an experience.
