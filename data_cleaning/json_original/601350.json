Two stops from Espanya and from there you can easily change to most other lines. Had a slight struggle finding it, keep Ikea on your right, cross over at the round about, it will be the second on the left, a main street called Botanica which is well sign posted, Keep walking left and you will see it. To get to metro walk back down and keep Ikea on your left! Room was spacious and clean, staff were pleasant enough, bar one snappy female receptionist. Most speak good English. We didn't eat in the area, however we did see all the eating areas in Gran Via 2 which have been mentioned in previous posts which all looked nice. We bought an unlimited 4 day travel pass (can use it on metro, bus train etc etc) which was 27 euros, we felt a bit ripped off as we were trying to buy another ticket, however we did take full advantage of it and at the end it was a pretty good deal. I'm a bit wary of buses so we took the metro and train back out to the airport, was easy and quick to do - check the time table for the train, they aren't as frequent as the metro. I would return again, but on for the same price (30 euros a night) Anymore and i would try and find something more central. Older guests, or those with an injury/disability may want to avoid this as there is some walking involved, and we were less likely to return during the day for a rest due to it location.

A mattress as thick as a napkin! It was rock hard. Service was pleasant and helpful. I guess the biggest problem was that we were there for Mobile World Congress so we paid 350 euro for two nights, totally sickening, and for that price you feel mugged off!

Other travellers were right about the breakfasts there, we didnt bother at 7.50 it was pricey, we found the local coffee shops with their delicious pastries were far cheaper, we paid less than 5 euros for both of us for lovely coffee and pastries. Despite previous visitors saying it is very expensive we didnt think and found a lovely tapas bar just off the La Ramblas which was about 25 euros including drinks, we also found an all you can eat buffet place at the top of La Ramblas which was only 9.50 a head including a drink, this was excellent value for money and we were stuffed! We went on a 30min boat trip around the harbour, well worth it, it was lovely, that was only 6.50 so again reasonably priced. The hotel itself we have to say was very clean and tidy, most of the staff we found were pleasant and helpful, it was only one male member of staff who just ignored us!

We arrived at Barcelona airport and jumped in an airport taxi only to find out that the Taxi driver didn't know where the hotel was. I had Google Maps Navigation on my phone and used it to direct the driver. However, on arrival at the address there was no hotel. We had to phone the hotel and the receptionist directed the driver further down the road to where the hotel was (it is near a BP garage behind the FIRA exhibition centre). The hotel is a standard Travelodge (if you are familiar with them from the UK) fairly basic but generally clean and cheap and everything was as expected there. We'd even phoned ahead to see if they had cots for babies and they said they only had 2 but would put one in the room for us - which they did without further prompting. The main area of the ground floor is taken up with tables mainly used for breakfast and not the sort you'd want to sit and relax in so consequently there were never many people in the lobby area. This contributed to the hotel having an empty feel, which was compounded by the fact that the bar closed relatively early each night. The family room we had was large and big enough for the double bed, sofa bed, and a babies travel cot. It was air conditioned and a welcome relief from the heat of the day (and night). The main downside of this hotel is it's location. It's situated between the airport and the main city area in an industrial part of town near the docks. It is also away from the main bus routes. It is surrounded by the large FIRA exhibition centre to the front and industrial units on other sides which mean the general area is pretty empty of people outside of work hours and at the weekends. We walked with the kids to a Carrefour and large shopping centre \"Gran Via 2\" the other side of the exhibition centre which had plenty of bars and restaurants. However, the walk back was pretty scary at night in the dark as there was no-one around. One night we started to be followed by two homeless people so my wife and kids ran ahead while I kept back to discourage any attempt to mug us! After that we started to use the buses a lot. There are bus stops near the hotel though to get into the centre of Barcelona you need to change near Gran Via and that can be costly. We managed to get tickets with 10 trips on them as it was cheaper than paying each trip. Be careful however, as the buses back to the hotel stop around 10pm and one night we missed the last bus. Rather than walk back (after previous experiences) we jumped in a taxi and got back safely. However the taxi driver advised that the hotel was in an area renowned for drugs and homeless people. Of course Barcelona itself was fantastic and the kids enjoyed seeing all the sights. However, on balance I don't think we'll be using this hotel again.", "Date": "October 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bursa, Turkey", "Title": "\u201cstay at the downtown\u201d", "Author": "ugurkoksal", "ReviewID": "UR116858469", "Content": "cheap hotel but far from downtown. first you must walk 15 min to train station , get the train for 2 station, then change for metro. poor breakfast slipshod rooms. try to find another hotel nearest downtown.", "Date": "August 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cclean and nice but in the middle of nowhere!\u201d", "Author": "londonColly", "ReviewID": "UR116766907", "Content": "Just came back from Barcelona after spending 4 nights at the Travelodge hotel.

How wrong we were! The Hotel is hard to find, located in a deserted industrial estate opposite what appears to be a long abandoned shopping centre or similar. I didnt feel safe at night and there was nothing around really in the way of amenities, restaurants etc. Its mainly a residential area, there was a distinct stench of drains in the whole area.It is well served by public transport but the info given by the hotel about where to get the bus or metro and which services was practically non existent, we were given a map which did not show the location of the hotel and told to navigate using a photocopies badly drawn plan. he hotel has the bog standard travelodge fixtures and fittings, TV etc. It advertises 'air conditioning' yet we were unable to control the temperature which rose and rose. The staff were typically unsympathetic and we had to telephone reception 10 times between 9pm and 2am while being told \"is good temperature, there is no problem yes?\" and we said no repeatedly... eventually we persuaded someone to visit our room and he admitted yes, there was no way the temperature was the advertised 21C. Unfortunately by this point my son who has autistic spectrum disorder( part of our reason for choosing travelodge, due to the familiarity of the room styles) was sobbing, rocking, had stripped to his underwear and was desperately trying to stay cool. We were relocated to another room but were all exhausted and were very very glad indeed when it was time to check out. The staff came and complained we had not vacated our room by 10am, I pointed out that we had no slept the night before and that the check out time was in fact 12pm. They seemed unsympathetic and said \"you need to leave\" I would not recommend anyone stay at this hotel", "Date": "September 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Liverpool, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood price, poor service\u201d", "Author": "Bubers", "ReviewID": "UR76621763", "Content": "The front desk was not very pleasant not to say rude.

The directions and map on the website were not completely accurate, NobbyClarke63 in his review gives a good description of the location and also how to travel around Barcelona from the hotel. We paid 20 Euro per room per night so was a much cheaper option for staying in the more well known parts of Barcelona, however if you just turn up the rack room rate is 110 Euro a night (not sure if its worth this much!). Breakfast was an additional extra but we found it cheaper to visit the Ikea for breakfast, a Mediterranean breakfast which consisted of a crusty bread roll, olive oil, tomato, ham and a coffee cost only 1 Euro - bargain!!!

The hotel is standard travelodge, the location poor but the ease of travel using the metro and T10 tickets makes everything relatively easy to do, just be ready to stay out all day and evening until you're ready to return for bed. If coming in rrom Barcelona airport jump on a 46 bus and get off at Ikea, look for it or the tall red cylindrical Porto Fira hotel that Paul Merton stayed at. Barcelona is expensive to visit, high admission charges for nearly everything of interest except the parks and Las Ramblas. Note that the Wold Heritage site the Hospital Sant Pau is currently closed for refurbishment or like me you will have a hot wasted journey to find it. One word of warning - PICKPOCKETS - in 6 days we had 3 attempts made on us, twice on the tube, blocking the entrance to the train and pushing up behind and once in the park 'collecting for charity' and using a clipboard to hie one hand underneath. Fortunately thanks to all the posters on tripadvisor we were prepared, all was safely secreted away and nothing was taken. THANK YOU everyone on here it saved our holiday. We had trouble getting good food at a sensible price even away from the main areas. We did find a restaurant / cafe on Las Ramblas near the Liceu metro station called Bello Italy, one day we had paella another we had paste both extremly good, cooked fresh not reheated from frozen as pealla is in a lot of places with a good portion of fish and shellfish in it at a sensible price. I know it's Italian, owned by a spaniard, staffed by other nationalities looks small on the outside but has a big first floor. They work on the principle of good simple food, friendly service, sensibly priced and not fleecing the tourists, how I wish for a few more places like that the world over! On a final point which hasn't been covered elsewhere on the nights of 18th and 19th June this year the were 2 council approved allnight raves opposite the hotel and nobody got any sleep. I don't know what the dates are for 2011 but if anyone is looking to go this time of year they better check before booking as a holiday without sleep is not much fun.

We are a family of 5 (kids aged 13,11 and 4) and booked 2 rooms at 20 Euros each room for 3 nights. It's no frills, but if you are on a budget and just need a place to sleep, its perfect. We were out all day, so it suited us. LOCATION: It's not the best and not that inconvenient. It also feels safe at night. There is a main road called Avinguada de la Gran Via, this is where the Europa Fira station is located aswell as bus stops and a shopping centre called Gran Via 2 . There are shops, coffee shops, eateries and a good supermarket (carrefor) on the bottom floor. There is also an IKEA which is good for a breakfast. All located near to each other on this main road. Placa Espanya - we spent a couple of hours in Placa Espanya one evening its worth a look around, the first thing you will say when appearing out of the station is\" WOW\", the architecture is fantastic. We then walked it back to the hotel which took about half an hour. DIRECTIONS: If you are arriving at Girona airport with Ryanair and take the Barcelona bus in to the centre then leave the bus station near bus bay one and you will see the Metro station sign. This is ARC DE TRIOMF metro station, take metro RED LINE 1 for PLACA ESPANYA and then the FGC train to EUROPA FIRA station. Leave the station towards the right exit, once you appear at road level take the road ahead of you keeping the tall red building (Hotel Porta Fira) to your right, walk down this road and straight on at the roundabout you will also keep the big Porcelanosa building to your right. Carry on down the road then take your next left and after a few minutes the travelodge is on your right.

GETTING AROUND: We bought a T10 ticket from the machines at the Metro station for Euros 7.85. This will give 10 journeys anywhere in the city and it can be passed on to each other. An example of how it can be used is we travelled on the train then a metro and then a bus and it all classed as 1 journey with a total journey time of 1 hour and 15 minutes and we passed it on to each other. So we used 5 journeys there and 5 journeys back. Not bad we travelled around Barcelona for 7.85. It can be used over the period of your stay. So yes Travelodge is Ok. Ignore the negative feedback.

My partner and I are both in our mid 30s and the purpose of our visit to Barcelona was sightseeing on a budget. So rather than stay in a hostel with a central location and the possibility of being in a shared room we opted for the Travelodge and its \u201cout of town\u201d location for 35 Euros a night. Getting there....the bus only costs 1,40EUR each!!! When you clear arrivals at the airport leave the building and turn right, you\u2019ll see a bus stop 50 yards ahead. Catch the number 46 and tell the driver you want to go to Ikea. It takes around 15 minutes and from memory is the 4th stop after you leave the airport. You\u2019ll see it coming though as it\u2019s big and blue like the ones we have over here. I\u2019ve uploaded an aerial picture with the route you need to take once you\u2019re off the bus, it\u2019s about a 10 minute walk with luggage. To get back to the airport, the same bus takes you from a stop exactly opposite. The Hotel & Room.... clean and comfy Check-in was quick and friendly and all the staff spoke good English. The hotel must have been fairly quiet as they gave us a family room which was huge with a double bed, large sofabed, big wardrobe, desk with chair and large bathroom with a great power shower. We had maid service every day where they changed the bedding and towels and cleaned the floors and bathroom. Previous reviews have stated that there is noise from the 24 hour garage next to the hotel, we can confirm that the garage is no longer open at night and we didn\u2019t have any issues with noise. We had a TV in our room and the only English channel it showed was CNN, which was helpful for keeping up to date on the impending ash cloud. We didn\u2019t pay for the breakfast option at the hotel so we stopped at the Gran Via 2 shopping centre on our way to the metro each day. The centre is full of restaurants, cafes and shops like Zara, H&M, sports shops etc. There\u2019s also a large Carrefour supermarket. Getting into town......The Metro The metro is the easiest way to get around Barcelona as it\u2019s quick and simple to navigate. The nearest station is Europa Fira which is in between Ikea and the Gran Via 2 shopping centre. We bought a T-10 ticket from the machine at the station which gives you 10 journeys on the metro, bus and train for 7,85EUR. It\u2019s also worth knowing that you can change lines as many times as you like within 75 minutes and it only counts as one trip. Once through the barrier take the stairs to your left and wait for the next train. All trains on this line terminate at Placa Espanya so you don\u2019t have to worry about getting on the right train. Once off, you can either exit at Placa Espanya and go to Mont Juic and see the fountains, galleries and Olympic stadium or head for L1 and get on the train to Placa de Catalunya which is right in the centre of town. If you want to go to the marina (Port Vell) then head for L3 and get off at Drassanes. To get back to Europa Fira just use the same lines but the platforms on the opposite side from where you got off earlier. Simple. The whole journey from the hotel to the centre of town takes around 20 minutes; the walk to the metro takes 10 minutes, you only have to wait around 3 minutes for the next train and the journey to Placa Espanya takes 4 minutes. A quick line change and another 3 minute train journey to Placa Catalunya and you\u2019re looking down La Rambla. Conclusion.... The hotel is in a business district and there is some building work going on up near the metro but it has no noise effect on the hotel. There are a lot of other hotels nearby so it\u2019s not deserted after dark as other reviews would suggest. We were getting off the metro at around midnight each night and there were always scores of other people getting off with us and heading off to the various hotels. We never felt unsafe or isolated at anytime we were there. Barcelona is a wonderful city but it does suffer from pickpockets. It only happens in the tourist areas and in the main Metro stations, just be sure to keep you bags zipped and wallets and phones in your front pockets. Beware of anyone asking for directions holding a map, groups of young children with clipboards, someone telling you you\u2019ve got bird poo on your back or just any sort of attention diversion. Remove rucksacks from your back when standing on the main Metro stations and you\u2019ll be fine. We stayed 4 nights at a total cost of \u00a3126GBP, the average price of a hotel around centre of Barcelona is \u00a3100GBP per night, we used 2 T-10 between us at a cost of \u00a312GBP so if you don\u2019t mind a bit of walking and you want more money in your pocket to spend on the rather expensive restaurants and bars of Barcelona then this hotel is a no brainer, we\u2019ll definitely use it the next time we visit.", "Date": "May 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "uk", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Value For Money\u201d", "Author": "Family091", "ReviewID": "UR63185363", "Content": "On our arrival at the Hotel the receptionists was extremely helpful, the hotel is on an industrial estate and we did worry that we may have made a mistake, but am pleased to report we didn't.

We were 6 days in Barcelona before the cruise and 3 days after. The hotel is located about 5 minutes by bus from Plaza Espanya. It is in the \"Fira\" (Fair) area of barcelona. We came to the hotel from the airport and we travelled with the local bus # 46 which leaves you directly in front of the IKEA store. You then have a 7-to 8-minute walk to get to the hotel. When we got there we were very well treated by the staff at the reception desk. Since we had a flight from Canada, we were there earlier than check in time (3 p.m.) and we were given a room almost right away (around 12). There is no guarantee of this, but the hotel staff is very helpful and will go the extra mile to satisfy their customers. We had encountered huge problem with the website (managed in England) which by the way has a extremely bad customer service, but the hotel staff in Barcelona was absolutely great. The hotel is fairly new and the rooms are spacious. (See photos). The hotel is in a quiet area because of its location in an industrial park. At night there is no noise except for the adjoining gas station and normally no noise after 10 or 11 pm. In the morning two types of breakfast are available for a fee: Full buffet or continental. The first floor has the reception area, the breakfast area, an internet station (fee) and a few sofas and chairs. There are also vending machines on prem, plus you can buy hot beverages from the reception. A big shopping mall (Fira Gran Via) is located about 5 to10 minutes walk from the hotel and there you will find many restaurants with a variety of menus for all tastes. The train station is located also about 5 minutes away walking and will take you directly to Plaza Espanya where you can connect to the Metro system. A couple of buses also go by Gran Via (near train station and IKEA) like number 46 and 65 for those who prefer to see the beautiful architecture of Barcelona. These buses will also take you to Plaza Espanya. A bus stops almost in front of the hotel ( number 72) but it does not link to a specific subway station and goes in residential district more than places where tourists have interest to go to. We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel where the staff is friendly, helpful and give the extra mile to make their customers happy. Prices at this hotel when reserved via their website can be as low as 35 Euros or approx. 50 Canadian or US Dollars. Just be aware that the website is very badly set and that, should you have a problem with a reservation (like it happened with some of ours), the customer service in England is absolutely putrid and it takes weeks to get a very small problem settled. Travelodge UK has a lot of work to do in that respect. Also know that when booking many consecutive nights, you have to reserve them one by one to be able to get the best price quoted. It makes very little sense but it follows the pattern mentioned above: \"no customer service\". By the way should the reservation system do a \"time out\" on your reservation before full completion but after giving the credit card number, make sure to check your email (given for confirmation) before going and booking again. You may find yourself with 2 bookings and no-one to help you correct the situation. Travelodge (England) will tell you that their system makes no errors. Travelodge UK doesn't make the effort to have one person settle a discrepancy since you can never have the same agent answer your request and they have the lowest customer service I have ever seen. The staff of the hotel in Barcelona though is absolutely great, the rooms are comfortable and the price is the best value considering the closeness to center and services around.

Also, there was a colour TV in the room that only picked up CNN, again not a problem because we were hardly there and just used the hotel for a shower and to sleep- like all Travelodges really. The hotel is located on a busy main road, next to a BP garage- perfect for getting bottles of water at a cheap price. Opening hours are between 8am-10pm- so no \"busy car wash to keep you awake\" as reported in another review. Before we went we bought a Barcelona Card- which I recommend. The 30euro price tag for 3 days was worth the money, but only if your stay heavily relies on using the metro, train or bus. Ours' did so it made things much easier to get around the city. The metro is clean and friendly- unlike the London tube. As for things to do while you are in the city you really are spoilt for choice- I would advise doing a bus tour- you are taken directly to the attractions and it is very nice to sit and relax and to take the pressure off your very tired feet! Each tour takes 2 and a half hours and you can hop on and off whenever you want to. The tour comopany does not encourage you to do both tours- but we did and saved 25euros. I would recommend the Travelodge to others as it is cheap and clean. It's just like any other in this country and perfect for a mini-break away.", "Date": "November 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place & Fantasic Service\u201d", "Author": "Sealyspeak", "ReviewID": "UR45744410", "Content": "At \u20ac35 a night you could not complain really.

Get a T10 ticket, Zone 1 for \u20ac7.70 and it will last 10 journeys. Your first stop is to Espanya (platform 2, and is the only stop ANY train will go to in this direction as it is the end of the line). Once there, Barcelona is your lobster. The breakfast is fine now and again, you can check it out before you buy anyway. It is very near Gran Via 2 which is a modern shopping place with places to eat and very handy for everything.

My Partner and I attended in the first week of September. After arriving from Barcelona Airport, we caught the Aerobus to Gran Via \u2013 which we thought was the nearby shopping centre \u2013 and then as it turned out we were in the wrong place we got a taxi to the Hotel. Total cost around 20 Euros, so cheaper than getting a Taxi from the Airport and maybe something to be looked into. Make sure you have the address of the Hotel on you if you need a Taxi, our driver didn\u2019t know where to go until I pointed out that there was a BP Garage opposite. We arrived approx 9pm. Check-in takes a couple of minutes, and they asked for our passports as proof of identity. Don\u2019t forget to ask for a Kettle, which they happily supplied although without milk. The room was a typical Travelodge, although spacious as we had booked the Family Room. We had quite a good view looking onto the Olympic Stadium in the distance. However, this has a negative side as you also face onto the BP Garage which has possibly the busiest car wash in Spain on it. Cars were being washed throughout the night, and traffic started to build up from 7am onwards. On the other hand, if your room faced the other way all you would see is the building opposite but it would be quieter, all depends on what you might prefer. The room has Air Conditioning, although we are not sure if ours was working as it was quite hot! We opened the windows the first few nights, but be warned we were bitten a lot. Take precautions with you. Room had a TV with approx 12-15 Spanish TV Channels, we ended up watching CNN American News whenever we wanted the TV on. Room was clean, Bathroom too with Towels and Soap provided. The Hotel is to be used as a base. It needs to be used as somewhere to sleep, and plan your days so that you won\u2019t return back to the Hotel until you won\u2019t want to leave it again that day. It is set in a commercial area, which when walking between the Hotel and the Metro is very deserted. It is a fair walk to either of the Metro Stations (Ildefons Cerda or Europa Fira). We reckoned IIdefons Cerda is the quicker, but Europa Fira is the nicer/easier walk. The Metro is very simple to use, very easy. As mentioned in other reviews, purchase your T-10 tickets from the machine at the metro station and off you go. There is no need to purchase individual tickets for people either, just buy one T-10 at a time and use that until it has run out between you all and get another one. There is advice on the internet about this. Saves you potentially wasting Journeys. If you can, print off a Metro Map before you go as it is much easier that way. For those hiring a car, there is car parking available around the Hotel. You don't need to worry about not having enough spaces. There is the large shopping Centre, Gran Via 2, very close to the IIdefons Cerda Metro Station. This has everything you could need in it. The Carrefour Food Shopping is on the ground floor, and there is a multitude of shops and cafes in there. We had lunch 1 day at the Carrefour Caf\u00e9 which was very reasonably priced and quite good. There is an Ikea close by too which you could use for Breakfast, if you ask reception they can point you in the right direction. Unfortunately, we were not able to sample the Breakfast as when we went it turn out to be a \u201cCatalan Fiesta Day\u201d so it was closes \u2013 as was most of Barcelona. (Just spend 2 minutes checking when these Spanish Bank Holidays are. EVERYTHING except cafes and bars were closed) We checked out early to make our way back to the Airport. We left and travelled to Europa Fira, and from there onto the next station Gornal where we caught the RENFE train from back to the Airport. Very, very simple. At Gornal you do need to leave the station and walk over to the next station but it is all sign posted. If we had known it was so easy, we would have used this service on our arrival to Barcelona. We would definitely use the Hotel again if we visited Barcelona. Unless you travel outside of Barcelona, I think you can see the majority of it in 4/5 days so we won\u2019t visit Barcelona again for quite a few years.

We chose it as you always know what you get with Travelodge and the rooms were \u20ac45 per night. Hotel was fine, as expected, and the staff pleasant. We took the Barcelona bus from Gerona airport (\u20ac21 return for two adults, under 4's are free) and it was a lovely ride into the Estacio Nord (approximately 1 hour 15 minutes). We then took a taxi to the hotel at a cost of \u20ac20. If we went again on our own we would just make the two minute walk to the Arc de Triompf Metro station, where you can catch the L1 line to Placa Espanya (we did this on the way back to the station, although there are quite a lot of steps in the Arc de Triompf station) The hotel, I would say was situated in a commercial area, rather than industrial, as the area around the hotel towards the Gran Via 2 shopping complex was well designed, and our daughter loved running along all of the walls and stone benches. We didn't arrive at the hotel until after 8pm, so were looking for somewhere close to eat. If you turn left out of the hotel, then right at the first roundabout you come to and follow that road round (past the aforementioned walls and benches) alongside the Gran Via exhibition centre, you will see the Gran Via 2 shopping centre and cinema on your right (no more than a 10 minute walk for an adult (kids can, and do make it longer!). At the Gran Via 2 there are plenty of restaurants, a kids fair, a delicious ice cream shop, cinema and the shopping mall. If you turn right out of the hotel, and cross over the road, turn left up the first road you come to (which takes you under a strange tunnel like structure connecting two buidlings) and carry on walking, you will pass the Gran Via 2 on your left hand side. Carry on up past this and you will arrive at the main road (very easy to cross). Cross over this and you are at the Ildefons Cerda metro station on the L8 line (you can take the lift down to the station). We did this walk a number of times, with a pushchair and it took no more than 15 minutes (but then who's in a rush when you're away from home?) The Metro is brilliant and we never waited for more than 3.5 minutes for any train. Buy a T-10 ticket at the ticket machines (easy to use and with English translation). You can use the ticket between you (rather than having to buy one each), just place it in the ticket barriers, collect it, and proceed through (if more than one of you just put it back through each time). From this station you will need to go two stops to Place Espanya, from where the rest of Barcelona is your oyster. My tips on where to go would be: 1. Park Guell - quite an experience to walk up to this park (especially the escaltors in the street). We managed it with a pushchair, which was hard work, but the views from the top of the Tower of the Three Crosses are absolutely breathtaking and made it all worth the effort. You can then walk down to the Gaudi Museum and sit on the worlds longest bench. 2. Sagrada Familia - the icon landmark of Barcelona, and one of the strangest buildings you will ever see. You can pay \u20ac11 to walk to the top of one of the towers, but you get better views from Park Guell, and you can see the Sagrada Familia well enough from outside 3. Magic Fountains - this is on Thu to Sun (in the summer) every half hour from 9 pm to 11pm in Montjuic Park. It is basically a giant fountain which dances with music and lights. It gets very busy, so try and get there early (we arrived at 8:30 and got a got spot) to enjoy the spectacular. 4. Montjuic Castle - You can catch the funicular from the Par-llel stop on the L3 line, up to the cable car which takes you up to the castle (\u20ac16 per adult, but worth it). Again the views are spectacular, but from the complete opposite side of Barcelona from Park Guell. 5. Barcelona beach and harbour - We spent half a day round here (mainly to keep our daughter happy) but the beaches are beautiful (try and take your own towels rather than hiring a sunbed, as they wanted to charge us \u20ac15 for 2 beds and an umbrella at 2 in the afternoon). The harbour is picturesque, and there is some fantastic architecture all around. Overall, we all had a brilliant time, and the hotel was a convenient base. We will definately be coming back to Barcelona, and would probably stay here again.", "Date": "August 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cIsolated - but a comfortable stay\u201d", "Author": "babyjenz", "ReviewID": "UR37468645", "Content": "I got this hotel as part of a holiday package deal and though it's rather isolated in more of an industrial part of the city, the hotel itself is a great place to stay.

It's about a 15 minute walk to the nearest bus stop (if you're coming from the airport) and the tube station, and about a 5-10 minute walk to Gran Via, a shopping complex with great food options and even a cinema.

However, on the evening before the last full day of my visit I noticed a bus going up and down C/Botanica and asked the receptionist about it. The bus is the 72 and you can get to the Place Espanya as follows, without the longish walk (it rained all three days I was there): Walk out of the hotel and go past the BP garage next door, cross over the side road next to the BP Garage and the bus stop is right in front of you, less than 1 minute from the hotel and on the same road. Catch the 72 and go for four stops. Get off at a stop on the liong road Pg de la Zona France. At the same stop you get off at, you can then catch either a 109, 37 or 9 bus. They are very frequent. Any of these buses will take you to the Place Espana where you are well placed to catch the metro or get on the Bus Turistic to anywhere in the centre of Barcelona. The whole journey, including any ongoing travel on the metro, will be considered as one trip with your T10 ticket (7 Euros 70 for 10 complete journeys). To go back to the hotel, just cross the road on Place Espanya from where you got off the bus and catch the 109, 37 or 9 back to one of the stops on the Pg de la Zona Franca and then get the 72 which will stop right opposite the Travelodge. It was much easier than I thought it was going to be. You can pick up the 72 at all the stops along the Pg de la Zona Franca. Just look at the top of the bus stops and you will see the number on there. The only thing to watch out for, when you are in the Place Espanya, don't get mislead by the L72, that is a completely different service. Stick to getting the 108, 37 or 9. I hope this information is helpful. A busmap from any of the information centres is quite useful.

From Girona airport there is a bus terminal outside where you can get a bus to the Estacio Nord in Barcelona for 21 Euros return. Getting to the travelodge is a bit trickier! It is around a 35-45 minute journey from the Estacio Nord and around 30-40 minutes from the Playa de Catalunya (Main central part). Outside the Estacio Nord catch a metro (Line 1 RED) from Arc De Triomf (Outside the bus station) to Playa de Catalunya, only two stops away. At the Playa de Catalunya (extremely busy!) cross the road to find a few busstops. We caught the L95 (you can also get the L94) bus. All travel (Metro, Bus, Train) is 1 Euro 35 for each trip. We then took the L95 outside of the central part of the city (past Playa Espanya) to Gran Via. unfortunately the roads fall outside of normal maps! However there are several other ways of getting to the hotel from the centre, but this was the easiest and also offered a better view than the train! You then leave the bus opposite Gran Via 2 Shopping Centre, it has huge blue neon letters and is around 10 minutes away- depending on traffic! There are lots of buildings and its mostly industrial. Ok so getting off the bus the best thing to do is cross the main road (so you are outside the Gran Via 2 shopping centre) and then walk down a diagonal road (2 tall office block buildings on the right) and you should find yourself outside a huge exhibition centre that is white. Hopefully this makes some sense! Walk around this building to the left and you will pass the Hotel Prestige Congress on the right. Turn left and the Travelodge is on the other side of the road! It was a bit confusing to find, but you are honestly no more than 10 minutes walk from the busstop! Places to eat are few and far between at the travelodge, however at the Gran Via 2 shopping centre, outside there is a Chinese restaurant, Burger Restaurant and a few Tapas restaurants that are reasonable to eat at. (Baskonia-Orange and Brown is wuite good). Getting into town is easy, take a bus from the busstop outside the Gran Via 2 and you can get off at Playa de Catalunya. Best things to spend your money on:- Olympic Stadium is worth seeing as its free and the museum was only 4 Euros. Sagrada Familia costs 11 Euros to get in (Adult) however what they don't teel you is that you have to queue for the lift to take you up (60 mins!) and costs an extra 2.50! Menu del dia is the way forward as you can get a lot for your money. There is a beautiful restaurant called TallerdeTapas hidden away in the Gothic quarter- walk down the Ramblas towards the sea, halfway down is a Mcdonalds and KFC. Turn left there and walk down some alleyways around there and explore that area, right next to a church is this great Tapas place. Me and my boyfriend ended up spending a lot of money on things we didn't need to. sit inside for drinks, there is a massive premium for sitting outside! Drinks on top of the menu del dia hike up the prices (3 Euros for a can of coke in 1 place!) Look around don't head into the first place you see, it's worth it! Check out the Olympic Port and the Parc Guell if it's good weather as its free. We tended to stay out all day so don't worry about getting up really early as you will just exhaust yourself- we left around 10.30am each day and by the time you have donw everything in one day you will be tired! The Spaniards also tend to leave things late, so by waking up later on we didn't need a breakfast (thought the travelodge does have this at a cost of 7 Euros) and then have menu del dia for Lunch (2-4pm) and then have a late dinner. If you are heading out for dinner at 6pm everywhere will be dead and there will be a lack of atmosphere! Get a t-10 travel card at any of the metro machines as this only costs 7 Euros 70 and will save you on journeys. The marketplace off the Ramblas if really good to walk around, however bee vigilant as it gets crowded and we all know what can happen if we aren't watching our bags!

I would not recommend this hotel for famillees with children unless you have a car as there is nothing at the hotel and nowhere that close to walk at night for dinner etc.", "Date": "January 17, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Travelodge L'Hospitalet", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d601350-Reviews-Travelodge_L_Hospitalet-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "$70 - $125*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">C/ Botanica 25</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">08908</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Barcelona</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "601350", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/e8/36/e836c348bbf406bf654f4875fea977137large.jpg"}}
