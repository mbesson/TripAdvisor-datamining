The room is a bit smaller than some hotels we've stayed in but the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom had everything we needed plus there's lots of storage for clothes, toiletries, etc. The hotel is close to shopping, restaurants (Queue de Cheval next door is a must), metro, etc. Parking your car is pricey but I'm sure all hotels are like that. I'm sure you can park your car in a lot but why bother when there's valet service at the Sheraton. We signed up for the Starwood Preferred Guest program and we occassionally get emails hotel discounts.

Generally we order room service, but the menu seemed over-priced, so we refrained. There was complimentary Starbucks coffee and tea that you could make. Decent channels on the TV, but not all of them clear. They have free internet via ethernet cable, bummer, I only had wifi devices, it costs about $14-15 for 24hrs of wifi.

Directly across from the Bell Centre, close to the vibrant night scene and 3 blocks from the central VIA train station. Great soundproofing between rooms, never heard anything from inside the adjoining rooms (which was full as evidenced by the newspapers outside each door). Quiet heating unit. Decadent lobby and chic restaurant. Smooth check-in, though very busy. Efficient elevators and ice machine. Large bathroom, quality toiletries, tons of counter space. Plush towels. Ergonomic showerhead installed for someone 5'4\" of shorter, but relaxing with three different firing settings. Slightly less water pressure than other SPG properties, no doubt for water conservation efforts. Cons: Rooms could use a mini-fridge. Soundproofing around entry door is poor. Expect to hear every door slam or hallway conversation, and due to the square design, many doors are clustered together in each corner.

It was a corner room with window facing west and south, with nice views of downtown Montreal (Bell Centre, etc.). The bed was incredibly comfortable. Although everything is a short-walk away in this area of downtown Montreal, the one downside is that the hotel is not connected to the underground city / metro (unlike Hilton, Fairmont and Marriott downtown, which all have direct access to the underground city and the metro). That being said, there's plenty of nice restaurants in the vicinity, more affordable places on Stanley street (adjacent), shopping on St. Catherine street is 1 block away and the nearest metro is 1 block south of the hotel.

We got a good deal for the room and spent under $150 per night for a deluxe king room. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and I would stay at this hotel again if the price was right once again. Here is some information I would have liked to have known before going. 1. The hotel is a little hard to spot from a distance just because of the way it is designed and where the signage is. We drove right past it - luckily circling around the block is simple enough. The location was great for our plans. We were about a $10 cab ride from many clubs and bars, about 2 blocks from the shopping on St. Catherine street, a couple blocks from the bell centre and less than a 10 min drive to Old-Montreal. 2. There is heated underground parking below the hotel for $24/24 hours. This does include a full 24 hour period, as we remained parked there during the day after checking out while we did some shopping. I'm sure there is cheaper parking around, but for the convenience and security, this worked. Only thing i didn't appreciate was that they charged my credit card automatically for the parking without confirming with me first. 3. Our room was quite spacious, very clean and comfortable. There was a sitting area with pull out sofa by the window which i thought was nice to have. Large flat screen TV. Lots of pillows and linens. The bed was a touch uncomfortable, but i think we are spoiled with our mattress at home. There was no mini-fridge in the room, not the end of the world but it is something i like to have when traveling. We were on the 32nd floor and the view was fantastic, especially at night. Bathroom was nice, though the lighting is a little dark. And one thing i found strange - they give you only one robe in the room....two seems more logical, but oh well. There is free internet in the lobby area, but it is $15/24 hours to get internet in the room. We were half of an adjoining room and I have to say, the noise can be bad. We were unfortunately next to a crying baby, which made sleeping in somewhat of a challenge. If you're next to quiet people though, i guess you're good to go. 4. There is a cafe in the hotel open for breakfast and lunch only, and a bar/lounge which is open until 1 am. We didnt go to either of these so I cannot comment on them, but they seemed to be mostly empty. We also didn't use the pool/fitness facilities, but they are open until 10 pm. There was quite an extensive roomservice menu (again, we didn't try it) that was rather expensive, but what room service isn't?

Cons: 1 AC/heater unit is a HUGE problem: * First off it has very bad noise, the kind of high frequency noise that made my heart beat rate to rise during sleep. Very disturbing. Couldn't sleep if not because I was so tired. * Secondly it's impossible to adjust to the right temperature. There's no control for temperature, just heat level.

If you set it just a bit lower, at first you feel it's blowing a proper and warm air flow but after some time it is going to blow COLD air. If you adjust it higher again it's gonna get very hot again then you need to adjust it down again. Then it becomes very cold in the room again.

I have nothing but good things to say about the staff from housekeeping, concierge, bar, doormen, etc. I didn't use the gym or spa, but did find some nice commemorative trinkets in the gift store downstairs. The only minor issue is the check-in desk. It was a weird set-up of 3 kiosk-like counters with no direction of who was checking in who. My group happened to be behind a large group of people who at any given time were both checking in as a group and individually.

Some staff shine but nickel-and-dime complaints are valid.\u201d", "Author": "Braindrain", "ReviewID": "UR119077286", "Content": "I recently stayed twice over a 2 week period. I am a SPG Plat and hadn't been back in about 6 years. Location The hotel is well located. It's close to Bell Centre and the main train station. It's in the nicer end of St Catherine's and many high-end boutiques are close by. As mentioned in my title, it seems to be a very large convention hotel and has to deal with hordes of people coming through every day. Check-in and Rooms When I first checked-in, I was extremely early and my room wasn't early. The front desk mentioned that the Concierge could store my bags for me \"without charge\". I had no idea what he was talking about as I am normally never charged to store bags. Well, when I did go to the Concierge, he mentioned it'd be $3/bag so I better cough up $9. It was only after I mentioned I was checking-in that the Concierge conceded there would be no charge. Extremely bizarre. Maybe it's because nobody tips them? Even I were to tip him, the tip instantly vanished after that exchange. It's worth mentioning that the front desk people were extremely courteous. It's the Concierge I have a beef with. For my 1st stay, I received an extremely large suite made of 2 normal rooms. One room was used for the living room area while the other room was the bedroom. There was ample space everywhere and it seems the rooms had undergone a recent renovation. Unfortunately, the HVAC system seems to still be the style attached to the window and not central. My beef with this is that some units are quiet while others are extremely noisy. Luckily, mine wasn't too noisy. The bed was comfy as I expect for a Westin and my internet was comped as I was a Plat. For my 2nd stay, I received a regular room. Again, it seemed to be recently renovated. No, it wasn't a suite but since I was travelling solo on a biz trip, I really didn't need all that extra room. Again, the HVAC system was external. Club lounge As part of the Plat bennies, I was allowed to use the Club Lounge. Upon entering, I was greeted by \"G\". G was extremely courteous and explained the lounge - since I mentioned I hadn't been back for about 6 years. The evening hors d'oeurves were decent - comprising of high quality cheeses, meats, and smoked salmon. While I don't want to get into details, let's say G was extremely accommodating if you $how how to treat him right. Strangely enough, for both stays, the Club Lounge was booked for private functions in the morning. The result? I was given a coupon for any full breakfast in the normal ground floor resto. Well, I certainly can't complain about that! The food in the resto was fine but service a bit slow. Final thoughts Would I stay again? Definitely. Would I recommend a colleague to stay here. Yes, but I'd warn him about the ridiculous Concierge fees. And, from the other reviews, it sounds like some other charges seem pretty unreasonable too. Tips There are a ton of great restos in Montreal. Don't stay in the hotel to eat. However, from my experience, stay away from the ethnic restos as I generally found them to be below-par.", "Date": "October 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton", "Title": "\u201cNickles and dimes\u201d", "Author": "Wade C", "ReviewID": "UR119048270", "Content": "I loved this hotel, except that, for the amount they charge for a room, there should be at least a bit of a break on parking!

Breakfast in the Club Lounge (for \"members\" with many Sheraton stays) was decent and included Montreal bagels and a 180 degree view of the city. Montreal is a great walking/biking city, and for those who love to walk/bike, this hotel was in a great central location.

However the people who worked there for the most part have an attitude. The concierge did not give the best advice when it came to finding a restaurant so do your research first instead of relying on them. We purchased a deal where we got breakfast each morning in the club lounge (usually only available for sheraton members) but they never had our name on the list and we had to get it straigtened out (even though we paid extra for this...it wasnt free breakfast by any means!). The hotel is NOT that close to Old montreal as they might claim. It's a good 1/2 hour walk each way. Not that the location is the worse...but if you want to stay closer to Old Montreal you need to stay one of the boutique hotels. My advice (which the concierge didnt tell us) is purchase the double deck tour (can do so from the tourism center which is actually around the block from the hotel) and this is a hop on and off tour all day. If you do that in the morning its plenty of time and a little less walking. I dont mind walking but when you have done it all day it's exhausting. Being that this is a VERY expensive city, you try and avoid cabs! Lastly, we did room service the last night for dinner because it was so late and we were so tired. The room service costs are SO overpriced. And they also charge you for a delivery charge! We orded two kids meals and two salads and its came to 60 canadian dollars! Originally they overcharged us and i called which they straightened out. Then I still felt it was high so i complained. The manager came out and was telling me i had all these things that i didnt. She then realized she pulled the wrong bill and didnt even apologize. I think it really reflects badly on sheraton!

Check-in was very efficient. The hotel was decently located in downtown Montreal -- but I find that Montreal is spread very far so unless you plan on just hitting the main shopping street (Rue Sainte-Catherine) you will need access to a car, or use the subway system or taxis. Parking was $24 for a 24-hr period with unlimited in-and-out priviledges and is added to your hotel bill at the end of your stay. Parking was a bit disorganized -- the first time we left the hotel we waited at the exit for about 15 minutes as it seemed they did not have an updated list of guests at the hotel, and every car leaving took 3 or 4 minutes to get \"signed in\" to be able to obtain the access card which allowed the in-and-out priviledges. The room was very clean, as was the washroom. However, the room was NOISY. We had friends staying in another room on the opposite end of the floor and I could hear them coming from halfway down the hallway -- and they were not speaking loud or making a lot of noise. And even 21 floors up you could hear traffic from the roads below, which I found extremely odd. I work in a business building 11 floors up and from that height you can't hear anything, even though the building is right beside the highway. But here you could hear sirens and tires screeching and loud exhausts well into the night. The windows also start halfway up the wall with a little window-seat, and the curtains only go as far down as the window seat, so a lot of light comes in the morning. This is the first hotel I've been to that doesn't have full-length blackout curtains to allow darkness even after the sun has risen. At 7am the room was already quite well lit with the curtains fully drawn. The beds were EXTREMELY comfy, as were the pillows. Probably one of the comfiest beds I've ever slept in. We got an extremely good deal but it didn't include free internet, though I think some of the higher rooms categories do have it included if you pay more. Otherwise it would have been $15.95/day. The hotel pool was nice -- plenty of large towels to use (I find sometimes hotel pools have only small towels rather than full bath-sized ones). The pool hotel was good for kids -- the shallow end extends quite far so several smaller kids can play in 3ft water rather than being all squished into 2 feet at the end of the shallow end.

After full refurbishment, the Marriott Chateau Champlain and the Omni Mont-Royal will play in the same league. Also, I would prefer Le Centre Sheraton over the Fairmont Queen-Elizabeth, even if the latter is considered a 5-star hotel in our local rating system. That said, Le Centre Sheraton should consider offering free in-room internet as the Marriott Chateau Champlain and other large hotels already do (still 14,75$ a day at the Sheraton).

It is everything you would expect from a Sheraton or other major chain in any major city in the world. The pluses outweigh the negative, but there is one MAJOR con (see below) that may affect some of your decisions. I was able to make due, and would possibly stay again if I return to Montreal. Pros: - Not sure if we lucked out, considering how busy the hotel appeared to be, but the room was incredibly spacious (corner room) with a more than ample closet and bathroom. I was worried the room might be undersized because like many international (non-American) hotels, the only two bed option was doubles rather than queens. I had nothing to worry about. - The beds were extremely comfortable. A lot of hotel chains advertise their special bed \"system\" or appointments and they don't impress me. The Sheraton beds truly did. - As mentioned, the bathroom was plenty large, with a very nice rainfall showerhead (with some significant power, which is rare for those types) and a pleasantly surprising \"magnified\" mirror for putting in contacts, putting on makeup, etc. - The hotel appears to be recently refurbished and renovated - everything in both the room and the lobby seemed to be new (or certainly clean), rather than overly tired. - Extremely fast elevators - for a busy hotel with nearly floors, we never had a problem getting an elevator and getting to our room quickly. - The business center has 8 computers for use, and the lobby has free Wi-fi (which are positives, but see cons below). - The location is very accessible - the 747 Express Bus from the airport drops off right across the street, and there are loads of public transportation options Cons: - The hotel nickels and dimes you on everything. Internet in the room is nearly $15 per day. There are no free calls, including local calls. Printing in the business center costs money. I was told that they charged a storage fee to keep luggage after checkout. Though the room rate was very reasonable, those sorts of charges could add up significantly and unexpectedly. - While the location is very much Centre-ville/downtown, the hotel itself is not IMMEDIATE to everything. The Peel (green) and Bonaventure (orange) subways are a couple to a few blocks away. The lively nightlife areas on Cresent St and St Catherine's/St Laurent are a few blocks as well. They are all certainly walkable, but they're not RIGHT there. - The staff was okay, but not great. At times, certain staff members seemed aloof and disinterested. Also, I'd asked for a late checkout, and was told that would be fine - but when I called the next morning to confirm, there was no record in the system for my room (luckily, they gave me one anyway). Overall, it's a nice hotel, and if you're staying for business or cost isn't a concern, then there are no major issues. If you're on a budget, or just concerned about deceptive practices, I'd be very wary of the additional charges over the seemingly attractive rates.", "Date": "September 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cork, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cIdeal location, great choice for downtown Montreal.\u201d", "Author": "Niall", "ReviewID": "UR117580675", "Content": "Stayed for four nights and overall it was a good experience, did not eat in the hotel, but used it as a base for travel around the city.

Known for the European old flair. The pool is a decent size. Theres a hot tub and a sauna room that can probably fit 2 -4 people comfortably. Theres also an outdoor terrace to tan but we didn't get to use that. Parking does cost a bit extra for self parking or valet. This was the best deal with a corporate rate. The lobby was nice and spacious with a small area for seating. We went to Montreal during a busy weekend so the hotel had a lot of traffic in and out.

The treadmills were very nice (easy on the feet and lots of programs). The gym also supplies towels. Didn't try the pool but it looked nice. + Housekeeping did a good job at cleaning our rooms everyday and supplying us with toiletries. The housekeeper was very courteous. + Internet station. This was near the check in desk. There are about seven or so computers available for free surfing. They charge a nominal fee for printing. There was free wifi near the internet station. There were times when all the computers were taken but it was helpful to get online the few times we did. + Gustavo, the doorman was very helpful. He allowed us to hold our bags for entire day even though we checked out earlier in the morning. There is a nominal $6 fee to hold luggage (we had two pieces of luggage). + The concierge was very helpful in giving use restaurant recommendations. She provides us with maps and even made reservations for us. * Note that this hotel is in downtown Montreal so on the weekends everything is pretty much closed nearby. But the Bonaventure metro station is nearby and the Montreal metro system is excellent. This hotel is like a block away from the Bell Center so if you're looking to catch a hockey game, this would be an ideal hotel. - The flatscreen TV was good but the program controlling the TV guide was slow and a bit annoying. - Kind of annoying whenever you enter or leave the hotel and you see smokers puffing up in the front of the hotel.", "Date": "August 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orleans,ON", "Title": "\u201cToo big a place for relaxing stay.\u201d", "Author": "dutchy 1943", "ReviewID": "UR117028574", "Content": "We stayed here on our trip from here to there,and to meet family.

So decided to give this a try and compare to the Westin. Unless there is a large price gap, I'd go to Westin without any hesitation. This hotel is entirely adequate for a typical Sheraton. Rooms are supposed to have been renovated, and the furnishing is still in good shape. The A/C units still look like from a while back, and they are quite noisy, but they work. Shower/tub combo looks old, but water pressure is adequate. Toilets have the half flush button to use less water if desired. Was upgraded to a junior suite, which is two small rooms put together. The living room area has its own full bath, which uses up a bit of space and results in the junior suite actually being kinda crowded. Living room area also has a large set of drawers, for what purpose I do not know. As well as closet and a second inroom safe. Again, wasted space IMO. Bedroom area is very small. I HOPE it's not the size of a typical room. If it is, it would be of deplorable size. No minifridge or minibar in room, but lounge (on 37th floor) is open till 9. Lounge is huge, basically an entire floor. Serves decent continental breakfast and snacks 5-8 in the evening. Also, coffee/tea during the day. There is a bar for alcholic drinks (charges applied, I think). If you have a laptop and a mobile device, you cannot use both at the same time via the same internet connection. Say you have your laptop connected, and then you want to quickly look up something on the mobile, one will be cut off. I guess unless you pay for both connections (SPG Plats get free internet, but i don't know if you can get free for two connections). There is no restaurant open for dinner at this hotel. No problem. Montreal has so many good restaurants, why would one want to eat in the hotel anyway. But be forewarned. Service at the lounge is okay with some moments of warmth. But doormen, front desk, etc. all are very perfunctory, if not indifferent. In fact, the valet car guy was more courteous than the doorman. Starwood, shame! For instance, when I pulled up to the entrance, the doorman stood there staring into space. He saw the car, but made no move to come and help or anything, until I waved at him. No move to open the door for the missus, or even a make-believe greeting of welcome. Really not what I expected from a supposedly four-diamond hotel (has grade inflation gone so far?).", "Date": "August 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cVery Pleased...would return\u201d", "Author": "NewYorkFamilyfun", "ReviewID": "UR116322976", "Content": "Our family of six stayed for 8 nights in two rooms. We were on a high floor (32) which we requested ahead of time. I noted that the sign on the floor was SPG, which we are...not sure if non-SPG end up staying there. We had a king room and a double double room. Very large. I noticed on their website that there was a large range in square footage for standard rooms. If you click on the room descriptions you will see what I mean. I am sure we had one of the larger sized rooms. We requested a view of the Mountain. Both rooms had this view. Because of a leaky airconditioner that could not be fixed in the king room, part of my family had to move. Considering this was a room that housed my 20 year old and her boyfriend, I had no problem that they were relocated to the 34th floor. They were upgraded to a junior suite which was basically two rooms...one with a king bed and the other with a living area. Important to note that the size of the two rooms in the suite were very small, so if that is the size on the lower end of the standard room range, I can see where people commented that their rooms were small. Because of the inconvenience of the move, which an upgrade was given, we also received a fruit basket and two bottles of wine....which I thought was very nice. We used the health club every morning around 7 am. There were business people around the hotel, but I never waited for a treadmill. There is only one ellipitcal though. The pool, located on the sixth floor, is very small and if I remember correctly goes to about 4.5 feet. There is a person who works right outside of the pool area covering the pool and the health club, but there is no lifeguard at the pool. You have to be 16 to enter without a parent. There is a hot tub which my kids liked. It is very hot inside the pool room. There is a terrace on the sixth floor as well, but it is under rennovation. Seems like poor planning to me as it would have been GREAT to sit outside on that terrace while my kids were in the pool and or just to relax on the summer evenings. We had coffee once, Starbucks, in the lobby bar area. We did not use the restaurants. The gift shop is very small, it is open until around 10 pm. There are other boutiques with expensive items, but they were not open in the morning before we left to tour and they were closed when we came back. There is a business center in the lobby with about 6 dell computers with free internet access...very very convenient as we were traveling outside of the US and didn't want to rack up the international data charges on our IPHONES. I found this to be a very convenient location. Easy walk to green line and orange line of Metro. One block from St. Catherine. Lots of good restaurants near by. Entrance to underground city close but not direct from hotel. Near bell centre. If you are going for a concert or hockey game, I would stay here...it is about a three minute walk. Grayline does pick up from this hotel for tours, but literally the starting point, which the shuttle bus will bring you to, is about a four minute walk. Housekeeping was great...fresh linens and everything cleaned well. Rooms were in good order, no mildew or chipping paint. Beds very comfortable. Pillows fluffy not hard so you judge based on your preference. Concierge was AWESOME! Tickets to different attractions were available and they were so helpful. On our check in night, I found the front desk clerk to be stand offish and rude. It wasn't a great start, but things improved because I didn't have to go to the front desk (except for the leaky airconditioner) again until check out. There was a different person at the desk for the airconditioner and check out and he was very nice. I will tell you that on Friday night a lot of people came in at once and they were very busy in the lobby. The line was very long for check in and I could imagine that people waited an hour. I would have hated that. My check in was quick, but we arrived at 9 pm and no one was on line. I rated the value excellent, but I got a deal for $99 per night Canadian. I would NOT have rated the value that high if I paid the original 200 per night. Although it is a downtown business hotel. Any questions, just send me a pm.

This had to be the best stay! The caring and commited staff made it a wonderful experience. Check in was flawless and friendly with a comp. upgrade to include access to the Club Lounge...very nice! Our room, newly renovated provided us with a wonderful view of Mount Royal made even more spectacular when we watched a free show courtesy of Mother Nature via a thunder and lightening storm one night. Kudos to some wonderful employees that made our visit most memorable. Jesus...friendly, funny and helpful. I don't think I've ever seen someone enjoy his job more than this man did. Thank you for the shear joy that you demonstrated to us! Mark (conceirge) who ordered us our Indiana Jones exhibit tickets and even printed them off for us! That was simply above and beyond the call of duty. Alexandra (guest services manager) This wonderful woman came down to the front desk to see me after I'd had a \"argument\" with the maid on our floor. Simply stated, she listened to the problems I had encountered with Susanna (the maid) and came with me to my room to give us the box of kleenex I wanted but couldn't get from the floor maid...she wouldn't give it to me. Alexandra also made sure that we got our wet towels exchanged for dry ones. I was so angry, and Alexandra went out of her way to eliminate my upset. Graciously, she sent her card to our room with 2 comp. breakfast vouchers. What a wonderful ambassador for customer service! Thank you so much Alexandra! Finally, Bruno (concierge) Who, upon hearing that the bachelor party guests staying on the same floor as us had not only woken us up at 3:30 a.m. one morning, but had also ended up that same evening eating at the same restaurant, at the same time at the next table, had given us a very rough evening (so much so, that we had to leave the restaurant early) sent to our room a lovely bottle of port with imported chocolates, maple candies and a wonderful card. It seems that the manager of the restaurant next door (La Queue de Chevall) had phoned him to tell Bruno what had happened. We were so touched by this over-the-top display of kindness that it brought a tear to my eye. Thank you so much Bruno...you do your job extemely well. Your boss should be very proud of you and he should be of all his employees! Of course, with the exception of the floor maid, everyone was wonderful, helpful, kind and all went out their ways to make us feel like we were really important and that we mattered! While at the computer station, a young man from the front desk approached me and asked me how I had made out the night following all the \"bachelor\" troubles. How thoughtful was that? These are just a few reasons why, when we visit Montreal every year, we always choose Le Centre Sheraton as our home away from home. I know that not everyone has had such great luck as we've had over the years. That's too bad, because this really is a wonderful hotel. It's clean, centrally located, close to great shopping and fine eateries. The Bell Centre is almost across the street and the walk to Vieux Port is do-able. Thank you for such a wonderful time.

It is just a few blocks down the street from the train station and an easy walk even with luggage. Upon arrival, we quickly noticed the new look of the hotel since our last visit which was sadly too long ago. The hotel was starting to look a little dated the last time we stayed but nothing too major. First off, the front desk looks far more modern. The small bar is now at the other end of the lobby and is a much larger more open area to have a drink or to sit and discuss business if that is what you are there for. The smaller area that was the bar is now the restaurant area. The staff were very friendly as we arrived. More than one staff member smiled or greeted us as we got ready to check in. Anna, our front desk clerk was so nice to talk with and helped us out with a few issues we brought up. She actually talked with us and not at us. Great asset to the company. The room was as we remembered with that great bed that makes a stay here worth the cost. The room really looked great. The bathroom received a huge makeover which was about the only area that we felt needed it. Really liked the new coffee area too.

One block away from shopping at St. Catherines, and virtually next door to the Bell Centre. About 20-25 minutes walk to Old Montreal. Parking: Self park for $24/day or $35 valet. The parking garage first three levels is valet only. Access through the hotel car pick up/drop off area. Check in/out: No real issues. Room: Rooms are clean and what the decor is consistent with what you would expect from a Starwood hotel. It had an in room safe, desk, chair, flat screen TV, internet access for a fee, but no fridge. I noted that the entry door is so thin that you can hear everything in the hall (especially at 3AM when the bars close). Service: Service is a little spotty. More than one request for amenities were not responded to and then for other requests, the service came fairly promptly. When management is aware, they do seem to try to accomodate requests (perhaps as a result of cost cutting or they are overwelmed). Features: The hotel pool is small, but nice and warm. There is also a hot tub and sauna, and exercise room on floor 6. Club floor access: On the 37th floor is the club amenities for platinum members only or if you purchase access (ie. up from gold status). The breakfast is mostly an assortment of cold items (breads, muffins, boiled eggs (cold), fruits, cereals, oatmeal (hot), juices). Go earlier if you can because I noted that the selection gets very sparse by around 8:30 and in some cases so does seating. Overall: I think the hotel was certainly good enough to go back to (if the price is competitive), but not great enough to consideration of the other hotels in the immediate area such as the Fairmont or the Marriott.

I waited too long to book, and subsequently could have gotten a $120/night rate, but I ended up paying $170/night before taxes. The room we got was the queen one, and while the bed was quite comfortable, especially after a long trek, the room was very small and felt a bit tight. There was a nice chair with ottoman next to the bed, with a large mirror on the opposing wall. The view we had was facing the backside of the street, so it was pretty quiet. Water pressure was great in the shower, and the bathroom was nicely decorated with champagne marble countertops with granite flooring. It's just a shame that the ceilings had that \"popcorn\" look to them. The other thing is that there is no fan in the bathroom, so just be prepared for that. The central location to all the main attractions makes this place very attractive, and with all day parking at $21/day with in-out privileges, u can't complain. Overall, I would recommend staying here, but don't bother saving a few bucks for the queen room. Definitely get the king room, it's much more worth having that extra space.

I tend to give places the benefit of the doubt. However, this hotel and the service in it was so poor that I feel compelled to write a poor review. The 4 concerns were as follows (in order of importance): 1. Internet charges I cannot believe that a 4-star hotel that charges premium rates can get away with charging for in-room Wi-Fi in this day and age (CAD14.75 excluding taxes!). Most cafes, coffee shops and restaurants in Montreal and throughout Canada provide free Wi-Fi, as do the majority of budget hotels around the world. There was no free Wi-Fi in the bar either (although there was a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcLink\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Sheraton station by the front desk which looked like a naughty boy corner). Shocking. 2. Layout of the room My room was next door to another, the two were tucked away together in the corner. I suspect previously they were adjoined and were a suite. The only thing separating me from my neighbours was a thin bathroom door. This meant that I heard EVERYTHING going on in the room next door, including their conversation and, even worse, their bedroom activities. I heard this loud and clear, as if it was in my room! 3. Charge for keeping bags I arrived on the first day at 9 am and was told my room was not going to be available until 12. I had asked for an early check-in the day before and was told it was not possible, so this in itself was not a problem. I understood that the hotel was fully booked. What was a problem was that the hotel charged me CAD6 to keep my bags for 3 hours. Most decent hotels offer this as a complimentary service. 4. Queues at Reception Every time I went up to the front desk there were 5 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 10 minute queues, with only 2-3 receptionists available for a queue of 8-10 people. Again, this is unacceptable. I stayed at The Met in Vancouver before coming to Montreal and there they had 3 receptionists even though they had no queues so you were seen within a minute or so, free wi-fi, no charge for bags and quiet rooms.

There are also ports to charge your devices like a USB port which was useful for my iphone since I just brought the cable. I had a chance to use the gym. They have two new threadmills that allow you to watch TV or connect your ipod to save your workout. The pool was very long. I didn't have a chance to use it, but my husband enjoyed swimming laps in it. I would definitely stay here next time I stay in Montreal for the weekend. I do recommend you park at the Stanley Parking lot which is located on Stanley street next to the hotel. I can't believe I parked there overnight and it was only $12 on a weekend.

I very nicely asked him that if our rooms weren't ready perhaps he could upgrade us to other rooms. He could not have been nicer and stated that he would like to be able to do that.

Reserved one room through Hotwire at the nightly rate of $96 USD. This was not the hotel I was expecting to get (I thought I would be booking the Hotel de la Montagne), so it was a pleasant surprise to get a Sheraton. We arrived at the hotel a couple hours before check-in, but the room was ready for us. Our room (1213) was a smallish corner room with a double bed, high definition TV and a desk. There was also a comfortable chair next to the window giving a north view of Mont Royal and the other buildings in the downtown area. The bathroom was also small, but it was nice and modern. There was a floor heater underneath the sink, which was a pleasant touch. On the down side, there were no towel racks except for the pull-out wire located above the tub. When we left our room to explore the city, we requested for room service to change the linens. However, we noticed it had not been done by the 6 p.m. time that had been promised. Aside from that, all employees that we met were very courteous. We took advantage of the fitness centre located on the sixth floor, which contained a hot tub, swimming pool, sauna and exercise area. It is open from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. and was always staffed whenever we stopped by. Towels were plentiful at the desk. Other users have noted that there is a fee to store bags, and this is definitely the case. We had a couple of hours in the city after check out, so we left a bag with the bellman for a $2 charge. During that time, we watched television in the corner lounge located next to the business centre (with many Internet stations that guests can use for free with an assigned password). The hotel is located one block from the Centre Bell, home of the Montreal Canadiens. It was a Saturday game night when we were there, but we couldn't hear any noise from the street once the fans left following the game. Instead, we heard our loud room neighbours throughout the evening. I always enjoy visiting Montreal, and my experience at Le Centre Sheraton has helped improve that impression.

I should also say that I tend to view the Sheraton chain itself as old and tired; my parents stayed there in the 60s and it seems like it's still the 60s in Sheraton land. We stayed at the Sheraton Montreal for a business meeting. It was a large group (I am the supportive spouse here so i didn't attend the business meetings) and it looks as if the Sheraton staff did a good job on this, and the facility is ok for a large meeting (in a dull 60s sort of way). Several aspects of this hotel are pleasant. There is a large and friendly bar on the ground floor level, and all of the coffee stuff was Starbucks, so pretty good. Sheraton has added a smallish, \"hip\" business center hangout adjacent to the bar, with a few computers etc., so that was useful (but crowded). The gym and pool were good. The rooms seem to have been redone in the past few years but still seem dated-- an old room with some new stuff. There is a coffee maker that makes Starbucks coffee in the room. No robes or other spiffy stuff. The bed struck me as soft-ish (I have a bit of a sensitive back, so it may not be a problem for you). The food in restaurants was predictable, relatively bland and a bit expensive. So, what I would say is that there are probably 20 more interesting places to stay in Montreal--- there are a bunch of boutique-y small hotels in the old part of town, and several more interesting looking chains. If you have to be at the Sheraton becuase of a business event, you'll be ok; if you can get a really good price (we paid about $190/night as a group rate), then fine, but otherwise, I'd go elsewhere.", "Date": "November 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cMy once a month consistant lodging!!\u201d", "Author": "CurtainJumper", "ReviewID": "UR87912715", "Content": "I visit Montreal once a month for a three night stay for business.

The hotel bar was a nice quiet place, but the food was quite expensive for what it was (arrived in evening, didn't want to go out to eat). I'd expect a hotel of this size to have more choice. One big complaint-the wi fi is expensive-and only works for the room you are in. Someone in my seminar had paid for the day, but could not access it in the conference room without incurring another $15 charge. This is a big inconvenience if you are attending a conference. Luggage storage for early check out also cost $2 a bag. I've stayed in many hotels that include things like this with no charge.

I had a colleague with me and had reserved a Club Level room with 2 beds. The room was smaller than I anticipated, but functional. The recent renovation is a real mixed blessing. The beds were good and, if you fancy lots of fluffy pillows, you're in luck. For some reason known only to the designers, the bathrooms have no towel bars. There is one towel ring for a hand towel, but nothing else. When I inquired of Guest Services, I was told that I should just call Housekeeping and someone would be right there to whisk away the used towels. That's just ridiculous in this era of conservation and cost-cutting. I was also very disappointed with the Club Lounge overall. It is a large, pleasant room with excellent views. The breakfast was just fine. However, the service was not worth the extra fee; the \"butler\" was overworked apparently; running in all directions, and barely civil. I needed a few pages printed from the computer in the lounge one morning; the printer was not working, and there was no staff on the floor except the butler. I asked him for assistance. He snapped, \"I'm just a waiter\". I found a phone and called Guest Services who sent someone up to help. He could not solve the problem, but took my USB key to his office to print the documents. This took far longer than necessary. Another big surprise in the Club Lounge was that there were no complimentary beverages at hours other than breakfast. No coffee, no water, no juice during the day. So, if one wanted to use it between breakfast and cocktails for any kind of gathering, you were on your own. And, at the cocktail hour, they served modest appetizers and no complimentary beverages. Wine and cocktails were charged at very high prices. Most (probably all) Club Floor Lounges that I've stayed at around the world have at least complimentary house wine for a couple of hours in the evening. I get the feeling that at this hotel, nothing goes uncharged. I used the internet connection in our room for the outrageous daily fee. My roommate took her laptop to the lounge because the website proclaimed that wireless was free in the lounges. Not so fast! She reported that she could not sign on without incurring the daily fee. Needing to get work done, she went ahead. So, for that particular day, we were charged nearly $35 for internet connection. The next day, I went to the SPG desk to protest. After too much discussion, the clerk agreed to remove the 2nd charge. This was another example of lack of clarity in guest information. The website clearly touts free internet access in the two lounges. There was no information in our room about the hours of service in the Club Lounge despite assurances that we were indeed on a Club Floor. when I finally found a card with Club Lounge hours (up in the Lounge), it said that the Lounge was open until noon on Sunday. But, on Sunday, I could not access the Lounge at 11am to print a boarding pass. The concierge desk told me that the Lounge closes at 10am on Sunday. Another surprise for a large downtown hotel was that they do not have 24 hr room service. We arrived late the first night and would have liked something to eat in our room or the Club Lounge. On Friday of our stay, it rained hard in Montreal. When we went to the room after lunch, someone had been in and set up an ice bucket under a water leak in our bay window. We were amazed at the amount of water coming in; towels had been put at the window sill and the wallpaper was coming off. We needed a nap and were sound asleep when the front desk called to say that someone in our room had requested to move and were we ready now? Actually, we were sleeping, Thanks anyway. We emptied the bucket and went back to sleep. When the leak had not abated, we took them up on the offer to move.....and the front desk was going to send a bottle of white wine to our room. I got keys from the SPG desk and we moved our things to the designated room. It was a room with one bed -- and there were two of us. We called the front desk - no answer after many many rings. I went down again and had to be agressive on queue because the SPG desk was not staffed and I didn't want to wait forever to correct their mistake. We were once more reassigned and promised a bottle of white wine for our trouble. Back up the elevators; move to the third room; this looked fine. We quickly unpacked and got ready for our evening function. The doorbell rang and there was a waiter with a bottle of red wine! At that point, what could one do but laugh?

As stated in previous reviews, we've been staying exclusively at this hotel for 25 years (as recent as July 2010). This time it was very different, and frankly disappointing. When we arrived, as SPG gold members, we received a small upgrade (from 2 queens to 1 king) but we didn't get the Club Floor as requested as they told me the hotel was sold out for the night. The clerk at the desk put a flag on our account and promised an upgrade to Club Floor if we checked in the following morning between 9 and 10. We did, and they accomodated us on the 34th floor. We had to move ourselves and we weren't even offered any help (I found this very strange as this has happened before, and previously they have offered to move our things for us when we were out for the day). The front desk clerk looked at me and said \"can you move yourself NOW!?. Most abrupt! The rooms have been renovated and were lovely. The view of Mont Royal with its fall colours was breathtaking. That's about it for the good stuff. The night of the room change we went out to a new untried restaurant and had a VERY DIFFICULT TIME with the servers. We looked forward to returning to the hotel and going for a swim. When we arrived at the room and turned on the light, low and behold we had a guest scurrying around--a cockroach! YIKES! My husband killed it, put it in a kleenex and proceeded to take it to show at the front desk. Most unsettled after the problems at the restaurant and now a cockroach, I got my swim suit on and headed for the pool. When I got there there was no one in the pool (good). When I entered the pool, I noticed there was quite a bit of white \"stuff\" floating on the top of the water and also laying on the bottom of the pool. I quickly got out and told the pool attendant. He came and looked and told me that someone?! had probably brought their baby into the pool with a 'regular' diaper, which exploded! He started to clean the \"stuff\" out of the pool but I was so grossed out by this time. I just left in tears (what a terrible nite!) My husband spoke to the Manager on duty that nite and she called the room to apologize and offer us free parking for 2 out of the 3 days we were there, also offered was a full breakfast for 2 for our last 2 mornings, and she took a restaurant charge off our bill. I very much appreciated that she called and the freebiess she offered. She seemed genuinue enough...but cockroaches on a Club Floor? \"Stuff\" in the pool? and nobody noticed? When I checked out, the clerk at the desk didn't even ask us how our stay was...most unusual. I will stay at this hotel again, cuz one bad experience in all these years does not undo all the good.

After an uncomfortable sleep in a bed, I came home and sent an email to the hotel explaining the issue I had with the bed (they tried to accomodate me at the time by switching my room) and a few other minor things (I STRESS that they were undergoing renovations at the time) and was called back within MINUTES by a lovely woman by the name of Marie Robillard, on behalf of the hotels' GM, Michel Giguere. Ms. Robillard was very concerned at the fact that I, little old me, did not have a wonderful experience in the hotel. She went out of her way to accomodate me on my next visit, making me feel as though I were royalty or worthy of some special, high-end treatment. The weekend that I went back was, not only incredibly amazing, but left me with the desire NOT TO GO HOME!!! As a business owner, my husband prides himself on customer service and, to this day, still talks about Ms. Robillard and Mr. Giguere and their willingness to please their clients and the extent they went to make it happen. This year, I chose to stay at the Centre Sheraton again, even after I had an opportunity to pay much less at the Fairmont through a friend who works with that particular hotel. I opted out of the lesser deal with the Fairmont and stayed loyal to the hotel that catered to my every whim. Once again, we had the most beautiful room, the most amazing view of the city, and cleanliness and service that was above anything else. I had been so bold as to call Ms. Robillard to tell her that I was coming for a romantic getaway with my husband and, upon entering the room, were greeted with a beautiful bottle of wine and a lovely cheese/fruit tray from Mr. Giguere and Ms. Robillard. Talk about stellar customer service. From the concierge, to the check-in clerk, to the cleaning staff, there is no comparison to the impeccable level of customer satisfaction and service (and I have stayed at NUMEROUS hotels). I highly recommend the Centre Sheraton in Montreal. It is beautifully maintained, close to everything you could want, and is blessed with wonderful people who work their and are working FOR YOU.

This sounds like a good thing, but that's about all there is in the area. The hotel restaurant, like all chain hotel properties, not only is way overpriced but also has odd hours. I think 7am-2pm. Perhaps the Sheraton assumes that none of their guests will dine in. The lobby cafe/bar is beautiful, but it's not an all out restaurant to get a full meal. Plenty of restaurants are ten to fifteen minutes away, but for inexpensive eats you'll have to rely on fast food chains. In fact, if you're ever starving for a quick bite to eat, the nearest thing would be the gas station convenience store just over a block away. My hotel room was quite dated. It was obvious that the room hasn't been vacuumed as there was noticeable hair in the bathroom and carpets. I was disappointed to see just one complimentary bottle of water. My room didn't have a fridge/minibar so storing food and drinks wasn't possible, and one of the lamps didn't work. The complimentary soaps and gels were pretty low quality. I almost always use the in-room amenities for convenience, but in this case I did regret that I didn't bring my own. At least the Starwood heavenly bed was as comfortable as always and the TV channel selection was plentiful. The fitness centre is quite small and dated, but the indoor pool and hot tub are good places to relax. Wifi is freely available in the business centre and the Sheraton also provides workstation terminals for guests to access the internet. They'll tell you that wifi is available in the lobby, but the truth is the signal strength is pretty poor if you're even just outside the business centre. Wired and wifi in-room is available for a ridiculous $17/day. What's the point of this when it's free downstairs? This tends to be a problem among every Starwood property that I've stayed in. I wouldn't stay here again because there's nothing in the immediate area (within a five minute walk) in terms of easy food options or availability, but if that's not an issue for you then it's location downtown is pretty convenient. On the plus side, the front desk staff were very friendly and helpful. Except that on a rainy morning they didn't have any umbrellas available. This hotel doesn't really deserve the Sheraton brand. Isn't Sheraton supposed to be Starwood's luxury flagship? I read an article recently saying that the Sheraton is a brand in decline and Le Centre Sheraton Montreal certainly reflects that.

It was one of the conference hotels and the reviews were not terrible, so we went with it. While we traveled as a family, I am a veteran business traveler and I cannot recommend this hotel for any purpose. There are just too many other great options in Montreal for anyone to have to suffer through this travesty of a hotel. Where do I begin? The hotel is nice enough as hotels go; rooms were mostly clean and comfortable, although the hotel is dated and the window-based AC units are noisy. Getting hot water out of the sink faucet required a wait, although hot water from the shower was plentiful. We found that the staff were less than friendly on many occasions and seemed to want to steer us to hotel services rather than help us locate local providers. The television channel options were pitiful, however. Like most higher end hotels, the Sheraton hotel provides a concierge lounge that provides breakfast, evening hors d' oeuvres, beverages, and business center access. This hotel, however, charges $60 a day for their lounge access, which is easily 130% of the average. For this over-priced amount, we got cold cuts and cold boiled eggs for both breakfast and evening meals. The breakfast did provide some pastries and cereal as well and the evening fare added some rather cheap and tasteless finger foods. There was also coffee, but no soft drinks, and no snacks at all except during the meals. The staff of this grand buffet were consistently glum and disrespectful. The entire affair seemed to be carried out with an air of suspicion and an intent to minimize the provision of anything to customers. Refills of beverage, even water, were scarce and when asked to do anything, the staff responded as if they had been bothered by a fly. Oh well, at least they had a business center with internet access... On my first attempt at using the two PC's and printer that made up the \"business center\", I found that one PC (in French) required a password - no instructions were available and the staff... well, we've already talked about them. The second PC gave me a blue screen of death when I tried to use it. A subsequent effort to use the center to edit a PowerPoint presentation found that the PC's had NO business software AT ALL!!!! No MS Office, not even a Word or PowerPoint VIEWER?!?!?!? They did however, have the free adobe reader, probably only because it was free. The systems were also in French. Now, I know that the national language of Canada is French and I'm okay with that. But even in Paris, they provide language options for travelers. The hotel advertises free wifi access in \"public areas\", however, their \"public area\" is a very small place on the first floor and I was appalled to find out that my $60 a day for concierge access did not include wifi. NO, that would be an additional $16 per day and I could not access the public wifi in the lounge. Not only that, it did not allow the connection of multiple devices, so if my wife was connected with her iPhone, I could not connect with my laptop without bumping her off. We complained to the desk about this, who immediately blamed the provider and stated that they were powerless to do anything. We also complained to the desk about the exorbitant lounge charges and the poor food options, but this resulted only in a wincing agreement from the desk clerk. The beds were comfortable enough, but we had to call housekeeping to exchange the heavy winter-weight duvet covers (they weighted about 60lbs!) for lighter blankets. The housekeeping staff seemed to be forgetful; one day we'd have new glasses, another we wouldn't. There were no refrigerators in the room, although when we asked about that, we found one could be provided (for a nominal fee, of course). I've stayed at a lot of hotels of varying quality and style. I'm not snobby nor overly demanding, but I do look for and appreciate quality service and a good price to quality ratio. Neither was available at the Sheraton Centre Montreal. This hotel, more than any other I've ever stayed at, was focused only on maximizing THEIR profit. Every aspect of this hotel operation made an effort to provide minimal service to the customer while charging the maximum payment in return. This greedy concept was so ingrained that it was blatant and arrogant. My stay at this hotel has left me with a strongly negative perception of the hotel, Montreal, and the Sheraton franchise as a whole. Montreal is more expensive now than it ever has been and the recession has certainly impacted the service industry worldwide. That is no excuse, however, for poor service and exaggerated pricing. Other hotels in Montreal are able to provide outstanding quality and service in the same price range. The Sheraton Centre will happily take your money, but you can get much better value and quality for your dollar in other Montreal hotels.", "Date": "August 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cSheraton Le Centre Montreal is a great hotel in the heart of Montreal.\u201d", "Author": "KevToronto", "ReviewID": "UR74219372", "Content": "Last weekend a group of friends and myself decided to make a weekend trip to Montreal.

At $108/night for a family of four, I don't have a lot to complain about. The room was tastefully appointed, the beds were really comfy, the bathroom was beautiful, and the view fine. It was all newly redecorated. Beyond that, we found the pool clean, attractive and well-managed, with plush towels a-go-go and helpful staff on hand. Even the elevators were swift and smooth. At the rate we booked, this hotel far exceeded expectations. But I still have a few niggly issues, each involving ridiculous charges. First, the parking was outrageously expensive. Luckily our car with roof box was too tall for the lot, and so we had to seek parking outside the hotel. Literally sharing a wall with the hotel and probably more convenient was a garage off of Stanley St.. We paid less over the whole weekend than it would have been for one night in the Sheraton. There appear to be tons of options, so I advise travellers to look outside the hotel. Second, the internet access fee of 15$ per day may not be uncommon in Canadian hotels, but it is a bit of a joke for seasoned travellers. When even one-star motels in the sticks offer free wireless internet, the idea of a four-star hotel in a major city squeezing visitors at a ridiculous rate is just in poor taste. Third, the food services are also offered at obscene prices. A breakfast at Reuben's on St. Catherine, two blocks away, would be about 40% of the hotel charge, probably better, and your coffee would be refilled. Because of my resistance to the irritating internet access gouge, I went down to the bar to use the free wireless. They give you 45 minutes for free. It is renewable but also unnecessarily confusing. Anyway, I had two drinks the first night in the very nice bar area. 23$!?! I asked about the bill ... I mean we are talking about domestic beer here ... but apparently there is a charge for everything. Summary: Their renovation is outstanding and the place is very attractive, tasteful, comfortable, and well-located downtown. However I would rather not feel like I am being \"nickel and dimed\" when in a four-star establishment. It is T A C K Y. For our weekend, I am awarding 5-stars for the room and 3 stars for the services; averaged this is 4 stars and a satisfied customer but I hope the hotel will reconsider its absurd mark ups.", "Date": "August 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Grand Rapids, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cVery happy\u201d", "Author": "sjkel", "ReviewID": "UR73191774", "Content": "Through priceline we got a room for 3 nights at the Sheraton.

Whenever we called the desk for towels, supplies, etc, they were sent within 5-10 minutes. Likewise, the hotel bartender, the wait staff for all catered lectures, the maid service, were all attentive+ and professional+. The room was generally very good. The lighting left some to be desired, it was hard to have one light on that was enough to read if the other 3 were sleeping. Since I went to bed later, I just ended up using the bathroom to hang out. The internet was not free from the room which was a pain to go down to the lobby business centre. We used the iron, safe, the desk with various convenient outlets for each cell phone, PDA, computer, etc. The closet and dresser storage was in sufficient for 4 people on conference but perhaps enough for 2/3 people. The quality of the complimentary shampoo was mediocre to poor, just warning in case your hair is like mine, but not a reason to complain. The location was the best feature, being close to everything. For our time outside of the conference, we could easily access shopping on St. Catherine, the metro, the Underground mall, touristy-hipster scene at Crescent st. We liked to walk, and got to Mont-Royale, McGill campus, great bring-your-own-wine restaurants, Old Montreal... but these are more features of the city rather than the hotel. Taxis are waiting for you at the back door of the lobby where the concierge and bell-hop are. You can easily do nights-on-the-town in your skyline shoes with a driver always there! I can't really complain about anything during this stay, but I had a great time on \"business.\" For when the room service / restaurant / bar are closed, there are vending machines on every other floor - but no gingerale. And the 7th floor has a snack machine, also just chips and chocolate. The only reason I will not consider the Sheraton for future visits is the price. Also having to accommodate 4 people was not comfortable and they were not offering suites. The pool was on the small end, and closed at 10 pm which felt early for a night owl like me.

Years ago, when the Expos were there, I started staying at the Sheraton because all the visiting baseball teams stayed there. As the years passed, it just so happend that I stayed at other hotels, sometimes because they were the sites of conferences I was attending. I kind of forgot about the Sheraton. I had noticed in driving by the hotel that the lobby had been redone but had not gone inside to take a look. Last week, we went to dinner in Montreal and stayed the night. We decided to stay at the Sheraton and we were very glad we did. They have done a wonderful job on renovating the hotel, particularly the lobby. The front of the hotel on Rue Rene Levesque is glass sided for the first two stories. Under the previous arrangement, guests did not get to experience how spectacular this could be. The bar was tucked off on the side in a windowless area. It has now been moved to the front of the lobby. Anyone sitting at the bar or at tables or sofas throughout this area is in for a treat. My wife and I had a drink and finger foods while sitting on a sofa and just people watched pedestrians going by. The tables have wing-backed chairs and are also very pleasant (We had a nightcap there after dinner.) Lest I concentrate too much on the lobby bar, the entire hotel has been spiffed up. Our room was a good size and since we are members of the Starwood Preferre Guest program, we were placed on a separate floor. I don't precisely how this affected our room amenities, but the room was nice. The Sheraton has always had a great location, close by everything downtown yet just out of the way of the hub bub of St. Catherine Street. The Bonaventure (Hilton) and Chateau Champlain (Marriott) are lovely hotels but they are just slightly out of the way and down a short incline from most of downtown.

Not only was I surprised, but my expectations were surpassed. Here's a breakdown of the stay: Parking and Check in: Check in was quick, efficient, and the front desk worker was very efficient and friendly. I've stayed at many hotels in Montreal, and I can say that this one had the best value (under 20$) for parking costs, and with it being at a central location, I was impressed. The room: I had booked a Deluxe room and was put on one of the top SPG floors. The Deluxe room was probably about 10$ more than the standard room, but had a full sized couch (also a pull-out) so I thought it was worth it. The website still has some pictures from before the entire hotel being renovated, but the room was larger than most, comfortable bed, LCD television, and what was interesting was that it was wired and set up that you could connect media from your laptop directly to the TV, as well as a USB connector (I was able to charge my iPod with its cord without needing an adapter to plug it into the wall) I was pretty sure that each room would come with an MP3 dock, but apparently that's only on the Club rooms (for now). The bathroom was also nicely updated! I saw the pool and gym briefly, though didn't use them. They looked decent, though.

The hors d'oeurves from 5 pm were a bonus too if you didn't want to eat until late as well and quite a variety as well. The bar on the ground floor was lively as this was also a conference hotel but that did not interfere with us in any way at all, I was worried that the club room might get too busy for us to find a seat, but that was never the case. There was a nice pool, whirlpool, sauna and outside sun area on 6th floor which was never crowded and always clean. The only fault that I could find with this hotel, and I am digging deep here, was that there was no mirror over the desk so drying my hair in comfort was a little awkward and I would have liked a flatter pillow as I have neck problems (told you I was digging deep). Checkout was just as simple as check in and no queues. The concierge was fine as well, but we only used her once and she came up with what we asked for. We were a 30 minute walk from Old Montreal and St Catherine Street with all the shopping was just behind the hotel. Metro and VIA rails station all close by. All in all, I highly recommend ia stay at this hotel if you like polite, discrete, friendly professional staff and a great room with a great view and Club facilities. Worth every penny! Oh, another unexpected bonus, we caught the end of the film festival and were treated to an expert outdoor display of acrobatics, music and other activities absolutely free!", "Date": "September 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful rooms, terrible service\u201d", "Author": "JellybeanandBug", "ReviewID": "UR41374605", "Content": "My spouse and I stayed at this property for two nights for a little getaway. We had booked this room as a reward stay for one night and a regular rate for the following night. Even before we arrived there were problems with our reservation. The information on the reservations was incorrect and they had us booked in two rooms for one night. It was a good thing I called to ensure that everything was correct before we arrived. That was strike one. When you arrive at this property it looks like any other nicely maintained large scale hotel; large lobby, large lounge and restaurant area, connections to shopping areas etc. The check in process was fine but I felt that the staff were not very polite. There were two conventions in the hotel while we were there so I can understand that the staff may have been rushed/tired etc., but first impressions and customer service count for a great deal, so suck it up. Since I'm an SPG member I was upgraded to the SPG (31st) floor of the hotel. The room was spacious with beautiful linens and a lovely view of downtown Montreal and Mount Royal. The money that the Sheraton chain spent on their worldwide reservations has been a good investment as the room are really quite nice. My issue with our stay was the service we received. As part of the renovations each room in the hotel now has a nice flat screen television with an area that allow HDMI and VGA hookups from your laptop to the television. Since we prefer the Starwood group of hotels we were aware that most properties have this feature and brought proper cables along to watch movies from our laptop on the television. We had problems getting the audio function of this interface to work and called to front desk for some help. After about 20 minutes a general maintenance worker came to our room and tried to 'fix' the problem. I get that not everyone knows how this type of interface works but do not send someone without the proper expertise to fix the issue! We never did get that problem resolved. It's also probably good for me to point out that the tv, while capable of producing a high definition picture, is not connected to any high definition channels. My second issue was the extremely early knock on the door that I got for the delivery of our hotel bills and the lack of coordination with our hotel reservations. Since one night was a reward stay and the other was a regular rate stay the hotel kept these as separate folios, so I got separate invoices, even though I expressly asked for them to be combined both when calling in advance of our arrival and upon arrival. Now in most hotels that we have visited, and we have stayed in many worldwide, your invoice arrives in the middle of the night, typically slid under the door. At this property, however, the staff felt it necessary to knock on our door and wake us for the delivery of this invoice at 7:50 am on a Saturday. Now I know that for the early riser this may not be that great of an inconvenience, but this was supposed to be a romantic getaway where we could sleep late and do things at our own pace. In addition to this inconvenience, we were awoken again an hour later by housekeeping and were harassed an additional time in the morning by housekeeping again even though we had a 'do not disturb' sign on our door. I would like to note that this same early morning knock on the door with the bill and the early housekeeping arrival happened again on the second morning. As part of our getaway we wanted to take in some of the sights and attractions that Montreal has to offer. We called the concierge and learned that the hotel carried discount tickets to the Biodome. We indicated that we were going to pick up some tickets and that we were coming right down. When we arrived at the concierge's desk, no one was there and we encountered the third issue with this stay. We waited about 20 minutes for someone to show up and help us. We spoke to the bell captain and another lady who both said that there was nothing that they could do to assist and that we would have to wait. I understand that staff are entitled to breaks and such, but if you know you are going to be away for more than a few minutes, leave a sign or some indication of when you will return. When the concierge returned we told him that we were waiting for a while and he brushed us off stating that he had 'other stuff to do' and that's why he wasn't available. Not a good excuse when your sole function is to provide guests with a service. Our fourth problem with this stay reared its head when we arrived back at the hotel that afternoon. Our keys did not work on our room door any longer. Since our reservations were not amalgamated, like I requested twice before, our keys' functionality expired and we had to get them re-magnetized. On its own, this would have been a mild hindrance, but it was just adding to the other annoyances we had already experienced. Our fifth problem was our final bill. Since the reservations were not amalgamated we were charged incorrectly for certain items, namely internet and parking. We were charged double for the internet and charged for valet parking, even though we used the self park option. I had to call the hotel after we left to confirm that the extra charges were removed. (An aside on self parking vs valet: use the self park and save a few bucks as the valet and self park are all housed in the same parking structure that is part of the hotel.) Needless to say, our experience was really soured by this lack of good service. This hotel really ends up giving the Starwood chain a bad name in Montreal. We will not be staying here again.

Our room was a junior suite and was really just two adjoining rooms, one with a small bedroom and bathroom and one with a living area and second bathroom. The rooms were clean and the bathrooms were well stocked with toiletries. My only complaint would be that the walls are paper thin, so be prepared to hear your neighbours! Location: A fabulous location\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwalking distance to great shopping and restaurants and close to Old Montreal. Club Lounge: We had club lounge access and it was fair. The breakfast was a continental buffet and appetizers were served nightly and consisted of pub style fare such as sausage rolls, spring rolls, cheese and crackers, chips and pretzels etc... One soft drink is complimentary and alcoholic beverages are additional. The view from the club lounge is lovely but the staff is a bit stuffy. Pool and rooftop patio: The Sheraton has a lovely indoor pool and whirlpool as well as a small exercise room and rooftop patio that you can order room service to\u00e2\u20ac\u201da great feature for warm summer days! Valet: The valet service is a joke. It is extremely expensive and, when you need your car you have to go down in person to ask for it. At all other hotels we have stayed at, when you pay for valet you can call from your room and your car will be waiting for you when you arrive in the lobby. We also found the valet staff rude. Other amenities: Other amenities included a bar and restaurant, gift shop, spa room service and concierge. Overall: Not a bad hotel, but there are other hotels in the area that are better. I visit Montreal several times per year and would recommend the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth - Gold Floor or the Square Philips Hotel instead. I have not tried the Marriott Residence Inn, but from what I have heard that is a great hotel as well.", "Date": "May 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pasadena,Ca.", "Title": "\u201cSheraton has a new life with a wonderful renovation!I had a great stay!\u201d", "Author": "bigguyinpasadena", "ReviewID": "UR30840154", "Content": "Stayed here for Memorial day weekend getaway.

The new bed rivals the Westin Bed for comfort and has very high quality white sheets,two duvets(one very light down and the other a heavier fiber fill-the down one was what I used to sleep under)and four king sized pillows with shams.I slept so well in the new bed which is a deep mattress with just the right amount of firmness for me.

As I was staying in a club room, breakfast was included in the price of the room. Breakfast was served in the club lounge on the 37th floor. A good selection of cereals, pastries and fruit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c perfectly adequate to get you started in the morning.

The Omni had all the amenities listed under the \"unknown hotel\" and Omni is one of the Hotwire suppliers. Anyway when I found out it was the Sheraton instead, I immediately went to the Tripadvisor and Travelocity websites to view what past guests were saying about the hotel. Most of the comments ranged from decent to downright dreadful! I was shocked and called Hotwire to cancel my reservation. The rep at Hotwire refused, saying they were standing by the 4 star rating and would hold me to the contract. I had no other choice but to stay there since I didn't want to pay for another hotel. I was expecting the worst when I arrived, but was pleasantly surprised to discover that the Sheraton Le Centre was actually quite nice. My room was on the 15th floor, with a partial view of Mont Royal Park. The room was not huge, but certainly not small either. It's no different than staying at a Marriott or Hilton. I was given 2 very comfortable queen size beds with contemporary bed covers, lots of pillows, an arm chair and a writing desk. The carpet was in good condition also. Although the bathroom was somewhat dated (wallpaper with little roses), everything worked fine. I had read some reviews that guests complained about the housekeeping at the Sheraton and I was a bit worried. I decided to leave the housekeeper $3.00 canadian dollars everyday for their services and they were very appreciative. Even wrote me a short thank you note every day. I had plenty of towels, the beds were always made, the carpet vacuumed, tea bags left near the hot water maker and plenty of toiletries in the bathroom. Although the hotel lobby is quite beautiful, I can see where other guests may have problems. It can be quite crowded if a convention is there or there is a game at the Bell Center which is across the street.

The hotel did not feel as large as it is and it was packed (fully booked) with conferencees and Habs fans the night we were there -- we expected much noise and heard none either inside or outside (the windows seem to be well insulated) You can walk to the Bell Centre of course but also easily to the best shopping on Sainte-Catherine and nearby streets, to nightlife and restaurants on Crescent and Montagne, and to many good coffee shops. (In fact there was a Starbuck's drip coffee maker in our room.) Very comfy bed with soft sheets. We had a delicious breakfast at Cora's just up the street -- very fresh and not greasy (for a big breakfast). Is this hotel a four star? Definitely not.

They offered one for $50 the next day, I said I would think about it. I wanted to see what the room was like. The smoking room was horrendously dirty and looked like a $40 motel. Large bright red stains on the floor, smelt like a motel, black marks on the walls. It gave me hives. I went down to talk to them about getting another room. They offered only the upgrade for $50, which I had no option to accepted, given my allergic reaction. They said to come down tomorrow and they would take care of it and move our stuff. That night, a staff member knocked on my door at 12.20 am and asked if I needed help with the safe. I replied no and refused to open the door. I next got a call at 12.25 am from the front desk asking if I needed help with the safe. I said no. The next morning, I went down and the front desk person said she had no note on the file and made several derogatory remarks about us booking on priceline. She accused me of lying about the upgrade . She was very rude and accusatory. I eventually had to speak to management and settled that matter out after a lot of wrangling with management. We were moved to a regular non-smoking room for the next 3 nights which was a normal, cleanish 3 star room (not 4 star). For our troubles regarding the upgrade, we were given a free breakfast. However, they were unrepentant about the state of the room I had slept in (see pictures). She said that some of the rooms were outdated and had stains. The bad service continued -- the next morning, I left the room only to be quizzed by the maid as to when the room would be empty (I had the do not disturb sign out). It was 8.30 am. I said probably later in the morning. She made a snarky comment about waiting. The next morning, I called about the airport shuttle. The hotel operator was rude and disrepectful. He said they didn't know anything about it except that it came every 25 minutes. Nothing about fees, where it stopped, how long it took or alternate transportation. He was dismissive and condescending. While some of the staff were quite friendly (upstairs, at the lounge), on the whole, my visit there was unpleasant and regrettable.

Not even close, despite the steep rates being charged and many a glowing guidebook review. Realizing that with any hotel of this size \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a large one with 36 floors and hundreds of rooms \u00e2\u20ac\u201c everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mileage will, of course, vary, but I suspect the differences won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be much given what I encountered during a visit in July 2008. COMMON AREAS: The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main entrance is presently under renovation leaving guests no choice but to come and go through the garage entrance off Rue Drummond. Inside the construction has cramped the already oddly shaped lobby which, given the size and number of tour groups loitering about, is not a good thing. At first glance the place felt like a tired, early \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc80s conventioneers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 paradise, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sorry to say that feeling stuck with me throughout my stay. In my mind few things sour a first impression of a hotel more than dingy rugs underfoot. Unfortunately a lot of the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s carpeting, particularly on the guest floors, looked more like the rugs around the dollar slots at a cheap casino: discernable \u00e2\u20ac\u0153trails\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd had been ground into them \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from front desk to elevator, from elevator to guest rooms, etc. The front desk and concierge area look right out of some Courtyard by Marriott. Unimpressive in a big way. Add to that the chattering ambiance of a bus station, thanks to the chaos of the tour groups, and, well, you get the picture. However, the adjoining Le Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Bar is an attractive inviting space, particularly if you like to watch traffic on Blvd Ren\u00c3\u00a9 L\u00c3\u00a9vesque. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also your only late-night dining option. One other detail \u00e2\u20ac\u201c admittedly small \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that struck me as strictly down-market was the hotel personnel clad in matching T-shirts. Bellhops, concierge staff, front-desk clerks, all wearing screened tees just didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t strike me as professional. GUEST ROOM: Not four-star, maybe not three-star. With the singular exception of the beds [see below], the room was an absolute disgrace for this supposed caliber of hotel. The carpeting inside the room was even worse than that in the corridors: outright stained in several places. The walls had marks and scrapes on them. Frankly everything about the room was tatty: the d\u00c3\u00a9cor was drab and dated; the 19\" TV was circa 1990 along with a cheap clock radio on the night stand; the windows were dirty on the outside; even the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s printed materials (cards about turn-down service, room service menus, etc) were dog-eared from passing through a thousand hands. The smallish bathroom (one sink), while not dirty, was far from sparkling clean. The floors needed polish. Wallpaper seams were coming loose in several places. The ancient brown tub/shower combo felt vaguely institutional, and the bathroom itself was not ventilated. (One hot shower left the mirror fogged for a half-hour.) The towels themselves were no better than standard-issue Days Inn. Also, no bathrobes were provided. (Four-star?) On the plus side, the quality of the beds themselves was quite nice. Dubbed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sweet Sleeper Beds\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by Sheraton, they really were exceptional. Definitely one of the most comfortable hotel beds I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever slept on. LOCATION: Comme si, comme \u00c3\u00a7a. I found it to be a negative. Ren\u00c3\u00a9 L\u00c3\u00a9vesque is one of the least interesting thoroughfares in city center, and while the walks to either Rue Maisonneuve for dining or Bonaventure station for the M\u00c3\u00a9tro were pleasant enough in the summer, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be far less so in inclement weather. The hotel has no link to the underground city. VERDICT: Le Centre Sheraton Montr\u00c3\u00a9al does not deserve to be ranked among the better hotels in the city. (Of all the guidebook reviews, too many of which are positive, Fodor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Montr\u00c3\u00a9al & Qu\u00c3\u00a9bec City 2008 comes closest to the mark.) Frankly, unless you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in town to catch a concert or the Habs at the Bell Centre (a short two blocks away), there are far better, more interesting, or less expensive alternatives. Priced like a four-star hotel but delivering like a two-and-a-half star, Le Centre Sheraton Montr\u00c3\u00a9al is ultimately a big bland disappointment.", "Date": "August 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cNot stellar, only adequate\u201d", "Author": "Perhillion", "ReviewID": "UR19153215", "Content": "I'm a big fan of the Starwood-brand hotels -- I try and stay at them whenever I travel.

The location was very central: just a short two block walk to the Bon Adventure Metro station next to Bell Centre and St. Catherine's Street. The area was very safe.

Yes, it's in the center of everything, but so are many others. This is not the only hotel in Montreal. This is unlike any Sheraton we've ever stayed at. The beds were very uncomforable and the comforter very heavy, not the down filled ones that most other Sheratons have. The rooms are outdated, with peeling wallpaper and carpets that have many stains on them. But, we didn't really care about any of that, since we were there to explore the city and not sit in our hotel room. So on day 2, we decide to go out for the day. We did not want our room cleaned, so we put out the do not disturb sign. My fiancee saw the maid in the hall when we were leaving, and told her specifically to not clean our room, and she said ok. About 10 minutes after we left, we realized we forgot something. We drove back, and I ran upstairs to find what we've forgotten. During that time, the phone rang, but I didn't have time to answer since I was looking for the item we'd forgotten. Shortly after, there was a knock on the door. I then remembered the old trick they use. First, they call, and if you don't pick up, they come to your room. I remained silent and just sat on the bed. Then, the door opened and in walks the same housekeeper that we told not to come in just 15 minutes before. She was shocked to see me sitting there and promptly exited, without saying anything. I ran after her, but she went into the housekeeper room, so I decided to just talk to the manager. She didn't even have a cart with her, so there was no reason to be in our room. The manager wasn't overly concerned and said he'd talk to her, which he didn't, since the next day there was evidence of them being in our room again. If you have valuables, take it with you. Do not use the safe in that room and take all your money with you. They have some sketchy housekeepers. In all our travels, this is the first time that we felt very uncomfortable leaving the hotel room. I would not reccomend this hotel to anyone and will never stay there again.

(I recommend Carlos and Pepe's for cheap but good Mexican; Mikasa for phenomenal sushi and Cora's for breakfast.) The bed is incredibly comfortable, and the rooms are a good size. The bathroom is pretty average - nothing too spectacular or offensive. The fitness room is ok - I stick with treadmills or cross-training machines, both of which they had. The room is big enough so I never had much of a problem getting a machine, and it's also well ventilated. I can't comment on the food at the hotel as I've never tried the restaurant, but the bar is a solid place to start a night out. The best part of Le Centre, though, is the price. I've paid as low as $100 and no higher than $180 a night each trip.

I was joining a friend who was booked to stay at this hotel as part of a conference she was attending. I just came along for the ride! All in all the room was \"fine\". We were in a non-smoking room with two double beds. The beds are very comfortable with nice hotel sheets and a comfy duvet with a hotel blanket in between. The room was of adequate size and the 19th floor gave us nice views. The location was also good - a short walk to Old Montreal and just over a block off of St Catherine's Street. I also walked to the Atwater market in half an hour too. I can't figure out how such a large hotel can have so many rooms with stained carpets. Ours was no different. A large stain in front of the office desk looked like perhaps someone had dropped a pot of coffee. There were a few other, smaller stains as well. The arms of the armchair were a bit worn. The bathroom was dated with floral wallpaper. The curved shower rod was a nice touch and the shower was nice and hot. No fan in the bathroom so it got pretty steamy. Our sink had a large crack in it and the handle of the toilet was cracked. I noticed some coffee splatter on the wall behind the coffee pot and dirt in the corners of the closet door - nothing life-altering but did kind of make me wonder about the attention to detail. I'm pretty squeamish about hotel rooms and all in all the room was just fine. I was quite comfortable but everything was just a little rough around the edges - ie) don't look too carefully and it will all be fine! My friend had a conference rate of $169 and I think that was about right. I was stunned to observe a rack rate on the back of the door of $565 though! I would NEVER pay that much to stay at this hotel and if you are, you need to rebook quickly. Anyone that we dealt with was very polite and friendly. The concierge's gave good restaurant recommendations. I liked the outdoor terrace on the pool level. It was a nice place to relax with a magazine. There are tables and chairs and lounge chairs too. One heads up that I have not seen before is that the mini-bar is electronically wired. If you move anything out of it's designated spot it is automatically charged to your hotel bill.

I arrived by taxi (it was 40 $ one way) , and unfortunately the website of the hotel did not inform me about the possibility to use the airport transfer (14$) to and from the hotel. Checking-in was very friendly. When I arrived at my smokers room, I was quite shocked because of the strong smell of smoke sticking in all the carpets and furniture. When I found out that there was not even a window to open to let in fresh air, I was dissapointed. Anyhow. None of the rooms has a window to open. Just let the aircondition running up all the time and leave the guestroom door open as often as you are able to. I provided myself with a smell killer spray and so I could stand it. I slept with the guesrroom door half-open all night. There is no dehumdifier or ventilation within the bathrooms, so if you want to enjoy a longer shower it gets quite humid inside your room. The furniture is not taken good care of. The chair in front of the desk as well as the armchair in the room were full of spots. Internet access was provided, yes. But to a rate of almost 15$ per 24 Hours. For example: a colleague of me stayed at Four Points Sheraton, Montreal, where the Internet access was for free! When I wanted to let my handout for my talk at the congress being printed out (the information sheet in the room told me just to send an Email to Lecentre.sheraton@sheraton.com it came back because of an unknown Emailadress. I went downstairs, where the friendly personal provided me with the information that I may print out anything at the business center. Well, I went down to the business center where iwas asked to pay 7.5$ just for using the computer, another 50 cents for every minute and another 50 cents for each of a black and white printed page or 2 $ for each of a coloured page. 10$ just to get a print out of a 2-side word document? No way! Imagine, you are already paying 15$ a day just for the use of the Internet! I went to the front desk again, where they helped me after I told them that I was not willing to pay 10$ for a print-out of a two sided word file. Using your telephone is equally expensive: If you are using a telephone prepaid card on your room telephone, you will be billed for that! You will be billed 1.50 $ for each calling and if you are talking longer than 60 minutes it will be an additional 10 cents per minutes thereafter. I went to the hairdresser at the lowest hotel level. I came out (just for highlights and no special hair cut) with a bill amounting 250$. My fault was, that I hadn\u00c2\u00b4t ask for the average amonut of costs ahead. What was really nice was the pool area, where you will be able to swim from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. , joining a whirlpool or a sauna. This area is really lovely. Check out is around 12 a.m. My flight was going in the evening so I asked for the possibility to store my luggage. It was 1.50$ for each item. Resume: I would not come again to this hotel because even if the pool area is nice, this is not what you should be searching for only in this wonderful city. Le Centre Sheraton is said to be a four stars hotel. I would expect Internet access for free, no billing when using prepaid cards or storing luggage at your departure day and a better service for printing as well as a ventilator/air condition within the bathroom and clean chairs to sit on in a four stars-hotel.", "Date": "August 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dalla", "Title": "\u201cThey took good care of me\u201d", "Author": "tmyers6497", "ReviewID": "UR8509092", "Content": "I made my reservation a while ago on their website so got a reduced rate.

The concierge, front desk, and valet employees were all so helpful and friendly, which made up for a lot of what this hotel was lacking. I'd give this hotel 2 stars if it weren't for the saving grace of the employees, for which I bumped it to 3. I only stayed at this hotel b/c this was what was given to me via Priceline (for about $90/night). I was having trouble securing a room via Priceline in Montreal in August. I'd take note of that - there were many events going on, from Grand Prixe Racing to a huge jazz festival, which made it difficult to secure a room at a decent price. I've read about others Priceliners getting a room here at the Sheraton for $70-80/night. I think this is appropriate for a stay at this hotel. The hotel is located on Blvd Rene Levesque, the downtown area of Montreal. The building is nestled amongst other corporate buildings and looks just like any other tall building in the area - nothing special. The blvd is dead on the weekends, since no one is in the office working. The Metro station is 2 blocks away, which was very convenient. However, behind the hotel, a block away is the bustling Rue St Catherine, which is a very commercial strip with clothing store chains such as French Connection, Le Chateau, Buffalo, Aldo, Steve Madden. There's also food chains such as Starbucks and Second Cup, and then nightclubs/bars and seedier places that I will not mention here. Also within walking distance is Rue Crescent, a 2 block area that is devoted to nothing but bars. It is pure mayhem and seems like a big frat party, if you are into that sort of thing. Latin Quarters was another crazy drinking area. I was not looking for this type of experience and appreciated other parts of Montreal, such as the Mont Royal/Plateau and Mile End area. The parking: either pay $26 for valet parking, or $19 for self-parking with in/out privileges. Parking for both are both below the hotel in an underground parking garage. The garage is very deep - there's 10 levels. There is an elevator that leads directly from the garage into the hotel. Then you need to just get into the hotel's elevator to get to your room. The room: I have to agree that the room itself is nothing special. I was already expecting a smaller room - hey, this is a big city. Space is a premium and I understand that. We had a queen-sized bed on a non-smoking floor (though I had asked for king). Apparently, the only avail king bed was on a smoking floor - no thanks. We were on the 19th floor and did have a good view of St Catherine. The bed was comfortable, but there was a small blood stain on our sheets! That wasn't pleasant. In addition, I noticed a small stain on the wall. I didn't even want to explore what it was, so I can't tell you if it was dirt, blood or something else. The carpeting is old and worn. There's a chair with a little table, which was convenient for late night snacks. The desk had internet access, but it wasn't free. We didn't bother to ask the price. The TV is old/dated, and I noticed that we didn't get any premium channels. The bathroom had a huge counter, which is typical of Sheratons. The bathroom handle was broken, which was annoying. You had to flush, then manually push the handle back up or it would perpetually flush. Amenities include a safe, iron/board, blowdryer, pantene branded shampoo/conditioner, coffeemaker. Despite all these setbacks, I will say that the room was overall clean. The cleaning lady was very nice. I wish the hotel would renovate overall, as it def is not the fault of the employees that it's in the state that it is. Overall, I was not expecting much from this hotel, and for what I paid, I was ok with this. If I had a choice of hotels, I would definitely not stay here again and opt to stay at a higher end hotel over the Sheraton.", "Date": "August 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Palm Springs, California", "Title": "\u201cWhat a Dump!\u201d", "Author": "PSTravelingMan", "ReviewID": "UR8382218", "Content": "This place was awful.

Personally, i find it much too big & it always seems more empty than it actually is due to its size. They moved the restaurant to the area where the bar used to be & it never seems very busy. As for everything else, still the same: small rooms that have seen few renovations (but need it!), overpriced internet (around $15 per day....most of the other hotels offer it for free!), several guys/gorillas that patrol the lobby & possibly the most unhappy-looking reception clerks that i have ever met in my entire life!

And depending on your reason to visit, it's location is excellent -- smack in the middle of the business district, within walking distance of much of what Montreal has to offer and with easy access to cabs and metros for the rest. (you can get pretty good views of the city too, depending on which room you get) If I were planning a trip solely as a tourist, I might look at a hotel around Vieux Montreal (consider, for example, the St. James or St. Sulpice), but this location isn't bad either. For perspective, it's about a 5 minute/$10 cab ride or a 20 minute walk to the heart of Vieux Montreal.", "Date": "May 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, New York", "Title": "\u201cQuite nice stay\u201d", "Author": "ElenaAP", "ReviewID": "UR7581070", "Content": "Stayed here while traveling on business.

We arrivd at 7pm to a simple check in, I requested a higher floor (as I usually do) and was granted one next to the elevator. While Im not happy about being by the elevator, it was a quiet hotel so it was never a problem. The room was your standard hotel room, I didnt hate it or love it, it was simply a hotel room. The internet was about $13 USD for 24 hours and the TV wasnt the best when it came to reception. As you know Montreal is a French speaking region, so any English channels on the TV are a blessing, and of course the ones with the static were CNN Headline News and CBS Vermont. We had other options, but not many. We never ordered room service...but they do guarantee delivery to your room in under 30 minutes or its free. Thats nice since once I waited an hour for a pizza at a Wyndham in Boston. The Sheraton Sweet Sleeper Bed was very comfortable and big, we had a queen size. The bathroom needs a makeover, stuck in the late 80s early 90s with old looking wallpaper. The room had horrible lighting...I mean this isnt some sleazy motel off of the highway, its one of the more popular hotels in Montreal downtown. One lamp didnt work and the ones that did had very dim lighting. We had a great view of a building being constructed in the distance...and no sarcasm here...the view was cool because we had snow (Montreal in March? no way!)...and the workers continued working through the wind and snow on a -10F day on top of this 30 story structure. Off to the right was Mont Royal. Very big windows light up the room during the day. They have a store (Montreal touristy crap like t shirts,mugs,magnets etc) one level below the lobby with an ATM next to it. They also have a jewelry store in the level below the lobby. The hotel is very close to the main train station where VIA Rail and Amtrak are located. About 2 blocks away and around the corner from Crescent Street which is full of bars/restaurants and shopping. Also check out St Catherine Street for shopping (FCUK,Mexx,Gap,Hugo Boss,Zara) They have two places to eat.Bistro Le Boulevard which is open daily 7am-2pm and Le Bistro Bar which is a bar/pub grub place with welcoming giant wall size windows and very comfy seats and couches. It isnt a sports bar with a jukebox...its more sophisticated chic styling with the best french fries in Montreal!

I'll break everything down. Location: Pretty good central location, across from the Bell Centre. Eaton Centre and Rue St. Catherine are a short walk away for great shopping and there are also lots of restaurants nearby.. Hotel Ambiance: Very upscale high rise hotel, more business like than family oriented. There is a variety store in the basement, expensive. There is a restaurant called Le Bistro on the main floor. Very pricey, not much for choices, food was just okay. Rooms: We had two double beds, the room was small. Not roomy for 2 adults and 2 kids. The bathroom was okay as far as bathrooms go. A bit outdated. The rooms were cleaned daily by the maid, and she did a good job. I'd say the room for me was dissappointing for $170.00 a night. There was only 1 tv and 2 phones. Who needs 2 phones? I'd rather have another t.v. Local phone calls are $1.49 + tax. Ouch! There was a video game console but you had to pay. Our ordering system for that and movies didn't work. Internet services are not free anywhere in the hotel. It is about $16.75 or so for 24 hours. There are some hotels that give you that for free. We were on the 20th floor and had a beautiful view. There is a fire station on the road beside the hotel, so we did hear alot of sirens from fire engines AND ambulances at all times of the day. The beds are heavenly! I never sleep in hotels because I am too uncomfortable, and this is the first hotel that I literally was out like a light. The sweet sleeper beds are awesome! Staff: Excellent, professional, courteous, nice and helpful! Orsola at the concierge desk will make sure you are never bored. Ask her what to do and she'll give you plenty of ideas along with a map! She's awesome! Merci Orsola!!!!! Bar: Very nice and pleasant staff. We has petite dejeuner (breakfast) there. They offer Starbucks coffee, croissants, pasteries, muffins, cookies, fresh fruit, yoghourt, bagels. After 2 pm they do finger foods. Pool: Nice, also has a sauna and a parrott named Cecile. The only thing that bothered me here is that parents let there kids jump and splash and act like maniacs. We left one day because there were some really bad kids. My kids were freaked out. Staff is friendly but they don't keep the kids from splashing or jumping when the sign says they are prohibited from doing so. Things to do: Biodome, Insectarium, Planetarium, Notre Dame, Bell Centre Tour, Shopping on Rue St. Catherine & Eaton Centre, lots of great restaurants, and the movie theatre on Rue St Catherine offers movies in English. The hotel said it had children's activities, but we did not see any. The metro is very easy to take and way less expensive than taxi's. You can jump on one at Peel or McGill in the Eaton Centre. Go to Chez Cora's for breakfast, it's really good! All in all, the hotel is nice but expensive and you have to pay for everything. No free breakfast here either. It is a really nice, professional hotel close to everything. I don't know if I would stay here again, I might try something else for less money and more for it.

My room had a big crack in the bathroom countertop and some small cracks in the wallpaper in the room. The Hyatt was definitely nicer, except for its poorly designed bathroom. One of the other disadvantages is that this is one of the downtown hotels that does not have a direct connection in to the Metro or the underground city so you have to go outside for a block or 2 in either direction before getting back indoors.

The hotel is oriented towards business travellers and tourists. Some previous reviews noted that the hotel is in need of renovation. And it is. It's not up to the new Sheraton standards.

Even though i have my complaints about the hotel, we did have a wonderful trip and the hotel did not spoil my fun. (but i admit that i wish i went with my #1 choice) If i were to visit again i would try another hotel.", "Date": "September 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, AZ", "Title": "\u201cvery tired and needs renovation\u201d", "Author": "PHXroadwarrior", "ReviewID": "UR5731791", "Content": "Compared to other Sheratons, I thought this one was way below average.

Rue St Catherine was a couple of blocks away so was the entrance to the underground city. On Sunday we took the bus tour of Montreal for $18 CAD each which lasted about 3 hours and was worth every penny The Driver dropped us off at the Notre Dame Basillica, took $5 each to get in. From here we walked through Old Montreal and back to the hotel which was about a 15 to 20 minute walk. By the way the tour started at Rue Peel at Dorchester Sq which was also a couple of blocks from the hotel. The room in the hotel was small but sufficient for 2 people, the bathroom was very clean, we were on the 30th floor with a fantastic view of the city. The people at the hotel were very courteous, the bartenders at the lobby bar made some mean vodka tonics. The room itself had a well stocked mini bar but the prices were ridiculous ( $9 for one of those bitty bottles of booze ). We paid $ 187 CAD for the room through AAA and it well worth it.

Also small. very small. the room fit a bed, entertainment/dresser, desk, chair and ottoman. Between them less then a foot of space. however I was really only in my room to sleep and shower. I was out enjoying the beautiful city of montreal. I was only there for the weekend so every chance i got i was out and about...however, if you are planning a lengthy trip and will be spending more time in the room you may want to find a bigger room. Overall i was pleased, if you are looking for a nice clean hotel to relax, and be near by to the locations you want to see, I would recommend, if you know you are the type of person who is more comfortable with space and looking for a at home feel I would not recommend.

They charge extra for most everything--internet, 800 and local phone calls, the newspaper, and parking (and the charges for all are higher than average). One happy exception is that the indoor pool and gym was free and much better than average (the pool is large enough to do laps--that is, if families aren't blocking all the lanes playing with the hotel's supplied beach ball!).
