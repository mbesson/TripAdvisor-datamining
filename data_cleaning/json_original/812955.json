The room was very uncomfortable. The bed was hard and had a stiff plastic covering over the mattress. As the room was already stuffy from limited air it made the bed uncomfortably hot and humid. There was very little light in the room. It would not be feasible to read except with a lighted electronic device such as an IPhone. The staff were very helpful and pleasant and you could walk to many sights. There is also a Metro station very close. We had an evening meal in the restaurant as we were tired and didn't want to go too far afield. That was a mistake. Both of us felt our meals were tasteless and poor in quality.", "Date": "March 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orange, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat value and location\u201d", "Author": "CosperPhoto", "ReviewID": "UR89927146", "Content": "My father had recommended this hotel for it's convenient location to the Metro Station Balderas, shopping and reasonable price.

The room was well furnished with a king bed. The bathroom was large, with plenty of large, plush towels, shampoos, soaps, lotion, etc. First hotel I have seen with a bidet at this price. Also 2 free bottles of water each day. The service was excellent. When I first arrived, I complained to the front desk that I was having difficulty connecting to the WIFI. Within a few minutes, the manager was at my door with key in hand to move me to a room with a good connection. And he stayed to see that I could connect. Only downside was the service in the restaurant -- slow with a \"dont bother me\" attitude. But plenty of good choices without using the on site restaurant. Metro station within one block, is another plus.", "Date": "April 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "P\u00e1tzcuaro, Michoac\u00e1n", "Title": "\u201cFirst rate value; central locatio.\u201d", "Author": "Don_Cuevas", "ReviewID": "UR57599736", "Content": "We chose the Hotel Pal on the basis of its central location near Metro Station Balderas where Lineas 1 and 3 cross. The other attraction was price. When I saw the modest rates for rooms and suites on the Hotel Pal website, I was nearly incredulous; rooms for one or two persons, with king bed, $350 pesos; rooms for two with jacuzzi, $450; and the master suites, $550?? It's true, as we found out. http://www.hotelpal.com.mx I'm not sure how they can offer such tremendous value at modest prices, but I think one way is to eliminate costly frills, eg, there's no bellman staff. The lobby is attractive but minimally furnished with a few easy chairs and a sofa. The hotel caters to business travelers, families and tour groups, but also the \"drive-in trade\", with a \"love motel de paso\" section accessed via a ramp into the garage. This had no feel of sleaze about it to us. Now, some persons might not like that the TV has 1 or 2 porn channels amidst the regular programming; but our solution was to not watch them. Whle we were there, a large tour bus group of older Americans or Canadians arrived by for one night The maintenance and hygiene are impeccable, and it's clean to the point of looking sterile. Our room was simply but pleasantly decorated. I have to mention that the free wi-fi in the room and lobby worked well, and for those guests who didn't bring a laptop, there are two well mantained PC's with Internet connection in a glassed in area to one side of the lobby. The huge bathroom of our Master Suite, on the 4th floor, was a highlight. The floors were faux marble, and in addition to the usual equipment, there was a bidet and a 2-person jacuzi tup. (Unfortunately, it took 25-30 minutes to fill adequately, which made me feel guilty for wasting water.) The shower had fast arriving, forceful and plentiful hot water. We never had less than 4 or 5 big bath towels. The bath amenities were basic but adequate. The main bedroom-sitting room was even larger and had a good, firm king bed, nightstands, a desk, a desk chair, a small round table and two wing chairs. The closet was open style, but had many hangers. Illumination was adequate from recessed spot lamps. There were two large windows, which partially opened, and well shielded by heavy curtains. There was some noise at night (music) from the buildings behind the hotel (some of which are humble tenements) but the noise usually subsided in and hour or so. A friend stayed in a front, single room, and he had no trouble sleeping, he reported. The TV remote control did not work, and was inconveniently bolted to the wall next to the bed.But since we don't watch much TV, it was not a big problem. The reception staff was business like and correct. They work from behind a large, heavily glass window. There is a restaurant and bar, but we didn't eat there, as we had other dining interests in the area. The neighborhood seems safe enough, at least in daylight hours, and we walked everywhere to the north and east, reaching the Centro Hist\u00f3rico in 25 or 30 minutes. However, I didn't want to make the same walk after dark. The Avenida Arcos de Bel\u00e9n looked fine, as did Av. Balderas. Calle Luis Moya might be o.k., but I wanted to stay away from the areas near Mercado San Juan and east to Eje Central 3 (San Juan de Letr\u00e1n) after dark. We took a cab back after dinner at Restaurante El Huequito in Centro, and it was only $160 MXP. There is a cluster of ATMs at Banamex on the corner with Balderas; various economical restaurants plus one upmarket one; a good bakery, a farmacia and various small grocery stores within a 2-block walk. The Ciudadela Artesanias Mercado is 2 blocks away. Mercado San Juan of specialty foods, about 8 blocks. The Hotel Pal will house us again when we stay in Mexico City.", "Date": "March 3, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Pal", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g150800-d812955-Reviews-Hotel_Pal-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">73 Arcos de Belen Avenue</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Mexico City</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Mexico</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "812955", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/09/53/bf/mexico-city.jpg"}}
