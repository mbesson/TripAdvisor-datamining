{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Will not recommend... We booked the Holiday Package, which includes 5 nights in a Deluxe Pool View Room. We made reservations for a room with a king sized bed, however, upon arriveal, we were told it's not available and we had to take a room with 2 single beds. On the next day, we were moved to a room with a king sized bed, however, due to availability, it did not have a Pool View, instead, the balcony faced the back of some hut. Also, this room did not have a TV remote and the safe was broken. On the 3rd day, we were awakened at 5 am by a terrible stench and had asked the front desk to check it out on our way out. When we returned that evening, the odor was milder but still there, so we asked the front desk if they found the reason for the smell and were told that maintaince had looked at it but he did not say what the problem was and is not in the building at the time. We switched rooms again and were placed in a larger room, still no Pool View, also missing a bedside table. The room was right across from their restaurant, which featured live music that starts in the evening and continues well after midnight, so the noise was terrible. Oh yeah, and the Tropical fruit in the room upon arrival promised on the website was received on the 4th day, not that we would've eaten it anyway since most of the fruits were kind of stale. Overall, not a good experience and will not stay at this hotel again.Pros: -convenient location, friendly staff-Spa was pretty good-beautiful garden and poolCons: -very run-down and dirty (all three rooms that we stayed in had nasty showers)-inefficient staff (have to call room serice at least twice before they show up with our requested item each time)-no free internet service (costs about $10USD for each hour)", "Date": "Oct 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR646084792", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "ChristineinKL"}, {"Content": "Awsome Experience Kuta Paradiso Hotel was an awsome experience for a holiday. Travelling in a group of 10 ladies we stayed at Kuta Paradiso for 8 nights which we found wasnt long enough as we all felt as though we hadnt even touched the service for shopping and day tours and things to do!! Although we were not all lined up together in our rooms we all had magnificent views of the pool (which you can basically swim all the way around) and off the ocean. The pool was just amazing and it even had sports in which you could entertain yourself with like volleyball, basketball and the main attraction the BAR :) The cocktails were really yum and the staff were very friendly. The hotel accomadation price was reasonable and i think it cost us a total of $400 Australian for our entire stay which included breakfast daily. The hotel was also upgraded on security and as you know the bombings are always a scare but it made you feel more secure entering and exiting the hotel with security at the front gate with scanning devices and mirror devises if you ever came in a taxi to the front of the hotel or even in your tour bus. The rooms were really enjoyable and were a very comfortable stay. Most of all the staff made it such an enjoyable stay and were very friendly and helpfull. I would definately go back to this hotel and the other 9 ladies would too.

Clean and lovely hotel Visited Kuta with my mum this month and we were very impressed by how friendly the people in Bali were. This was the same case for the staff in the Kuta Paradiso. They were very friendly (all spoke English) and the service was very efficient - our toilet was blocked on the last day and was fixed immediately (I was impressed). The pool area is lovely although I think the chairs on the pool side should perhaps be updated (nothing major though). The only downside about this hotel is that it isn't beachfront but we were 'teased' with the sound of the ocean which was obviously very close by.Security is very high in this hotel - bags are checked on entry (which is reassuring considering the history in Kuta). There are shops, bars and restaurants within 5-10 mins of walking from this hotel. All in all we were impressed with this hotel. The only thing I would probably do is to ask for a room with a better view - eg sea or perhaps just one that faces the pool.

We have always felt that although the hotel is reasonably nice and has an excellent location, there is far too much focus on getting the money out of the guest's pockets. Everything is charged and negotiating anything has turned out to be simply impossible, which gives the hotel a rather greedy image.Worst example was this summer where we had booked a family room for a five day stay with our three children. Due to an emergency we were unable to actually arrive on the scehduled date. The Paradiso management insisted that it was impossible to reimburse or in any otherway compensate for this fact - costing us hundreds of dollars.

Parts of hotel was under renovation and hence, not everything was open. The hotel has a open-air concept and hence, it is not air-conditioned except in some restaurants and in your rooms. Hence, it can be hot and stuffy at times.The low rating wasn't so much that the hotel was barely OK but what happened during check-out. Since I booked on the Internet in US dollars, the hotel converted my USD Internet rate to Indonesian Rupiah at a rate of 1 USD to 10000 IDR when the prevailing exchange rate was more 1 USD to 8500 IDR. Hence, with the hotel's exchange rate, they profited about 20% on top of the expected room rate. I complained but they said that was their rate and I didn't have a choice and they wouldn't let you pay in USD cash to avoid the exchange rate either.I checked into Hard Rock Cafe and Westin Hotel next during my Bali stay and both hotels were honest in using the current exchange rate.

This is definitely NOT a five-star hotel as mentioned in all their advertising. This is a 3 star at the most - charging 5 star prices.We booked a suite as the pictures on their website and many others of a suite at this hotel has an ocean view and looks fantastic. This was so NOT the case - we arrived really late at night and were led to a dingy room at the side of the hotel overlooking an adjacent bar. There was no view to speak of, there was a huge rat/mouse living in the room and the bar next door had 'live' music until the early hours of the morning. The overall look of the room was run-down and old.We stayed in the room one night and complained the next day. We asked for the suite we had seen online - it was empty so they showed us the room but it took a few hours for them to track down someone who could authorise for us to move. In the end we paid an extra US$12 per night on top of the already exorbitant US$295 per night we were paying.Admittedly the room we moved to was great because the view was as the pictures online suggested - breathtaking. But apart from the view the room itself was looking its age - looks like they haven't maintained the furnishings or decor at all since it was built.Also note that this is not a beachfront hotel.Luckily we had only booked for 3 nights or we would not have stayed after the first night. But found out a few days later that they had charged us twice for the stay - to the cost of some US$900. It took over a week to sort this out and with conversion rate costs as they are - cost us nearly AUD$100 to sort their mistake out. Overall a rather disappointing start to our holiday. Luckily every other place we stayed at in Bali was as expected or even better than expected.It is just annoying that there are some hotels in Bali (like this one) that insist on charging the same price they have always charged - regardless of the fact that their hotels are getting older and are not being maintained.
