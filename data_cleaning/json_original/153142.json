If I have to find some negatives, it would be the hard beds and inconsistent Wi-Fi. We had to get several username/password cards to keep up with the internet connection, but really who needs the internet when you have this resort! Also, while we loved breakfast and lunch each day, some less formal dinner options would be nice. All of the dinner restaurants are formal (even the 'casual' one is formal, really) and we would prefer to have the option of more laid-back, simple food in the evenings. We canceled our last dinner reservation and ordered room service. Sometimes you just want some hot wings and french fries! Or steak that isn't smothered with sauce. But, to each his own. My husband and I are not fancy people, so to speak, and gourmet meals every night are not our cup of tea. It certainly won't deter us from returning, however.

Great drinks - the real thing with good alcohol! There is a lot of variety to choose from on menus and especially at breakfast in the Spices restaurant. The Palazzo restaurant also very tasty.The Deck restaurant is very busy at lunch but worth waiting for the shrimp burrito. Thank god it's open till 18:00 because we had to grab snacks here in the late afternoon as our restaurant reservations weren't until 10:00!!! I usually eat late but this was so ridiculous we actually fell asleep waiting to eat one night! There is no buffet at supper time - this was not missed by us but some people really want one. Other problems: Oriental restaurant just not up to par with the rest of the hotel with super salty, flavour lacking food (I've realized oriental food in Latin America just doesn't cut it for me but thought this could be the one place that could do it right). If you're on the first floor the noise from rooms above is not conducive to sleeping in late. Also there really isn't anything exciting to do in the evening and the live music was enough to put you to sleep.

The rooms are very nice and are situated in several small two-story buildings with open courtyards, which gives this resort a nice boutique feel. We requested an interior building, so had no issue with noise from neighboring resorts. The grounds are well maintained. The pools are nice, temperature was perfect. The white sands beach is beautiful. We enjoyed all of the restaurants and Palazzo was our favorite. The liquor is top shelf, from Vodka, Tequila, Scotch, etc. Make sure to email your reservation times about a week ahead. We just said we'd like to try all of the restaurants at 7:30 and had no problem. The \"Baja Fis Tacos\" at the Deck for lunch were awesome. Ask for a margarita made with 1800 Tequila and Grand Marnier - Fantastic. The staff all work incredibly hard to make everyone happy, we always bring dollars for tipping, these people truly deserve it. If you're looking for people with bullhorns yelling at everyone to get-up and play beach volleyball, this isn't the place. If you're looking for great service, a place to relax on the beach and have great drinks brought to you, this is the place. My wife enjoyed the yoga class every morning, as well. Playa del Carmen was an easy 20 minute walk and we then we walked the beach back. I'm sure there's all the typical mainstay clubs in Playa, should you want to dance, do tube shots, etc. Only a couple of minor complaints: I'm sure they have contracts with one beer distributor, but it sure would be nice to have greater variety of Mexican beers beyond Modelo and Corona. The one other item was the New Age music that was live almost every night, it wasn't awful, but it sure gets repetitious. How about some variety? These are really only minor.

We were a little sceptical about an 11hour flight for a weeks vacation but to be honest we have had a very relaxing time. Is it perfect? Well no BUT it tries very hard. There are some pros and some cons PROs - the staff and service pool side is very friendly The room we stayed is was really nice (we transferred from block 31 to block 22 as the noise from the services was constant and started early) The staff were very efficient and helped us with no problem. The food varied from ok to excellent - the quality varies, so do your research and book early The drinks are high end and generous The view and beach are spectacular -even on inclement days from a cabana there is plenty to see CONs Breakfast starts from 7am. You need to be seated by staff and depending when you go there can be a very long wait. That said you can have coffee or champagne while you do - now that's good!!! The speciality restaurants are not 5 star. The most disappointing for us was the Palazzo. There is something strange lost in translation from Italy to Mexico. The Grill was good but go easy with the salt. We also tried the dinner show; my other half was not keen but you have got to give it a chance and if nothing else it adds colour to the recollections you will have about your trip. we laughed at the miming to Madonna's \"Vogue\" and those male dancers were in quite a frenzy. That said the service and food on that evening were ok. My final con would be speed ( and of course this is probably my problem) this whole place is quite slow. I guess you need to really let go of your own everyday schedule and allow yourself to slow down, otherwise you may be driven crazy. So in all a great break, I am typing this on our last day and we will be at the chefs table tonight for $500 for 2.

Top 5 pros: The food ranged from just above average to excellent. The Grill on the beach was ok, but the more creative restaurants - Las Ventanas and Palazzo - featured very high quality fish and steak dishes that really satisfied. From interesting amuse bouches to unusual desserts (olive ice cream, anyone?) the meals were varied, cooked appropriately (I like my steak rare) and almost universally successful. The service is very hard-working and friendly; it's not five-diamond quality in the restaurants by any means, and the servers make a lot of elementary mistakes. But if you can look beyond that and appreciate the fact that they are committed and attentive, you'll enjoy meeting and chatting with the service staff. Service by the pool is slow - better off going to the bar for your drinks. The bedrooms are clean, the beds are comfy and the TVs have HDMI inputs for all you computer fans. The turndown service was erratic and often too late. The resort grounds are well-maintained and designed. Although compact there is a feeling of space, and the beachfront is white sand and blue ocean that's safe for swimming. There are several pools and hot tubs scattered throughout the grounds, making it easy to find a secluded spot. Finally, the drinks are generous and of the highest quality. Beware the pina coladas, they actually have rum in them! Cons: The biggest, without a doubt, is the awful, awful 1980's saxophone music that they play in some areas of the resort ALL the time. Seriously, who wants to listen to Careless Whisper on the alto-sax ten times in one vacation? Get Spotify already, and put something else on! Another thing to be aware of - not really a con, just to be aware of - is that the restaurants need a reservation each night. This is difficult for newcomers to the resort. I suggest booking Palazzo, the best of the restaurants, in advance. One problem that the designers did not consider apparently is that the courtyards which the rooms face. They echo noisily during the day when the maids and concierge are working, and the walls seem very thin so daytime naps should be restricted to the pool! The only other thing I can think of is that your expectations may be enhanced by the price and the Five Diamond award. I think the resort falls a little short in some ways and that can be frustrating, but overall the experience is very good and made for an enjoyable and fun vacation.", "Date": "March 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brooklyn, New York, United States", "Title": "\u201cSeek out Royal Hideaway\u201d", "Author": "ATallDrink", "ReviewID": "UR125249892", "Content": "Went to Royal Hideaway for a friends wedding weekend. Overall, an amazing trip and a great resort that I would recommend to anyone seeking a quiet, relaxing all-inclusive resort with a fantastic staff and a gorgeous beach. I'll break down the pros and cons. PROS: - Guests are greeted by Bellhop who escorts you into lobby and brings you a hot towel and a glass of champagne. -Incredibly accommodating and friendly staff. In particular,Alex, the Activities Director, who served ice cream from a cart poolside and greeted everyone with a smile and suggestion of activities for the day. (I recommend Ocean Kayaking.) - Hotel grounds, restaurants and rooms are immaculate - Sumptuous bathrooms with jacuzzi tub, separate shower, marble vanity with double sinks -Instead of one large hotel building, rooms are divided into three story villas, with about 12 rooms and a concierge for each villa. -Beautiful, pristine white sand beach - Two large pools, a smaller \"quiet\" pool, three hot tubs. Fantastic. - All inclusive aspect makes it much easier to relax and not worry about having your wallet or how much anything costs. You can swill champagne and order room service guilt free! - No kids, teenagers or anyone else loud or annoying. Except at the resort next door. CONS -Food is good, but not great. I would be inclined to call it \"faux gourmet\" -Our room was located on the edge of the hotel property, overlooking a fence and a large black tarp hung in the hotel grounds next door. - Pillows were very small. I expected king size pillows for the king size bed. - The Dinner Show offered by the hotel is a second rate Cirque du Soleil meets a dance review. Not worth your time. -Hotel grounds/landscaping feels a bit contrived. They have the feel of a Disney Hotel, not a 5 star resort.

My husband and I travel to Mexico at least 20 times per year on casual mini vacations. The bad about this resort..... I feel so inclined to write this review...

However all but 6 chairs have books, magazines, lotions, and other personal belongings on them.... Are you serious it's 7:15am? So if I wanted to sleep in today that would be a NO CHAIR situation.

Just ask) We like to tip on vacation when we recieve great service. We did not tip last night at our 10:30pm Italian reservation because the service was poor and slow ( I had to ask for water 3 times and we had to wait for 15 minutes to order even though there were only 3 tables...why make people wait until 10:30 at night to eat hen you have so many open tables???) The waitstaff and bartenders at pool and late night area work very hard to please you!! Rooms and resort is very outdated.

It is also the first resort of its kind to receive the AAA Five-Diamond Award, and it\u2019s easy to see why when you step onto the property. Upon arrival, champagne & relaxation begin to flow. We were greeted with a cool fresh scented hand towel and a bubbling glass of champagne. There is no registration desk. We simply were invited to sit on a couch, relax, and enjoy our champagne, while the staff checked us in. As I looked around the lobby I was reminded again why this is one of my favorite hotels. It\u2019s full of classic ambiance, gorgeous flower arrangements, chandeliers, marble floors, and beautiful oil paintings, this not like any other hotel in Mexico. The rooms were laid out in two-story colonial Mexican-style villas, each with a private concierge (who can assist with other services, such as dinner reservations, tours, cultural excursions, deep-sea fishing, golf, private tennis lessons, motorized water sports, spa and salon services, car rentals, laundry and dry cleaning and more.) All rooms had a complimentary beer and soda minibar, Bvlgari toiletries, double marble sinks, a separate shower stall, whirlpool tub, Bose sound systems with iPod docks, LCD flat screen TV and large walk in closets with bathrobes. There was plenty to do, or do nothing at all at this resort; With a fitness center, basketball, bocce ball, horseshoes, tennis, SCUBA lessons, sailing and cooking classes, kayaking, boogie boarding, windsurfing and aqua aerobics in the cascading infinity pool which overlooked the beach. The beach never felt crowded and we never had a problem securing a beach bed. Waiters catered to us like we were royalty by the pool and on the beach. The service here was spectacular. At lunch time we would dine at The Deck, a casual bar and grill located right on the ocean. The menu had a huge variety of meals but our favorite always seem to be the chicken tenders with chipotle mayonnaise. At night there were 6 gourmet restaurants to choose from. All require reservations, are a la carte and have a dress code of casual elegance. The concierge will help you with the reservation and it\u2019s my advice to make reservations for your entire stay shortly after arrival. For the foodies the Chef\u2019s Table experience is accompanied by fine wine pairings and takes place in a private dining room with very limited seating. While this wonderful culinary experience is not included ($150 per person), it is truly worth it for those who love food and wine. They also offer 24 hour room service, which we were very thankful for after a night out at Coco Bongo Disco just a short cab ride away. Royal Hideaway\u2019s attention to detail and emphasis on customer service was apparent throughout our stay. If you\u2019re looking for an all-inclusive property that truly delivers on luxury, Royal Hideaway is the ideal choice for you.

My lodging stays have run the gamut from high end hotels, condos, eco-huts and a few all-inclusives. I stayed at the Royal for business about 5 years ago so we went to the Royal for a little R&R and I also wanted to be close to Playa Del Carmen. I have to say that the Royal is a very nice place to stay with a few exceptions. The food is great for an all inclusive. The breakfast is great with a great choice of fresh fruit. They also have bacon eggs etc which were pretty good as well. The lunch is served from a menu so there are many choices. We did not have dinner at the Royal because we always go to town for dinner. That's just us though. The rooms at the Royal are a little small and not quite up to par as some of the newer resorts, but they are adequate. I think they need to be updated. The grounds are very well kept and some of the palms are tall, old and beautiful. The beach at the Royal is beautiful although sometime crowded. Its nice to be in Playacar as well because I can go for a run around the loop and be outside instead of the Gym. There is also a Starbucks across the street. :-). You can also walk to Playa from the hotel, about 15 minutes to the south end of 5th Avenue. I also like the mix of Americans, South Americans and Europeans which means the hotel caters to everyone, not just North Americans. But, I would say the best thing about the hotel is they have some of the very best and happiest employees I have ever seen in Mexico. That means the owners and managers of the resort really care about who works for them. Unfortunately, that cannot be said for many of the resorts in Mexico. That makes me want to go back to the Royal and support this hotel. The only complaint I would have is the age demographic was slightly higher than us. People were certainly older for the most part and it did make the resort a little \"sleepy\" which for this trip to Playa, was perfect.", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gatineau", "Title": "\u201cOn our way back this firday for the 3rd time, wanted to know if anyone\u201d", "Author": "Diane P", "ReviewID": "UR124873374", "Content": "Hi all, did anyone get asked to provide proof of health insurance when entering the country", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Islamorada", "Title": "\u201cLovely time\u201d", "Author": "IslamoradaUMCanes", "ReviewID": "UR124806961", "Content": "My husband and I just returned from a wonderful 5 night stay at the Royal Hideaway.

You should pay a big price for an Hotel but you will never find perfection; this is a reality. But some always try to reach perfection. The Royal Hideway Playacar is one of them. Some hotels try to make a show by being big, luxuous, tinsel but the staff and the food are just average. At Royal Hideaway Playacar, the emphasis is to serve you as a VIP, nothing less. If you are looking for a quiet hotel (no children there), excellent services, great food, and to be near the amazing Playa del Carmen, you should consider this resort as the best choice. My wife and I had made many trips before (all in resorts of 4.5* or more, and cruise ships too) and we can assure that The Royal Hideway Playacar is on top of the list. They make you feel important; not as a fancy client but as people who are there to forget everything and let them helping you to relax and to be be completly satisfy. The check in make you feel important (thanks to Antonio, Yanine and Melissa), the bellboys were very helpful (thanks to Bogart and a special thought for Alvaro that is a real gentleman). Our Concierge was always available and she answered more than we were expected to(Carolina, you were fantastic). At the pool/beach area, everybody works hard; Alex you are always running to serve all the people. We could say the same for the waiters and all the staff everywhere in this resort. Palazzo and Azia restaurants were the best for us, for both food and ambiance. Umberto was our waiter three times; what a nice guy! The room was always clean, the same for the lobby area and restaurants. Breakfast buffet was stunning for a \"small\" resort. Lunch time was the best (At the deck) we met becausein other resorts we usually found very little choise but here the choice is wide and the service still quick and courteous. Maybe We should say that sometimes we felt bad about seeing the staff running and running. But they kept smiling and stay polite in despite of hard work. Because nothign is perfect, we found (as any whiners people lol) 4 minor points to be fixed (but the rest is so wonderful that we would eb in bad faith to insist on those points): 1- Repetitive music at the pool and also at the Spices restaurant (breakfast). 2- Regarding the fact that most of the people quit the beach/pool area before 4PM, there is no bar elsewhere where we could take a drink before 6pm. So, as many people, after showers, we dressed for dinner but we not able to take any apperitif before 6pm except by going on beach area (most of restaurants are on the opposite side - Lobby area) 3- The doors of each room are very noisy when people close them (echo); cushioning should be fixed on doors frame 4- There are a lot of seagulls on the pool edge, each day. That is unpleasant. Is there a way to resolve this problem? Anyway, we received so much touches from the staff that those points are non signifiants compared to our satisfaction. Royal Hideway staff... You were simply WONDERFUL so that it was very emotive for us to quit the resort, in particular towards Alvaro (bell boy), Carolina (Concierge), Alex (speedy Gonzales) and Umberto (waiter-Palazzo).

The real kicker was that we had initially asked for a suite that was specifically NOT next to the resort next door -- we and our travel agent emphasized this request strongly. When we were shown our room we were so close to the adjoining resort that we could literally see into their pool area. We were kept awake by the party and loud music that played well into the wee hours of the morning. (We had been warned of the adjoining loud resort from a posting by a few people on Trip Advisor)...We consequently had a sleepless night. We asked our concierge first thing the next morning to find us a new room. Unfortunately, it took a face-to-face with the assistant manager later in the afternoon to get any results. He did a nice job under pressure to get us into another suite on the quiet side of the building. It was like our holiday had started over afresh! It was as if we were in a different resort -- the one we had read about with the glowing reviews! Now the good news.

Kudos to Reyes and Leonardo. The meals we had at Spices (Mexican) were authentic, well made and very tasty. The breakfast buffet was also very well done with Mexican dishes mixed in with an egg station, lots of fresh fruits, pastries and fresh squeezed juices.

They are especially eager poolside:) For those of us who are accustomed to doing things on our own, it's quite nice to have someone notice that I'm looking for something, and offer it:) I visited for five days with my family, and we were a group of ten. The restaurants had some difficulty seating us all at the same table, so we normally split into two groups. No biggie. We visited at the beginning of January, 2012, which seemed to be just past the Holiday rush. The resort was well-attended but not overcrowded. The food in all the restaurants was excellent. The breakfast buffet at Spices was extremely varied, with a mix of Mexican and American favorites. Since this was the only restaurant open for breakfast, it's especially nice that several hot items were different each day. With the assistance of the concierge we made all our dinner reservations on the first day, and then just had to show up. Each evening a reminder was slid under our room doors, telling us where and when we were dining that evening. The concierge was exceptionally helpful. She helped us plan a day trip to the nearby Mayan ruins with my 95-year-old cousin. All went wonderfully and my cousin was able to virtually see and do everything there. There are several opportunities to swim with dolphins in the area, and our concierge recommended one experience, which turned out to be the highlight of my trip!! There are two reasons I did not give the Royal Hideaway a five-star rating. First, we were in Villa 28, which is on the edge of the property, bordered by another resort. The first night I couldn't sleep because of music which was so loud it felt as if I were in the first row of a rock concert. When I phoned the reception to ask where the music was coming from, I was told it was from the Royal Hideaway's own club, which faced my room. I was also told that the club would close around midnight, so I just waited for the noise to stop. After the first night, I did occasionally hear some music, but nowhere near as loud as on the first night. Certainly in this particular villa, on the edge of the property, we could clearly hear the activities from the neighboring resort, which is only separated by a fence. All the resort properties in Playacar seem to border on each other in this manner, so if peace and quiet are very important, ask for a room in the interior/center of the grouping of villas. The second reason for a four-star rating is the poor communication between the various service entities at the Royal Hideaway. If someone told you they would bring you something, they did so without fail. However, if they said that they would pass it on to another department, it just never happened. There were numerous instances of this miscommunication. For example, the concierge said she would speak to \"maintenance\" about a lamp in my room which didn't light. Nobody came. The following day I asked the housekeeper, who promptly went to an adjacent empty room and brought me another lamp. Perhaps the communication was worst amongst the various people who work at the dive shop. They clearly get some sort of commission for selling you one of the extra services/trips they offer, and are extremely eager to speak with you. Unfortunately, one person will give you information which is different from the next. For example, I was told that a trial diving experience would happen at noon at the pool. Just show up. I even went to the dive shop prior to noon (as one of them had suggested), to tell them I'd be at the pool, waiting. Nobody with diving gear ever showed up at the pool. Around a quarter-after-noon, I went to the dive shop again, and was told that the diving trial that day was at the next resort (which is apparently owned by the same company). I was then wisked over to the adjacent resort and had my five-minute diving trial. Earlier I had seen two other guests poolside who apparently were taken to the adjacent resort for this purpose, and even though I had told a dive shop employee I was waiting for the diving trial, nobody approached me. I didn't figure this out until afterwards, or I certainly would have asked the person who assisted the other two guests:) Overall, I would definitely visit the Royal Hideaway again. The negatives were minor, and definitely overshadowed by the overall experience.

We thoroughly enjoyed our time there and most of all, the people that work at this resort. There are so many wonderful people and I wish that I could remember everyone by name, but that would be impossible. Check-in and out was smooth and quick. We stayed in villa 26 which was perfectly located centrally to the beach and all restaurants. Our concierge was the most delightful person and always offering help in any way necessary. We encountered a very minor problem on the first morning (shower draining VERY slowly), which we brought to her attention and it was fixed immediately. Great service. Also any request for specific beverages in the room fridge were met and maintained for the week. Aileen made our restaurant reservations for the week and there were no problems at all. I realize now that I spent way too much time worrying about this prior to our visit. We never had any issue getting into any restaurant. And once you leave your work-mentality lifestyle behind you realize that it really doesn't matter what time you dine. We found every restaurant to be great. Only have one regret in regard to the restaurants and that is that we did not try the evening \"tasting menus\" until the last night. Each restaurant offers a taste of their finest or most popular (I think). We decided to try it on our last night and soon found out what we had missed during the week. We ate at Las Ventanas twice, trying the scallops in mole, sea bass, and the salmon, all wonderful. Every course deserves mention. Palazzo twice also, here with the tasting menu, just do it. You will not be disappointed, but you will be beyond stuffed at the end so beware. Azia 3 times and loved each time. Tried different things nearly every meal and never found anything that was less than impressive. These are true dining experiences and \"chopped champions\" on every plate. The presentations were beautiful and very impressive. The servers at all of the restaurants were true professionals. Not once did we have slow service nor did we ever feel rushed. Every dinner was paced perfectly and the attention that was paid to detail was fabulous. We appreciated the whole experience. And although the professional servers were intent on perfection for your experience, they were also friendly and willing to interact as much as you wish. Thanks to Eleazar, Lenin, Angel, and all at Spices for breakfast and lunch. We also experienced great beach service too. We never had to wait for anything or look for someone to take an order. They came around regularly, always checking to see if you needed anything. Bernandino was really great. And don't worry about finding chairs at either the pool or beach. At any time of the day you could find a great place to relax, shade or sun. Alex offered his help on the beach and by the pool every day. By the pool there was a special area set up where they offered different lunch selections each day (in addition to the restaurant offerings). These included a mexican food buffet, rib and chicken BBQ, seafood, and paella just to mention a few. The things we tried were very good. We loved the fish tacos and coconut ice cream at Spices for lunch. Unfortunately Spices was not open for the entire week during the evening. I can only imagine the exquisite Mexican food that we missed from there. Maybe next time. Evenings are a bit quiet but we enjoyed this and after a day in the sun we were not ready to burn the midnight oil. We did hear a Latin Trio one night that I wish would have been there every night! They were excellent!!!! This is a great place to relax and enjoy the surroundings. The grounds are beautiful and well attended to.

Checkin was quick and convenient as always. We tend to get there before official checkin time so we went and got lunch at the Deck. This is an excellent way to kick off you stay since you are right by the beach to take in the beautiful. Every time we arrive and get a first glimpse of the beach views it still amazes us. Our building concierge was Carolina and she was absolutely fantastic in helping us with anything and everything we needed. We quickly made reservations for the restaurants for the rest of our stay. We like to get these squared away as early as we can to make sure we don\u2019t have to worry about doing it later. The food is still as great as we can remember, but we were sad to see a couple of our personal favorites off a few menus. Nothing to worry about since they have a lot of great food across their menus. Our personal favorite restaurant is Palazo. It is their Italian restaurant and the decor and atmosphere of the restaurant are just right. Since it is on the third floor, you get a little bit of a better look over to Cozumel. Previously, my wife and I were not that found of the Grill. This restaurant is the Deck during the day and transformed after lunch into the Grill. Since the weather was a little cooler in the evenings, it was nice to be right by the beach with the open breezes flowing through the restaurant. Other times we had been at the hideaway, it was fairly warm at this restaurant in the evenings, so we usually skipped it. We will definitely not be doing that again since we really enjoyed this restaurant at this time of the year. Azia is another one of our favorites. The spring rolls are great with the sweet dipping sauce, a definite must have. We did not do the hibachi grill again because we like having a nice dinner just to ourselves, but also it seems like it takes a lot longer to get dinner up and going when people do that. In most cases, we are seated after people at the hibachi tables and finish dinner right about the time people are enjoying the cooking experience. Those at the hibachi tables do seem to be having a great time so they don\u2019t seem to mind the longer dinner. Just something to be aware of. During this visit, breakfast was offered buffet style with an omelet station or al a carte at Las Ventanas. Either place is great for breakfast, but we preferred to get breakfast quick to get out to the beach. Overall the food was right on par with what we expected with no complaints. We do like the ability of ordering any food they offer at the Deck for lunch poolside. Definitely checkout the jalapeno poppers or breaded chicken strips, they are a great snack poolside. The rooms are just as we remembered with a few updates. Previously I believe I had mentioned they should update their TVs. The hotel has responded with flat screen Samsung LCD TVs and a Pioneer docking station for iPhone & iPods. This was the perfect update to the rooms. My wife and I used the docking station almost every night while getting ready for dinner. One thing to be mindful of though, the rooms have marble floors and sound does travel very easy since their is not much to absorb the sounds coming from other rooms. We tried to watch the volume we played our music at to not disturb other guests staying by us. This was not the case one night in our room when our neighbor blasted their music. Not a big deal, but I am sure they would have turned it down had we complained. Its hard to stop someone from enjoying their good time though since we weren\u2019t try to sleep or anything. The service was outstanding as usual. We find it very hard to complain about anything when it comes to service because the staff works extremely hard to make anything and everything just right. We generally bring money to tip those helping us. I know it shows tax, tip, and gratuity is included in the price but the staff works so hard for us every time that a little extra does not go unnoticed or under appreciated. When it comes to anything you need while at the pool or beach, look no further than Alex or Christopher. I can honestly say that I saw Alex running around the property nonstop to get guest whatever they needed to make sure their experience was perfect. We got a chance to sit and talk with Alex before bingo and really enjoyed his enthusiasm for his job. I hope we get a chance to see him again on another trip, but I am sure with his outstanding work ethic, he will be work his way up through the ranks in other jobs. Christopher was always there asking if we needed anything and ready to lend a hand when we needed it. One of the beach lifeguards, Jesus, was great to talk to also. He always made sure we were taken care of everyday or he would find a way to take care of whatever it was we needed. Thanks Jesus! Our concierge Carolina was, as I mentioned earlier, fantastic! I fell ill while down there and required medical attention. She was pivotal in getting one of the local physicians from the hospital to our room. Without her quick response and expert knowledge, we would have been scrambling for help. With regards to falling ill, it was determined by the doctor that it was not due to food, but rather a bacteria in the seaweed. My wife and I had a lot of the same food to eat or shared a lot of our food as well, so we ruled out a food born illness very early on. The physician stated that this is common to those not exposed to it during this time of year. We did not spend much time in the ocean, but we did walk on the beach quite a few times. In a lot of cases, I would take a drink with me on this walk and believe it was from that. One day the waves were fairly larger than normal and there was a lot of splashing when the water would hit our legs. The water must have gotten in my glass during this walk and got me sick about 3 days later. Please do not worry about the food getting you sick, this is our 3rd trip here and the first time either one of us have gotten sick in the 5 times we have been in the region. Overall we are still in love with the Royal Hideaway! We were happy to see the updates in the rooms because we believed they were due to stay on par with the our high end all-inclusive resorts in the region. Staff was excellent as always and ready to jump over any hurdles to make sure your stay and experience are on par with other AAA five diamond resorts worldwide. Food was just as great as we had remembered with a few changes that were great as well. We always recommend this property for those people looking to get away to a great all inclusive that offers up an excellent service, food, and couples oriented vacation. We are still trying to plan our first trip with other couples we know because it is great to hang out with friends during the day but enjoy the evenings over a nice dinner with your spouse or partner.", "Date": "January 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cDisappointed will not return\u201d", "Author": "Kelley S", "ReviewID": "UR122814813", "Content": "We spent a week over Christmas at the Ritz Carlton Cancun and then three nights at the Royal Hideaway.

Don't get me wrong, if you walked into a room there, you would most likely be impressed. They are specious, well appointed and the bed is a dream! Where the resort falls short is the attention to small details. Rooms and furnishings, while handsome, show their age; for example, there was a small hole (~1cm) in the plaster around the telephone in the bathroom, the molding was slightly peeling away from the mirror and layers of paint were evident on all moldings. Another example - my room had the same cheap plastic toilet seat with the gap in the front that you see at the airport; a five star hotel would provide a full toilet seat. Food was good, certainly vastly superior to anything you'll find at other all inclusives, but not amazing. Where the resort truly comes through on its claim of five star status is in the quality of the staff. All were always helpful and friendly and made an effort to make your stay special. Unfortunately, I can't recommend the dive shop (Barrakuda Scuba). They kind of misrepresented how certain trips operated. I wanted to do the Cozumel dive and asked how long it took to get their and they told me 20 minutes, leading me to believe that we were taking their little boat straight across the channel!! Instead, we had to drive downtown to take the ferry across and then get on a dive boat to the reef (~2 hrs). I also asked if we would be back for lunch and she told me yes; we got back at ~5:00pm. They also encouraged my mother in law to sign a medical waiver that misrepresented her medical status because in their opinion her condition would not have been too much of a medical risk and for liability purposes she had to lie on the form or not go.

This resort is hands down the best resort on Playacar. We have stayed at the El Dorado Royale, Secrets, Riu Palace and Riu Playacar by comparison. RH offers outstanding service and food. The beach is well-maintained. This is a perfect place for couples. Here are a few tips. We like to use a private transfer from the airport. With a private transfer, you skip the many stops with a shared bus at the other hotels. The private drivers usually have an Escalade with plenty of room for the 45 minute drive to the hotel. It is well worth the extra few dollars and gets you to the sunshine faster after a long flight. Use the villa concierge for everything. Each villa as someone in the atrium to make your reservations and answer questions. They are a friendly face and ready to help. They seem to keep hours from around 8 am until 5 pm. We really enjoyed that our concierge was not another person trying to sell an excursion or time share. You should get to know your concierge on the first day. Also, you can't go wrong with any of the restaurants. We liked having breakfast overlooking the ocean each day, and then coming back for a balcony-area lunch. As for breakfast, you should make a special request for a latte. Otherwise, they are serving coffee. Also, there is a Starbucks one block off the resort. Ask your concierge for directions if you care to make that short walk for your wife in the morning. The resort offers food and drinks on the beach. It is a short walk of 10 yards or so to the bar. With a little flag, someone will bring you a drink if that walk seems too far. The guacomole is made fresh. That's a perfect snack in the afternoon with a drink. All the drinks are top shelf. For dinner, the food is some of the best. We never left the resort during our week because we enjoyed each of the restaurants. The dinner theatre was the only restaurant that was average, and that is to be expected when trying to serve several hundred at one time. I don't think we would go to the theatre next year because it naturally results in less conversation during the performance. Each of the restaurants is high end, and you will be eating ala carte with the option of great wine for an additional charge. You will find that everyone dresses to look their best (at least the women do!). The lounge chairs seemed to fill up faster around the infinite pool than the beach. We enjoyed the beach more, and especially the shade under the coconut trees. There is cabana help for the chairs and towels. They also have a canapy to cover two chairs for shade and privacy. Have the cabana amiga show you how to set up on the first day so that you're set for the week. This beach, of course, is as good as it gets just about anywhere in the world. The sand is white and soft. There are some smaller waves and roped off areas for swimming. The shoreline is generally busy with people walking the beach almost all day. The sail boat is available by reservation, but I was able to go out each day without having to wait for reservation times. The water activity tent will offer excursions as well. While we were there, we were with mostly Canadians, Americans and some British and Irish. We're told that the area is popular with Europeans in the summer months. Everyone was in a good mood and relaxed. It seemed that only my American neighbors decided to use the business center for the free internet access. I don't think that there was an expectation for tipping, although we did regularly. We typically tipped our servers a few dollars in the morning (a buffet breakfast), at lunch, and especially a bit more in the evening for great service. We also took care of our concierge at the end of the week. We also took care of our maids with a few dollars each day. They always cleaned the room while we were out, and then had the bed turned down while we were at dinner. They all made us feel welcome, and we tried to show our appreciation.

We limit our stays to small, adults-only resorts with good beaches. We read the reviews for Royal Hideaway and, despite some of the negative reviews re: food, decided to give it a try. THE GROUNDS: Immaculate, well-manicured and beautiful. Staff was constantly cleaning, picking up and making sure that everything looked nice. THE STAFF: Overall, the most friendly, efficient staff we have yet to encounter on any of our trips. They seemed genuinely happy to be working there and would go out of their way to try to fulfill any request. THE BEACH: Very big, spacious, clean and long. The water was warm and beautiful. Our only issue was that the lifeguard wouldn't let people put their chairs past a pole in the sand (which wasn't very close to the water at all). He said it was a safety issue, but his perch sat a good 15 ft. up in the air and was so far from the water that I doubt that any chairs beyond a certain point would obstruct his view or inhibit any possible rescue attempts. So much beach area, but everyone was stuck in one general area. THE ROOMS: Clean and accomodating. The AC was sufficient and the housekeepers did an excellent job of keeping the room clean. The only issue was that while the resort boasted a \"green\" initiative, we had to turn on the hot water in the sink and/or shower for a good 15 minutes before the water became luke-warm. I felt terrible wasting the water like this, but it was the only way we could get a warm shower. Also, as the room doors are situated in an octagon-like manner, we could hear every door slam, loud guest, etc. echo throughout the night. They need to put some type of door hinge that doesn't allow the doors to slam closed. I really don't think many guests were aware of just how loud (and wall-shaking) this behavior was. THE FOOD/RESERVATION SYSTEM: This is the area that needs the most improvement. As suggested, we made our entire week's reservations at the time of our arrival. The only time we got an 8:00 seating was on our last day. We were usually scheduled for 8:30 or 9:00. While this wouldn't seem to be such a big issue for many, the service at dinner was so slow that we didn't get served until a good half hour (or more) after we were seated. Each dinner took at least 1.5-2.0 hrs. from seating to finish. Oftentimes we finished dinner at 10:30 or after. On our anniversary we were bumped from our 8:30 time to 9:00. No biggie, but a couple we just met who just arrived at the resort as a complimentary upgrade after they bought a timeshare was seated at the 8:30 time. Can't help to think that we were bumped to accomodate them. How could they get an earlier time when they arrived 3 days after us and were only staying for 2 days? Christmas evening dinner was a bust. We had 8:00 reservations. We saw a couple walk in at 7:50 and immediately get seated. We tried before to come in a tad early and were turned away as it wasn't quite our time. Anyway, we weren't seated until 8:20. It took our waiter another 10 minutes to get our drinks and another 10 to give us our menus. We decided on what to order, but could not locate our waiter. We then saw him taking orders at the Chef's table (where people pay big $$ to enjoy a meal personally cooked by a chef). There must have been 12 people at the table and he was very busy. We patiently waited another 15-20 minutes and he was still in the Chef's table area. It was now approximately 9:15 and we haven't been able to place our order. We decided to leave and get room service instead as we had a flight that left the next morning and didn't have the time to spend 2+ hours on dinner. When we started to leave, management came up and offered to have us set at another restaurant, but we knew that this wouldn't mean we'd get seated or served any sooner. It was evident that they needed more servers. It wasn't the waiter's fault, but rather management's as they were understaffed at all of the restaurants. Also, we are not \"foodies\" by any stretch and can eat almost anything, but we found the food to be mediocre at best. Steaks were chewy and many of the selections were so \"gourmet\" that they simply didn't appeal to us. If you aren't into seafood or steak, your choices were severely limited. We wished that they had a small buffet to fall back on if you didn't want to go to a formal restaurant or sit in your room and eat from the limited room service menu. During our 7 days there we both said that we didn't have one really good meal. We have stayed at other resorts where you don't need a reservation and the system worked fine. I don't understand why RH can't try that method. While we enjoyed our stay, we wondered if we'd return. The ONLY thing that stopped us from saying \"yes\" is the restaurant/food issues noted above. If RH were to implement changes with this, we would definitely return.", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cPeaceful and clean\u201d", "Author": "V S", "ReviewID": "UR122188681", "Content": "I visited Nov. 13-17, 2011.

We will definitely be returning hopefully next Christmas time. In general, the staff are such genuinely hard working and nice people, I don't see how people can not, after indulging themselves in this luxury for a week, open their wallets and their hearts and share a couple of dollars now and then for their great service. We saw so many people who didn't and we honestly feel those people should be ashamed of themselves. Management, we understand that you read these reviews, please know you are lucky to have employees such as Alex at the pool, Ricardo at the grill, Roger the concierge, Fernando the omelet maker at Spices for breakfast, Fray the waiter at the pool, Veronica the hostess at Spices for breakfast, Chris the manager at The Grill, and Barbara at Bar Allegra. We did not have a bad meal. Everything exceeded our expectations, and everything was delicious. We ate at the Grill several times, although we ordered steak a few times Medium, and it came out Rare, and then we finally ordered it Well and it came out Medium....my suggestion would be just to order it Well to begin with. Spices for Breakfast was delicious. They have a nice spread with delicious french toast, as well as an omelet station. I would highly recommend having Fernando make you rancho rancheros. They sauce they have is truly out of this world. We ate at Palazzo, and everything was delicious. I had called the concierge before hand because it was my Dad's birthday, and they came out with a special piece of cake and sang him happy birthday, I didn't think they understood my request, but I was wrong! We tried to eat at Spices for dinner on Christmas Eve, but there was a special pre-fixed menu, and there was not anything on it that we all would eat, so we walked downstairs to the Grill and they were able to accommodate us. The Grill also had a pre-fixed menu, but it included steak and fish. Christmas Eve has two seating's for dinner, 7pm and 9pm. We also ate at Azia and was surprised at how good the food was. My parents and sister all had teppanyaki and I had rice noodles in a oyster sauce. Although the noddles weren't true rice noodles and was fettucini everything was delicious. Seriously, all the food we had was just delicious. We've been to many AI results, and this food was top notch compared to some. I have to say that service was incredible everywhere, and the resort was at full occupancy the last few days. The only issue we encountered was during breakfast when we had to wait for a table, even though there were plenty available. Pool service was fast and accurate, and the drinks were great. The rooms were smallish, but very due-able. We didn't spend a lot of time in the room, my sister and I shared a Kind size bed, and there was more than enough room for us. The bathrooms were clean, and included a separate toilet with door, and a separate bathtub. The shower was marble, but the water temperature was finicky. Make sure you put the cold water on first, then add the hot to your likely. Good water pressure, and the towels were extremely soft, and plentiful, we always had clean showers. We had a closet, but it wasn't walk in, my parents room, right next door, had a walk in, so I guess it depends on the lay out of the room. We had the villa (#31) closet to the pool area, and it really was great. We definitely would have been unhappy with a villa further away from this area. We didn't find that the noise from other hotels was bothersome, I'm not a good sleeper and the noise did not cause me trouble sleeping at all. When my parents were here in March, they said there was no night life. This trip, there was music every night at Bar Allegra, some nights were better than others. The only negative we have to say was that the gym was small. Only one elliptical, and 3 treadmills. I was up early every morning to get my work out in on the elliptical to make sure I'd get on it. Although there was never a wait when I wait, it would have been nice to see a couple more elliptical. There's a very nice gym room, but no low weight free weights, we could not find any 3 or 5 lbs.

The service was very good too and you wanted for nothing. All the restaurants took their time serving you which was great as in other places we had been to we were rushed with courses served straight after each other or, on two occasions, our starters and mains were served together! One of the highlights for me was the bicycles the hotel had for you to use. Every day we cycled to 5th Avenue for a spot of shopping and it was blissful. The resort was very quiet, however unfortunately the resorts in Playacar are very close together and the one next to us was rather loud. Luckily the music stopped before midnight so it wasn't really a problem. If you are looking for a relaxing holiday then this is definitely the place. If you are looking for a resort with constant entertainment then don't book here as you will be disappointed. That's not to say there isn't entertainment, as there is, it's just more refined. For example, one day there was a saxophone player by the pool for about an hour and every night there is live music in the piano bar.

Pro's= Beautiful beach, beautiful grounds, great location, beautiful views, comfortable bed, small villa type buildings, most of the staff was friendly however there were a few select that needed an attitude adjustment. Con's= Pools were not heated so it was too cold to use, some sort of \"mites\" in our bedroom (we had the two story model), room service food was not very good and VERY limited. A lot of noise at night. Here are some notables, now, if you had planned on using the spa, you might need to dip into your retirement account because they had the most expensive massage I have ever seen anywhere in the world. The exercise room was so hot that it was cooler to work out in the streets. Food, I want to talk about this for a minute. We had the most difficulty with this process. Before you even get to your room, they want you to make reservations for every night at what place you want. I dont understand the reservation portion of it as the resort was not busy at all, and there was no way to deviate from your reservation. Azia, seemed to be the better place. The fancy place upstairs was just, let's say, over blown and tried to be a 10 star establishment complete with attitudes. I understand some people liked it but 4 out of 10 did not. The evening place by the deck below spices (forgot name) was another one. Trying to be fancy and forgetting what is most important, taste. The food was so over cooked it was virtually inedible. The salt they added to everything was in such high volume, that I needed a tranquilizer to settle my heart after we ate what we could. The breakfast buffet upstairs is fine however, be prepared to wait. We didnt really care to wait for a buffett. If you want any type of eggs, get in line quickly. There is only one cook to make eggs and he can only mentally handle 2 people at a time. As you can see, we didn't really care for the evening dining experience that much as all restaurants had a formal attire only. Men can not wear fancy jeans, at all. Slacks or nothing and they will refuse to let you in. What we did is for $7.00 us or 70 pesos, (pay in pesos and get your money exchanged downtown, they resort is too expensive) we went to Play Del Carmen where you have a million choices of safe restaurants. We felt completely safe all the time there and finding a taxi (at the stations) to return home was super easy. There are so many places to eat that our heads spun. A favorite of ours that is also in Cancun is called \"La Parilla\" , You cant go wrong there, kitty corner from that is Casa Adelo which had the most remarkable Mexican food that we had the entire time we were there. There are also italian, french, american etc.... down there. So for us, we would eat breakfast and/or lunch and then go to town for dinner. The entertainment and environment was very exciting. The noise at the hotel was fairly difficult. Two loud resorts blasting music and yelling over the microphone on top of the local bands that the hideaway hires. If you are one of the unlucky to reside in one of the buildings close to the main building or the north end, you will enjoy many sleepness nights. If booking, make it a condition to be located on the south side, as close to the beach as possible. This is a bit more quiet for you. If we were going to play again, we might stay there, but we would look around first. a few tips. 1.) at lunchtime , spices (upstairs) is open but, nobody really knows about it. 2.) at the parasail tent on the beach, as a RH guest, you get free boogie board, kayak, and hobbicat sail boat. 3.) there are bikes you can use to ride around Playacar or ride them into town and walk them down 5th. 4.) There is no real mexican food so if you want authentic, go downtown. 5.) If you can physically handle it, go to Xplor. The zip lines were awesome and boating through the flooded cenotes was a blast. 6.) If you see towels on the chairs, dont assume somebody has that chair. The staff place them out there everyday for you. So if you see towels rolled up and no personal belongings there, it is open for you. 7.) Pool is cold and hot tub is warm at best. plan for that. 8.) internet can be sporadic. You get one connection. So if two of you want to use two devices, you will not be able to. One at a time only. 9.) there is a dvd list up at the main office if you want a free dvd to watch. 10.) pay in pesos, exchange down town.

Yes, the serves are small/gourmet style, but this is the norm if you wish to sample the menu from appetizers to mains, to desert and cheese and crackers etc. We thought the breakfast was very good, but having only one egg station made it quite slow, unfortunately. Beach drinks service was a little slower than we are accustomed to, but one can get rather spoilt in these places. Note that children under 18 are not permitted, but this is not one of the 'hookup' type resorts like others in the area. The activities were included in the all-inclusive price. The rooms were excellent. It was nice to have a hotel where the TVs actually worked, although for the price paid, some extra options like HBO should be included. We also went to the dinner theatre on one night. The show was a bit cheesy but not bad. Once again, the food was quite good. I'm not sure if it was actually worth the upper level all-inclusive fee, but the bit of extra pampering was nice.

Within the hour, we were at the resort... Unfortunately, it was not straight to the beach--we arrived just in time for a downpour! No worries though... after a glass of champagne, we decided to risk getting wet, and were escorted to our room by a bellman with a very LARGE umbrella. We took a minute to get settled to our liking, and then sat down with our concierge to have the property explained to us. We had no problems booking reservations within the two hour window that was convenient. I'm going to break the rest of the review down, or this will be a novel: PROPERTY: extremely well groomed and landscaped, with freshwater pools meandering through the property. There was one area that had a plant that I despised the smell of, but I suppose that's a matter of taste, or scent, as it may be. Almost all areas were immaculately kept; however, the smell of mildew was so strong in the Bar Allegria that we couldn't have a drink there, sadly. Overall, there wasn't really a good \"bar\" per se. We weren't drinking all that much on this trip, but I can see how this would be a disappointment to many. ROOM: We were in the second block of rooms along the right of the resort, facing the ocean. We had a lovely view of the sea. Room was rather smaller than expected, but beautifully and comfortably furnished. Had a roomy bathroom with a smallish shower stall (one at a time, folks!) but a nice tub, and a separate WC (soooo nice). Closet opened off of bath and was pleasantly roomy. I do love to be able to fully unpack on vacation. The veranda was nice, but not at all private. We were on the ground floor, and had no problems with insects as others had mentioned. Only downer: quite noisy from the property next door until at least 11 at night. Boyfriend could fall asleep, I could not. POOL: We only used the main infinity pool and the hot tubs right there; fabulous. Be careful--if it's breezy, it's quite easy to get burned as you look out on the ocean and the spray from the edge of the infinity pool mists you to keep you cool! Also love the lounges off to the left side with full sun cover--where we spent the rest of our trip, all day every day, after our first day burn! BEACH: Lovely, with a caveat. I had not realized when booking just how close the other properties were to each other in Playa. Oh my. The whole feeling of the Royal Hideaway is that its this exclusive little luxury property in paradise--spending time on the beach ruins changes the feeling to exclusive little luxury property in the middle of millions of tourists. We stuck to our \"beach beds\" by the pool so as not to ruin the ambiance; the noise of the ocean warded off the sounds of the other resorts, and the area in front of RH stayed clear and peaceful for the most part. RESTAURANTS: Before I breakdown the restaurants, as mentioned in other posts, the evening restaurants are open on some sort of rotating schedule, not all six every night. Additionally, breakfast was only served in Spices, and lunch at the Deck and at Spices. The Wines offered on the AI plan were ok, not bad enough to bother ordering a special bottle, but not good enough to write home about either. The Deck-This was the first restaurant we braved our way too during the storm. In better weather, there was plenty of al fresco dining, but the sun was so strong (and we are so fair), we stayed inside but could still enjoy the sea views. Food was good, not great. I wouldn't recommend being adventurous here. There was an attached bar that also served the pool--delicious drinks. Spices-At night, this is a VERY GOOD Mexican restaurant. In the morning, it is a good but rather half-hearted effort. There is a buffet breakfast--it's not that there is anything lacking other than luster. Without the live omelet station, it would be quite poor. That said, what WAS there was tasty and I never left breakfast hungry. One caveat: I had not seen mention in anyone's review of the very long painting along the back wall, and thought fit to warn you about it, because it was a bit weird. At first glance, it is a bunch of lovely paintings of family groups. When you look closer, it is actually a guide to races--as in, the father was listed as one race, the mother another, and then their child was listed as the resulting race. It was...unusual to an American. Another traveller told us this was normal in Mexico, so take from that what you will, but hopefully your eyes won't bulge like ours did when we realized what the labels meant! Azia-decent food. Originally, we had made reservations to eat here twice. We decided once was enough. Las Ventanas-Really delicious the first night. Everything is in tiny little portions, but you don't leave hungry. When we cancelled our second Azia night, we chose to eat at Las Ventanas again, but it wasn't as good the second time around. The homemade ice creams are delish. Palazzo-We were SHOCKED when Palazzo was our ABSOLUTE favorite restaurant. I never expected the best Osso Bucco I've ever had to be served to me in Mexico. It was only open the one night on our trip, sadly. SO SO good. All in all, we had a lovely trip. It was just what we needed, and we returned from our trip completely refreshed. Would we stay there again? If the property were all by itself on an island, probably. I think the next trip we take, we may look for a resort that is a little more isolated from other resorts. Additionally, while it was VERY nice, it was only a small step up from a 4* resort like the Now Jade (quality of room furnishings, fine dining restaurants, SERVICE), but not quite to par with a true 5* like the Maui Four Seasons. Of course, it is also more than half the price, so it is an excellent deal! But I think for our next trip to Mexico, I'd like to keep pursuing that ideal.", "Date": "December 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Trenton, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cPretending to be a 5 Star Resort\u201d", "Author": "TheSentinal", "ReviewID": "UR121911754", "Content": "Stayed at the resort in November........This is a resort that is pretending to be a 5 Star property.........the place is beautiful....well maintained and ultra clean.........the service staff is outstanding.........our waiter for breakfast Reyes.....was excellent every day.........food was also very good..................pool and beach were excellent..........now the little things................they make a big deal about their reservation system.......but it is very rigid......example......one night i witnessed something incredible........2 couples arrived late.....9:00am and wanted to eat...........the night manager for the resort told them that they could not accomodate them becasue they did not have a reservation..........after some hard words and raising of voices .........the manager relented......i witnessed this twice........our nickname for the manager was \"senior knucklehead\"............twice i tried to change my dinner reservation to another restaurant on the property......twice i was told ..........5:00 or 10:00pm............i got the impression that perhaps if i reached into my wallet the desired time would have been available........our villa had a concierge..........girl never smiled...........her name was \"miss miserable\"..............each room comes with nice bathrobes.........mine did not fit...........i am an extra large...........i requested a larger size......they said all they had were large..........yet i saw at the resort the week i was there........men wearing robes that had to be 3XXX.................finally the place is dead at night............we made the best of it since i smoke cigars after dinner...... would i go back....yes...........but with some changes............", "Date": "December 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Canada", "Title": "\u201cPleasant but not exceptional- 3.5/5\u201d", "Author": "455kate", "ReviewID": "UR121893256", "Content": "My husband and I went last week for a pre Christmas break.

This was our second time to this hotel.\u00a0 We used Cancun Valet to drive us from the airport to the hotel and back again. They were great. Excellent communication, on time, courteous--everything you would want from a transport company. I had the reservation in place for weeks. We ended up catching an earlier flight and I emailed Hugo from Cancun Valet while I was on the flight to Cancun to let him know that I was arriving 4 hours earlier than we had reserved. He emailed me back right away to let me know I wasn't to worry--they would be there, no problem. I was very impressed. Armando was our driver. He answered any questions we had, got us everywhere safely and was even five minutes early to pick us up from the hotel to the airport. We would definitely use Cancun Valet again. We honeymooned at Royal Hideaway 8 years ago. The high quality of the hotel is still the same. I would say that some parts are even better than before. The infinity pool and beach/pool cabanas are definitely great additions. We were upgraded to a duplex suite and it was breathtaking. The nicest hotel room I've ever stayed in. It had two floors, two bathrooms and two balconies. Marble everywhere. We were celebrating my husband's birthday. They gave us a bottle of champagne and a beautiful fruit bowl.\u00a0 We had dinner at Las Ventanas, Azia and a private beach dinner.\u00a0 The food at Azia was definitely the best. So fresh and the teppanyaki table was very entertaining.\u00a0 Las Ventanas was good too, but it was my least favourite. The service was extremely slow. Our dinner was 3 hours and we were tired! Our beach dinner was great! Christian was our server and he was wonderful. We had steak and lobster and both were really tasty. The lobster was especially done well. You can't beat the atmosphere of being the only ones on the beach, eating dinner lit by the moon! Breakfast was at Spices every morning and it was yummy too. The buffet had lots of variety and the view of the beach was great.\u00a0 We had lunch at Spices and the beach grill. Again, both places had awesome food. We ordered room service once and ate in our cabana once. The calamari, chicken wings, onion rings and guacamole can't be beat! Overall, I don't think any other hotel can come close to this one. The only thing that another hotel could have over this one is nightlife, but we aren't looking for nightlife/parties when we are on vacation, so it suits us just fine.

The infinity pool is wonderfull!! The bar are really nice!! So as you can see, I and my friends loved the resort!!! The only thing that we (the four of us) didn't like...and it's not major...is -in the room, (I don't know the word in english) we can here everything outside, people talking, door everything but during the night, it's not a problem, it's just in the morning. And the Azia restaurant was not really good. We went there 2 times. The first with a table with a chef and the other time one table for the 4 of us. But both time the food was not really good. To much soya sauce, salt. The sushi is excellent! The problem is the main course. We spoke with other people in the resort and they said the same thing as us. It's the only thing that we didn't like but the service was again, excellent!! The other restaurant was WOW, good quality, fresh, tasting!! REALLY REALLY GOOD!!!!!! It's a must to do the Las Ventanas restaurant and the lamb is absolutly fantastic!!!

Food: delicious a la carte menus, fine dining cuisine, house wines from Chile were incredible, Las Ventanas was my favourite restaurant! Rooms: spacious, extremely fresh and clean, great decor, ipod deck, large flat screen tvs, DVD menu to choose from, lovely bathroom and balcony Bars: piano bar is a modern and classy lounge with white leather sofas, great relaxing vibe! Drinks (top shelf selection) were amazing! Lots of choices, try the watermelon cooler (white wine, watermelon liquor etc). Pools: infinity pool has a gorgeous view of the ocean, however a little chilly but still refreshing. Hot tubs were a great touch in front of the pool! Entertainment: was lacking a bit, much more of a laid back ambience around the resort during the evening. However, the alegria bar and the piano bar were great options for a late night drink. The once a week dinner theatre show was pretty entertaining! Overall, a 5 star resort with incredible friendly prompt service!

We have travelled to several resorts (4.5 to 5 stars) in Cuba, the Dominican Republic (we got married in Punta Cana) and Mexico and this is hands down the best resort that we have ever been to! Our room was beautiful, very clean and turn down service every night was a lovely touch. Our concierge was also very helpful with our dinner reservations and even managed to get us into Azia more than once since we enjoyed it so much. The food was top notch, as was the service and this is the first time that we have ever been to a resort where the wine was not only drinkable but better than a lot of the wine we buy from home! Las Ventanas definitely deserves 4 diamonds and the sushi at Azia was wonderful! Palazzo was probably our least favourite restaurant but it was still very good, we just enjoyed the other restaurants much more. The deck was great for lunch and the view was spectacular! Make sure to try the ceviche! There wasn't a whole lot going on in the evenings but we didn't mind at all because we were there to relax. My husband said that this was the most relaxing trip that he has ever been on and I agree! We loved sitting outside of the piano bar and talking to other guests. Caesar the awesome bartender always made sure that we had a drink in hand and he could make anything you wanted. Make sure to visit the Allegria bar and try the tiramisu martinis, they're delicious! We were very impressed by the gorgeous private beach and the beach butlers always made sure that all of our needs were taken care of whether we needed shade, a drink or even lunch in our lounge chairs! Needless to say we felt completely pampered! We also liked the fact that we didn't have to wear bracelets at the resort or use towel cards, you could take as many towels as you needed. I can't comment much on the pools since we are beach people but they were beautiful and looked very clean. There were also small private pools scattered throughout the grounds. The location of this resort also can't be beat. Every morning we would run into Playa del Carmen and grab coffee at Starbucks across the street from the resort when we got back (the one small complaint that we had about the resort was that the coffee wasn't great but that's a pretty minor complaint!). There were also lots of little shops across the street from the resort that were fun to look through and we appreciated the fact that the vendors weren't aggressive. Although we didn't use the spa services whatever scent they use in their products was intoxicating! I actually regret not finding out what it was/buying their products! I have a feeling that we'll have to visit the resort again to find out though... All in all this was the best resort experience that we have ever had. We have never visited a resort that we would like to return to (we like trying different places) but we will definitely be visiting the Royal Hideaway again!

So, if this is what you are looking for make sure to request the room in advance or you\u00b4ll be SOL. Special thanks to Chris- the Manager at the Grill restaurant for his amazing service. His great server- Ricardo and a great chef in Marco for an amazing dinner that rivals the best upscale restaurants in West Los Angeles. If you are thinking great view and fun staff, think of breakfast and brunch at Spices. The hosts like Christopher, Veronica, Laura, and Cesar are your hook-ups to the best seats in the restaurant. The buffet style gives you many options from both traditional and modern Mexican, American, and European cuisine. Be lucky enough to sit at either David, Reyes, Miguel, Javier, Armando, and Vitalino\u00b4s tables and you\u00b4ll be treated like royalty. If you are thinking Asian Fusion, make sure to visit Azia. Adrian is the Chef there and he\u00b4s fabulous and very humble. The host Fernando was considerate and attentive while Manuel the server is a sweet man and a comedian at heart. For Modern Fusion, make sure to visit Ventanas and enjoy some fun and beautifully prepared meals. Narciso is the server there who is just sweet and is a brand new Daddy. He also assisted us during Tea Time from 3pm to 5pm at the lobby which included live smooth saxophone sounds. If you wish to complete your dance card, make sure to invite Isis to dance with you pool side. She provided great drink and lunch suggestions with some Salsa and Meringue on the side. But be warned, she will make you look bad if you cannot dance. A special shout-out to the 2 Iguanas jacuzzi side for being such celebrities. Special thanks to Manuel - our beach side server who had to walk back and forth to fill our drink orders and never lost his smile and sense of humor. For wine enthusiasts, check out their extensive wine list. And if you are extra nice to Chris (at the Grill), he\u00b4ll locate a spanish 1994 gem that may not be on the wine list anymore just for you. Some suggestions for hotel management: Making a great first impression is the foundation of a great stay. So, if Yanin happens to help you when you check in, run and ask for Daniel instead. She needs a complete customer service experience re-training as she\u00b4s not very welcoming and does not complement the rest of your amazing staff. In addition, Roger Balan - our bungalow concierge needs to be friendly and not seem bothered or rushed every time you see him. A suggestion for the saxophone player would be to consider a diverse reportoire of music since he seemed to play the same songs at the lobby and pool area. We would like management to consider investing in better, more comfortable, regular size pillows that do not flatten to wafer thin when you lay your head on it to sleep. Also consider either better batteries or better remote controls for the television. You have these beautiful crystal clear Samsung TV\u00b4s if you can only turn it on from the remote. But we certainly appreciate the effort of the room service staff by switching remote controls quickly but to the same result. A final note, with the exception of a couple of staff we mentioned, everyone at the Royal Hideaway from housekeeping, restaurants, and customer service made our first winter vacation in Mexico worth repeating.

An experience like NO other...\u201d", "Author": "alienpilot", "ReviewID": "UR121066505", "Content": "We stayed at the RH from 9 Aug \u2013 5 Sep 2011, our twelth summer in a row. Each year we stay for about three weeks, so I consider myself something of an RH expert. Every year I say how can it get any better, but it does. I am just blown away! There is not much more I can add to the previous posts. They are all mostly correct, but I will attempt to clarify and explain the changes this year, as well as the impact of the present economic crisis on RH. I want to stress that the state of the hotel is season dependent. More guests mean more and different services. We were in low season, so take this review with that in mind. I have repeated some material here from my review from last year, but feel it is worth repeating for the benefit of those contemplating visiting this property. WHAT\u2019S NEW?... New lounge chairs on the beach. By the end of December 2011, new furniture in the Allegria Bar and on \u201cThe Deck\u201d. New desks in all rooms. Outside metal railings being replaced with maintenance free material. New shower heads in all rooms. Wood deck in front of the infinity pool around hot tubs replaced with stone. It\u2019s nice to see the property being cared for and updated! OCCUPANCY There are 11 villas on the property (200 rooms) capable of housing an average of 400 guests. This includes six two story junior suites and two Presidential suites. During our stay this year, the resort averaged about 50-60% occupancy. They located the guests in the front villas closest to the ocean. Another \u201csmart thing\u201d that RH is famous for. Why keep all villas opened with a concierge in each with maid service, if the occupancy is at this level? I love the small resort concept. Been to the mega resorts and they are just too impersonal and crowded. At Royal Hideaway, it\u2019s personal. They make it a point to remember your name and strive to make your experience a memorable one. Need or want something? Just ask\u2026 FYI; if you ever find yourself needing medical attention, don\u2019t worry. I saw a lady who needed medical attention by the pool on her lounge chair and within minutes, the pool concierge was right there administering first aid and the lifeguard was there stat stabilizing the situation. The doctor was immediately called. All seamless. Impressive\u2026 RESTAURANTS All restaurants are enclosed and air conditioned except for \u201cThe Grill\u201d (it\u2019s the pool snack bar\u2026\u201dThe Deck\u201d during the day. They spiff it up at night). ALL restaurants except for the breakfast at Spice\u2019s (buffet style) are \u201corder off the menu\u201d. For dinner, reservations are required and there IS a dress code. Study up on that, because if you\u2019re not dressed properly, you won\u2019t be seated. My suggestion to guests is that they make all their reservations as far in advance as the RH schedule allows for the time you want. If you wait to make reservations the night before or the night of, don\u2019t be surprised to learn that the only time left is for 9 or 10 pm. You\u2019re forewarned\u2026Customer service can make your first several nights dinner reservations before you even leave home. Email them for details. You\u2019ll find the dining experience formal. Waiters are dressed in tuxedos and the tableware is first class. Be prepared to spend several hours for dinner. Especially in Azia\u2019s. Relax. You\u2019re on vacation. Due to the low occupancy, RH did another \u201csmart thing\u201d. They had only two (or three, usually) of their restaurants opened per night. While we were there, Las Ventana\u2019s, their signature restaurant, was almost always opened, and they rotated the second/third restaurant every night through their remaining five. Most guests stay at RH at least a week, so you would be able to eat in all of the restaurants before you left. For breakfast, only Spice\u2019s (the Mexican restaurant) was opened. It is the only restaurant that is buffet style with omelets made to order. When occupancy is up, Las Ventana\u2019s is also opened for breakfast (order off a menu). We preferred Spices for breakfast with more choices and a beautiful beach/ocean view. For lunch, we had a choice of two restaurants; \u201cThe Deck\u201d (the pool snack bar) located on the wooden deck by the infinity pool and right by the beach. If you prefer, they also have open-air inside seating. Spice\u2019s Mexican restaurant, upstairs from \u201cThe Deck\u201d, was our other option. We normally alternated days between \u201cSpice\u2019s\u201d and \u201cThe Deck\u201d for lunch. Spice\u2019s was air conditioned and was a nice break from the hot summer sun, and the menu was extensive and creative. They had the best soups and salads on the property at lunch. But make sure you are dry and covered up when you dine. Here\u2019s a little secret. If you know they have ingredients for something you crave, but is not on a menu, ask them if they can prepare it. I like BLTs. I asked, and it appeared. Something more complicated that may take more time to prepare? Get a manager at the restaurant and explain what you want. And if you don\u2019t like the sizes of the portions you get, ask them to double it, or reduce it. Don\u2019t like how something tastes or prepared? Get a different entr\u00e9e or ask it to be re-done to your liking. They want to make you happy and will do everything in their power to see it happens. Just be nice, patient and respectful and make sure your request is properly understood. Sometimes they appear to understand, but it loses in the translation. YOU are a guest in THEIR country. Play nice\u2026\u2019nough said. Now the really good part! If you are a foodie, you will do this. Las Ventana\u2019s has something called \u201cThe Chef\u2019s Table\u201d. http://www.royalhideaway.com/chefstable/main.html This will cost extra; $150 per person, or $200 with wine pairings (check, the cost may have changed). The menu is custom prepared and changes each time it is done. Have requests, or don\u2019t really care for something? Communicate. They will do whatever you want and will work with you. Let them know ahead of time. This was a highlight of our stay. The Executive Chef Jose Bossuet Martinez and Sous Chef Jose Manuel Morales Garcia cook for you before your eyes in a special glassed in room in Ventana\u2019s kitchen with your private, dedicated waiter. It\u2019s an experience you don\u2019t want to miss if you\u2019re a gourmand. Check out my video on this experience; http://vimeo.com/28559823 If you\u2019re lucky and the occupancy is up to 50-60%, you may be able to enjoy \u201cPaella Day\u201d or \u201cGrill Day\u201d around the pool for lunch. They set up the barbeque on the deck and cook it right there! On \u201cPaella Day\u201d, they bring in the gigantic paella pan and add chicken, mussels, chorizo, langostinos and shrimp, scallops and rice! On \u201cGrill Day\u201d they have Mayan chicken Argentinean white chorizo, ribs, arrachera and if you want something else grilled? ASK! This was FUN!!! Mid-morning around the pool deck, Cynthia, the pool concierge comes out with her fruit cart. A variety of fruits and a chilled towel is offered. You\u2019ve been working hard! Enjoy\u2026 ENTERTAINMENT This is a very quiet, laid back property. The only entertainment you will find on property is in the \u201cTheater\u201d for a dinner show once a week and every night there is something going on in the Allegria Bar. Night life at the RH is seriously lacking, I know. Want it? Take a $6 cab ride to town (Playa del Carmen), including tip, and hit 5th Avenue. You\u2019ll find what you want\u2026This isn\u2019t a party place\u2026 BEACH WOW! Just WOW! The beach has been reclaimed! I\u2019ve been coming here for 12 years, and I have never seen the beach so deep as this! Just gorgeous! No giant sand bags, no interference with the view. You can get help with a cabana for two to protect you from the sun and a couple of lounge chairs right on the water\u2019s edge. Oh\u2026worried about food and drink issues so far from the pool snack bar? Not to worry! Pick up a black flag (ask your pool waiter) on the way out to your \u201cspot\u201d. Waiters regularly service this area. Want something? Put the black flag up. They\u2019ll be there! Water aerobics are offered in the morning, and there are other activities you can get involved in, only if you want. There is NO pressure here. Cynthia, the pool concierge, your villa concierge, or the water sports folks can help you with any activity you crave (tennis, golf nearby, table tennis, crafts, cooking classes, Spanish class, deep sea fishing, etc.). TO TIP OR NOT TO TIP? We have been asked about tipping at RH numerous times. I understand the property is at the upper end of the price scale and tipping may be the last thing on your mind. What we do, is tip the maid, concierges, the pool and dinner waiters, and the entertainment. The amount isn\u2019t important. The tip is important, because it shows your appreciation for what they do. Do what you can afford, but do. The maids are working behind the scenes but their tasks are the most time consuming, so we are more generous with them. That is our take on the tipping, and it is appreciated. What you do is up to you, and you will get the same service if you tip or not. In 12 years, I\u2019ve seen tipping guests and non-tipping guests, all are given the RH treatment. Follow your heart in this matter. Here\u2019s a few links I think you\u2019ll like; Live cam, Royal Hideaway.

Very quiet and romantic. Watch the sunset. Get beverages from the pool bar area and take up with you. Waiter service not usually available there. Champagne is a nice touch\u2026We go when Spices or The Grill is open, then you can get beverages. Nice breeze, nice view, always quiet and secluded. You newly marrieds would love it. DO THIS. 2) Did you know they have \u201ctea time\u201d here? It\u2019s from 4-6 pm every afternoon at the front of the property, just before you walk out the front. I know what you\u2019re thinking. \u201cYeah, right\u2026tea time\u201d. Do it. They have several flaming Mexican coffees that they prepare before your eyes, a sax player plays, the champagne flows, the finger sandwiches are eaten\u2026whatever you want. Not just tea\u2026nice break from lying around by the pool or beach. Just sit down at a table. I suggest the breezeway. Nice breeze. The waiter will bring everything to you. No need to serve yourself. Enjoy my video of a Mexican coffee being made before your eyes! http://vimeo.com/27803783 3) Two desserts you must try. Are they in any of the restaurants? No. Only in room service. Order these; Opera cake and Tres Leches (three milk cake). We liked the Opera cake the best. Another good thing from room service? Their chicken soup. Wings are good, too. Want those for lunch? Ask for them at The Deck or call room service and have them delivered there, they\u2019ll magically appear! You can order room service at The Deck at lunch if you want something from them, which is not on The Deck menu. Ask your waiter or manager. 4) Bring mosquito repellent for the porches, tea time, the Grill and Allegria bar. You will be happy you did. 5) Get an insulated mug for your cold beer or beverage. I suggest a Starbucks stainless steel insulated mug or similar. They are all over, but get a stainless steel insulated one. You won\u2019t regret it. It\u2019s hot, and drinks get hot very quickly. A MUST! I\u2019m serious! DO IT... You won\u2019t regret it! (They just built a Starbucks across the street to the left in the strip mall at the very end. Yummmm\u2026). 6) Spice\u2019s has the coldest beer on the property. 7) Have a special request for your in-room refrigerator? Tell them how you want it set up. Like all water, no sodas, just particular kind of sodas, beers (what kind do you want? I liked Leon)\u2026ask them for the selections. They have many American beers, as well as Mexican and ? 8) All rooms have free wireless internet. They have a business center with 4 computers, but they sometimes get crowded. Bring your laptop. Then you can download pixs and vids to it and share on Facebook, Twitter, etc. 9) Want to call back home but are stressed because of the cost? Like $1 plus per minute for cell phone calls? Install Skype on your laptop. If someone else has Skype, you can talk for free. If you have a webcam, you can talk and see for free with a Skype user. If the party you want to call doesn\u2019t have Skype, signup for a Skype monthly subscription. Call back to the USA for $2 for a month, $3 for the USA and Canada! You can cancel when you get back home. It will only cost you $2 or $3 for your entire vacation, unlimited calling. Can\u2019t beat that! I do that every year. Here\u2019s the link; http://www.skype.com/intl/en-us/prices/pay-monthly/ 10) Can\u2019t get that pool umbrella up by the pool? Ask the pool concierge or any other staff and they will do it for you. Note; Cynthia is the BEST pool concierge EVER! No umbrella where you want to lay? Ask!! 11) What are those large guinea pigs called running around the property at dusk and dawn? These are called sereque. They are protected by the Mexican government, but, I hear, are quite tasty\u2026. http://www.mayansanctuary.com/sereque.jpg We already made return reservations while we were down there. Many of the first time guests said that they were returning as well, because of the service, the attention to detail and the ambience. Hope to see you August 2012. I\u2019ll bring the chicken, La Guardavida \u201cPepita\u201d to save anyone in the Infinity Pool, if need be. She is always on duty 10 am until Tea Time at 3 pm. God bless and hurry down.

The service was truly 5-diamond; it was very personalized and the staff are very caring. The rooms were absolutely beautiful and very clean. The entire resort was emcaulately groomed. The infiinity pool overlooking the ocean was spectacular, and when we weren't lounging on the beautiful beach, we were relaxing on one of the cabana's. The food was exceptional. Again surpassing our expectations. We have travelled to many resorts in Mexico and in the Caribbean, and have never experienced food of this superior quality. It was also such a pleasure to be served at the a la carte restaurants rather than having to eat dinner at a buffet. There are no buffet restaurants for lunch or dinner, only a la carte.

The grounds of the Royal Hideaway are very well maintained and everything is clean. The views from the pools and beach are great. The staff are friendly and accommodating. We particularly enjoyed Isis at the \"Deck\". Guest rooms and bath areas are smaller than expected in this supposed class of resort. Paint and wallpaper issues need to be addressed and the ground level guest rooms are very humid and have the smell that goes along with it - even the pillows have the scent of mildew. The beds are comfortable and bedding always clean. The real problem with this resort is beyond the cosmetic has to do with food and beverage. I will start with the beverage service - diluted alcohol beyond reasonable expectations and false advertising with regard to the top shelf liquors. By flavor alone (ie Grey Goose vodka or similar) anyone could tell that it was not as per the label on the bottle. Three more things confirmed how they insult patrons with the gimmick of top shelf liquor: 1) A bottle of Grey Goose with a broken seal with the level of the liquid within a quarter inch of the top - way overfilled for a new bottle less alone an already open one! 2) When the issue of diluted drinks was brought up with the concierge I suggested she would have a server bring us a bottle of Belvedere vodka and have the seal broken in front of our group and we would drink from this bottle. She told us after consulting with the management that there would be a $80 US Dollar charge plus 11% tax for this service - but if we drank the Belvedere from the bar by the glass there would be no charge. No wonder - since it wasn't Belvedere and whatever it was was half water. 3) Even with shots of varieties of different iquors ordered on the side of mixed drinks you would taste that they were super diluted. An insult to anyones intelligence. Now the food,... very inconsistent at best and horrendous at the worst. Out of our group of nine people, five experienced gastrointestinal problems within a day or two of arrival to this resort. There was no off site drinking or eating. I would estimate that a quarter of the meals tried by our group could not be eaten because of over salting, over cooking, sea food that had past its prime or just awful taste. Even during the same meal people would order the same steak for instance and half of them would be great and half could not be eaten at all. Just about everything came luke warm. Book your meal time well in advance otherwise you will be done eating around 11 PM. We found the resort to be on the boring side with little life and little in the way of entertainment or sporting activity. A friend of mine described this resort as putting lipstick on a pig. In this case the lipstick is how pretty and clean the resort is and the pig is the subpar food and drink which totally destroyed the experience for all of us.", "Date": "November 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tn.", "Title": "\u201cI wish it were my second home\u201d", "Author": "smjsmj", "ReviewID": "UR120641393", "Content": "We were at Royal Hideaway in late Oct during the hurricane. Since we had been there several times I knew it would be wonderful. I have always appreciated the staff at Royal Hideaway but the hurricane experince bumped them up to a whole new level. The resort is beautiful. The beach and pool areas are lovely. There is never a problem getting a chair or drinks. The rooms are so comfortable and the food very good. The service and care of the staff is better at Royal Hideaway than anyplace I have ever been. We were evacuated to the Occidental Grand Xcaret which was awful. We were put in building #20. The floor of the room was flooded. We had no a/c, no runnig water nor flushing toilet. The people at the front desk were just mean to some of the Roylal Hideaway guest. We did deal with Mercades at the desk who was nice and helpful. I can really say nothing good about this the Grand Xcaret. We did escape the Grand Xcaret the next morning and got a taxi back to the Royal Hideaway. At this point the Royal Hideawy said they had no services to offer. Boy were they wrong. When we got back the first thing the doorman said was \"Welcome back. We missed you\" I thought my wife would shead tears of joy. Our room was not ready but a small buffet was set up in Las Venetes in case we were hungry. It was just so nice. It was a small buffet but the food was wonderful and the staff so kind. This was clearly the Royal Hideaway at it's worst. Royal Hideaway at it's worst is still nice and better than many resorts at their best. I feel the staff would never have sent us to the Grand Xceret if they had known the conditions. We ending up needing to stay a few extra days due to flight cancelations. This did make our vacation cost more than expected. The staff was so kind and were providing such excellent service I probably would have paid almost anything to keep staying there.

I am so happy that I chose RH. It was a dream. The staff is truly fantastic and took care of our every need. We are beach dwellers and stayed on the beach all day everyday and found the staff to be attentive- yes you will have to fetch a drink on occasion - but I didn't find that to be a problem. The beach itself is pristinely gorgeous with comfortable furniture and plenty of shade either under palm trees or under the moveable canopies. The sand is soft and white with no rocks once you enter the water as there are at other resorts. I can't speak to the pool because we spent no time there but it appeared that there were plenty of umbrellas and loungers for anyone that desired one. Our room was spacious with a nice bathroom that we could both move around in with ease. Plenty of room for the two of us and with a lovely balcony we would sit on in the evening. The bed was comfortable by almost any standard. The cleaning staff did a wonderful job of keeping our room sand free and clean. The food was better than I expected. We took advantage of room service every morning for coffee and juice and then again in the late afternoon for a snack to tide us over for dinner. Room service was always prompt and if something wasn't as ordered they were quick to remedy the problem. Breakfast buffet at Spices was just fine with us- nothing spectacular but certainly something for everyone- plenty of fresh fruit and an omelet bar along with food to suit most nationalities. We had lunch at the pool deck most days and enjoyed it - plenty of variety so it didn't get old after multiple days. Also ate at Spices for lunch twice and found it to be tasty. Always with great service at both locations. We enjoyed most of our dinners. I agree with many of the other viewers in regard to the odd way the reservations play out. We ended up dining so late on most nights because all the 8pm reservations were filled and when we arrived it appeared that no one was there. We really enjoyed the Asian restaurant and went twice. Palazzo had a lovely atmosphere and the food was beautifully prepared if not a bit salty. Didn't much care for Las Ventanas the signature restaurant. Cool modern interior but the food lacked luster- it was the only meal where my boyfriend found something to be inedible. We ate at The Grill twice and both of us were surprised at the flavor and preparation of the steaks - cooked exactly to order and accompanied by delicious mashed potatoes and beautiful desserts. We did eat at Spices for dinner one night and really liked it. We eat a lot of Latin food normally so we knew what to order and everything we tried was delicious. In the evenings at Spices you can also get a hold of some delicious top shelf margaritas. The drinks were up to par wherever we went. You will have to request specific liquors if you desire them. All of the bartenders took direction well if you have any specific requests. We drank a lot of the house wine and found both the Cabernet Sauvignon and the Sauvignon Blanc to be more than tolerable - it just wasn't worth it to order anything off of the wine list. Overall the grounds are lovely and the staff attentive and upbeat. It was a wonderfully relaxing vacation and true to what others have said this is not the place to go if you are a night life party animal. We did take a twenty minute walk up the beach to Playa which was fine. Playa has become rather like a carnival atmosphere - I felt like I was being heckled at every step to shop or eat. It made me appreciate the refinement and tranquility of RH. Frankly we were so tired after our days on the beach we welcomed the low key atmosphere. We can't wait to return and would recommend this resort to anyone.

Unfortunately, Hurricane Rina had other plans for us. We ended up being stuck there for three extra nights. I'll talk about that fiasco shortly. The resort is outstanding. The food is excellent. And the staff are superb and very hard-working. I won't delve into the details as others have done previously since I would simply repeat their mostly excellent reviews. My wife is mobility-challenged so we wrote to Cynthia Sanchez prior to leaving West Virginia to ask for a villa near the pool in order to minimize her walking. When we arrived, we were pleasantly surprised to find that Ms. Sanchez had arranged for us to be in villa 23 which is a few steps from the pool area. Ms. Sanchez also made dinner reservations for us in advance which was a very nice touch. We really appreciated her efforts. Everything went fine for a few days. Then on Saturday the 22nd we began to notice the formation of a storm off the coast of Honduras. It intensified quickly and became Hurricane Rina. Over the next few days it reached category II. On Wednesday morning, the 26th, were were advised by our concierge that we would be moved to a different room that evening. At around 4 pm we were advised that the entire resort would be evacuated to a 'shelter'. Visions of the New Orleans Superdome ran through our collective minds. However, it turns out that the written evacuation notice that the hotel passed around was riddled with translation errors. Instead, we were to be at the front desk at 10 pm to board three buses to the Occidental Xcaret which was about 15 minutes away. We did as we were told and evacuated. The OX (for short) was not ready for us. There were no towels, no toilet paper and no hot water. We were assigned to building 20 which had apparently been shut down for some time. We called the front desk repeatedly and they gradually were able to restore services to the building. We spent the night and had breakfast and lunch there the next day - Thursday the 27th. I contacted Royal Hideaway by email to inquire as to when we could return. I received varying answers - none of which were in any way similar. Finally, at around 6 PM the front desk called and advised that were were being evicted and sent back to Royal Hideaway. By this time the storm had weakened to a tropical storm and was approaching. We trudged back to the front desk of OX in the driving rain - a 600 yard walk from building 20 - and waited for two cabs to take us back to Royal Hideaway - in the middle of a tropical storm. When we arrived, the excellent front desk staff was ready for us and got us checked in very quickly. They then told us that they were serving dinner buffet-style at Las Ventanas. The buffet was outstanding. We then retired to our rooms to ride out the tropical storm. They had moved us to building 25 which is on higher ground. The winds blew pretty fiercely and the rain peppered down all night. What was left of the eye passed over at around 2 am. The next morning they served breakfast buffet style in Las Ventanas. It was again excellent. I found out that many of the staff spent the night at the resort. There was debris all over the place - a couple of palm trees were down and some bushes were damaged. The pool area and the lower villas were closed off. By noon Friday most of the cleanup work was completed. By 6 pm you really couldn't tell anything unusual had happened. It was amazing how quickly they restored everything. There was some roof damage to Spices restaurant but that was all that remained. It appeared to be fixed on Saturday. I met the manager - a french gentleman - by the pool. He said he was mostly worried about the beach. I suppose that repairing an eroded beach was the most expensive possibility about which he was concerned. However there appeared to be no damage to the beach at all. He was a very nice fellow and talked with us for a bit before resuming his inspection. I also met Cynthia Sanchez and thanked her for the excellent help both before and during our extended trip. I would certainly return to this place in a New York minute. The debacle over the evacuation was certainly not one of their finer moments, but I suspect they were even more confused than we. And, they should have arranged for transportation to de-evacuate us rather than require us to get our own cab. Nevertheless, this is a wonderful place staffed by excellent folks. My wife likes to make origami elephants and other creatures with dollar bills for the staff members. One recipient - Reyes at Spices restaurant - reciprocated by making a cricket (grillo in espanol) out of a palm frond. He also made a snail out of a bar stirrer. He is really talented!

In reading a few of the recent reviews of the place, one thing that struck me was some references to the possibility of \"new staff\", or of the place not being a 5 star place. While I've rated it a \"4\", I only do that because a 5 rating probably isn't possible. I don't think ANYWHERE I've ever gone I could give a 5...although I may have rated the RH a 5 after our first trip, because it was such a special place for us! The room we had this time was smaller than the room we had during our first trip; while that was somewhat disappointing, I do have to agree with the person who said you really aren't in your room that much anyway. If you'd like a bigger room, with a shower big enough for two people to comfortably fit in, I think you should just ask and see if they can accommodate that. The bigger room is definitely nicer...but not a huge issue for us one way or the other. The food and drink, and service, at this place we have found on both trips to be just outstanding. The service staff are well trained, and make efforts to remember you. Several called us by name a day or two after we met them, and remembered our favorite drinks. Perhaps the best information that I can share with those of you considering a trip here is this: when we first went here, 5 years ago, it was at the suggestion of my sister, who has been in the travel business for over 25 years. She's traveled all over the world, and told me that for her, this was the nicest place she had ever been to. And, on this trip, we met several other couples who told us the exact same thing...they THEY were recommended the RH by people within the travel industry. So the place has a wonderful reputation within the professional travel service industry. One gentleman we met on this trip was enjoying his 10th trip to the RH. He has been retired for 27 years, and travels all over the world. And I know he can afford to literally go ANYWHERE he wants to go. And while we didn't discuss it, I'm left to believe that for him, he feels that the Royal Hideaway is still worth the trip(s)! I'm sure if he no longer felt that way, he'd be finding another place in the area (or somewhere else, perhaps) to go...but he keeps coming back. In closing, the other thing I'll point out that my wife and I enjoyed is that this is an adults only place. That's certainly not to say that we prefer not being around children! It's just that when you want to kick back and relax, and actually LET your brain \"drain\" a bit...and enjoy some peace and quiet at a relaxed place...this is a place that you know you will have the atmosphere to do that in. Will we go back? Of COURSE we will. And if any of you are \"on the fence\" about going, I agree with another reviewer who wrote that since they had gotten a \"deal\" to go there...he felt bad about criticizing anything about the place! If you can swing it, and you won't miss being around children, or partaking in a loud environment like can be found in other area all-inclusives...the Royal Hideaway is an excellent place to head to!", "Date": "October 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando, Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat Escape\u201d", "Author": "squeke", "ReviewID": "UR119938000", "Content": "My wife and I took a quick 4 night getaway to Royal Hideway in October.

The campus is small (but not crammed together), giving the overall place a more intimate feeling. The beach is second to none and the pools were well-maintained with plenty of chairs. All of the restaurants are a-la-carte and the portions are somewhat small, but they allow as many courses as you want, so you can order 3 or 4 appetizers, second courses or desserts. I loved almost everything that I tried, but have to say that I am not the pickiest eater; we heard/read a lot of mixed reviews on how good people thought the food was. However, if you don't like what you ordered, you can just order a different item from the menu. We booked 5 nights (only had 4 full days), which was not enough- you need at least 7 nights to enjoy the resort and see some of the local sights. Despite arriving at 10 p.m. we were greeted with champagne and given reservations at Las Ventanas with full dinner service. The next morning our villa's private concierge greeted us and helped us with dinner reservations for the rest of the week and arranging an excursion for the following day (the excursion was a blast!). Their breakfast buffet was wonderful every morning- must try the chiliquiles! Our first day was spent lounging on the beach, then we borrowed bicycles and rode into the Playa del Carmen port of call/shopping area, about 10 minutes away and you pass a park with Mayan ruins on the way. There is also a smaller shopping mall across the street (flea market type). Walking/biking around the area felt very safe and secure as Playacar is a gated community. Half of the guests were evacuated at 10 p.m. on our third night night due to Hurricane Rina approaching and we were told that the entire resort would be evacuated by the following morning. We spent the night at a different resort, reinforcing our desire to be at Royal Hideaway (VERY bad experience at Occidental Grand Flamingo Xcaret!!). The next morning the storm had been downgraded from hurricane to tropical storm status and after a somewhat lengthy process, we were accepted back to Royal Hideaway; the other guests never needed to be evacuated at all. Although the services were limited while the storm passed over us (no room service, all meals were buffet-style, beach/pools/spa/gym all closed), they did a great job of keeping us safe and recovering full services by the middle of the day after the storm. If not for the storm, it would have been absolutely perfect, and I actually would commend the staff at Royal Hideaway on how they handled the storm- we were told by many locals that it had been 3 years since such a big storm, and before that, 6 years since Hurricane Wilma; events like this are not common and are difficult to plan for/manage. My husband and I hope to return to The Royal Hideaway within the next year since we only had 2 full days that were not interrupted by the storm. It certainly deserves its 5-diamond credit!", "Date": "October 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madison, WI", "Title": "\u201cVery nice time at Royal Hideaway...but not blown away\u201d", "Author": "BuckyFans", "ReviewID": "UR119562003", "Content": "My husband and I traveled to Royal Hideaway the week of October 10th. We have been to numerous other resorts in Mexico and this one was very nice but we were not blown away. I think we have become extremely picky in our travels, as our time away is so limited and precious and we want things to be perfect. The resort is amazingly beautiful and the grounds are lush with vegetation. The beach is also as perfect as others describe it. The food is incredible, both taste and presentation. Servings can be on the small side, but after a number of courses you fill up in no time. We ate at all of the restaurants in the place, even did the dinner show on the evening offered. It was an amazing theater, especially considering it is not a huge resort. Truly first class. The one restaurant we avoided was one at the pool. The food is all American basics and we can get plenty of that at home. We preferred Spices for lunch and the waiter Reyes was incredible. He brought us drinks as soon as we sat down once he knew our favorites. The liquor is top notch. My husband even fell in love with a tequila at Las Ventanas and we have found it not to be available anywhere, not even at the airport. They will pour you anything you want and will never bat an eye. The one small downside of the resort is the rooms. The concept of having a concierge at each of the villas was lovely. Someone was always there to assist us. However, the rooms are small, the showers are small, and everything just seemed cozier than we are used to for such a beautiful resort. There is no way you can get two people in the shower and the water temperature changes quickly with no warning depending on the demand in the rest of the villa. My recoomendation to the resort is to update the rooms a bit. Fix the chipped paint, replace the wallpaper that is peeling off, etc. There are just little things that need attention. Again, we are quite spoiled in our travels. A positive comment on the room is that had no odor or hint of mildew. Everything was very clean. The air conditioning also worked sufficiently. The relaxing pools are amazing within the lush plantings, but yes, there are a few mosquitos when you are so close to the plants. We did not notice any bugs at night though. The evening entertainment is nice. It will not be your cup of tea if you are looking for a rocking time though. Speaking of tea, they did have High Tea from 4-6pm every day for guests. Nice touch.", "Date": "October 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northridge, cA", "Title": "\u201cthe definition of LUXURY\u201d", "Author": "Stephanie B", "ReviewID": "UR119461113", "Content": "Come here if you want to feel like royalty. Everything is astonishingly beautiful at this resort! The staff truly seem to take pride and pleasure in providing excellent and attentive, respectful service. I particularly noticed the lovely flourish of the waiters at the evening dining restaurants; the way they move is beautifully choreographed and downright courtly. The rooms are all in beautiful villas, each with its own concierge. Each room has a little balcony with chairs and table where you can take your breakfast or drinks. The beds are luxurious, with adjustable lighting (all on dimmers). The bathroom is really lovely (marble, natural light) and wonderfully set up for two people; not only are there 2 sinks, but the toilet is in its own little room, and there is a shower stall AND a hand-held shower in the bathtub; so two people can shower at the same time without getting in each other\u2019s way. The landscaping is absolutely beautiful; fantastic tropical plants and flowers, with colorful birds visiting many of the trees. There are two main pools with a Jacuzzi next to them, and there are a few more \u2018Jacuzzis\u2019 tucked away in secluded spots between the villas, but these are not your standard hotel-type noisy, round Jacuzzis, but rather lovely and asymmetrical lagoon-like pools. These make wonderful spots to relax and get away by yourself. The Jacuzzis are not hot, but cool (room-temperature) water which is refreshing in the tropical air. The food is absolutely amazing. The breakfast restaurant (\u201cSpices\u201d) is decorated with grand, elegant paintings and chandeliers with a tropical theme. The variety of the breakfast buffet has something for everyone, and I especially liked the unusual tropical fruits, some of which I\u2019d never seen before!! The breakfast is up a long, big staircase, which would not be not ideal for mobility-impaired guests, and indeed the guests at the resort skewed young, from 20-something newlyweds to some energetic 60\u2019s. The lunch restaurant (\u201cThe Deck\u201d) is right next to the pool and beach, it felt so relaxing and glamorous to look right out at the beach and ocean while having a gourmet lunch. Since people come to lunch right off the beach, no one batted an eye when I had bare feet and just a pareo over my swimsuit at THE DECK. The breakfast room is actually grander than the lunch room, and while it\u2019s not exactly formal, bare feet are not welcome. The dinner restaurants are just amazing. We had dinner in the \u2018signature restaurant\u2019 LAS VENTANAS the first evening, and the customer service manager who had coordinated my reservations had let the staff of the restaurant know that I was vegetarian! So the waiter already knew, and the chef had prepared a special menu for me! It\u2019s this kind of thing that makes you feel like a VIP the whole time you\u2019re here. The seven-course dinner was top-notch gourmet, delicious and presented beautifully. We had dinner in the Italian restaurant PALAZZO the second evening and it was just as amazing. Heads up, the dinner restaurants are air-conditioned quite chilly, I was glad to have a wrap with me. As befits top-notch elegant restaurants, there is a dress code for the dinner restaurants; just no flip-flops, no shorts etc, which is nice. In between the gourmet meals, we worked on our tans, at the picturesque white-sand beach, in the main pools or in the secluded lagoon-like Jacuzzis. Attentive staff come around to the chaises around the pool and beach and take drink orders. Yes, you can have your drink in the pool! A lot of people do. Of course they don\u2019t want broken glass in the pool, but I was very impressed that the plastic cups they serve you if you are having your drink in the pool are not flimsy throw-away plastic cups, but nice-looking heavyweight tumblers that look just like glass. Of course, nothing is second-class here! In the evenings after dinner, we went to hear music in the bars. The piano bar of LAS VENTANAS actually has (in addition to regular seating) two upholstered chaises longue where you can stretch out while having an after-drink and listening to the pianist! The outdoor ALLEGRIA bar had good duos; one evening a keyboard player and trumpeter played laid-back smooth jazz, and the next night the same keyboard player along with a girl singer got the guests up and dancing to live disco and salsa music! ALLEGRIA is like a mini \u2018town square\u2019 where guests socialize, meet each other, and dance! It was really wonderful to be spoiled rotten for a few days.

We have been coming to Mexico for 16+ years and have stayed in many resorts all over Mexico, but mostly in Cancun and Riviera Maya. All 4-star and better. Simply put, nothing has come close to the Royal Hideaway. Stop reading the reviews and book it now! But...if you want to hear more, there is not too much I can add to what has not been written about already. The Resort: The Hideaway has a very cool, Colonial feel. The relatively small size of the place adds an air of intimacy as well as convenience that is missing from the larger, mega hotels. The grounds are lush and beautiful (but you should pack bug spray since the mosquitoes were out at night). The rooms are a bit on the small side, but very nice and well appointed. Housekeeping came twice a day and included turn down service. The room was always spotless and contrary to other places we have stayed, the mini fridge was actually cold. The resort\u2019s location in Playacar was perfect. We could ride bikes or take a 70 peso cab ride to Fifth Ave in Playa del Carmen. Everything was so close compared with other resorts in the Riviera Maya, yet you did not feel like you were right in town. Just walk up and down the beach and check out the other hotels and you know you made the right call. Beach/Pool: The beach is by far the best we have visited anywhere in Mexico. Incredibly wide and there are no rocks in the ocean. My wife and I took several walks on the beach and I swear the sand is actually whiter in front of the Royal Hideaway! We lucked out with great weather, so the ocean was calm and there was very little seaweed. There are lots of palm trees for shade and they even have mobile cabanas as well. There are hidden \"relaxation pools\" as well. After a long day at the beach, my wife and I grabbed a cocktail and headed for one of these hidden pools to cool off. We had the place to ourselves and it was surrounded by lush, jungle vegetation. Felt like a secluded island. The Food: All of the restaurants are ala carte but I understand there is a breakfast buffet that we never made it too. I support the many reviewers that the food was excellent in both the taste and presentation. The lunch on the Deck was very good. Several times, we actually ate on the beach. No Styrofoam containers either, our meals were delivered on china with cloth napkins and silverware\u2026on the beach! For dinner, the tasting menu at Palazzo was superb and my lamb at Las Ventanas was actually some of the best I have had anywhere. Men...bring long pants because shorts and jeans are not allowed in the main restaurants (although jeans are ok at The Grill). The room service menu is minimal, but they were always quick to deliver coffee in the morning and cocktails and wine in the afternoon. In short, the food was excellent for any resort, but since this was all inclusive, I cannot imagine you could do better. The drinks are truly top shelf. Grey Goose, Patron, Tanqueray, Jack Daniels, etc. At other AI hotels we have had to pay extra for \u201ctop shelf\u201d. This was one of the only places we have been where domestic US beer was readily available as well. However, the greatest thing about this resort is the staff and their outstanding service. Within 2 days, everyone knew our names. Kudos to Arturo the pool concierge, William at the Deck (and Palazzo), Isis (both of them, at the pool), Humberto at the beach and Angel who brought our morning coffee and pre-dinner Cabernet. Each Villa has its own concierge to arrange your dinner reservations (like other reviewers recommended you really need to do so well in advance or you will eat at 9:30pm) as well as spa services, etc. Melisa in the famous building 30 (not so bad, but you can hear the music from next door) was remarkable. My wife ran out of her brand of cigarettes with 2 days left in our trip, and we spent an afternoon in Playa trying to find them. Unsuccessful, we returned to the hotel and my wife asked Melisa if she knew where they might be found. Melisa said she would look into it. We thought she was just blowing us off, but the next day, Melisa saw us and came running up to my wife with a pack of her cigarettes. Truly outstanding. In addition, my wife asked Melisa about arranging a romantic dinner on the beach since my birthday happened to fall on a day of our vacation. Thinking it would be more fun to spend the day in Cozumel we decided not to it. However, when we returned to our room after dinner the night of my birthday, the room was literally filled with balloons and a greeting card signed by the staff and a cake was sitting on the dresser. How can you beat that? I do miss a swim up bar, but the negative edge pool did the job. As others have noted, this is not a party hotel, but a larger lobby bar would be nice since everyone scatters to the different restaurants in the evenings. This would make a nice, central place to meet up before or after dinner. Although there was a sleepy little indoor/outdoor area called the Allegra Bar that offered a duo playing live music it was just okay. As I stated earlier, the Royal Hideaway is a treasure. Go. You will not be sorry.

First off they advertise evening entertainment (NON Exsistant), they have only one show per week and thats it no music unless the elevator music in the resturants can be called music, they had cd music in the lounge and nothing else, They have 2 pools and 4 hot tubs not pools.

When we stay at other resorts, and talk with the management, they are always telling us that their General Manager or Executive Chef is from the Royal Hideaway -- making the Royal Hideaway the \"Gold Standard\" for luxury resorts. The Royal Hideway is a great oasis, the place to get away from it all. It's quiet and elegant with a sophisticated atmosphere. One of their biggest concerns is their noisy neighbors to the right. If you really want a quiet vacation, ask for a room to the left of the resort because the neighboring hotel has loud pool games in the afternoon and rock music at night. As for dining, we enjoyed breakfast and lunch the most with service near the pool. Dinner service was slow, and I don't think they have enough dining rooms or space for everyone at night. Every restauant was full, and they wanted us to come back at 9 pm, which was just too late to eat.

I was a little skeptical given some of the Trip Advisor reviews but a friend had visited earlier in the year and convinced us to still go. Most of the bad reviews have been about the food. We did not have a bad meal at all, although some were better than others. And if you don't like something, they will bring you a different selection since it's all inclusive. Our favorite was Palazzo (Italian-very romantic) and Azia (Japanese/Thai-ask for a private room). Las Ventanas is the fanciest and seems to be the favorite on Trip Advisor reviews but it wasn't ours. All of the restaurants are great. Be sure to book your nightly reservations before you go or as soon as you arrive. The villa concierge can do this. Later in the week if you want to change your reservations because you like or dislike a restaurant, they will do that also. The rooms were very nice and clean. Maid service is twice a day. When they come through at night to turn down the bed, etc. they will also clean the bathrooms (just as they do in the morning). Some people have complained about furniture being dirty or old in their room but we didn't notice anything like that in ours. There are nice big flat screen tv's but only with a few channels in english. But who goes to such a beautiful place to watch tv? We were in villa 23 which is very close to the pool/beach but not so close as to be bothered by people at the pool.

You do not want for anything while you are there. Whether it's during the day at the pool or beach or at night in any of the restaurants. There is not much nightlife, which I really enjoyed. We did not want to go to a big resort with a bunch of drunk people running in and out of their room at midnight. I think the other guests who stay there are in that same mindset so it stays very quiet. If you are looking for that, you may want to consider staying somewhere else or go into town at night. Do ask for a room in a quieter section of the resort because the hotel next door plays loud music at night. It can be heard from some rooms. We asked and were placed on the opposite side so we did not hear anything. There are so many great things about this resort that I know I'm leaving something out.

Overall, we had an amazing experience, the positive reviews of the resort from the other reviewers are all true. For those who are checking out the reviews to help with their hotel selection (as did we), I hope that we can provide some helpful information about the resort. We stayed at Secrets Maroma (\"Secrets\") in May of this year so we will try to provide a reasonable comparison of the two resorts (rates are comparable). In terms of our demographics, we are both professionals from NYC in our 20-30's. 1) Grounds: RHP is a much smaller resort so it has a more romantic, intimate feel. Getting from the room to the pool/beach area as well as to the restaurants does not feel like walking through a trail (although it was not bad at all at Secrets). Both resorts have beautiful landscaping and grounds are maintained well. 2) Rooms: Rooms at Secrets are much larger, with larger balconies (a couch vs a couple of chairs at RHP). I think we spent a bit more time (eg, before dinner) on the balcony at Secrets than at RHP, but we really didn't feel the need to spend any time out on the balcony at RHP as everything else is just steps away and the entire resort is beautifully lit and romantic. RHP had a full time concierge per building (or villa). Only 4 rooms per floor per villa (mostly 3 story buildings). So only 12 rooms (max) per villa with a full time concierge - although we really didn't need a concierge for the most part except to make dinner reservations. Constructive criticism - At RHP the way the villas are designed, it's a square building with an open atrium in the middle part (so the middle of the building is open to the sky) - beautiful design, except when it rains, or when people speak in the atrium, the acoustics amplifies and can become very loud. 3) Service - both resorts offer excellent service but we preferred the service at RHP - smaller resort means more personalized service - everyone remembered us my name. The poolside service is outstanding at RHP, on average, a server came by every 5-10 min throughout the day. 4) Food - We were a bit concerned about food because of some negative reviews posted on Tripadvisor, but the food became our favorite part about RHP. Overall, we would rate RHP a bit higher than Secrets in terms of decors of restaurants as well as presentation, quality, and taste of food. But please do not go to Mexican All-inclusive resort expecting a three Michelin star restaurant quality. Our favorite was the Italian (Palazzo), but our best time was at the Asian restaurant (Azia) where we got the private room in the back (highly recommended). Although not all restaurants are open every night, they are on a rotation so you can try all of them during your stay. (Three of the Four restaurants are open on a rotating basis) 5) Drinks - Two thumbs up for RHP, beats secrets hands down. All the drinks are freshly made (every morning fresh juice are squeezed for the drinks), plenty of alcohol, and the top shelfs (grey goose, juan julio) are on display rather than hidden away (we didnt discover Secrets had grey goose until mid way through the trip). All the drinks that we ordered, especially Dirty martinis, were much much better at RHP than at Secrets. In terms of the wine selection, the house wines at both resorts probably retail for $5-8/bottle in the US (they served Frontera brand at RHP). Although we are both wine drinkers, we were fine with the house wines - no way we would pay markup of 5-10 times retail for their wine selection. 6) Pool/Beach - A very different setup at RHP vs Secrets, We really liked the open setup at RHP, where the pool is right next to the beach area, with an infinity pool directly facing the ocean (see many pictures posted by other reviewers). Very beautiful. It was more quiet and relaxed at RHP than at Secrets since there wasn't a swim up bar at RHP (although it can be fun). 7) Activities - not much at RHP, Secrets offered more activities and it was more lively. But we were looking for relaxation so it didn't bother us a bit that RHP was more quiet. Although at Secrets, they have an awesome outdoor bar between the pool area and the main buildings with a ping pong table, a pool table, and darts. It was our favorite late afternoon stop. At RHP, we rented bicycles (free service) and rode to Playa del Carmen - it was a very nice ride, highly recommended. 8) Other tips - we've seen complaints on this site for getting later times for dinner reservations only to find empty seats at the restaurants - well, they have empty seats because during low seasons, they have less number of staff. And guests have different preferences as to when they eat (we generally eat later 8:30 to 9:30 - and there are guests from Spain who are used to eating after 11pm). If you absolutely can't wait for your reserved time, just go early, the hostess will do everything they can do to accommodate you. (during 8 nights of our stay, I think we showed up at the right reservation time only twice). Anything you want, just ask the staff, they will make it happen.", "Date": "September 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, Canada", "Title": "\u201cBest Place in Playacar\u201d", "Author": "Kenneth P", "ReviewID": "UR118702305", "Content": "This is the third time we have stayed at Royal Hideaway and we have yet to be disappointed.

The people selling things are the beach were the least pushy people I have ever seen and there are not that many of them. I have been to the secrets hotels in Riviera Maya and Jamaica and I thought that Royal Hideaway forsure had the best food. All restaraunts were really great. The grill had huge portions and all had great food. * for people that complained about portion size its irrevelant at any restaraunt I went to they would give me more of anything (ex. at Las Ventanas I requested double on the Lamb chops and they gave me 4 insead of 2) and you could order whatever you wanted. The Italian was also great. Lunch was also really good. Not sure why a lot of people did not go upstairs to the hispanic place but the Mahi Mahi and Shrimp Tacos were amazing and David was a awesome waiter! The hotel in my mind is 5 stars and I have traveled a lot and am really a person who enjoys good food. If you are into crazy night life not the hotel but you should know that going in. The drink guys at the pool were also right on you never would you not have a drink if you wanted one. Only things I can think of as constructive criticism. We were in Villa 23 the Paths were not very lit up like could barely especailly the side ones when walking to and from dinner. A few more options on the room service would have been good like a nachos or something because unlike all the other meals at restaraunts the room service food was not so good. Although the roomservice was very good about getting stuff to you fast including glasses of wine. These are all small things that are more suggestions. If you are looking just to relax and be pampered and spend time with your significant other and eat good food this is the hotel to go to.

Because of occupancy only two restaurants open a night. This limited the choices, also the dining times. Folks were a bit peeved at late reservations. Mexico and Spices the Mexican restaurant not open for the week, makes no sense, we were in Mexico. This also took away from sitting on the great deck area on wonderful evenings as there was only a bar open at the grill for one night, who wants to go 200 plus yards to fetch a drink?? Cesar the manager in Spices during breakfast and lunch was very obliging, and appreciated by us. However there are staff problems in that location, service was slow not just my observation, some of the waiters are unprofessional one was pulling faces behind peoples backs, another obviously had no interest in providing excellent service, it appeared he was more interested in the young lady hostess's, (who were very good even though it was a semester job) funny thing is Cesar this guy appeared to be your favorite and you failed to see his failings, training time needed on Marcus. I did not think the grounds were kept quite as neat as in the past, but glad Faustino looked after the pool so well. While talking staff not to many of the old ones around, although I have seen them in other resorts, seems the policies are rigid but the pay lacking, when again the resorts greatest assets are it's people. My favorite if I was asked to pick one is Isis Sr who just never stops, a wonderful obliging lady. Also really glad to see Max and Yolonda of management still on the team. I headed this resort HOME for I truly feel at home even with any imperfections, I love the place and was on my 10th trip there I hate to have to agree with the odd gripes that I have mentioned and hope it returns to it's past splendor ASAP so that I can once again give it a 5 star, guy's there is competition out there I know after 19 visits to the Yucatan!!

I am college aged and found it difficult to pick resorts along the maya riviera that would not be grotesquely animated and kid friendly. I am a seasoned traveler and had difficulty navigating the review so we relied on the advice of our travel agent and picked the place that was the most luxury for our money and let me tell you it was a good pick. Because it was the three of us we sprang for a two story room the hotel put a roll away bed in the living room for me to stay in. it was comfortable and i actually had the best view in the place. There were THREE balconies, two that overlooked the beach, one was HUGE and definitely allowed sunbathing but we chose to spend our time by the beach rather than in our room. the third overlooked the loud and obnoxious hotel next door. I heard about the noise complaints from previous reviews but can say that at night we never had a problem with noise. it always stopped around 10pm. The problem was that if one wanted to relax on the hammock or chairs at the room you would be bombarded by show tunes and loud almost auctioneering voices from next door. we got used to it but i must say it was highly annoying. The restaurants were first class, we never ate at the steak house or italian due to the fact that we had learned from other reviewers that these were not strong points. Every meal came with multiple courses so even if the plate wasn't large, you had six courses, so if you weren't full by the end then you probably shouldn't eat that much. Las ventanas was our favorite with the supreme service and piano music. Breakfast was great, twice we waited 5-7 mins for a table but we understood that we came at the the most popular eating time so it wasn't a problem. plus, they provide mimosas while you wait :) So many choices at every restaurant that it would be difficult not to find something you liked. We ordered room service a couple times for lunch or because we were out on an excursion and missed dinner. Bernardo was a sweetheart and provided extremely good service. His customer service was 5 star! There was beach waiter service and plenty of activities during the day in case you wanted to branch out and do water aerobics or bocce ball. One time, our excursion lasted longer than planned and the hotel called the excursion's office to ask where we were. It made us feel extra safe and protected to know the hotel was concerned about when we were supposed to return. Every time we left they took our room number down so as to make sure we came back safe and only certain taxis are allowed in the playacar development to begin with. we did not feel unsafe at any point during our trip, but having this extra attention and security measure was appreciated. Each building has its own concierge to arrange dinner reservations or even excursions and taxis as it was for us. it was great just to be able to rely on someone to call and make arrangements for us when necessary, and this was a service that we gave a tip for at the end of the week. Thanks Itze!! All and all the beach was beautiful and the resort was gorgeous, we took pictures in every nook possible. the infinity pool was incredible and the drink specials at the bar were delicious. We ended up having the vacation of our dreams due to the extra attention that the staff payed us and all of the amenities that were offered.

A little disappointed not to have a room in one of the central buildings, as pre-requested by email, but any concern allayed during stay with only occasional noise from adjacent hotel. Lovely room, with huge King Bed and plenty of storage space. Large bathroom with jacuzzi and separate shower, separate WC, as well as a small walk-in storage area containing safe.

Outside balcony ran length of room, with table and chairs, overlooking garden. Room cleaned to high standard. Evening turndown if required, but we never saw who did this! Although Gabriella was the concierge for our building, we did not really use her services. Beautiful gardens, well maintained. Highlight of the holiday was the abundance of wild life! From iguanas down by the pool, to coatis and agoutis roaming the grounds, to monkeys by the bar Allegria. Mind you, the person on the sun-lounger by the pool who reached down for her book and touched the 2-foot iguana will for ever remember her vacation! Pool area had more than enough loungers and parasols, although the parasols need a bit of tlc, with most having lost the steel pins to keep them erect! Nothing that a bit of boy-scout \"knotting\" couldn't fix! No shortage of towels, even on those days, when constant rain showers resulted in numbers of abandoned towels getting wet. Pool butlers very efficient and welcome! We were there at the same time as a couple from the US, who were obviously regular visitors, with their own reserved sun-loungers, great characters. In fact we met a number of people with whom we enjoyed a chat! Did not use the beach, other than a daily walk in either direction. Restaurants generally good, but do make sure you get your reservations in early. Ate in the Azia first evening, and throroughly enjoyed the experience. The spicy banana sauce with the prawn starter was to die for, trying to get recipe! Second evening found us in the al fresco Grill, down by the pool. Nothing special of note. Third evening we took in the Club Royale. It was circus evening, which was a load of fun, the jugglers were particularly good. Sadly, the food was not up to standard. It is a long time since I have been unable to finish a fillet steak, but this one was inedible.

The house wines were Chilean, which were adequate. Sadly, we were unable to use the Spices restaurant, which was closed for maintenance in the evening, during our stay. Apart from one evening, we did not make use of the wine list. Breakfast outside on the balcony of the Spices restaurant was most enjoyable, with wide selection of cereals, fruit and both cooked and cold food. We had lunch at the Deck every day with more than enough choices for us! The afternoon tea was a disappointment, with little choice and sandwiches which were in danger of turning up at the edges, in the heat . Not worth the bother of leaving the pool! We did not really use the bars in the evening, visiting the Alegria only once for a performance from a saxophonist accompanied by a singer, which was a pleasant experience. The barman in the Piano Bar was a great character, and we spent several evenings there. The male pianist was excellent, but the female not as good. To borrow from an old UK comedy show, she played all the right keys, but not necessarily in the right order! We had no complaints at all with regard to the quality of the drinks, never having to request \"top shelf\". Staff in all areas friendly and attentive! Don't be afraid to engage them in conversation. Most of them understood English, and were even able to interpret my schoolboy Spanish! We would not normally have treated ourselves to a hotel of this high standard, but we got a great deal from Expedia, which enabled us to spend 5 wonderful days here. If we can get a similar deal in the future, we will most definitely be back!", "Date": "August 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Resort will book again\u201d", "Author": "CHAPEAU", "ReviewID": "UR116637419", "Content": "My wife and I vacationed at the Royal Hideaway from the 31 of July @ 07 of August, 2011, booked with Transat holidays option plus was included and we were up graded to first class on both flights.

The layout of the resort is fantastic 20 minute walk to playa Del Carmen $7-$10 taxi drive back to the resort, all of restaurants have air conditioning except the deck/grill which is not needed located on the beach side, the infinity pool and area is just great they will serve you at the pool.

We had really high expectations after reading tripadvisor reviews and were so disappointed. It might be that we aren't the ideal clientele for RH (we love to cook, eat organic/sustainable/local, outdoor sports, etc). Quite possibly we should have done our research better, so keep that in mind. We did enjoy: - The Beach and infinity pool are both beautiful. A downside was that pool chairs were gone by 9:30 a.m. and we were never able to get one of the sun beds. We had to get up early and go lay down towels/books to get seats. - The service is outstanding. From bellmen to waiters to pool service, all wonderful, friendly and working hard! - Azia. Food was fairly good (although our waiter didn't seem to want to let us order 3 sushi rolls & encouraged us to just split 2- those are tiny!). We ate here twice. - Ventanas. Portions were tiny, and some of it was over-salted, but it was okay. We also ate here twice. - Piano Bar next to Ventanas. - Tea in afternoon- get the mexican coffee! Did not enjoy: - Noise from next door- we were in a villa that bordered the resort, and music went until 11/11:30 and sometimes later. - Uncomfortable mattress/ bedding. - The wine- they only had one variety by the glass (Frontera). The shiraz was decent, the rest not so good. And after several nights of drinking the same wine, it just doesn't taste good anymore. Also the whole flashy routine is silly (pouring for tasting after you've already drank it for 5 nights in a row). - Irons had strange dirty stuff coming out of them (sea salt? sand?). Ruined two shirts, and we went through 2 irons before they brought in a clean one. When we showed them to housekeeping, they made no effort to reimburse cleaning costs, etc. - Mold in bathrooms, peeling paint, green mold in shower, rust on balcony. - Jacuzzis around property were cold! We tried to go in at night a few times, and they were just a few degrees warmer than pool. We never saw anyone in them. - Fitness Center tiny and outdated. - We paid for airport transport and our reservation was messed up (company said we were going to a different hotel). It meant waiting on the blacktop at the Cancun airport in hot sun for about an hour until a van came for us. This was arranged through RH - Allegria Bar. Our drinks were awful and the couches were like something you'd expect in a frat house. Worn out, gross. - The food overall was super salty. We got very sick on our second day at Palazzo. I had the veal there and it was the worst I've ever had. We maintain a low-sodium diet at home, so this could have been why we got sick. We were sick from Day 2 through the end of our trip, off and on. - Stray Dogs. I know it's Mexico and they're everywhere, but it was super depressing to see them running around resort/behind restaurants. - The Deck (only real lunch option- Spices was just buffet food when we were there)- food wasn't good (the fish soup and watermelon gazpacho were awful) and I'd expect more from a 5star. - Breakfast. Awful. Probably the worst part of our trip. The buffet food was just standard, greasy food. I had a yogurt and some (not good) granola every day. Likewise, room service breakfast was super limited (toast/pastries and fruit). - Limited choices for restaurants at night (only a few open each night). Most people expect to gain a few lbs on vacation. We (combined) lost 10+ pounds in a week. This was because the portion were so small, food just wasn't worth eating, and being sick for the bulk of the trip. We are so disappointed that we spent so much $ here expecting a great vacation.", "Date": "August 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Hideaway with few downsides\u201d", "Author": "AndyMac94", "ReviewID": "UR116271973", "Content": "The Royal Hideaway Playacar was such a wonderful change from the first hotel we stopped at on this vacation, they would have had to poison us to keep us from loving it. Fortunately, they did not and my wife and I had such a wonderful stay. Distance from the Airport: Playacar is a bit of a drive/ride from the airport. The only reason I bring this up is that you might want to consider factoring this in to your travel time. My wife and I were fortunate enough to have private transfer and it was really nice as it allowed us to set a romantic tone as we watched the sights around us, such as they were. Playacar: I think the first thing we noticed about Playacar was how safe and secluded we felt. Every auto was checked at the gate before being allowed to proceed. Given the fears of violence in the area (vastly overblown in my opinion), this was a major plus for us. As soon as we drove in we were surrounded by fine resorts, lush tropical plants and the feeling that we were really in for something special. Again, this was just a great way to mentally get into vacation mode and set ourselves into romance mode. Checking In: Check in was wonderful and we were immediately offered a cool towel and I was offered champagne while my wife--who was pregnant--was provided with a chilled bottle of water. Both the towels and the drinks helped cut the humidity and were a nice touch . The reception area is in a private air conditioned room where you are seated prior to check in which also lends to a feeling that you are there to relax. Although we had just switched from hotel 1 to the Royal Hideaway 4 hours prior to our arrival, the hotel staff found our reservation quickly and before we knew it we were being shown to our room. The rooms are all located in bungalows with about 12-16 rooms/bungalow. Each bungalow had its own concierge to help you with anything you wanted which was great. Our concierge did not think our room would be to our liking -- it faced a loud RIU property next door so while she showed it to us, she also offered to get us a more secluded room away from the noise. This was incredibly thoughtful and we did end up going with another room, at no extra charge. Even though we changed our rooms, our luggage was brought to our new room and arrived within minutes. The rooms were nice and cool inside -- again, this is the tropics so a good A/C is so appreciated. The bed was VERY comfortable and such a welcome relief from the usual hard beds that are typical of many resorts in the Yucatan. There is a separate shower and jetted bath, double sinks and tastefully appointed rooms in general. We really liked the scented candle in the room and used it often during the evening for some added romance. ROOM SERVICE: Top notch, they cleaned everything, organized any clothes that were left out, always provided fresh towels and toiletries and kept us stocked with fresh cold water bottles, sodas and beers. During the evening, housekeeping would come back and provide a really lovely turn down service. CONCIERGE: While we did not need our concierge very often, she played a key role in our experience. First, she stopped by to introduce herself and ask if everything was great in the room, which it was. At our convenience, we were invited to stop by for a discussion on the grounds, restaurants, services, etc. Later that day, we stopped by to setup a couples massage and she made sure that they could provide a pregnancy massage during our scheduled time--this was nice because we did not have to spend one second on the phone asking all these questions, it was all done for us. In addition to our babymoon, we were also celebrating our 2nd anniversary and my 35th birthday, and the concierge had balloons everywhere in our room and door to make sure we celebrated in style. The chocolate cake she had set out for me was delicious. The concierge also arranged for a private photographer to come and do a babymoon photo shoot for us that has left us with some truly spectacular photos! As a final thank you, we received a nice card from our concierge a few weeks after we returned from our holiday thanking us again for staying with the RH.. The Grounds: Are gorgeous, tropical and lush. There had been rain for the two previous days so the soaking pools that are spread throughout the grounds were a bit dirty and full of leaves, but otherwise it was spotless. Also, you will see wildlife walking about the resort--there are lizards of all sizes, small brown beaver looking animals and a variety of birds. The nice thing is that you feel like you are the only people at the resort--could be a sign of the times, but we loved the solitude, we were not here to party. The Pool: The pool was really nice. Again, we were not here to party, so the fact that there were not activity directors everywhere trying to get us to do shots was perfect. There are two RIU Palaces nearby that would be better for guests seeking this kind of activity--they are nice as well. The staff was pretty good at reading your need if you needed a drink but there were times when we had to wait awhile. The infinity pool was just gorgeous and we spent a lot of time just relaxing and watching the sea, the palm trees framed the Caribbean like a perfect picture frame. there were plenty of bali beds available throughout the grounds and some of the pool/beach seats had hot tubs next to them-- a nice bonus. The BEACH The beach did have a good amount of shells on it, so it could be sharp at times, but they had to rebuild a good portion of this beach after hurricane season, so I was just glad that there was a beach. There is really nothing better than laying on the sand with your hands in the sand, feet in the sea (for those of you who have been there, you will recognize my thinly veiled reference to the resort theme song!) The ocean itself was beautiful with a light north to south current that was perfect for floating in. I felt pity for the folks stuck on the cruise ships! The FOOD Again, the global recession has really struck some of the high end resorts and the RH was no exception. This was most obvious when one noted that not all the restaurants are open every night, which is really too bad. We absolutely loved the Mexican restaurant for lunch, the wait staff there was remarkable, made cute animals for us and always remembered what we were drinking and willing to make virgin versions for pregnant wife! The breakfast was nice and all the windows provide a perfect view of the morning sun rising over the sea. Asia was our favorite restaurant by far--the teppanyaki show was really top notch as was the food, wish we could have gone again, but we wanted to hit all the restaurants. The food is just incredible! The Italian restaurant is also good, although the food was better the second time we went for dinner. I always recommend trying the grappa as a finishing digestiv--that is bloody firewater! Finally, the modern restaurant was also good, just not really our favorite style of food, but quite nicely executed. We did not eat at the steak house (no A/C) or Mexican restaurant for dinner (not open during stay for dinner). Again, the service was really nice and the food was surprisingly good, the best we have had in Mexico and well worth the price of admission for this high end resort. The dessert at Azia is not to be missed! The SPA: All spas are pricey and this was no exception. The service was really nice and we did not regret spending the $$$ The spa facilities were rather nice as well. The CONS: (1) There is a stunning theater that only has shows 1 night of the week. We were not there so we did not get to enjoy any on premise entertainment. One of the things we love about RIU are the nightly shows, which while cheesy, are really entertaining and a nice way to avoid having to leave the property; (2) Wish all restaurants were accessible every night; Really minor blips, we had a wonderful time and felt like we were at our own private resort the entire time . . . to us, this was not a bad thing!", "Date": "August 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful\u201d", "Author": "CMcc24", "ReviewID": "UR116230310", "Content": "Fantastic resort.

We heard mixed reviews about some of the restaurants but everything must have been personal taste because we really enjoyed all of them. Las Ventanas could go a little larger on the portions and was probably our least favorite but still delicious. Have a chocolate martini after dinner at the piano bar or at the other bar downstairs. Some recommendations. Make dinner reservations the moment you arrive. Go to the mexican restaurant for lunch once or twice instead of the deck (just different and delicious). If you don't like ALOT of mariachi, you might want to skip the dinner show ( we left early, along with several others). At Azia, If you like watching the cook at hibachi restaurants ask to be seated at hibachi table if you don't mind sitting with others. Some have said the hot food is better if you do this too. There was an unfortunate storm system while we were there so we didn't get to take advantage of many of the ocean sports, site seeing etc. but even with bad weather our stay was still AMAZING!!!! I would definately repeat this trip! One thing we felt a little misled on was the advertised honeymoon package with the \"room upgrade based on availability\". Basically we checked several times and there was never availabilty since the upgrade is just an ocean view room and there are only 8 of them. The resort was at 30% capacity when we were there so if no upgrades are available with low capacity....chances are very low during high tourist season. But that being said...you really don't need it.

The grounds and pool areas were kept nicely. Maid service twice daily. The staff was wonderful-they knew you by name. A nice personal touch. The concierge was always willing to help in any way. Food~~good and bad. The breakfast buffet was not up to par. Cold scrambled eggs turned me off the first day. I think there should have been an option to have a menu to order from--I am not a buffet person. The rest of the vaction I ordered room service but only continental breakfast was offered, so very limited as to what you could eat for breakfast. Palazzo was wonderful-my favorite restaurant. The beef tenderloin was delicious. The atmosphere was quiet and romantic. Very nice ambience. The Grill was good as I am a picky eater. Very easy to choose and we ate there twice and was not disappointed either time. Very nice view of the ocean-laid back but still a very nice atmosphere. Club Royale--all negatives... Magic Show was a bit silly for an adult resort. Different entertainment would have been more suitable. The food was awful and not much of it. It was like bad wedding food with way too much salt and the entree was served in the dark as the show was going on so it was difficult to even see what you were eating. Also the service was lacking--we had one drink and no one returned to ask us if we wanted anything else. Wine choices at dinner were very limited. They need to expand on that. It became quite boring having the same wine every night. Accomodations---be very careful what villa you stay in. We had a duplex suite and were in villa 31. Our bedroom faced the resort next door--RIU. There was constant noise to the point we could not even sleep. The banging of drums and just noise in general went until at least 11:30 each night. We called the front desk to complain several times but to no avail. They said they have ongoing problems with that resort (it is a family resort) but really can't solve the problem. We could not even watch TV or a movie--you could still hear the constant banging. Our suite was pricey and I thought I did my homework prior to booking it but you don't know until you get there what problems may occur. This was a huge drawback for us as we like quiet and we did go to an \"adult\" resort for that reason. The pool service was excellent. They do need more entertainment as evenings provided nothing to do except go to one of the bars. I think all in all this is a 4 star resort--not a 5 star.

We chose this hotel based on the overall package as well as reviews. We didn't want to go to a \"mega resort\" where you have to fight for a spot on the beach, wake up at 6AM to safe a lounge chair, or be forced to listen to loud music at all hours in the night. We found this resort and liked it based on what most of the reviewers said. If you're looking for a quiet, relaxing, low key vacation, this hotel is for you. It has around 200 rooms, and it was filled with couples around their mid-30s to mid-50s. A few days before we left for Playacar, we called the hotel to request a villa that is more centrally located. They processed the request, but when we arrived, we were told our villa was on the edge. The reason we requested this was based on a reviewer who said to ask for center villas due to noise from the both resorts flanking RH. When we tried to switch rooms, we were told none were available in any other villas that were in the luxury class. If we wanted to upgrade our room, we would be placed on a waiting list. Now upon our arrival, we were told that it was a quiet weekend, but they expected more people to arrive within a week. It was true. There were always a decent amount of spots by the main pool, and lots of lounge seats on the beach. Then my husband started to suspect that the villas that were centered were not all open. I think to keep costs down, they had a slimmer staff, and didn't have all the villas opened. I understand why they would do that, but it still irked me considering I had a hard time sleeping due to the bass music that started EVERY night around 10PM. But judging from the noise on the other side where RIU sits, I was happy I wasn't there. Anyways, I was in Las Violetas, Villa 23. The rooms are very small, and I do agree that it is a beautiful hotel, but probably needs a facelift fairly soon. Another item worth mentioning is that we had a $500 resort credit to use. Don't let that number fool you into thinking you can do what you wish with it. When we were checking in, the front desk told us we had our credit, gave us a little printout showing how the credits were broken down. He also asked if we wanted to leave our credit card number on file w/ them so we can charge any misc. items to our room. We thought, no, it's an all inclusive hotel so we figured we'll just pay for any items as we go along. As for the printout, it basically says you have $25 towards a bottle of wine credit (4x), $40 per person for a spa treatment, and around $75 towards a room upgrade. So that credit was somewhat worthless b/c you never really use all of it if you don't want to do a spa treatment or upgrade your room. We ran into a problem during dinner when we purchased a bottle of wine. When we said we had a wine credit, they had no idea what we were talking about. Basically we ended up paying for it and then had to make a trip to the front desk to figure out what was going on. He informed us that in order to take advantage of any credits, we were REQUIRED to leave a cc number with them. That would have been nice to know when we were first checking in. The wine and food at RH were decent. I was getting very tired of the wine from Chile. It started to make me gag. This is why we started to purchase other bottles instead of what was included in our deal. The food was also decent. My favorite dinners were at Palazzo and Las Ventanas. Some dishes were incredibly salty. I would recommend you ask them to go easy on the salt. Breakfast was low key, and decent, and lunches were also low key. Nothing fabulous, but just okay. I think those that have complaints about the food have to keep in mind this isn't a true 5 star resort. It's an all inclusive, so I feel that you can't really compare it to the Ritz or Four Seasons. Oh, and I also recommend you ordering multiple appetizers if you're hungry. Portions are TINY. For example, when you order mozzarella sticks and jalapeno poppers at lunch, you get 3 pieces each. I thought the glitches were worth mentioning, but I don't want people to think I didn't enjoy my stay or liked the resort. My husband and I had a wonderful time, always had a spot by the pool or on the beach, and fell in love with the staff! Seriously, service was unbelievable here. Everyone is so genuine, sweet and on top of it. They just need to iron out a few glitches, and update the resort a bit. But other than that, it was a great stay!

I do feel, however, that reviews are very subjective and apply when in similar situations. So, my boyfriend and I went on this vacation the first week in June as a celebration for my completion of a Master's degree. We are from NY and have the luxury of enjoying great food. We typically take one special vacation each year. I will be as concise, yet detailed, in my review to benefit readers: 1. Transportation: just a note, we found this to be quite \"shady\". When we spoke to the resort prior to the start of our vacation, they could not confirm a definite answer on how to get there from the airport. We decided to grab a private car when we arrived in Cancun, which was more because of some roundabout explanation about having to pay Government taxes. And, even as we planned our departure back home, it still seemed complicated scheduling a ride to the airport. If you can, do this in advance. The private (vs. shared) car is more expensive, but worth it since Royal Hideaway is further than other resorts. 2. Weather: I was so skeptical about going in June because I also review weather extensively and June has much rain. People told me \"Oh, it doesn't rain in Mexico, and if it does it's a quick afternoon shower.\" We had 3 beautiful, sunny days, 1 when it rained and poured, and another rainy cloudy day. So, it does rain and it does last! Just fyi! 3. Beach: the water is such a beautiful blue! However, we were disappointed with the sand (very rocky with shells, making it quite difficult to walk on, except along the shoreline) and the water itself. The water isn't clear like I had expected, and is very sandy, so you walk out of the water with sand all over your skin. We stayed at the pool the majority of our stay. 4. Rooms: We liked the room, It was definitely spacious enough for us, with a nice walk-in closet. The AC worked well, and was almost too cold at times. The water temp in the shower was also fine. The shower is pretty small, enough for one person. We were disappointed with the spa tub...it's small, again definitely just for one person. We didn't use this, unfortunately. The bed was, eh, slightly uncomfortable but we slept. 5. The Grounds: It's a lovely, peaceful resort. We loved the separate villas. It is VERY quiet, which is fine if that's what you want (but just be advised). It wasn't crowded when we were there (at first...read on), and at times at night we felt we were the only ones there. But we were ok with this (although, to have a bit more at night would be fun). 6. Company Functions: Let me just say this now; during our stay, Liberty Travel had approx. 20 employees there for some function. They were so obnoxious and really ruined part of the stay. I had read other people metion this and though, \"it can't be that bad,\" but it really was. For such a quiet, couples-geared resort, I was surprised they even allow this. This group was drunk for breakfast on. The resort closed the Piano Bar one night for their function, leaving only the smaller, less-exciting bar open. Really!? We were trying to have a romantic dinner at Palazzo one night, with a lovely violinist playing, and this group was extremely noisy. It's just unfortunate that people trying to have a relaxing, romantic vacation have to deal with this situation. Next time, I will certainly ask if any functions are scheduled during my anticipated time of stay. 7. Spa: we made appointements for 2 massages. We were told over the phone that we could choose which massage upon arrival at the spa. This never happened. We arrived and were quickly escorted to our respective changing rooms. We also requested one male, one female (male for me, female for my boyfriend). However, as the massage was about to begin, the female therapist came into my room. We had to explain, while in our robes and trying to relax for our massage, that we wanted the opposite sex. We were then still never asked which massage we wanted and given the basic Swedish massage. The experience was unfortunate and disappointing overall. 8. Restaurants: Ok, well this is where the resort desperately fell short of our expectations. First and foremost...make reservations!!! And you can do this one week prior to your arrival date. We were annoyed that only certain restaurants were open each night, usually 2. We never got to eat at The Grill because it was only open one night and reservations weren't available until 10! Club Royale is only open on Wednesday. This makes absolutely no sense!!! I really wish that would be changed. Las Ventanas: Our first night, we went to Las Ventanas. Our LEAST favorite!! Let me reassure you that we were not rating the food by comparing to what we eat in NY. It's all-inclusive, so expectations are already lowered. But, we had dishes during our stay that were completely inedible!! Las Ventanas tries way too hard to be fancy and upscale, and they just fail misreably. It's just simply silly how their meals are, extremely small and lacking flavor. Meals were edible, at least, but forgettable. Although, I had salmon, asked for medium rare, and was so overcooked I couldn't eat it. It tasted like Bumble Bee salmon from a package. Palazzo: The Italian one. This was fair. Dishes were ok, the inside was very lovely. Plates were small, but much larger than Las Ventanas (and we're not big eaters). However, along the lines of inedible food was part of a ceasar salad that included \"frozen anchovy cream.\" Let me say, it tasted even worse than it sounds, if that's possible! It was awful!! Tuna was pretty dry and octopus was very fishy. Azia: The Fusion one. To our surprise, our favorite. Sushi rolls were decent, but we had phenomenal service here. We absolutely loved our sweet, attentive server Juan, as well as the maitre'd. We didn't care for the beef entree, though. The dinner was good. However, we feel that the others were SO bad that this one just seemed great. So, what we typically did is filled up on the breakfast buffet (although, it was the same daily). We would have a light late snack at the pool to fill-up, then a fairly light dinner. Overall, it was a nice stay, but for \"5 Star\" we were definitely disappointed. I can't say, however, if I do or don't recommend this resort because we didn't stay at any others, so I have nothing to compare in the area.

We visit the Mayan Riveria several times each year and have stayed at the RH over 10 times since 2000. I can say that the beach in front of the resort was better than it has ever been, deeper, clean as always and not at all like some older reviews have listed. The service was top notch and we saw several familiar faces which speaks well of the staff and hotel. The quality is there and you chose what premium liquors you want and the food is varied and much better than other resorts. The pool area has been expanded and the cabanas were attractive and comfortable. No problenm with poolside seating as there are plenty of chairs umbrellas and space.

The check in went smoothly. Champagne, moist towel and cookies offered. We were in 2626 which I did request an interior building with the top floor. They honored our request. Loved the room, they decorated with towel swans and balloons on our anniversary and the next day with a towel as a girl. Always had turned down service and looked like they put out fresh towels in the evening also. Service is spotless! I reserved The Chefs Table by email before arriving and had attempted to request other restaurants but since we checked in on a Sunday and the reservations are Friday to Friday the restaurant choices changed since we had discussed online with Cynthia. No worries, we booked our dinners when we checked in. There were only 2 restaurants open an evening. First of all -The Magic Show. We did not eat there. We went to the Mayan Show on our last trip. I really liked the Mayan Show but then again I like dancing and they were really good professional dancers. The theatre is hot and takes some time to warm up. The Magic Show was lame! They did include the audience so maybe those folks liked it. We had to keep from falling asleep. It was actually funny-we were laughing as it was so lame. But that's just my opinion. Day 1: Las Ventanas: We had a late dinner. That was what was available so we made sure to have appetizers before 6pm at The Deck. We had the tasting menu. Most things were good with smaller portions. We were \u201callowed\u201d 1 change to each category on the tasting menu. I thought that was interesting as we could have what we wanted. We switched up one entr\u00e9e and 1 desert. What we enjoyed the most from dinner was: Portobello Linguini and Shrimp appetizer, Sea Scallops in Chocolate-Mole Marinated, Coconut Sauce and Pear Glaze, New York Steak with Grilled Bell Peppers and for desert- Apple Tart and Chocolate Roll Day 2: The Chefs Table Dinner was incredible! The Chef planned a 12 course meal which was delicious! We had 2 servers which one included the dining room manager. We were waited on hand and foot. The Chef was also very nice and enjoyable to talk to and explained his dishes and why he chose each dish. One was frozen clamata juice, beer foam, and peanut crusted oysters. Sounds strange but really worked. One appetizer was chocolate covered foi gras (which I never had before) and tasted like a peanut butter cup but so much better! Everything was presented wonderfully and tasted great. Day 3: Azias. We ate in the Tatimi room. The best things for dinner were the spicy tuna roll and what ever their eggroll is called. They ran out of the Beef Tenderloin. The dinner was very good and they brought seconds of what we loved. I would go to this restaurant twice if I had the time and eat at the Hibachi Grill also it smelled great. Wish the restaurant was open more days because you can go to the sushi bar whenever you want to at dinner time in addition to your dinner meal. Day 4: Palazzos: The Caesar salad is very good and also the Carbonarra is good but that night the chef had the pasta noodles sticking together. I had the beef tenderloin very good and the tiramisu was also very good. We sat on the patio-great view. High Tea: Don't miss this! Between 4-6pm up near reception. We sat in the open area for the breeze. They make the BEST mayan coffee! I drank dirty monkeys and frozen white Russians with extra kahula. We had a beach bed each day and there were open beds until 10am. Plenty of loungers by the pool. The deck was good for lunch. Didn\u2019t really care for Spices for lunch and breakfast was so so. I realized how much more I enjoyed the Mexican food in Mazatlan where my mom has a time share and decided next trip we\u2019ll go there even though it is a much longer flight. We went into town only for souvenir shopping. Room service was excellent-ordered nachos and desert one night. I would highly recommend this resort for those who love great service like the Ritz, want to have a laid back vacation, and who love good food and service! Internet worked well in my room, around the pool, and beach beds. It did not work near reception or in the restaurants. I turned my IPhone to internet only. People were using their IPads at the pool. You can also use the internet in the business center.

As honeymooners we had high hopes, particularly since we'd read many of the glowing reports on TripAdvisor before we booked, so it was a pleasure (and a relief) not to be disappointed!! Basically, we agree wholeheartedly with all the positive comments made regarding the accommodation, grounds, beach, facilities and service (so will avoid repeating). We do wish to emphasise though that the waiters/staff are friendly and attentive doing everything in their power to make your stay as comfortable and relaxing as possible. We were particularly impressed by the quality of the 'pool food' supplied by the 'Deck' and the range and seemingly endless supply of cocktails that came our way whilst lounging by (and in) the pool. Perhaps the Deck bar could have remained opened longer (past 6pm), but we generally took this as our cue to take a final dip in the pool/sea, get cleaned-up back in the room and then head-over to the Allegria or Piano bar for drinks before our evening meal. Kayaking is free and snorkelling is just $33 USD for approx. 1 hour in the water at a reef 15min (boat ride) from the RH. You have to wear life-jackets so diving isn't really possible, or necessary, since the fish come to you! We didn't bother with any of the other extras, but for those interested: Dinner on the beach is $300 USD and an hour's massage will set you back approx $120 USD. There's also a $4500 USD bottle of wine if you fancy it. The only 'wrinkle' during our 7 day stay was the drama surrounding a cabana bed. With only 8 in total you'll find them in demand, so it's quite frustrating to see them monopolised by some guests (a minority) who think it's reasonable to claim one (with a bag or towel) and then disappear for an hour or two. Unfortunately the staff are reluctant to enforce the 20min vacancy rule (clearly displayed via a notice on each bed, 'use it or lose it'), so having watched a bed remain idle for just over an hour we decided to remove said bag and actually make use of it. A full 30min after that the 'owners' returned from their extended-lunch, explaining at some length and with raised voices their displeasure at having been evicted, adding some carefully chosen swear-words before taking their grievance to one of the staff, who dutifully found them a newly vacated cabana, which they then declined. Worth the agro? Probably not, but perhaps those unpleasant people will reflect on their behaviour and will in future play fair and share?? Come on people, we're on vacation!

By basis of comparison, we have stayed at the Iberostar Grande Paraiso (3 times), Excellence Riviera Cancun, Le Blanc, and Secrets Maroma Beach. OVERALL VIBE The vibe is elegant without being stuffy. The look and feel is a cross between a hacienda and a West Indies plantation. I felt like I was a guest at a private estate. Quiet couples who are content to read and socialize with other quiet couples would be most comfortable here. This is not a romance factory \u2013 don\u2019t expect any banner on your door proclaiming \u201cHoneymoon\u201d or \u201cAnniversary.\u201d There is no swim-up bar, and minimal planned activities. This is not an active, noisy resort and guests who try to stir things up with loud music at the pool and antics will stand out like sore thumbs. The resort is rather like the grand old dame aunt who is not quite ready for another face lift \u2013 but close to it. The word that comes to mind is \u201cpretty.\u201d Not striking, and with minimal \u201cwow factor\u201d but a pretty resort that feels comfortable and elegant at the same time, without any pretension. ACCOMMODATIONS Some buildings are three stories, other two. We had a room on the top floor of Building 26 (second floor). Each building is villa-like and has a name and number, and is round with a circular central courtyard and fountain. Each villa has a concierge who makes your dinner reservations. We loved the location of the building as it is in the middle of the resort, so you don\u2019t get noise from the two larger resorts on each side of RHP. If you are sensitive to noise, I would especially stay away from the side of the resort that borders on the giant Riu resort; it is a noise factory. Buildings 27, 29, 30 and 31 border the Riu. Buildings in the middle are: 25, 26 and 27 (with 27 being closest to the main pool and the ocean). Buildings 21, 22, 23, and 24 border the Occidental next door. The rooms are on the smaller side for a luxury all inclusive, but very comfortable. We had a top floor room with vaulted ceilings and I think that made a difference in the ambiance of the room. Note: do not request the top floor if you have mobility issues \u2013 there are no elevators in the villas. The d\u00e9cor is earth tones and neutrals. Bedding was of high quality. The mattress was a bit older, bouncy but comfortable. Lighting in the room could have been better as the room always seemed a bit dim at night. Bathroom is large and private, with a separate toilet room with a solid door. Shower is fairly large \u2013 but not a two person shower. Double sinks in the vanity and a large closet with ample hangers and a safe. There is a jetted tub. Water temperature did vary in the shower. The bathroom did have lots of small ants running around on the vanity, but it is the tropics. The minibar is very basic with: bottled water, Coke, Diet Coke, Sprite, and Orange Fanta. Also, three cans of beer (Modelo maybe?). No snacks are provided in the room. Each room has a balcony with at least two chairs and a glass-topped table. The rooms are very well-kept and clean. Housekeeping was excellent. Our room was made up at the same time each day, and turned down at night every night without fail. The Iberostar Grand is the winner in the room category; the bed is heavenly and the furnishings luxurious. Secrets Maroma is a runner up. I\u2019d put RHP third. Rooms at Le Blanc are luxurious, but small and a bit claustrophobic (I think because of the lack of balcony and small baths), rooms at Excellence Riviera Cancun are dated and tired, and seriously need some revamping, finer linens, and new mattresses. FOOD I thought that the food in general was excellent. It was well-prepared, of very good quality and nicely but simply presented. Breakfast is a bit of a disappointment, and the Achilles\u2019s heel of the food service. It is mostly buffet, with an omelette station. See attached photos. The food was tasty but the presentation was lacking, especially when compared to that of other luxury adult-only all inclusive resorts. Breakfast is served in Spices, and it is HOT in there in the morning with the sun streaming through the large windows. Excellence does a fabulous breakfast, as does Le Blanc. One day we ate at the ala carte Spices (Mexican) and it was excellent, but we preferred the more casual The Deck. Service was fast and excellent, and the menu has something for every palate \u2013 salads, soups, pizza, burgers, and more heavy main courses. You can also order anything from The Deck menu poolside or on the beach. We enjoyed Buffalo wings in our poolside lounge chairs on several days. Reservations are required for all dinner restaurants. We enjoyed The Grill (where they don\u2019t grill but actually pan fry), Azia, and Palazzo. Our meal at the gourmet Las Ventanas was well-prepared but the menu is a bit odd. It was my least favorite dining experience. Many of the entrees are prepared with olive oil instead of butter and as a result, the entrees are lighter in tone than other places \u2013 the Iberostar Grand comes to mind where many of the entrees are in heavy cream or butter-based sauces. I still think Le Blanc offers the best dinner dining experiences, but Royal Hideaway is a close second except for\u2026 the wine. One thing that is a negative for this level of resort: the included wines are limited to ONE brand, a Chilean brand called Frontera by Concha y Toro. It is a nice, inexpensive wine that we actually drink at home, but it is the ONLY wine available without an upcharge, and only by the glass. Oenophiles are sure to be disappointed. Le Blanc and the Iberostar Grand do a nice job (Le Blanc the best) at culling an included wine list with wines available by the bottle. Since it is the only wine, it does get a bit silly the whole wine tasting ritual at each dinner restaurant \u2013 since you are \u201ctasting\u201d the same $8/bottle wine each evening. Wine availability is on par with Secrets Maroma or Excellence, yet the price point for RHP is much higher and the wines should be available accordingly. Summary, the best food for us was still Le Blanc, but Royal Hideaway is a close second. While we had dishes that we did not enjoy (the NY strip steak in the grill was so chewy it was almost inedible), in general, the food was very well prepared and tasty. Service was efficient in all of the restaurants. SERVICE The best service I have yet to experience at any hotel in Mexico has been at Royal Hideaway. The employees seem happy with their jobs, and it is reflected in the service. There is nothing forced about the service, or scripted (Secrets Maroma takes the cake on scripted, weird, service) \u2013 just plain \u2018ole excellent service; drinks, restaurants, housekeeping \u2013 all excellent. We only had two snafus in 10 days: 1) they forgot to acknowledge our 25th anniversary. They had four alerts about it (initial booking, phone call to resort 4 days before arrival, on arrival/check in, and lastly, with the concierge who welcomed us and made the dinner reservations). Also, the last day we ordered room service before departing and it didn\u2019t arrive in a timely manner and we had to cancel it. Other than that, our service experience was stellar so much so that it blew Le Blanc and the Grand out of running. Secrets Maroma and Excellence do not even get an honorable mention from me in this category. BEACH The reclaimed beach at RHP is very wide. There is slope leading down to the water, and while the beach is very long, it is hard to walk on if you like beach strolls, due to the slope. Getting in the ocean, there is a slope, too, with a 3-foot wide collection of shells and small rocks to traverse. Once past, the ocean floor is sandy, rock free, and level. Expect a small undertow and moderate waves. In 10 days, there was never a totally calm surf day, but neither was there \u201cred flag\u201d days. There is a water sports activity outpost next door at the Riu, and the result is some times you do smell diesel from the boats as they get ready to leave. There is jet ski, parasailing and boating action but it doesn\u2019t detract from the tranquility of the beach. One major downfall is the lack of shade on the beach. There are some delightful palm trees at the beginning of the beach that offer some shifting shade. The resort offers a canvas cover to go over the lounge chairs that can be tied down which offers some shade \u2013 but then you have to cover your legs with a towel. The beach lounge chairs are the most uncomfortable of any beach chair I have experienced; there is no way to get them to adjust so you can sit up, and they bounce around a bit. The resort really should offer some sort of more durable shade, such as palapas or even umbrellas. We are beach people, but we were unable to sit on the beach due to the lack of shade. Winner in this category: The Iberostar Grand for the spacious beach palapas and comfortable chairs, and Secrets Maroma for the glorious, sandy Maroma beach. POOLS The main pool is an infinity pool. It is in excellent repair, and is very clean, as is the other pool right behind the infinity pool. There are wooden loungers with cushions that make for fairly comfortable seating, although the chairs are very heavy and difficult to move and the cushions need replacing. The cloth umbrellas offer shade, but you do need to move a heavy concrete base around to get shade. One negative: the music they play at the pool is the same jazz tracks over and over, every day. The CD repeats itself 3-4 times per day and the music is really grating once you become aware of it; the good thing is that the volume is really low. But you may want to bring an iPod! There are several smaller pools scattered throughout the property that are very picturesque; I didn\u2019t use them, but they sure are pretty. Drink service at the pool and beach was excellent. There is no swim-up bar but you will not lack for bar service. OVERALL I really enjoyed my stay at RHP. But something was missing. I\u2019m not really sure how to express it. Every resort I\u2019ve stayed at in Mexico has had a certain something that is its signature: The Iberostar Grand: the pools, beach layout, and comfortable rooms; Le Blanc: the stylish vibe, the food, and the spa; Excellence Riviera Cancun: the meandering pools; Secrets Maroma: the amazing ocean water. Royal Hideaway? There is nothing for me that instantly jumps out. I don\u2019t know how to define it. And maybe that is it; it is missing a component that makes you go, \u201cWOW.\u201d My husband thinks that RPH\u2019s wow factor is the sincere, friendly staff and service; not over the top and fake or scripted but being treated like an old, returning friend. I loved RH for the peace and quiet, the lovely pool, the food, and the service.

They were always very attentive and were quick to accomodate any request. Our luggage was in our room as they said it would be and after a quick power nap and change into bathing suits, we headed to the two pools. They are wonderful. Plenty of lounge chairs, umbrellas, free cabanas, poolside wait staff...can't say enough. The temperatures of the pools were perfect...one was kept just a bit cool to be refreshing and the other you could slide into like bath water. The pools never felt crowded. The best chairs were taken by about 9:00 but there were always plenty of chairs open. The room was nice but not fabulous. We've stayed in nicer rooms. The shower water temperature was irratic most of the time. Tried different times of the day with no luck either. The food was good, not great. But the staff was incredible. They were very attentive and quick to accomodate any request. Husband didn't like \"dressing for dinner\" in long pants. But it was okay.

We felt that 2 days was good enough to get a feel for the resort so we could return again next year for a much, much longer stay. I was really looking forward to receiving their world class service, I have had this resort on my list for many years, I was so elated to see & experience it for myself finally. We had very high expectations but they really missed the mark in terms of the service as well as the food but there were many other issues as well. Some issues were more trivial than others but this was our experience & or observations. I am glad that we only stayed for the 2 days. We arrived around 12:30 pm & the check-in process was pretty smooth, we were each given a nice glass of champagne & cool towel. We were told that we were in Villa 27 in room 2724, what a great location, we were very pleased. We knew our room wouldn't be ready until 3pm so we decided to take a look around & have lunch. We walked around the lobby & it was so breathtaking, the entire resort was so aesthetically pleasing. The beach was expansive, absolutely beautiful the resort had a very tranquil feel to it but at that point, unfortunately, that's where it ended for us. We went to lunch right on the beach, the menu seemed great. We ordered a couple of drinks & had lunch. The food was not very good at all. I ordered the octopus appetizer along w/ the watermelon gazpacho soup & it was a was big let down. Both lacked flavor, very dull/boring & the octopus was rubbery. The beef in the burrito was just okay but the tortillas was very dry. Oh well, I thought no big deal, move on. I asked my husband & he had the same issues w/ his meal as well, no flavor. We brushed it off & decided to go get our swimsuits out of our luggage, we were planning on having a great afternoon at the beach & the pool. We went back to see our concierge a little before 3 pm & we were able to make our dinner reservations. The concierge was very nice & she highly recommended Las Ventanas (international) it was their signature restaurant, so we were really looking forward to a nice formal gourmet dinner. We went up to our suite & my first overall impression was wow, what a nice looking suite but then after having a closer look around I started to notice some not so good things. Now some of these things may seem like I am knit picking but I feel they are worthy of mentioning. The mini fridge had 2 cans of Modelos, 2 bottles of water, 2 cans of soda & 1 can of sparkling water, that's it, no snacks. I wasn't expecting that from a 5 star resort. There were no available power outlets in the room they were all occupied. 2 of the occupied outlets were behind the very heavy nightstands which were hard to move. The only other outlet was located behind the table which was also being occupied by the coffee maker & the lamp. No big deal having to unplug the lamp or the coffee maker but why don't they have at least one available unoccupied outlet in the room itself, sorry but that is a pet peeve of mine. The shower constantly ran from hot to cold no mater how many times I readjusted it, it wouldn't stop so I just took very quick showers to avoid that issue. We had a constant dripping noise coming from the a/c vent in the bathroom so we shut the doors to the bathroom at night & that helped. The safe is not big enough for a laptop so please keep that in mind, also the closet doors were extremely hard to move back & forth, very annoying. One of doors on the entertainment cabinet was pretty bad, I really didn't want to move it around to much in fear that it would break, the suite was definitely showing it's age. No toothpaste in the bath room so make sure you bring your own. No hamper to put your dirty towels in either so we just left them on the floor. There were ants running allover the tables in our room. I suspect they were in other areas as well but I only noticed them on the tables, they were so tiny you could hardly see them but thank goodness they didn't bite. We had no iPod dock & or stereo system in our room, we were told that they had just finished installing all of them. I was looking forward to listening to our music but again oh well. The wifi in our suite was absolutely ridiculous, we couldn't get online the first day at all (& yes we had the code) We called down & the tech. was also unable to help, again not the end of the world but we couldn't pick up wifi in any other part of the resort either, not a world class resort imo. The following day my husband went to the business center to print our boarding passes. If you need to do so please allow plenty of time b/c those computers moved at a snails pace, it took him over 30 minutes & he is extremely computer savvy as well. We split our 1st day in two after lunch. We spent a few hours on the beach, which was very nice, extremely relaxing & then we spent the rest of our late afternoon/early evening by the pool. Service on the beach was okay but the beach itself made up for that, the water was so nice, a bit of seaweed but who cares, we had a lot of fun swimming. Our time at the pool, not so fun. We were skipped by the servers basically the entire time we were there. The servers were going around asking the guests if they wanted food/drinks etc... all the while skipping over us. I walked up to the bar myself, no biggie but the big kick in the pants for us was that the pool bar closed so early. I believe it closed right around 6 pm. Once again we watched the staff go around after the last call, everyone else was waited on except for us. I kept feeling like we had done something wrong (if you are thinking we weren't tipping, we most certainly were the entire time no matter how long the service took & or if the orders came back correct or not it didn't matter to us we still tipped regardless) We figured we would just go to another bar if we wanted to get another drink, but we tried & their were only 2 other locations, neither of which you could go to casually in a swimsuit. That was another big let down. We headed back to the suite to prepare for dinner, we drank our 2 Modelos, showered up & tried to turn on the TV (I like to watch TV while getting ready for dinner) but nothing, it didn't work! My husband took a look around & there was no power cord at all. We called maintenance & explained the problem over the phone. They came & told my husband he was wrong, the guy said the power cord wasn't the problem. My husband stood there & watched the guy figure it out & then the he said \"I guess you were right\". By the time he got the cord & TV set up I was ready to go to dinner so again not the end of the world but just another hiccup. We went to dinner just to experience another similar situation in regard to the service we had earlier, we felt like we were back at the pool all over again. We would watch them go around waiting on everyone else while we just sat there w/ empty glasses, again feeling like we had done something wrong. We ordered off of the tasting menu & another huge blunder, the food was not very good at all, it was very bland to say the least again another misfortune for us. We are not food snobs at all and we were very sad when we left the restaurant, extremely let down. BTW this was not a formal restaurant at all. I chose to were a gown b/c I was told it was formal but ladies you can basically were whatever you want, so bring on the club wear if you like, hahaha! What a sight to see at a formal restaurant, again was not expecting that at all but to each her own. After dinner we walked down to Allegria, it was karaoke night. I am not a big karaoke fan at all so we went back up to the piano bar. We sat outside after we ordered from the bar, we chatted w/ a lovely couple from Toronto for a bit. The bartender came out asked the other couple if they wanted something else from the bar & didn't ask us. Shortly thereafter the lights were shut off & the place closed for the evening, we thought oh no, now what? There were no where other bars to go to other than Allegria & I didn't want to sit through the awful karaoke. Sorry but it was really bad, I was waiting for the dogs in the area to start howling at any given moment, hahaha. We called it a night & went back to the suite, a little blue, but we did sleep well. The bed was very comfortable so that was good. The next morning we went to order breakfast from room service since we were checking out a little before noon but unfortunately they only offered a continental breakfast, another let down. I kept thinking what kind of high class resort doesn't offer a decent room service menu for breakfast? We tried not to let it get us down so we thought we would go to lunch instead but only place available was at the same place we had lunch the day before so we figured we would order something different & give it another try since it was our only other option at that time. So off we went & needless to say another disappointing lunch. We both ordered the fish tempura & it was minced fish. The beef & blue cheese panini sandwich didn't even have any blue cheese on it & it was the same bland beef from the beef burrito that we ordered from the day before. My husbands burger had wilted lettuce on it & my orange juice wasn't fresh squeezed & it was very watered down, again you would expect freshly squeezed OJ from this sort of place, wouldn't you? To me it seemed like they were really cutting corners in reference to the food, the presentation was nice but lacking in taste & that's the most important aspect of any meal. Another thing I noticed, was the staff going around & talking to most of the guests during lunch, they seemed very warm & friendly, introducing themselves, laughing smiling & for the life of me I couldn't understand why we never received the same kind of treatment. It really seemed unfair to me but nevertheless you live & learn. I do not regret going but I would be very hard pressed to give the Royal Hideaway another go around. I really wanted to love this resort but to me it was just a beautiful place w/ an equally beautiful beach w/ no substance otherwise, it was all aesthetics imo. I was so hoping to leave stellar feedback & it saddens me to leave such a mediocre review but it was our experience. I think if you have never stayed at a real five star resort you may love the RH but once you have experienced true world class food/service you maybe disappointed.

Before I mention the downside in fairness I would like to say the staff as a whole was very friendly and courtious (exeption of the pool bartender who as rude every time even as I tipped) I can really see that this place one upon a time could have been 5 star but those glory days have passed. The resort is in need of major upgrades all around and would be considered 3.5-4 star at the very best in its current conditions. Room: There are very few ocean front rooms so must will have a garden or jungle view.The room was very clean but worn down( lots of rust and just needs a major upgrade) and the bedding was comfortable but our shower never had hot water the entire stay( i tried at different times of the day and no change) I mentioned this on day one of our trip but nothing was ever done about this? I mean if you are truly a 5 star AAA diamond resort and a guest tells you nicely there is no hot water in the shower..do something. Food: I want to say that I have traveled to this area many times in the past and have always been ok with food at the many resorts I have stayed but not here! It was very poor even down to the hamburgers (i guest got sick from the food while we were there) The waitstaff does try very hard but this resort needs to really find a better vendor or company to buy its food from..its horrible! The Royal in PDC was great so I know it can be had! Service at the resturants could be slow but hey have a drink and relax. We didnt enjoy any of the resturants and found ourselfs trying to fill up on bread just to get by until we could go into town and eat! The grounds where always kept clean and the beach was beautiful as was the pool area. I can say everyones right as theres NOTHING going on at night in this resort and its very boring..but we were there to relax but would have liked a little more to do or a good place to socialize that had more than 4 people total there.

The room (luxury standard) was very spacious with great amenities \u2013 no issues there. The public spaces very very clean. Really spectacular grades on the environment as a whole. \u2022 The pool and beach were great. Also immaculate. No issues getting chairs or umbrellas \u2013 but the resort was only occupied 50%. Very high service levels at the pools. The waitstaff could not do enough for you \u2013 these people worked hard in that hot sun. They learned your drinks and kept them coming without being asked and nothing was a problem. Service always with a smile. The guacamole and burgers by the pool were great for afternoon snacking. Whoever manages the pool and that portion of food and beverage should get a raise. \u2022 Breakfast buffet was excellent. Fresh fruits and melon juices.

The spa lacked a hot tub or cold plunge and without a water journey \u2013 its not a spa \u2013 just a nice locker room that offers massages and facials. That\u2019s what this was. \u2022 The fitness center was small and cramped and the equipment old. You are certainly able to break a sweat \u2013 but if you enjoy great gyms with new equipment \u2013 you will be disappointed. \u2022 It\u2019s an hour from airport. We took a private car \u2013 and its worth the $$$. On the shared shuttle you are first in and last out making the trip more than 2 hours.

On the positive side, the resort grounds and the beach are impeccably well kempt, the staff very friendly and professional, and the general size manageable -- it never felt crowded. On the negative, we were very disappointed by the food, which was one of the main reasons we chose the Royal Hideaway. While the service in most of the restaurants was very good, the food at times bordered on inedible. At best it was bland and lifeless. There was generally a lack of fresh vegetables across all of the restaurants. Overall, it felt as though they'd really cut corners in the ingredients. We spoke with another couple who were on their fourth visit, and they said they were shocked by how much the quality had declined. The attributed the decline to the departure of the longtime award-winning executive chef in January. Most disappointing was Las Ventanas restaurant, which is supposed to be the flagship. When we arrived, the service was in disarray. It took a long time for anyone to bring us a menu. The table cloth at our table was soiled. And the food, which attempting to be somewhat avant-garde with assorted foams and reductions, failed at one thing - to taste good. We had booked the chef's table there for the following night and immediately cancelled the reservation, saving us from a very expensive disappointment. Additionally, while room service is indeed 24 hours, for the majority of that time (after 6pm, before 11am), it's comprised of maybe 2-3 items, such as a chicken sandwich and some snack food. By the end of our week there, we ended up leaving the resort to get food in Playa del Carmen. One other issue we had, which some other reviewers have mentioned, was that our room faced an ajoining resort and almost every night there was a dance party with a loud DJ that blared into our room until around midnight. We mentioned this to our concierge after the first night and he told us there were no other rooms available. I guess you could avoid this by getting lucky with your room assignment. At one point our room lost all water, but it was only during the daylight hours and it came back by the evening. Lastly, we found the system of tipping at the resort rather awkward. The staff clearly appreciates tips (if not expects them?), but the resort doesn't make it easy to leave gratuities. There are never any bills at the meals, so you can't charge the gratuity to your room. If you didn't bring enough cash with you, you can take money out of the resort ATM, but they charge a $7 fee, plus whatever your home bank charges. It would be nice if the resort would either explicitly ban tipping, so no one feels pressured to do it, or makes it easier for the guests to do.", "Date": "May 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northern New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cRoyal Hideaway is the Best in Playa del Carmen\u201d", "Author": "CorinneLagonigro", "ReviewID": "UR108565888", "Content": "Where do I begin with the Royal Hideaway? We went there for our honeymoon in September 2010 and the staff and hotel were amazing. It was a long time since we had stayed at an all-inclusive resort, but we wanted to have zero worries after the stress of planning the wedding and zero worries were exactly what we got. We took private transportation to the hotel which was about 40 minutes from Cancun airport. Upon arrival we were welcomed with a cool towel and a welcome glass of champagne with strawberries. The lobby is nothing short of breathtaking with all of the different murals and beautiful flower arrangements. The bellman, Miguel, escorted us to our villa (villa 23) which was away from the neighboring resort and close to the beach and pool. Try to request a first floor room as there are three floors to each villa and no elevator. We were lucky enough to have a first floor room and it proved useful when you are tired from all of the food, drinks and sunshine from the day. The room was spacious and so was the bathroom. I loved that they had a double sink and linen closet in the bathroom which was great to hold all of our toiletries instead of having them overflowing on the counterspace. We never had a problem with water temperature or pressure as others have mentioned either. Lotions, shampoo, conditioner and soap were replaced daily, as well as plenty of towels. The beds were comfy and there were plenty of pillows. The only thing I would recommend would be for the televisions to be upgraded to a flat screen instead of the old fashioned tube sets they have in the rooms. Other than that I can't complain. The beach was beautiful. I know people complained in the past about the beach. I believe it was after a hurricane hit and took away the majority of the old beach. The new beach is beautiful! My husband and I would go out to the beach at night and listen to music and take in the stars. No worries here either as there are security guards on the beach at night to make sure the guests feel safe. During the day we would spend most of our time at the pool. We never had a problem and found the same chairs everyday for our stay. The staff at the beach bar are awesome and will find you anywhere to make sure you have a drink or to see if they can get you anything else. We especially loved the infinity pool. We would hang over the side with a frozen strawberry banana daquiri in hand and relax the day away. The Italian restaurant, gourmet restaurant Las Vantanas, and Spices were all good for dinner. Our favorite was Azia where the terriyaki and tuna rolls were awesome. Yes, the restaurants do take 2 hours plus for dinner, but this is a romantic and relaxing resort...why rush? Make sure you order every course because the portions are small, but they are timed out so well that you leave full. Very European outlook on dining which suits me just fine. Breakfast may have been our favorite meal due to the breakfast menu. You can have either buffet or you can choose the sit down menu. I loved the sit down menu especially their specialty omelette with the mushrooms, squash and cream cheese. It sounds weird, but it is delicious. Also, there is a great waiter there, Juan, who made our breakfast very memorable. He was from Spain and spent the mornings with us talking about soccer. The spa was very nice and very relaxing- we went twice during our stay. At the time it was buy one, get one half off. So, since we were planning on doing two spa days from the get go we took advantage. Once again-very relaxing. We also loved the afternoon tea time. I believe it was every day at 5:00. Nathaniel was our waiter there and at two of the restaurants. He made us wonderful Spanish coffees! Make sure you try them if you can. The variety of finger sandwiches and pastries were always good and they proved to be a great change of pace from a room service snack. Speaking of room service it is 24 hours and the food is fantastic. The club sandwich, fries, nachos, chicken wings and my favorite Opera Cake were always tasty. Room service was always prompt no matter what time you called them as well. As for nightlife you may want to take the $5 cab ride to Fifth Avenue. We went a couple of times during our stay and enjoyed the food, music and shopping. We got a ton of things there that we would never be able to find back here in the U.S. There isn't a disco at the resort, but there is a bar, Bar Allegria, on site. Dario is the bartender and he is great to have conversations with about Mexico and their culture. Make sure to check it out! I would highly recommend Royal Hideaway Playacar if you are looking for a relaxing, quiet vacation with wonderful food and great staff.", "Date": "May 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNot so 'Royal' - Never again...\u201d", "Author": "Suranne_11", "ReviewID": "UR106676262", "Content": "Extremely disappointing. This is not a Five Star hotel in my opinion, and I am really surprised that it has been rated as a \u2018Leading Hotel in the World\u2019. I am not fussy by any means, but this was not up to the standard I would expect. We arrived late evening to a luke warm welcome from the concierge, and a horrid glass of cheap sparkling wine. We were escorted to our room via the tradesman entrance round the back, and was shown to a dark and dingy room with a musty damp smell. We asked for a room with a view, and instead got the view of a tree, the side alley and back wall of the neighboring hotel. The bathroom was poor with wallpaper peeling off the wall in the toilet, a stained bath, cracked sink and temperamental shower. The following morning we complained and were moved quickly to a room with a better view facing the pool and gardens, however the bath was still to a poor standard, plastic and stained. The shower was a little better, but not what i would have expected from this standard of hotel. The room had an adjoining door to the next room, which meant you could hear everything from your neighbours. Sadly for us, we had people staying next door who were extremely loud and decided to turn the TV on at 12 every night to watch a film whilst ordering room service. We could even hear them eating and clanking plates, that\u2019s how bad the sound proofing was. The water/drainage system also had its problems. The ladies toilets by the pool had no water at least once a day so you couldn\u2019t flush the toilet or wash your hands, and one day I walked in to a flood. One evening we couldn\u2019t get ready for dinner until late as there was no water in the entire resort for about 4 hours. I got the feeling this was a common problem. The most disappointing thing for me was that fact that a huge work conference arrived on our 3rd day and stayed the majority of the week. They completely took over the hotel, so instead of an idyllic 'hideaway' by the Carribean Sea, I felt as if I was gate crashing someone else\u2019s party. They took over the pool and bar completely, and it meant getting restaurant reservations was difficult. The food at the hotel is good, so that I cannot complain about, although the service around the pool during the day was less good. Some waiters were new and their English was poor. Ordering simple drinks became a chore. I know my Spanish should be better, but I would expect a hotel such as this to have good English speaking staff. The quality of cocktails and smoothies was also very hit and miss. The breakfast however, both a la carte and buffet was very good, and the best restaurant was Azia for food, ambience and customer service. The Grill was also very good. The spa was excellent, however I would avoid the couples massage by the sea. This is actually in the gardens next to the alleyway of the neighboring hotel, and all I could hear during my 50 minute tranquil massage was the rubbish bins being emptied, and bottles being smashed. If you want any treatments, have them in the spa itself as this was excellent. Avoid hiring the bikes, mine was squeaky, rusty and the seat wouldn't stay up. We settled our bill in full upon checking out, but the front desk porter was insisting on seeing a slip of paper (which we hadn\u2019t been given) before letting us board our coach to the airport. I\u2019ve never known that before, and felt the customer service generally was quite poor. Generally I didn't feel it was the standard of a Five Star Hotel, and certainly not a LHW. I won\u2019t be returning to the Royal Hideaway Playacar anytime soon....", "Date": "May 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow", "Title": "\u201cExcellent in every way!\u201d", "Author": "Gla28", "ReviewID": "UR106260136", "Content": "Every aspect of our stay at this wonderful hotel was excellent.

The food, wine and drinks are absolutely fantastic. We ate at all restaurants for lunch/dinner. There were enough menu selections to last two weeks. The service was excellent. They made a point to (try to) remember our names at all restaurants. The rooms were small but very well laid out. They were the most comfortable rooms in an AI. Large shower, walk in closet, amenities were just perfect. We certainly recommend this hotel for couples that need a quiet vacation. We would definitely go back. What we did not like (nothing is perfect): the Concierge Service. We all believe that we should not need to reserve to go to restaurants and, therefore, a concierge is not required for a resort that small. We found the concierge a bit of a nuisance more than a service. The beach at Playacar is one of the most beautiful. You can (now) walk into town from the beach. At night, you can also walk to PDC (20-25 miuntes) to enjoy a cocktail on a patio. Stroll between other vacationer. Truly the best vacation yet.

It was an absolute dream come true. The resort and staff made everything perfect, and we could not have had a better wedding or honeymoon week. The resort is impeccable, service incredible and the whole experience completely luxurious. A few notes that may be helpful to others traveling to or considering this resort: - Rooms: We loved our room (2337) and would highly recommend upgrading to an Ocean View room. We looked over the top of the building in front of us to a great view of the ocean and lights of Cozumel. With all the palm trees, the room was totally private. Building 23 is great and comes with the bonus of Patricia -- a super sweet and helpful concierge. Patricia made sure our wedding clothes were pressed, scheduled our dinners and excursions, confirmed our departure transportation, and even made sure the bellhop was there at 7 a.m. for our luggage. - Food: We are total foodies, and I'm a former food editor. We thought the food was fantastic. I know others here have had negative things to say about Spices, but we absolutely loved it -- breakfast, lunch and dinner. Spices head waiter Jeovansky gave us the most amazing dining experience, suggesting dishes to share and bringing us a special sampling dessert (a little of all the offerings). Loved the tasting menu at Vantanas and the melt-in-your mouth sushi at Azia. At lunch, go for cerviche on the Deck or fish tacos at Spices. Also fun: We always asked the waiter for the drink special or whatever they could suggest. We ended up with a dozen new mixed drink favorites. - Wedding: Talk about taking the stress out of a wedding! Miriam the wedding coordinator was fantastic. She made the process super easy, took care of securing a fantastic minister (who could not have performed a more perfect ceremony if he had known us all our lives), a hair dresser and a great photographer, as well as getting the beach site set up. All we had to do was to pick a bouquet/boutonniere and say what we wanted for dinner. With so little to worry about, we were able to totally focus on each other and our special day. - Not to miss: Go to the spa -- massages are to die for! Consider springing for a romantic dinner on the beach. It's worth every penny. The two of you, your own staff, candles, torches, rose petals. The beach is deserted at night, so a completely romantic experience. Honeymooners are offered breakfast in bed. Get it! It's not a cart rolled into your room; you are truly served breakfast in bed!

The staff are lovely and really try to give you as good a service as possible. Our concierge Patricia was really lovely and was always available to help and offer advice. In fact *all* the staff are wonderful and I cannot praise them enough. I have a couple of cons. First there is some noise from the resorts on either side. It\u2019s not a problem during the day, but you can definitely hear the \u201cactivities\u201d at night. Thankfully it doesn\u2019t go on too late nor is it too loud. We go to bed real early on holiday and this bothered us slightly, but not too much. We were in Villa 23 which is up against the Occidental Allegro. I'd asked for a central villa, but they weren't available apparently. Second, the portions at some of the restaurants are rather small, occasionally necessitating a call to room service afterwards. This was especially true at the Club Royal one night where the starter was 2 x 2cm long tiny bits of cream cheese wrapped in smoked salon. This was followed by a mouthful of cauliflower soup in a cocktail glass and the main was a couple of morsels from a leg and a breast of a tiny (Pigeon sized?) chicken (allegedly) which was barely edible. My partners grouper fish actually was inedible. The best bit was desert which was bigger, though I am struggling to remember what it was. It all seemed rather unnecessary and parsimonious to be honest. Portions are also small (though absolutely delicious) at Ventanas. This was the absolute exception, otherwise I cannot find fault with any of the meals we had. We had lovely lunches at the Deck and lovely meals at the all restaurants. Our favourites were Azia (the Sushi is to die for), the Grill (steaks - yum) and Palazzo. Dress code is enforced at Azia, Palazzo and Ventanas, well more or less anyway. I had a bit of an upset one night when the greeter thought my blue grey chinos were jeans. She clearly hadn't looked properly and choose to take me to task in a full bar. Sadly, she embarrassed both of us rather publicly. Another night at Palazzo we saw some visitors being given VIP treatment who were wearing jeans with impunity. There's no real towel game here, though it must be said that people tend to hit the pool early. We were at the pool most days by 9am. My partner had a Thai massage and said it was really good. If you are looking for a quiet adult only resort within easy striking distance of central Playa then you should look no further.

As many others have said, you are treated like royalty from the time you check in to the sad departure. Check in is 3PM, but if you arrive earlier they will tell you where to change so you can get to the beach or lunch at the Deck. Having traveled extensively, I must say that this is now our favorite warm get away spot but it is a laid back experience and there just isn't much night life here. Sure you can go into town which is only a $5.00 cab ride but if you want to simply relax, this is it. The restaurants are all very good with our favoirte being Pallazo. Las Ventanas was a real dissapointment both this year and last. Other reviews listed it as their favorite, but we had poor service as well as dishes that were not good. Specifically, having ordered a steak medium rare it came out with not a hint of red. More troublesome was the waiter who couldn't explain much of anything other than why we were disappointed. Luckily we had a reservation for both Las Ventanas and Pallazo on Valentines Day and cancelled the Las Ventanas one. Our Valentines Day dinner at Pallazo was phenominal. Our waiter was attentive and there was not one miss step in the experience. The food was exceptional once again, as this was our second time there on this trip. Our next favorite was the asian restaurant. Then Spices. All in all the food is great at this resort, as good as many expensive restaurants back home. I really believe that our experience at Las Ventanas was the exception rather than the rule and will try it again next year. we can't say enough about this place other than to say you will not be disappointed!!", "Date": "February 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cRoyal Hideaway: A Classy and Elegant Resort\u201d", "Author": "TorontoSuzanne2", "ReviewID": "UR96912170", "Content": "Just returned from the Occidental Royal Hideaway in Playacar and quite anxious to share this information with those who have already booked or are considering booking. Hope this is helpful! General: First, I should mention that this resort is really adults only - even though the resort says 13 and over, there wasn't one couple under 30 there. It's truly an adults only / couples only resort. It is a quiet, elegant place to relax and regroup. The Grounds and Facilities: Top notch. This is a beautiful resort surrounded by lush gardens, waterfalls, ponds and walkways. There are only 200 rooms, so it's a smaller resort than many of those larger ones. This means more personal service. There are two main pools and about 4 smaller ones scattered around the property. The pools were never crowded. The two main pools do not play music or have those loud activities there, so if you are looking for that \"YEEHA\" kind of pool volleyball thing, this is not the resort for you. If you are going to relax, have peace and quiet, then yes, it's the resort for you! The Rooms, The Restaurants, The Lobby, Lobby Bar, Etc: Each building has a private concierge who will arrange the a la carte dinners (translation: NO standing in line for 20 minutes like you have to at some resorts). We had her arrange all our dinners, she just booked us in to a different restaurant every night at the time we said we'd prefer, and that was that. Never once was our choice \"booked up\" so we got what we wanted. The food was great from start to finish. One thing - there are two breakfast places - the buffet (closer to the water, at Spices) and La Ventanas, near the lobby. Spices is a very small buffet , so you may be surprised by this if you are used to those mega resorts with what seems like acres of buffet! But it's a smaller resort, so bear that in mind. The food is just as good, really. If you don't want to do the small buffet, check out La Ventanas - it's a la carte and has a lovely menu and very attentive service. The hotel has a dinner theatre - definitely worth checking out. House wine there is great! I'm a wine drinker and sometimes these hotels have mediocre (at best!) wine, but this was Chilean and I liked it a lot. Four varietals to choose from, so you can get what you want. The lobby is gorgeous! You enter an open air lobby and then to the right is the front desk staff. Actually the whole resort is gorgeous. Check in was FAST and courteous, and while we were there quite early and our room wasn't ready, we just went and had lunch and by the time we were done our room was ready for us. There is no disco on the property, and no nightlife really, but they do have a beautiful lobby bar/piano bar, so enjoy that. It's a relaxed atmosphere. They also have afternoon tea (high tea) but we were too busy relaxing on that beautiful beach (more on that in a moment). Ok, the room - they are really nice. They look just like the photos in the website. The jacuzzi tub is a little smaller than the ones in the newer resorts, but still ... this place is a few years old so we knew that. Seperate shower is nice, and really nice amenities (shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, soap) are a nice touch. There is limited shopping on the property, but being so close to Playa del Carmen it's not an issue anyway. The gift shop we found to be overpriced, but isn't that always the case on resorts anyway? Just get whatever stuff you need in town. The Beach and Overall Location of Resort: The beach is huge, and gorgeous. They've rebuilt it (check out the website) and it's lovely. Lots of beach chairs and nobody did that \"get there at 4 am and throw a towel on a chair and then go back up to bed\" stuff. There were always lots of chairs, never a challenge to find a great place to suntan. The resort is about a 15 minute walk to Playa del Carmen, along a nice side street in Playacar. It's a great location. You can also walk to town on the beach. Either way will get you there. The Staff: What nice people. They work so hard and were always genuinely friendly to guests. They do want you to have a great time, so please treat them well, tip them and just say \"thanks\" because they really do appreciate it. Whatever you need, they will try their best to accommodate. So overall, this is a terrific spot for a QUIET, relaxing holiday. If you want the noisy club scene with all day activities at the pool, this is not the spot for that. However, if you appreciate stunning grounds, superb service and a very quiet, mature and upscale environment, treat yourselves and go here! You will not be disappointed. I think that just about covers it except to answer that very important question: \"Would we go back?\" You bet, in a heartbeat. In fact, we'll probably head there next year again. It's really a gem. Any questions, happy to discuss.

The first day he greeted us and asked what we would like- we started in the wonderful daybeds w/ champagne & guacamole then went on to get ready for our first night at the resort...dining at one of their amazing restaurants! Night 2 we wanted a little dancing, so when Eddy was asked- he recommended V.I.P. tickets to the CocoBongo... WOW, is an understatement! We passed all of the people in the line to enter our private area directly across from the stage with open bar and a view that was SPECTACULAR! We danced until 3 then ate pizza @ a local hot spot next door...amazing! Night three Eddy booked us V.I.P. @ Brahma & then night 4 we went to Mandolin. Each night was completely different and I only wish we had a night 5 so we could see what Eddy had in store for us. The best part is each night he was always around, making sure we were safe & having fun. Eddy made this our best vacation!

When they welcome you \"home\" at the entrance with your name and you remember their name (Marcos), it's a special homecoming. The best change from our last trip is the beach. It is super wide and very long so it was great for walking the beach and people watching. Previously the beach had been eroding but it was in great shape this trip. The food as always was fabulous. One lunchtime the chefs had the grills going by the pool and they had whole grilled red snapper and large shimps plus the full menu available which was excellent. They did not skimp on the quality or quantity of the food. We sat at the same table for lunch everyday (not necessarily the same time) but our waiter Reyes got to know us and our preferences so he was really excellent throughout our stay. It was great having the concierge arrange all of the dinner reservations when we arrived. One hint for future travel is to contact the hotel in advance of arriving and request dinner reservations. This wasn't a problem for us but we did hear some grumbling from other guests about not getting their reservations in the restaurants they wanted at the times they wanted. I think if you're flexible enough to work with the concierge you'll get close to what you want with a little give and take. In fact, it doesn't hurt to check directly with the restaurant to see if anyone has cancelled or changed their time at the last minute if you don't get your first choice of restaurant or time. We were there over Super Bowl Sunday and they had the game on a big screen in the theatre with Super Bowl type snacks galore. It was a fun way to get together with fellow travelers and helped to build camaraderiethrough the stay. I do have to say that I noticed that the ratio of guests to staff seemed lower on this trip. If the hotel had been more full I think that would have been a problem. Hotels are struggling because of the overblown media attention to crime in the border cities but why people would be afraid to travel to the major tourist areas I have no idea. I live in a large Midwest city and we have shooting/other crime daily in our newspaper but I still live here. I just don't go to the \"bad\" areas of town.

I have stayed at several all inclusives and I have had mediocre food at most places, but the Royal Hideaway takes their cuisine to another level and the service at the restaurants is impeccable. The only downside is it was pretty dead when we were there so it was a bit quiet, it would have been nice to have more people around. Also, it definitely attracts couples so if you are looking for a singles hangout, you may need to venture into town in the evening. My girlfriend and I had 2 massages and they were soooo nice, I felt refreshed and relaxed. It is a very quiet hotel at night, meaning the entertainment is next to none, we had one show the 8 days we were there. They have a sister hotel next door you can go to for shows or the town is super close and they have a night life as well. The hotel next door the riu palace which I have stayed at has night shows but there food is mediocre! and the shows are loud and go until midnight to 1 am so bring ear plugs if you want to sleep :) The concierge service at each villa is super cool, they help with the booking of the hotel and coordinate any of your needs. All of the staff work so hard to make the vacation a real vacation and I really appreciate that. I would definitely go back to this hotel in a heartbeat.

We generally also don\u2019t like being tied down for meals. With our hectic life and pace recently, we decided to try an all-inclusive so we would not have to really think about anything or plan meals. We could just relax for a week. The resort is beautifully landscaped. It is an older property but VERY well maintained. We visited during the second week in September, which I think is considered their off season. It was the perfect time. The resort was not crowded and we felt like we had the place almost to ourselves. Our room was spacious, comfortable and clean. The bathroom was almost the same size as the sleeping area and included a walk-in closet. My past experience with all-inclusive hotels/resorts (many years ago) was that the accommodations could be average to nice, but the food was average or below average. Royal Hideaway Playa raised the bar to a whole new level. The location was perfect, the pool areas were gorgeous and the quiet, peaceful setting (at least at this time of year) was a hit with us. What really made this stay spectacular were the restaurants! The beautifully appointed d\u00e9cor of the on-site restaurants with their innovative menu choices, excellent food and presentation rivals and/or surpasses many 4 and 5 star restaurants. What a surprise to find this quality of restaurants in an All-Inclusive resort. Because it was the \u201coff-season\u201d, there were only two of there 5-6 restaurants open each night. We got to experience all of them with our length of stay. A concierge is assigned for each \u201cVilla\u201d at the Royal Hideaway. The concierge assisted with restaurant reservations and spa appointments. The only buffet at this resort during our stay was the breakfast buffet. There was a large variety of fruits, meats, yogurt, pastries, granola, cereals and some traditional Mexican dishes and American breakfast items (bacon, eggs, sausage). The other restaurants include Spices (with a Mexican menu, this is in the same place as the Breakfast buffet); Azia (Pan-Asian specialties and one of our favorites); Palazzo (Italian); Las Ventanas (our other favorite); The Grill (steaks, seafood grill, in the same place as The Deck during the day). The Deck which is right off the beach and pool area served food during the day until late afternoon.

Overall I give it a 8 out of 10. You can tell the Hotel was built a while ago and there are some minor things that need to be updated (no flat screen TV's ~ but we didn't watch much Television anyways ~ some tiles here and there in the Jacuzzi didn't match the original, and some painting could have been done ~ beach chairs could be upgraded) The resort is well maintained and the staff is very pleasant. Some kids, but all of which were older and well behaved, mostly couples in the resort. ROOMS: We stayed in the standard room (which I was hesitant of) but it was lovely. The tub is small, but we didn't use it. The water pressure very nice, and never an issue with a steaming hot shower. The safe doesn't fit a computer and the room isn't very large, but it is well decorated and very clean. The beds were comphy and there is a cute Patio. BEWARE, some of the rooms do face the exterior of the resort and look onto the adjacent properties, but thankfully we didn't have one of those and ours looked onto the cute streams that flow through the hotel. To be honest I don't think I would do a higher room category if I were to come back...for the amount of time spent in the room, it well more then fine. FOOD: I must say the food was great. Their signature restaurant Las Ventanas was amazing. My BF and I decided that if we had ordered the meal we ate in NYC it would have cost at least $500...the quality was out of this world good and the food just kept coming...We like one of our deserts, so we ordered 2 more, never any questions asked, always willing and wanting to feed us more and get us more cocktails. Really Awesome. Spices and the Deck were the Day and Morning options. They were willing to makes me other eggs when I didn't care for what was offered at breakfast. Also grill some shrimp up when I didn't want to order from the menu. Very accommodating. For dinner the other night we ate the Azia the Asian Bistro. Good food, unfortunately we didn't get a seat at the Hibachi table, but we still had a great meal and the shots of sake flowed like water. Because of the great service we had especially at dinner we always took care of the serves ($20 each, which I think is more generous then most give...though they expect NOTHING and I think give fantastic service despite, they truly appreciated the small gesture!) TEA TIME: Go and have a flaming coffee, seriously Yummy. GYM/SPA: I normally use the gym and the Spa. The gym could be updated, it was a bit small so I opted to just exercise on the beach and the Spa was also small and could use a renovation...I didn't have any services done (they maybe fantastic, I DO NOT KNOW??), but after having just used the Ritz spa a day earlier I didn't feel this one stacked up for the prices they were charging... LOCATION: I love the little Playacar community. Across from the hotel is a Starbucks if you need your caffeine fix. And its a $5 cab rise to Playa Del Carmen if you want some excitement ( the hotel is fairly quiet and doesn't boast a night scene) But since PDC is so close you really get the best of both worlds. And its a short 45-60 minutes from CUN airport. BEACH: Look to your left, and then right. All the other beaches are completely crowded while the Royal Hideaway's ISN'T ~ thank goodness! We sat secluded from others close to the water. Unfortunately you can hear some of the NOISE (drinking games I assume??) from the other resorts. But You can have drinks and even lunch at your lounge chairs (if a bird doest try and snatch it from you) Beautiful white sands and very friendly beach staff to make sure you can relax and catch some sun! OVERALL: For an all-inclusive (this is my 4th I've stayed at) it is a great one. It deserves it's high marks. They offered great liquors and they truly were top self...Johny Walker Black label, 1800 tequila, Goose/Kettle etc. Lobster was missing unfortunately...but everything else was there.

The drinks were never-ending! The waiters from the bar that work the beach were superb! Reyes, you rock! My favorite restaurant for lunch was Spices. We enjoyed their daily drink special too! I would recommend going to Azia, the Pan asian restaurant early in your trip because you will meet people there while dining around the table with the hibachi grill. The sushi bar was great as well before dinner. High tea every afternoon was a nice surprise too. My only suggestion would be to offer a better selection of wine. We tried the glasses of wine included and didn't like any of them. We did purchases a bottle one night for a special meal but found that pricey! The pilates and yoga and water aerobics were fun.

We've only been to AI's twice but this was a good blend of nice hotel with AI ease. It was also a great blend of what we each want - my guy likes nice hotels, knowing we'll be taken care of (think the Ritz) while I prefer intimate, boutique experiences (local luxury vs a chain.) From the moment we arrived til our departure, we were relaxed and well taken care of. The check-in was nice, efficient, and the cool cocktail helped end the travel and begin the vacation! Our room was on the first floor, and while it had no view, it was quiet, bed was comfy, shower was great (entire bathroom set-up was wonderful actually - nice counter/sink area to get ready together, door separating the toilet, walk-in closet.) Our time was mainly spent by the pool - the beach was nice to walk along, I just liked the view of the infinity pool. :) I finished my books early so borrowed one from their library - a nice touch. RH is small but the food options had enough variety for our 4 night/5 day trip. Our 'routine' tends to be long dinners with a pre-dinner and after-dinner drink so the low-key (read: lack of) nightlife was good enough for us. We each got two massages - the spa was really that good, and similar to NYC spa prices so why not. Walking into Playa was an easy walk & a nice break away from the 'routine'. We elected to not do a real day trip since we were enjoying relaxing but our building's concierge was more than helpful while we were exploring - and even surprised us with flowers in our room one day after I commented on how nice the ones on his desk looked! All in all - great spot for a couple, or a small group. There was one larger (30 or so) business-group and they were fine but definitely not the norm.

There is a reason this is considered a 5-star resort--it earns that rating. Our concierge, Jenna, was wonderful! The restaurants at the resort were all first-class. [For our anniversary in November, we went to a highly-rated and quite wonderful (and very expensive) restaurant here in San Diego, CA, and the meals we had at the Royal Hideaway Playacar at Las Ventanas, Palazzo, and Azia all compared quite favorably. Spices was not quite as elegant, but it was wonderful and had first-class service, too.] The wide, clean, beautiful, white sand beaches are as nice as anywhere we have ever been. The staff was all so friendly and helpful. Before you finish your glass of water, orange juice, cup of cappucino, Margarita, mojito, or whatever you might be drinking, your server is there with another! Or (s)he is there to ask if you'd like another. The turn-down staff left us extra chocolates! The maid service folded our towels into cute shapes (e.g., a Teddy-bear and a mermaid) and left us balloons and streamers to say Happy Anniversary. The location is great, too. In addition to being right on one of the most beautiful beaches in the world, we were close enough to walk (a perfectly safe and comfortable walk) into Playa del Carmen to sight-see and shop, and we were able to take day trips to the Mayan ruins at Chichen Itza and Tulum, to visit the Spanish colonial town of Valladolid (founded in 1543), to snorkle with giant sea turtles, and to snorkle in Cenote Dos Ojos. And to top it all off, the dinner show on our last night at the resort was a thoroughly enjoyable magic show to rival the best in Las Vegas. In sum, everything was just perfect--what else can I say?", "Date": "December 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cRoyal Hideaway\u2026\u2026we came away spoiled!\u201d", "Author": "alienpilot", "ReviewID": "UR89360809", "Content": "We stayed at the RH from 12 Aug \u2013 31 Aug 2010, our eleventh summer in a row. Each year we stay for about three weeks, so I consider myself something of an RH expert. Every year I say how can it get any better, but it does. I am just blown away! There is not much more I can add to the previous posts. They are all mostly correct, but I will attempt to clarify and explain the changes this year, as well as the impact of the present economic crisis on RH. I want to stress that the state of the hotel is season dependent. More guests mean more and different services. We were in low season, so take this review with that in mind. Just found out (30 Nov 2010) that all rooms have been approved by corporate for TV upgrades to 37\u201d LCD flat screens! There are other electronic upgrades going in, as well, and am eager to see this happen. OCCUPANCY There are 11 villas on the property (200 rooms) capable of housing an average of 400 guests. During our stay this year, the number of registered guests averaged 60-80 and were located in the front four villas closest to the ocean. Another \u201csmart thing\u201d that RH is famous for. Why keep all villas opened with a concierge in each with maid service, if only 80 people occupy the property? I love the small resort concept. Been to the mega resorts and they are just too impersonal and crowded. At Royal Hideaway, it\u2019s personal. They make it a point to remember your name and strive to make your experience a memorable one. Need or want something? Just ask\u2026 RESTAURANTS All restaurants are enclosed and air conditioned except for \u201cThe Grill\u201d (it\u2019s the pool snack bar\u2026\u201dThe Deck\u201d during the day. They spiff it up at night). Due to the low occupancy, RH did another \u201csmart thing\u201d. They had only two of their restaurants opened per night. While we were there, Las Ventana\u2019s, their signature restaurant, was almost always opened, and they rotated the second restaurant every night through their remaining five. Most guests stay at RH at least a week, so you would be able to eat in all of the restaurants before you left. For breakfast, only Spices (the Mexican restaurant) was opened. It is the only restaurant that is buffet style with omelets made to order. When occupancy is up, Las Ventana\u2019s is also opened for breakfast (order off a menu). We preferred Spices for breakfast with more choices and a beautiful beach/ocean view. For lunch, we had a choice of two restaurants; \u201cThe Deck\u201d (the pool snack bar) located on the wooden deck by the infinity pool and right by the beach. If you prefer, they also have inside seating. \u201cSpices\u201d Mexican restaurant, upstairs from \u201cThe Deck\u201d, was our other option. We normally alternated days between \u201cSpices\u201d and \u201cThe Deck\u201d for lunch. Spices was air conditioned and was a nice break from the hot summer sun, and the menu was extensive and creative. They had the best soups and salads on the property at lunch. But make sure you are dry and covered up when you dine. Our awards this year for the best restaurants? Here they are; Most romantic; Palazzo\u2019s Italian Most interesting menu; Las Ventana\u2019s Most fun; Azia\u2019s (Teppanyaki table). Note; the Teppanyaki chef, Romi Rodriguez, was the best I have ever seen here in 11 years! No overall winner again this year, as the food was always excellent and each had its particular charm and strong points. Here\u2019s a little secret. If you know they have ingredients for something you crave, but is not on a menu, ask them if they can prepare it. I like BLTs. I asked, and it appeared. Something more complicated that may take more time to prepare? Get a manager at the restaurant and explain what you want. And if you don\u2019t like the sizes of the portions you get, ask them to double it, or reduce it. They want to make you happy and will do everything in their power to see it happens. Just be nice, patient and respectful and make sure your request is properly understood. Sometimes they appear to understand, but it loses in the translation. YOU are a guest in THEIR country. Play nice\u2026\u2019nough said. Now the really good part! If you are a foodie, you will do this. Las Ventanas has something called \u201cThe Chef\u2019s Table\u201d. http://www.royalhideaway.com/chefstable/main.html This will cost extra; $150 per person, or $200 with wine pairings. The menu is custom prepared and changes each time it is done. Have requests, or don\u2019t really care for something? Communicate. They will do whatever you want and will work with you. Let them know ahead of time. BEACH WOW! Just WOW! The beach has been reclaimed! I\u2019ve been coming here for 11 years, and I have never seen the beach so deep as this! Just gorgeous! No giant sand bags, no interference with the view. You can get help with a cabana for two to protect you from the sun and a couple of lounge chairs right on the water\u2019s edge. Oh\u2026worried about food and drink issues so far from the pool snack bar? Not to worry! Pick up a black flag (ask your pool waiter) on the way out to your \u201cspot\u201d. Waiters regularly service this area. Want something? Put the black flag up. They\u2019ll be there! TO TIP OR NOT TO TIP? We have been asked about tipping at RH numerous times. I understand the property is at the upper end of the price scale and tipping may be the last thing on your mind. What we do, is tip the maid, concierges, the pool and dinner waiters, and the entertainment. The amount isn\u2019t important. The tip is important, because it shows your appreciation for what they do. Do what you can afford, but do. The maids are working behind the scenes but their tasks are the most time consuming, so we are more generous with them. That is our take on the tipping, and it is appreciated. What you do is up to you, and you will get the same service if you tip or not. In 11 years, I\u2019ve seen tipping guests and non-tipping guests, all are given the RH treatment. Follow your heart in this matter. Here\u2019s a few links I think you\u2019ll like; Live cam, Royal Hideaway.

Very quiet and romantic. Watch the sunset. Get beverages from the pool bar area and take up with you. Waiter service not usually available there. Champagne is a nice touch\u2026We go when Spices or The Grill is open, then you can get beverages. Nice breeze, nice view, always quiet and secluded. You newly marrieds would love it. DO THIS. 2) Did you know they have \u201ctea time\u201d here? It\u2019s from 4-6 pm every afternoon at the front of the property, just before you walk out the front. I know what you\u2019re thinking. \u201cYeah, right\u2026tea time\u201d. Do it. They have several flaming Mexican coffees that they prepare before your eyes, a sax player plays, the champagne flows, the finger sandwiches are eaten\u2026whatever you want. Not just tea\u2026nice break from lying around by the pool or beach. Just sit down at a table. The waiter will bring everything to you. No need to serve yourself. 3) Two desserts you must try. Are they in any of the restaurants? No. Only in room service. Order these; Opera cake and Tres Leches (three milk cake). We liked the Opera cake the best. Another good thing from room service? Their chicken soup. Wings are good, too. Want those for lunch? Ask for them at The Deck or call room service and have them delivered there, they\u2019ll magically appear! You can order room service at The Deck at lunch if you want something from them, which is not on The Deck menu. Ask your waiter or manager. 4) Bring mosquito repellent for the porches, tea time, the Grill and Allegria bar. You will be happy you did. 5) Get an insulated mug for your cold beer or beverage. I suggest a Starbucks stainless steel insulated mug or similar. They are all over, but get a stainless steel insulated one. You won\u2019t regret it. It\u2019s hot, and drinks get hot very quickly. A MUST! I\u2019m serious! DO IT... You won\u2019t regret it! (They just built a Starbucks across the street to the left in the strip mall at the very end. Yummmm\u2026). 6) Spices has the coldest beer on the property. 7) Have a special request for your in-room refrigerator? Tell them how you want it set up. Like all water, no sodas, just particular kind of sodas, beers (what kind do you want? I liked Leon)\u2026ask them for the selections. They have many American beers, as well as Mexican and ? 8) All rooms have free wireless internet. They have a business center with 4 computers, but they sometimes get crowded. Bring your laptop. Then you can download pixs and vids to it and share on Facebook, Twitter, etc. 9) Want to call back home but are stressed because of the cost? Like $1 plus per minute for cell phone calls? Install Skype on your laptop. If someone else has Skype, you can talk for free. If you have a webcam, you can talk and see for free with a Skype user. If the party you want to call doesn\u2019t have Skype, signup for Skype Unlimited Country for $5.95 a month. You can cancel when you get back home. It will only cost you $5.95 for your entire vacation, unlimited calling. Can\u2019t beat that! I do that every year. Here\u2019s the link; http://www.skype.com/allfeatures/subscriptions/#mexicanSubscriptionTab 10) Can\u2019t get that pool umbrella up by the pool? Ask the pool concierge or any other staff and they will do it for you. Note; Cynthia is the BEST pool concierge EVER! 11) Night life at the RH is seriously lacking, I know. Want it? Take a $6 cab ride to town (Playa del Carmen), including tip, and hit 5th Avenue. You\u2019ll find what you want\u2026 12) What are those large guinea pigs called running around the property at dusk and dawn? These are called sereque. They are protected by the Mexican government, but, I hear, are quite tasty\u2026. http://www.mayansanctuary.com/sereque.jpg We already made return reservations while we were down there. Many of the first time guests said that they were returning as well, because of the service, the attention to detail and the ambience. Hope to see you August 2011. I\u2019ll bring the chicken, La Guardia Vida \u201cPepita\u201d to save anyone in the Infinity Pool, if need be. She is always on duty 10 am until Tea Time at 3 pm. God bless and hurry down.

The service was outstanding, we were treated very well. Be sure to make reservations, though, the restaurants can get booked up during the most desirable times. Unfortunately, there were very strong winds during our stay, so strong that the beach was closed (we were not allowed in the water at all), so that was a bummer we couldn't enjoy water activities. The wind blew away any books or drinks or even chair cushions we left out at the pool. It was awfully cold for the pool, but it was nice sitting in the hot tub and looking at the view. The view from the restaurant that was by the pool was beautiful, we ate there a few times at a window seat. We went to the nightclub and really enjoyed the mojitos! Delicious. I do suggest they play more contemporary music, more variety. Actually, we would have loved to hear salsa, meringue, and rock music in Spanish, not all old songs in English. They cater to gringos, but this gringa loves Mexican/Spanish music and wants to hear it in Mexico! I was also surprised the dance space was so small, almost non-existent, they should expand the dance floor and the nightclub and have Salsa/Meringue night.

She took care of us and we enjoyed getting to know her. I only have one word of advice - south of the property is a resort that is known for being party central. If you really want peace and quiet late at night, try to get a room in one of the buildings away from here. We were lucky, our room was in a building on the other side, closer to the beach and pool as well. And who cannot appreciate a light massage and fresh fruit while sitting by the pool? We also had a small pool and hot tub right outside our building. In addition to the main pools by the ocean, there are smaller ones throughout this beautiful property.

From the very first minute we arrived, the most common response to our requests was NO. * We asked for a bottle of Grey Goose delivered to our room and were told NO. Only by the glass. * At breakfast we asked for Guacamole. In the Spices restaurant, they had to go down stairs to get guacamole, we felt this was a challenge so we stopped asking. The day breakfast was served in Ventanas due to the hurricane, I was told NO we do not have guacamole in this restaurant. Really? I am in Mexico and I cannot get Guacamole? * We asked to have music and drinks on the deck after dinner so we could enjoy the ocean? We were told NO, we do not have the equipment. We tried to coordinate it ourselves, but no lighting made it impossible. * Karoke was offered one night in the \u201cdisco\u201d. When we arrived it was almost 11 pm. We were able to participate for about 30 minutes when they packed up the Karaoke We asked if they would keep playing but they said NO. * The Disco was horrible! A hot little room with a choice of TWO, only two CD\u2019s to dance to, terrible music at that. With the many different types of guests that visit RH you might think they would have a selection? Maybe some oldies: Dean Martin, maybe some 80\u2019s rock, maybe some Big Band, We asked: NO * We thought it might be nice to order room service to the Deck! As a group we could sit and enjoy the beautiful view of the ocean, each order our meal and have it delivered to the pool deck. \u2013 A BIG NO! Not possible. If you order room service it must go to your room and only your room. What would prevent us from carrying our food from our room to the deck? We just wanted to know we could get a few more drinks if we needed to. NO! * The pool was beautiful and the views amazing. We enjoyed sitting by the pool enjoying the sun and views however, there are only two little speakers (disguised as rocks) playing music. If your chair is not close to one of the rocks you cannot hear the music, they cannot turn the music up and there is no other device for music. We had failed to bring our ipod speakers so we were just out of luck. No Music by the pool. And NO they cannot help.

Scrambled eggs, fried eggs, or omelets. No special Mexican dishes like Machaca or Chorizo! We are in Mexico, where is the Mexican food? At night the resort was VERY DARK. Not well lit. No lights on the decks and NO BAR to get a drink if you wanted to hang out on the deck after dinner. Some of the walk ways were actually completely dark, a little creepy. The Disco had a nice patio but again poor lighting. Candles would have made the mood so much nicer but that just did not happen. Due to the low occupancy they only had two restaurants each night. This could have been fine but we really never figured out what the problem was. We had a group of 10, a large party however our first night dinner took over two hours from start to finish. The next night at the Japanese restaurant, we finished our 8:00 dinner at 11:00 pm and, we skipped the dessert! There was only one Chef for two grills. We had been seated for over an hour, waiting for the Chef to finish with the other group (who had the same frustrating experience) when she finished, she had to go in the back to prepare our rice, veggies and meats. She did not start cooking our meal until we had been seated for over two hours. It seemed as though low staffing levels made it difficult for them to manage the restaurant seating. Each night we made our reservations as suggested. What was curious was when we tried to change one. We were told that the only available seating in Spices was at 9:30. Funny that when we stopped by at 8:00 pl the restaurant was half empty! Under staffed and unable to accommodate the guests request! I read and had been told that the food at Royal Hideaway was excellent. One of the main reasons we selected this resort. NOT THE CASE! The food was OK. Most of the dinners menus provided enough variety but I would not give this an excellent rating. I have had much better. This again gives an appearance that they are trying to cut corners. Please know, I am not the typical American looking for mountains of food however, each entr\u00e9e is served Al La Carte and unless you know to order sides (not very well explained) you leave hungry. We had another couple tell us, \u201cwe have learned to order two or three appetizers\u201d. Some of the desserts were OK, most we did not even get to try because of the slow service, we were just spent by the time the entrees were served. Trying to provide 5 diamond dinner service while short staffed creates an unmanageable situation. THE EMPLOYEES ARE NOT TO BLAME: One of the main reasons we travel to Mexico so frequently is because of the people. They usually go out of their way to provide great service. The impression we got from the Royal Hideaway is that the employees are not happy. Without the tools to do their job they cannot provide the service they are so used to offering. It seemed that the resort is trying too hard to manage every little cost and it is reflected in the service. From the poor lighting to the restaurant experience, the shortened service hours, lack of flexibility, the over all experience was average to poor. I do understand low season and low occupancies but this should be NO excuse for cutting corners when you boast 5 diamonds! TO SUM UP THE EXPERIENCE, if you are looking for a beautiful place to go relax, no music, no entertainment, no lively upbeat employees, Royal Hideaway is for you. However if you like to eat, drink, dance and experience true Mexican Hospitality, I would not recommend this resort.", "Date": "October 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Joliet, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cIt was truly a \"Royal Hideaway\"\u201d", "Author": "lds1126", "ReviewID": "UR84322001", "Content": "From the moment you step onto their property you are treated like royalty.

We had a wonderful time! The Pros: 1. The service is EXCELLENT in all aspects. The staff is very friendly and they work very hard. The housekeepers clean several times a day and do a thorough job. 2. The restaurant food is very good. Our favorites were Azia (great sushi) and Palazzo (romantic atmosphere). (Thanks Victor for your professional wait service.) 3. The beach is not crowded, it\u2019s clean and bar/food service is available. (Thanks Reyes for being the best beach/pool waiter imaginable! Almost as soon as our drinks were empty, he would bring us another without us asking.) The hotel has beach chairs and covers big enough for two chairs in case you want to enjoy the beach but not the sun. And, there is a lifeguard on duty. 4. The liquor is top-shelf and there\u2019s no problem getting a drink! Drinks are free-flowing! The bartenders couldn\u2019t be nicer or more accommodating in the Bar Allegria, Piano Bar, or pool bar. (A special thanks to Gabriel, a very professional bartender!) Ask Gabriel for a \u201cMexican Beer\u201d. My husband thought this was great. It contained lime, jalapeno and Corona. Be careful, it\u2019s spicy! 5. The rooms are located in several separate buildings. Each building has its own concierge. This was very convenient when it came to making dinner reservations and asking questions. (Thanks to our concierge, Muriel, who did a wonderful job.) 6. The property is beautiful and very well maintained!! We enjoyed watching the birds, iguanas, and agouti from our patio. Agouti are harmless vegetarians and are related to the guinea pig, only larger. The trees, bushes, and foliage are unbelievable. There are walking bridges and streams throughout the property, between the various buildings. It\u2019s a lovely setting. The Cons: 1. There\u2019s not much to do after dinner as far as night-time entertainment. However, the doorman will summon a taxi into town and the taxi will drop you off on 5th Avenue which is the tourist district. There are many, many restaurants and bars on 5th Avenue. The tourist district is set up to be very safe and the police patrol it continuously. We also asked our concierge for a pass one night to the neighboring resort which had a rock-n-roll legends show. The show was okay, but what stood out in our mind was that the quality of the neighboring sister resort was lacking compared to the Royal Hideaway. We could visit their resort for free, but we were told they had to pay to visit our resort. 2. There\u2019s not much help to drag the beach chairs down closer to the water. Suggestions: 1. Tip the staff. They do a great job and really work hard. 2. The hotel serves bottled water and purified ice and that is standard practice. The hotel also states it has a water purification system, but, having travelled frequently all over the world, and after living in Mexico for two years, my advice is not to drink water from the tap at any resort in any second or third world country, no matter how highly rated.

Ammeneties are fantastic, the concierge will take care of everything. As for the restaurants, well, there is a reason why they have achieved diamond status. The Las Ventanas restaurant is by far the best there. You must dine twice here. From the appetizers to the entree's, they will make your taste buds explode with enjoyment. Pallazo, is a close second(again dine here twice). the ambiance is incredable, as if you were eating in Milan or Rome. The food, well just amazing. Azia is for those that love food from the Orient. My wife insisted on two visits and it was well worth it. Try the Hibachi dinner service first, a truly amazing experience and if you are lucky like we were, the other couples will add to the festivities. The Grill, we did not attend (we switched for the second time at Las Ventanas) but we were told that it was great. The lamb chops were highly recommended. The last restaurant, Spices, was very nice. This was our least favourite, but still was a nice evening. Club Royale was under some renovation so we did not have the chance to visit, but I am confident that it would be an experience like the others. Regardless of your personnal choices for dinner, you will not be dissapointed at all. If you are looking for a party atmosphere, this is not your resort.

In other words its hit and miss...mid-week we saw Salsa & Merengue night we got pumped...when we showed up it was more like oldies and top 40.

So do your food and beach relaxing there and if you want nightlife it's literally less than five minutes in a taxi to 5th Ave where there are nightclubs, swanky bars and tons of people. 5th has a very Euro feel to it. The perks of the RH are the food, which is delicious. Just make sure you course out everything i.e. order a personal appetizer, salad, soup, entree and dessert at all the restaurants, their classiness, service and beach. If you want to tour the ruins of Tulum on a day trip, tell the bellhop and give him a nice tip and he'll call you a great taxi driver to take you there and wait for you till you are finished.

There are no lunch or dinner buffets, only sit-down options. Dinners are the evening entertainment, and they are creative 5-course meals with beautiful presentation. The food quality was far above any other resort I've visited--excellent meats and seafood and great variety since you're in a different restaurant almost every night. The chefs are top-notch, and the service is impeccable. The drinks are top-shelf and potent. You want a quiet, relaxing getaway. There are a few daytime activities, but few guests really participated. Lounging at the pool or on the beach is the main event. Night time entertainment consisted mostly of \"CD music\" on a patio with about 20 guests sipping drinks. The entire grounds were relaxing and tranquil, sprinkled with small, private pools. You enjoy superior service. Your chair is pulled out, your napkin is placed on your lap, your every need and whim are catered to. The pool waiter knew not only our drink of choice, but exactly when to deliver fresh drinks! Rooms are spotless; they are cleaned during the day, then again when they are turned down at night. Your building concierge makes your dinner reservations, can book your excursions, and will make sure that everything runs smoothly. Ricardo watched the weather like a hawk and helped us plan adventures around days that would have the best weather. The people on staff are wonderful. Argenas patiently tolerated our drunken water aerobics antics, and Cinthia jumped in to show us how to properly \"shake our booties\" during salsa lessons. However, choose a different resort if: You are looking for nightlife on the grounds. There were no shows. The only time things actually got active was karaoke night. But right when we all loosened up and got into it, the host shut everything down promptly at 11:00 despite our begging for a few more minutes. We got a pass to the Allegro next door one night, but found things pretty quiet there, too (maybe due to off-season?) For nightlife, you need to go to Playa del Carmen, which is only a 5-minute, $5 cab ride away. You are a fussy eater or don't want to spend a lot of time at meals. While there's a great variety of food on the restaurant menus, there are some very creative interpretations of dishes (basil jell-o in the caprese salad, for example). Everything was delicious, but I know some people who would have starved because they'd much rather have a hamburger or something familiar (hamburgers, pizza, hotdogs, chicken fingers are available at lunch, though).

Both the properties were great but not quite in the same league as TRH in terms of the food. The rooms are much prettier then they look in pictures and are imaculately clean!The rooms are in 2 and 3 story buildings that blend into the full grow landscaping and is just beautiful.Most rooms don't have much if any water view even if they're listed as water view because the way the resort is set up. Do request the top floor because the room has vaulted cielings and you may be able to see water over the tops of other buildings. The balconies are small and wrap around to a small sitting area where you can have breakfASt(24hr room service!) The property is absolutely beautiful! The landscape is very mature therefore very lush and perfectly landscaped. There are small very private pools with hot tubs dotted along the property and you could miss them if you dont look for them.There are also small statues and fountains dotted all over the property adding to its relaxed atmosphere. This property is Adults only and very mellow.There are 2 places to hang out in the evening after dinner. There is a piano lounge inside of The restaraunt Las Ventanas and a small patio bar downstairs where they has live music and dancing. Now about the food. This is where the resort shines!!!! If you are as ocd as I am, you probably read hundreds of reviews before chosing your resort! Anyone who says that the food fell short is insane. we were a group of 6 and literally ordered everything on the menu every night.All the restaraunt were great, some we liked more then others. Spices is a gormet Meican restaraunt that we all loved!Everything was delishous but of course we liked some choices b etter then other.Try the seat potato dessert, its unique!! The Grill was basically a steak house type place with some fisk. the food was really good but for me personally, was my least favorite restaraunt. Dont get me wrong, everything was great, im just not much of a meat eater.The men were very happy!!! All the meats were of the same quality of any steak house we could get her on Long Island! The Palazzo restarunt was also awesome. They did some unique twistes on some italian staples.The food was great as was the service.Again, we ordered everything on the menu and not one thing fell short! THe crowned jewel, Las Ventanas!!!! The atmosphere is incredible as was the food and service!! again, we ordered the entire menu plus a few repeats because they were soooooo good! Try the creammy rice..OMG!!!! Azia is there sushi/ tempanyaki rest. We had sushi and other delights there one night for appetizers and drinks before a late dinner. You can sit in the sushi/ bar area without a reservation and order anything you want. we didnt stay enough nights to have a full dinner there but , judging from the things we did get, the food is probably great!!! Most of the restaraunts serve small portions even the entrees. If a few things sound good, order them, the waiters wont even blink! The main pools are nice and front the beach. There are 3 hot tubs at different temperatures right there on the beach. There is pool and beach beverage service and let me just tell you, Dante at the pool and Isis at the deck lunch restaraunt , Are 2 of the hardest working, most delightful people you will ever encounter!! All I can say is dont hesitate to go here!! Weve been doing all inclusives for years and this one takes the cake, literally.

Of particular note on the food, since we are a younger couple the 4p tea did not sound all that fun but after a day of on and off rain we decided to check it out and it was awesome! If I had to rate one thing lower it would be that the included wine and champ was a little lacking overall, not horrible, just not great, and the wine you can buy there is super expensive (a great wine list, but wow!).

After many hours on Trip Advisor I chose Royal Hideaway (RH) for a trip with my wife and break from my job which requires me to travel. I DID NOT want a hotel feel with elevators, long hallways. RH is perfect for a quiet trip of beach time, pool time and excellent restaurants with a full compliment of excellent multi-course meals. Service was great and food portions were about right. Do not bring your kids 14 and up as they will hate the place, it's geared towards adults despite the 14+ allowance. Used USA transport service for 105 usd roundtrip. Perfect, takes 45 minutes from airport. Don't check your bag and keep moving to the USA guy outside. Room - reminded me of the four seasons Nevis with decor and quality. Clean, quality bathroom amenities, comfortable bed (i didn't wake up once in the middle of the night). The rooms are situated in buildings with about 12 to 15 rooms each with a conceirge who takes care of your room and dinner reservations or anything else you need. They sit right in the middle of the building so you see them when you come and go during the day. TV was an older one which usually bothers me, but i could have cared less once you get acclimated and start relaxing. Shower was very hot, AC was perfect and wifi had a great connection (5 bars). Stayed in building 24 next to pool and beach and booked the Luxury (the lowest possible price). View off of patio was a lush green lawn with palms and a couple of other buildings. Restaurants - 4 of 5 things we ate were outstanding. We dined at Palazzo, Las Ventanas over the past two nights and will try Spices tomorrow night. Palazzo is an rich italian feel, comfortable seating and Pavarotti type music piped in quietly. Las Ventanas is modern, bright and has a feel that makes you think where am I again? As it could easily be a restaurant in LA, NYC, Miami, Dallas, Vegas etc. Food was high quality and as we'd expect from a 4 to 4.5 star Dallas restuarant from both restaurants. This is a place where you dine and enjoy the food quality. There are 4 to 5 courses in the meal and plenty to fill you up if you are worried like some on this board. Desserts are small and perfect unless you the type who has to have a quarter wedge of cake to be fulfilled. You make reservations with your concierge which was cool because they go all the way to 10:30 pm at most. 8 or 830 is the most popular time. 630 or earlier, you'll be alone in the restuarant. Breakfast was delicious with the only buffet on the premises. I hate buffets normally but this is not one of those trough buffets where people are piling their plates high (think buffet at the Westin on Easter or your local country club). Made to order eggs (order Huevos Rancheros overeasy with beans and you won't go wrong) as they don't expect the gringos to know how delicious it is - she looked surprised and whipped it up. Fruits of all sorts (mangos were awesome), shapes, and ones you've never seen or tasted (try them), kosher, traditional eggs and meats, muffins, even sliced turkey). Beach - beautiful and spacious. Only complaint is too many shells in the sand walking from resort to the water. People pulled the chairs from the hotel area towards the water to be close. I'd recommend hanging back by the resort for comfortable privacy from all the looky lous walking the beach. Topless was about at a 20% rate and varied during the day (it's fine though). You avoid the shell issue that way, can still see the water and easily access the resort. A lot of the people tended to hang at the infinity pool which is really nice. So what that means is you end up with a lot of open chairs on the beach all day long (never an issue, never). You can walk a mile south where the resorts end and the beach is somewhat isolated. Pool - beautiful infinity pool with lots of room, plenty of comfortable loungers with good service, mulitple spas (hot tubs) some for 2 people, a couple of large ones as well. The ones for 2 are on the other side of the infinity pool level with the beach, so that's cool, you can sit in the spa, level with the beach and see the ocean. SPA - so relaxing and nice. I fell asleep during massage. Comfortable changing room with Steam, Sauna, and Showers where they come and get you when ready. Steam was broken which was disappointing. The overall feel though is dark inside, cool music piped in and another world feel. Resort feel - tropical well manicured lawns of st. augustine and a good mix of tropical water gardens and palms; saw 2 iguanas, some sort of marsupial, a racoon at night (i've never seen a jungle raccoon until now). The varieties of palm trees are beautiful with many textures I found amazing. Small enough to not work up a sweat walking to dinner. Think front breezy lobby, winding downhill towards the beach with lots of walkways (you'll never get lost though). Clientele - upper middle class, mostly American, about 10% of them were from South America or Europe -age groups were 30% in their 20s to 30s, 50% in their 40s, 20% over 50 and there were maybe 2 older teens. The younger ones appeared to be honeymooners and/or were very reserved and classy. What we didn't like - - the shells on the beach sand just after the chairs and before the row of chairs people pull to the shoreline -we got there around 1:00 pm and couldn't do an early check-in so we grabbed lunch and waited until 3PM. Suggestion - bring your swimsuit in a carry-on and change in the restroom to get started on your vacation while you wait. -the Jetskis buzzing back and forth (that was really annoying the first day we sat on the shoreline). On the second day when we sat back near the pool and palmtrees, neither of us noticed them anymore.", "Date": "June 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas, Nevada", "Title": "\u201cThis resort does not live up to its 5 star status\u201d", "Author": "Discerningtraveler36", "ReviewID": "UR67929049", "Content": "The Royal Hideaway does not live up to its 5 star rating. My husband and I have been to other 5 star resorts in Mexico and there is NO COMPARISON! Before I list the reasons why, I would like to preface them by saying the staff is VERY nice and helpful. I would especially like to recognize Carlos, the sommelier. He was absolutely THE BEST and gave above and beyond service! However, this did not compensate for the multiple other problems we experienced with this hotel. The first night of our stay, the hotel was hosting a party on the beach for travel agents. It was VERY LOUD as there was a live band (playing very cheesy 80\u2019s songs) until 10:45pm. My husband and I had traveled from the West Coast and been awake since 2am so we were very tired. The next morning when we complained about it to our concierge they acted as if they were unaware there was even a party on their beach with a band!! After speaking with two different staff members, we were told they could give us two 25 minute massages to compensate us. This hardly made up for one night of very little sleep (seeing as though the rooms are about $400/night). We then spoke with the Head Concierge in the main lobby, Antonio, who after MUCH haggling between my husband and him, agreed to upgrade our room on Saturday night. It seems the resort was full until Saturday and we stayed through the following Monday. Once we did change rooms, it was very nice and VERY quiet. I would recommend anyone staying at this resort who wants peace and quiet to upgrade to a Terrace Junior Suite. It is well worth it! There was no hot water in the shower the first night and each night thereafter the shower temperature would change intermittently throughout the time it was on. I really think the resort needs to upgrade its plumbing as on two separate occasions the toilets did not flush in the ladies restroom at the pool and there was no running water for about an hour. The restrooms are also not air conditioned which would have been nice since it was so hot outside. At other 5 star resorts we have stayed in ALL of the public restrooms were air conditioned. As for the gym, I must say IT LEAVES SOMETHING TO BE DESIRED! The resort has only ONE elliptical trainer and even though there are THREE treadmills, only ONE works!! They definitely need to upgrade their gym to a 5 star resort status. The Spa also LEAVES SOMETHING TO BE DESIRED!! Again, the showers (all three) had NO COLD WATER so all you got was SCALDING HOT!! After I had already shampooed my hair before my massage I was unable to wash it because the shower was so hot!!! No to mention, there is no area to relax while you wait for your massage. I must say however, my massage itself was wonderful! The TV\u2019s in the bedroom are old Zenith tube TV\u2019s and in my opinion they should be flat screen TV\u2019s for a 5 star resort. Also, be careful when going out on the patio, the sliding glass door \u201csticks\u201d so if you accidentally shut it you are locked out. The main pools have chipping tiles and do not seem to be kept up nicely. All other \u201crelaxation pools\u201d had green, mucky water that did not look appealing. Additional wait staff at the pools is also needed as they do not have time to come around very often to refill your drinks. The housekeepers are excellent and VERY TIMELY. However, a dirty gray cleaning cart out is left out in the open of the atrium for everyone to walk by. It is very unsightly and smells. For a five star resort, this is unacceptable. Lastly, be very careful about calls you may receive from people telling you to meet them to confirm your pick-up date/time. These are people trying to sell day trips, adventures, etc, and they are VERY persistent! You DO NOT NEED TO MEET THEM!! Your concierge will take care of this for you. We were called one morning at 8am and two days later at 3pm. It was very annoying. The above listed is not to say this resort is not nice, it just does not deserve to be in the category of 5 stars. I would say this is a 3-4 star property. If you have ever been to a 5 star property you would know what I am talking about. My husband and I would not go back to this property simply because we wanted a relaxing, quiet atmosphere and to feel pampered in ALL WAYS. Unless this resort fixes the problems listed above, it will not be 5 stars in our estimation.", "Date": "June 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Raleigh", "Title": "\u201cBest trip I've had in a long time\u201d", "Author": "cfarrar", "ReviewID": "UR67876494", "Content": "My husband and I went to the Royal Hideaway the end of April.

Several with ocean views. 2) Top notch service. I specifically want to mention Genaro at the pool, Dario in the piano bar, and Ricardo our concierge. 3) The infiniti pool is amazing with a perfect view of the ocean. We spent many days lounging at the pool - reading, swimming, drinking, meeting other travelers... 4) TOP NOTCH liquor in all of the bars. Grey Goose, Johnny Walker, Chivas, many types of Tequilla, etc. Tips: 1) Always order a ton of food. The portions are tiny, but everything is amazing. Grab a few apps and if you can't decide on a main dish, tell them that you want two. They won't always do it, but sometimes they will! Also, ask a lot of questions about the menus. Sometimes it's hard to tell exactly what you are ordering. Some waiters are better than others at communicating in English. 2) Go see Dario in the piano bar before your dinner. He's awesome and makes great drinks. 3) Go to the pool early and often. Stake a claim to the nice pool chairs or napping cabanas and then you won't be stuck complaining on TripAdvisor about how quickly the pool chairs fill up :). Genaro and the gang will come around early and often with water and other tasty beverages! A tip here and there will ensure that they remember exactly what you want! 4) Definitely eat at Las Ventanas, the Grill, and Azia. If you can't get a reservation at the time you want, just make one for late and show up early. People don't show up to their dinner reservations and you can get a seat. 5) The resort is DEAD at night, so plan on enjoying your dinner and relaxing. Or else go to downtown Play Del Carmen (2 minute cab ride) where it is CRAZY. All in all, this hotel is LEGIT. AAA 5 diamond for a reason. It oozes class, relaxation, and style.

The restaurants particularly las Ventanas, Spices and the sushi at Azia excellent.

First timers may find the hotel great but trust me it is not what it use to be. During our first dinner at Ventenas I was dismayed to note the key wall under the window cracked and crumbling. The property while still good, it must be noted the hotel is in need of maintenance, we felt cost cutting measures were in place and not meeting the high standards of previous years. We were bitten by insects numerous times inside and outside of our room. We had never experienced this problem before. Our room key was deactivated not once but TWICE within 5 days (we were staying 7). My husband and I suffered from \"montazuma's revenge\" starting Day 4 and it lasted for an entire week. Again during our previous stays there was never any health issues. I believe there are issues with food safety and improper hand washing as well as food handling. I noted the omelette chef wiping his nose on his coat sleeve; he left his work station and returned without washing his hands (I watched him). As well he used the same spatula when managing 3 to 4 omelette orders. This could cause a problem with food sensitivies/allergies. During BBQ chef handled raw food and then touched other prepared foods without washing hands - this is a food safety issue. Also at the BBQ a cream dressing was sitting out, uncovered and not placed on ice with full sun beating down. We spoke to other returning guests and they too noted the changes.

Cardio equipment does not work, weight room is dangerous if more than one person at a time due to space, there are not even pins for all of the circuit machines. Plus no air conditioning. The food has gone from being a 9/10 to maybe a 6/10. The resort and in general, Cancun/Cozumel are empty. Blame the US economy. I remember when this area was really a treat and very low cost. Not anymore. They would rather have your dollars than pesos. Example, is 1/2 hour on a jetski, $67, or how about a snorkeling trip for $98. Seems a bit high to me.

As some background, we have traveled to Cancun, Nuevo Vallarta, Belize, Caymans, Puerto Rico and other beach destinations within the US. We've had all-inclusive and not, stayed in 3 to 5 stars resorts. In all, if you want to be treated like royalty, this is your place. I honestly don't require all of the pampering they provide, but it's a nice touch, if that's what you desire. We arranged private transportation with Olympus Tours through the resort prior to arrival for $170 round trip. A taxi would be a little less, from what I understand about $80 to the hotel but $50 back. They apparently charge more when they are at the airport. I didn't realize Playacar was a completely separate, gated area, and then the resort was also gated. I felt much more safe than I have at other resorts. Upon arriving or departing, you provided your room number. The employees at the resort simply work themselves to death. Although it's all-inclusive, I certainly hope anyone who can afford to travel here provides tips to these great people. They do an exceptional job and deserve the extra tips. I want to note that I did not realize how formal this resort was for DINNER only (breakfast and lunch are casual). I read prior reviews, but didn't notice many comments about how specific the dress requirements were, so I would like to mention. Men are REQUIRED to wear long pants to ALL restaurants for dinner, and reservations are necessary. At the Grill and Spices, they can wear jeans. No shorts are allowed for anyone. I personally think men should be able to wear nice shorts and a golf shirt when it's 90+ degrees. Just my opinion, maybe others would disagree. We enjoy dining at a nice restaurant a couple times during vacation, but not to have to dress up for every dinner. Some of the women were dressed to the nines, but I just prefer to pack a couple nice outfits, not one for each day of my vacation. We ended up shopping for clothing, which was fine. I would note that room service is available 24 hrs per day, if you prefer to opt out. Also to note, dinner does last 2-3 hours. All of the food was very high quality, not your typical all-inclusive. You are provided a menu that you select from. I believe a buffet is available for breakfast, and they have a grill by the pool for lunch, in addition to a couple other options. Upon arrival, we were welcomed with cold towels and champagne. However, I had mentioned we were there for our anniversary and would prefer an oceanview room. We did not get one. When I inquired, they said it would $188/PER PERSON/PER NIGHT, which seemed a bit unreasonable for Mexico. We moved onto our room, which was relatively small, but very nicely appointed, clean, and had a large balcony. I wish they had a fan in the bathroom for steam, and a large mirror in the room just so you could get ready separately. The bathrooms are extremely nice, two separate sinks, and a tiled shower and a separate tub with a shower. They also provide a scale, a hair dryer, and your daily soap, shampoo, lotion. As others have mentioned, the noise level is a bit loud. We didn't notice any noise from the other resorts, rather people running up and down stairs, going in and out of rooms, etc.. Beach area is absolutely lovely. There are plenty of chairs and a large area to lay out and relax and listen to the waves. They also have cabana beds available overlooking the ocean. Service was impeccable at all points. From the cleaning people, to waiters, to service desk, we could not have asked for anything more. They cleaned the rooms twice daily, which I didn't think was absolutely necessary. One was for the turn down service, so they just did a lighter cleaning. We like to relax in our room periodically, so I felt bad when we were in there. We told them a couple times not to worry about it, but they just came back later. The grounds - simply superb, lush greenery, surrounded by tropical palm trees with walkways between each villa. Very beautiful to walk around. Pools were plentiful. If you are not interested in being surrounded by others, they have various areas where small pools are available for use and very private. Otherwise, the large pools allow everyone to gather and mingle, if you are interested. Towels are available, and someone will assist you. I tried returning the towels and was told that this was vacation, and princesses need not do such things while on vacation. :-) Fitness center - has an ample number of cardio machines and a separate weight facility which was perfect for a quick workout in the morning. Nearby shopping. If you walk to the left of the resort, there is a small shopping area with various options. You can walk or take a $5 taxi ride to 5th Avenue for high end shopping and/or vendors from Mexico. It's a wide array. We had a great time in this area, many places to have a drink and numerous shopping venues. In all, we had a wonderful time, but I wouldn't return only because I would prefer something a little less fancy. I met a woman on our plane who stayed at The Royal for two weeks, and it was their 4th trip and they love it there. It's apparently not quite as formal.

It was truly an amazing experience. We stayed from a Sunday through Saturday. We only left the resort twice - once to visit Chichen Itza and once to go into Playa Del Carmen itself for an afternoon. We had signed up for the base rluxury oom but as part of the complimentary honeymoon, were upgraded to a partial ocean view and also given a bottle of champagne upon arrival. The room itself was very nice - althoug we could hear occasionally the loud music coming from the resort next door even though we had an inward facing room. The air conditioning worked well, and the leaf ceiling fan filtered out most of the noise. They kept our mini bar well stocked during our visit - if we drank a lot of one drink, we'd see more in our fridge the next day. The jacuzzi and marble bathroom were great as well. We had nightly turndown service which was a nice touch, although they forgot to do it one night (oops). We advise making your dinner reservations for the restaurants early - our villa's concerige Muriel did this. She was very helpful. Only some of the restaurants are open on different days at night. For breakfast, your options are the buffet at Spices - great fresh fruit and omelettes or ala carte at Las Ventanas or room service. For lunch, your choices are the Deck which had a variety of seafood - I recommend the fried calamari, ceviche, and barbecued ribs appetizers, and the salmon / group entrees, or a grill which had a variety of kabobs, burgers, hot dogs, chicken, fish, and fries. As for dinner, we had Dinner on the Beach once which had great ambience, Las Ventanas twice, Azia twice, and Palazzo once. We didn't do Spices or the Grill. The service was outstanding - the portions at Las Ventanas were not that big unless you got the tasting menu but the food was great, Azia was decent although the sushi is definitely not like New York, and Palazzo's tasting menu was great. You could also get dinner at the show which is on Thursday but we saw it after eating. We heard of the Chef's table at Las Ventanas where they go through preparation but we didn't sign up for it. The service overall was spectacular. The staff was eager to please and also greeted you with a smile. If you get a poolside chair or bed by the beach(yes you do have to get up ~700am and reserve a seat), if you tip the servers occasionally, they come by more often. Beers and tropical drinks are plenty, and they do have many top shelf drinks - you can get Grey Goose, Johnnie Walker black, and Don Julio Tequila. At night, we could get drinks at the Piano Bar or the Allegria Bar. Room service was punctual and nice. The infinity pool is shallow but you could easily lounge on the float or just sit and eat/drink all day. The beach is not big but very clean and you could walk into other resorts. The guests all seemed very happy and there were many repeat visitors, including one couple who had been there 33 times! I think we will be a repeat visitor someday. Other notes: High Tea between 4-6pm is nice - they have live music and you can get tea or tequila plus some canapes and other finger sandwiches. They had daily activities including classes on cookie, scuba, boccie ball, water aerobics, spanish, and fun activities where you could meet others such as trivia, karaoke, sing along, and ping pong. They have free wireless internet service so bring your laptop. The PCs in the business center are really slow. The gym is small but good if you want a quick workout. We didn't use the tennis court or basketball court as it was too hot, but it definitely looked nice. We didn't use the spa, but many of the guests did. Only minor nuisances was that their room cards were particularly sensitive to being deactivated near electronics. Mosquitoes (after a brief rainstorm) were pesky. The TV is a simple Zenith but if you're there why would you be watching a lot of TV? Making phone calls from the hotel phone are very expensive.

This was my 3rd time here and it is as good as before with a couple of small differences. We like smaller adult only resorts and enjoyed the quiet infinity pool looking out at the recently restored beach. It is breathtaking. The hot tubs overlooking the sea are wonderful too and actually saved the last couple of days in which we had a good bit of rain. The property is lovely and always being maintained. We saw staff painting shutters on the villas, painting the roof of Spices restaurant etc. during our stay. The landscaping is lush and the privacy pools are nice for those who want even more quiet and solitude than what the infinity pool offers. They do have floats and there always seemed to be enough (no one hoarding them during our stay). Also there was not a lot of chair saving going on during our stay. They have Thai beds which did tend to get reserved but people would use them and then vacate them by lunchtime and we were lucky enough to get the beds three separate days when people were vacating them and told us they were available. Obviously availability will vary with occupancy rate but we were very happy not to have to worry about getting shade, either a Thai bed or an umbrella set up for us by the pool staff. There are plenty of daytime organized activities which are listed in the daily newspaper placed on your bed during nightly turn-down service. Regarding housekeeping, the housekeeping here was the BEST over any resort we have been to. They were always finished our room by the time we returned from breakfast so totally unobtrusive and turndown service was always done by the time we returned from dinner. The room was immaculate and all toiletries, towels and washcloths were plentiful. We never had to request a thing as our room was well stocked! The rooms are a bit smaller than other resorts but big enough. The bathroom was spacious with a double bowl vanity, Jacuzzi tub, separate shower and walk-in closet. There was plenty of drawer space between the two nightstands and the armoire, plus shelves in the walk-in closet. Speaking of the armoire, it houses the TVs which other reviewers have mentioned are not LCD. I really didn\u2019t mind the TVs not being LCD since we don\u2019t watch much TV on vacation. The armoires actually match the cherry wood sliding shutters in the rooms so the resort is probably not in a big hurry to swap out all of the TVs and redo the matching furniture. The staff are wonderful, especially our favorite waiter at breakfast and poolside for lunch, Gorge. He was always smiling, always seeing to our needs, and takes a lot of pride in \u201chis\u201d restaurant. There seemed to be a good many new staff members in training. I think the resort is in a transitional period and once all of the new staff our trained, RH will be what it was before. This was one of the small differences I alluded to in my first paragraph. It seemed that the personal touch was gone to an extent. On previous visits, staff greeted us by name by the 2nd or 3rd day and without asking brought our drinks (cappuccino and orange juice at breakfast). I think right now the focus is on getting all of the new staff trained and once they are comfortable in their roles, hopefully they will once again provide those personal touches. As far as food, we did not have a bad meal at any of the restaurants for dinner. There were 4 of us traveling together and we all agreed Azia was the best (we didn\u2019t do the hibachi table; we sat in a private room). The sushi was incredible. Surprisingly, Las Ventanas, their \u201csignature\u201d restaurant was just ok, not our favorite. The Grill was awesome and so was the Italian. There was lots of variety at lunch \u2013 several salads to choose from, plenty of fresh seafood, and ceviche that was delicious as well. Spices was a little disappointing for breakfast the first two days as everything was cold. The burners were not lit under half of the breakfast items. I spoke to the manager about this and the rest of the week the burners were lit and everything was hot \u2013 such a simple thing but it had to be mentioned in order to get a hot breakfast. I was also disappointed that Ventanas was not open for the a la carte breakfast during our week there; however Spices never seemed crowded at all for breakfast so I can understand why they wouldn\u2019t open and staff another restaurant for breakfast when occupancy was seemingly low. But they do need to work on making sure the hot foods are hot. Regarding night life, it is true that this is a quiet resort in the evenings. There is a bar you can go for a drink after dinner but it is pretty small and a bit musty inside. There are tables outside too where it is nice to sit and have a nightcap weather permitting. What is missing (and we discussed this with other guests who are avid sports fans) is a place to watch games without having to go into PDC. The lower level of the lobby is a big enough area and never seemed to have a soul in it. It would be nice if they would install an LCD TV with satellite channels to at least catch a game with other guests. In this lower level there are bookshelves categorized by language where you can help yourself or leave books for other guests once you have read them. They did have the Dinner Theater on Thursday night. It was a good show but not too original. The food was good and everything was hot. I got a 45 minute Spanish massage at the spa. The spa is very nice and Juan was an excellent masseuse. The gym was nice with decent equipment. I loved that the resort is within walking distance of PDC (or a quick $5 taxi ride). PDC is changing all of the time. I can\u2019t decide if it is for the better. I liked when it was dirt and cobblestone roads with the nameless mom and pop shops, although I have to admit I like the occasional comforts of home such as Starbucks as well. Regarding noise levels, yes, you can hear doors slam during the day because of the design of the villas. Yes, you can hear music from adjoining properties until 11 pm. You mainly hear it when you are walking around the property. When you are in your room with your door closed, you might hear a little bass, but it ends at 11 pm. It didn\u2019t bother us a bit. I don\u2019t go anywhere expecting perfection but to me Royal Hideaway is about as perfect as it gets! We will definitely return!

He was very helping getting our dinner reservations together for us. He brought some beautiful flowers to our room which we thought was very sweet. He made sure every day that our fridge was stocked with lots of water and Bud Light. The restaurants were all great. We went to a couple of them twice. Our favorites were Las Ventanas and Azia. The pools were very nice and not ice cold. The hot tubs in front of the infinitety pool were nice and hot. It was nice sitting in them and looking out at the ocean. The grounds are impecacble and they are always working on them. The flowers are just gorgeous. I liked that Playa del Carmen is in walking distance. The resort also offered bikes to ride into town. There is also a nice smaller scale market right across the street from the resort. The beach is incredible. You can walk for miles and miles. The ocean was nice and warm. One of my favorite things about this resort is that it is very quite. There are no games (volleyball, etc) played in the pool and there is no loud music played at the pool. They have 5 pools and if you want some real seclusion there are 3 pools that are very isolated. But the best part was that we met some wonderful people. They are Chris & Karen from Calgary as well as Bob & Paige from Vermont. We did nothing but drink & drink some more and laugh the entire time that we spent with them. They all were very friendly and very funny. I would highly recommend this resort.

We were looking forward to eating at their signature (and five diamond) restaurant, Las Ventanas, but were somewhat disappointed. Although the experience was generally positive, the portions were incredibly small, the fish that my husband ordered was not properly cooked and they were out of the wine that we selected from their wine list (we did not care much for their 'included' wines, especially the red). The service was outstanding in most restaurants (where we were often recognized and greeted by name) but rather inconsistent around the pool area. The only disappointment was the lack of entertainment, both during the day and at night. We are far from 'party animals' and like the tranquility of adults-only resorts but we found the place a little too quiet (no band or music around the pool, no dancing, or cheesy shows at night...).

And honestly, we were wondering at the beginning if we needed to tip and after watching others, we only tipped on certain occasions. For example, when you are lying down on the beach and the waiter comes to you and takes your order for a drink - wow! The food was very good - the restaurants that are really upscale are Las Ventanas and Palazzo (the ambiance at this restaurant is fantastic). We did not try The Grill so can't comment. Azia was a bit disappointing but the sushis were excellent. It is true that you should book your restaurants ASAP (when you arrive) for the whole stay if you want to avoid eating at 9:00 PM (unless this is what you want). The Deck for lunch time is fantastic. Now for the property and cleanliness - PERFECT. The resort is peaceful & restful (no loud people) and the rooms are very well kept. In conclusion, I must say we are extremely picky when travelling and prefer staying home if we can't have the perfect place.

We arrive to find our ocean view room was on the 3rd floor with no elevator. This is unacceptable in a 5 star hotel. We were not as young as some of the guests and one of us had just had a hip replacement. When we asked about something lower they said they only had 8 ocean view rooms. Sorry. We managed but we did think about if we really needed to go back to the room for something. The rooms were ok but not at a 5 star level. Our closet was less than 2 feet long and difficult to use. I know other rooms have walk in closets but not this one. The bathroom had little counter space and no shelving. The tub and shower were both small and not very appealing. The bed linens though Italian needed to be pressed. I don't do this at home but I do expect it in a 5 star hotel. Artifical flower and the fruit plate consisted of 3 apples. Granted they would bring you other fruit but this was a put off when we got to the room. We're in Mexico and they can't have real flowers?? They advertise a big show in a show room. When we asked about it, they were no longer having it. Little other entertainment. As stated before only 2 dining rooms a night. We were there for 10 days and the food was average but many times it was not served hot. Steaks were tough and fish was overdone. Dinner took anywhere from 2-3 hours. In the Asian dining room it took an hour to get our first course. If you really studied the menu, there were 5 or 6 entrees(meats) that had different sauces in different dining rooms.

One day it was raining and we stayed dry in a tucked away hot tub. Someone pointed out \"rodents\" around the resort and I would like to add that these are Mexican chinchillas and we enjoyed watching them, they aren't friendly but the won't bother you and certainly won't come in your room!!! The main pool was nice and always chairs available. Pool staff brings around fruit and there is one bartender at the bar, so getting your drinks does take a while.

I like to take a siesta and it is really impossible to do-that was the only downfall of the trip. The people we traveled with concurred.

It is quiet, the rooms are beautifully appointed, the food is excellent and the service is fantastic. We were among the first people on their newly reclaimed beach, which is now also fabulous, and while we found the pool to be refreshing, it was never too cold to swim, particularly when daytime temps were in the 80's! After reading some of the other reviews here, I will be honest and say that, on occasion, we were disappointed when a particular restaurant was not open for a certain evening. However, we looked at that as an opportunity to try foods we normally would not have sought out elsewhere, and we were never disappointed. I would also remind people who have never been to an All-Inclusive that it is MORE than acceptable to ask for a second or even a larger portion for dinner, or to ask for another dish should the first one not be to your taste. On an evening when I felt unwell, our waiter saw that I was picking at my dish in Spices (which I felt had VERY good regional cuisine) and immediately asked if I would like to see the menu and make another selection. On another occasion, our 18 year old son did ask for seconds several times on our first trip there, and his request was gladly fulfilled. In addition, it is possible to see if a certain dish is available - - -if their dessert menu did not appeal, we often asked for a simple dish of sherbet or ice cream, which was also readily accessible. Another great thing about this resort is that, while it is very quiet in itself, it is a 5 minute cab ride into Playa del Carmen, and the hotel's staff often urged my children (who were 18 and 22 on our first trip there) to \"give Playa a try\". So - - - quiet, yes - - - but noise and evening excitement was certainly within reach if you wanted it. Occasionally the noise from the hotels next to the Hideaway would intrude into the idyllic peace we were seeking, but this was rare and to me, too far away too be considered intrusive. In addition, we were quite close to the beach while they were finishing their renovation, and once our doors were closed, we never once heard the machinery that I KNOW for a fact was going all evening.

This is the first time I have ever stayed at an all-inclusive and was reluctant to be tied to the hotel for 3 meals a day. That being said, for four days I was satisfied with the options, we met some other couples who stayed for two weeks and I don\u2019t know how they did it. I like diversity and choices when dining and two weeks of the same 4-5 restaurants would have driven me nuts. Rooms \u2013 We were in Villa 31 which was right by the pool and Spices restaurant. The location was perfect in my opinion. We were supposed to have Ricardo as our concierge but he was off for 75% of our trip, we had Anna instead and she was wonderful. Anna was always a smiling face and greeting you by your name and took care of every request we had. The rooms were very nicely appointed and quite spacious. The bathroom was expansive and my girlfriend enjoyed the separate Jacuzzi tub. Housekeeping was great, each day when we returned from the beach our room was cleaned and our mini-bar restocked. Nightly turndown service was superb, it was if they knew when our dinner reservations were as not to disturb us when changing for dinner. Food \u2013 I have seen so many mixed reviews on this and overall the food was very good, but not every restaurant was 5 stars. Spices: Only ate breakfast here and each morning it was a delight, omelets cooked to perfection, coffee cups never running empty and more options then you could possibly wish for. Las Ventanas: this was our first dinner and the perhaps the most disappointing, service wasn\u2019t great and meal portions were made for mice. I am not a big guy, but when my scallop entr\u00e9e came out with 4 scallops and no accompaniments I almost fell out of my chair. The appetizer was very good, but I felt Las Ventanas didn\u2019t live up to its hype. Azia \u2013 We did the hibachi option here as opposed to the private table and it was an experience (good and bad). Start with the bad, before they will seat you at the hibachi grill they need a minimum of eight people. That\u2019s fine, I understand that but we had an 8PM reservation and didn\u2019t get seated until almost 8:45PM, if they had just told us that the other 50% of the table wasn\u2019t coming to 8:45 I would have moved our reservation. We were seated with a colorful group of people which was enjoyable. The food was excellent, but it was a LONG meal. We didn\u2019t leave the restaurant until after 11:30. They didn\u2019t come out to cook the hibachi until 9:45. Azia won hands down for the best food and service. The Grill \u2013 We both enjoyed being by the water for dinner, the food was more fish and steak in my opinion. Service was great and so was the food. Pallatzo \u2013 We had low expectations for this place given all the negative reviews but we felt the food was good. Not great Italian food, but very good. Service was attentive and the harp player was a nice touch. Fitness Facilities \u2013 This is where we were let down. The gym isn\u2019t huge which is fine but it is unstaffed for the most part. Even though it shares space with the spa we never saw anyone there in the morning. There was a separate cardio room, which on the first day was incredibly warm with no one there to show us how to turn on the A/C or to flip the switch to turn on the treadmills etc. The nice part was the gym was a ghost town most morning. Beach/Pool \u2013 Yes there are those big black bags on part of the beach, but we didn\u2019t find it disturbing. The waiters by the pool were excellent and we never had a problem with service. The chairs were relatively well kept and there was always an abundance of towels. Cynthia by the pool was a gem giving us Martini & Tequila lessons. Edwin and Caesar worked the bar most days we were there and were funny and pleasant.

The food was not just comparable to Cutrain Bluff in Antigua, Maroma, up the way from R/P or Cambridge Beaches in Bermuda, but rather much much better. Is it Gourmet ? No it isn't but once again it is much better than the vast majority of the resorts out there. That said I find it interesting that some of the reviews indicate that the food was dissapointing or worse. Each of the six days that we were there, our meals were great and the service was attentive. We went to Azia our last night and I ordered the Peking Duch dish which was anything but Peking Duck. When I brought that to their attention they quickly got me a substitute of sushi, which was very good. As far as small portions, I noticed another couple that ordered an additional appetizer, so it doesn't pay to be shy. If you are, you don't have grounds to complain. We dinned at The Grill one night and I had this fantastic Caribbean Seafood Soup/ Fish soup. I liked it so much that at lunch the next day I asked if it was on the menu. It wasn't but the person I asked indicated that he would see what he could do. Well a little while later after the restaurant chef came on, they delivered a bowl to me by the pool. Just an indication of how the service was on our trip. Regarding the rooms, we found our room to be clean and nicely furnished. The bath was large with a walk in closet and separate toilette area. Double sinks, shower and Jacuzzi tub. My only negative there would be the lack of an ocean/gulf view. Other than that I can find no reason at all to complain about Royal Hideaway. We will be returning to R/H very soon and can't recommed this resort highly enough.", "Date": "January 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "long island", "Title": "\u201chighly recommended but not perfect\u201d", "Author": "aldor11", "ReviewID": "UR53315155", "Content": "I am in my last day here after a week and the place is first rate. The rooms are appointed with all the luxuries you expect. Robes, double sinks, excellent showers. Lots of closet space and drawers. We walked along the beach and checked out the other hotels and the comparason is not close. The other places are cheap looking , ugly and the crowd is definitely not of the caliber of the RH. I imagine the price has a lot to do with it. Not many of tattoo crowd here, not that theres anything wrong with tattoos. The grounds are beautiful and well maintained. The staff cannot do enough for you. Very accomodating. Tipping is included in your all inclusive package but a lot of it goes on anyway and I never saw an employee refuse one. The all inclusive aspect (A.I.) aspect is great. After you get accustumed to it its like being in the Catskills again. Room service 24 hrs. is also part of the A.I. If you want something not on the menu they will try to get it for you. The food itself is ok. Not great. Breakfast is the best meal. Presentation is very nice but sometimes you just want a simple tuna sandwich.The drinks are all right but the stuff from the well is not first rate. Try the Miami Vice. The Asian restaurant is the best. The Italian food is mexicos version of Italy.. Not bad but it aint Don Peppes in Queens, if that means anything to you.The service while attentive is slow. Most dinners took almost 2 hrs. but there is not much going on anyway. ITs a quiet place. Which brings me to the really only negatiive part of the vacation. The place is definitely less the 50% occupied. Much less I would have to geuss. I believe because of this some of the restaurants were closed on what seems to be a rotating basis. When we tried to make some reservations we found out they were closed. Rather annoyed us actually. Check this out before you book. It really restricts your options. And you are not likely to eat somewhere else. Each villa has its own concierge and they are very helpful. One last suggestion. Do not take a room on the first floor. There are these animals around, the size of cat that look like some kind of rodent. They are apparently quite shy and harmless but my wife was would noy be happy with even a possiblity of one of these things getting in the room. We are in Villa 23. Good location. Closer to the pool than the main building. The health club is a little small but well equiped and locker room has steam, sauna and massages. I only wish the weather was warmer so we could have taken full advantage of pool and ocean.

We were looking for an all-inclusive adult only resort to spend the Christmas Holiday at. I had searched and read reviews on resort after resort, and was driving myself crazy. I read the reviews posted about Royal Hideaway, and they had their good and bad too, but we decided to go with them and take a chance. From the time you enter the resort, to the time you leave, you will not want or need anything! The staff at Royal Hideaway are friendly and take very good care of you! The resorts grounds are quite beautiful, and the landscaping is wonderful. The rooms are pretty and some what on the small size, but the bathroom is large and can double as a dressing area (has a walk-in closet). This is the FIRST resort that I have ever stayed in, where the water pressure in the shower was not an issue! They have both a hand held and overhead sprayer, and I had no complaints with water temperatures or pressure the entire time we were there. We stayed in building 23, which is centrally located. It has 3 floors of rooms (no elevator) something, that if we were told, we might have wanted to change, but we got use to it by the 2nd or 3rd day. Most buildings just have 2 floors. The Main pool was beautiful. It would of been wonderful, if there was some way that the water could be heated, as the weather had been on the cold side a few days before we arrived, and it took the pool a few days to warm up via the sun. The infinity pool is also very nice, and the heater would pay off nicely there too. There are several nice smaller pools scattered throughout the grounds, but we did not use any of these, so I can not give you any information regarding them. The beach is nice, and there are ample chairs so that anyone wanting one could have them. There were always towels whenever we needed them, and they would even bring you new ones if you had been sitting in the sun all day, or one rolled up to put behind your head. This service was also given to poolside patrons too. While sitting by the pool, the staff will bring you cool towels to help keep you cool. They come and serve you fresh fruit, and are always there to take your drink order or food order. You will not want for anything ------ it will be brought to you, all you have to do is ask! The food is wonderful. Our favorite restaurant was Palazzo's (Italian food). The service was 5-star, and they treated you like royality. Aziza (Oriental cusine) was our next favorite. The sushi was good, and they have tatomi rooms or outdoor seating. Spices restaurant is wonderful too. They have a killer breakfast buffet, that you can choose from fresh fruits and/or have an omelet made to order. There always seemed to be room on the deck to eat our breakfast on the patio, so we could look out over the ocean and really enjoy the start to our day. Las Ventana's is Royal Hideaways signature restaurant, and it is indeed a dining experience. The wait staff almost fawns over you to make sure that you have everything that you need or desire. The Grill, is the poolside eatery, to get your typical hamburger, french fry type fare, nothing fancy, just quick food. Our building Conceierge (every building has their own) ours was Rosalia. She was incredible friendly, and she did everything that she could to make our stay there enjoyable, and we put her to the test each and every day, with questions about various things ------Thank you Rosalia! Afternoon tea. 4-6PM daily. Please do not miss afternoon tea. Ask Manuel to make you a Mayan coffee, and watch him as he does it, it really is quite an interesting process. The Kahula, tequila and I believe there is coffee in there somewhere too, makes the whole afternnoon happy! Be sure to smile at the gentleman playing the saxaphone for your listening enjoyment, he is alot of fun too. We did go to the Dinner Show on Christmas Eve. The show was absolutely wonderful. A Mayan fire dance and lots of great lighting effects. The dinner.......well, let me say this. It is very hard to serve that many people in that short of a period of time. You might be wise, to go and see the show, then go over to Spices and see if you can get a table for a late night snack. This hotel, and we travel around to alot of different places and islands, was an absolute pleasure to be at. We were treated very nicely, be each and every person there. No need of our was too big or too small. The even presented us with a small chocolate confection on Christmas Eve, as a \"present\" which I thought was very very nice of the hotel to do. We met 2 other couples there, and we all had the same reaction ------ we would all come back to the Royal Hideaway Resort ---- its a no brainer.

Our first visit ever was to Royal Hideaway and I say this is where we fell in love with Mexico. That was five years ago. This was our first time back to Royal Hideaway in 3 1/2 years and in that time I have often thought longingly about it. The thing that stood out was the service was like no other we had experienced anywhere else. I said they set the bar that no one else had met. We have been going to the Iberostar Grand the last three years because of the condition of the beach at Royal Hideaway. Royal Hideaway still charges top dollar so we had not been tempted to go back until I heard about their buy one night, get one free special and decided it was time. I should have stayed with my memories. We were there Nov. 28th to Dec. 4th. The weather was pretty perfect and the resort is still beautiful. The beach is really small, but the sand bag situation in front of RH is not as bad as I had feared. Currently there is only one giant bag right in front. however, to the north and south there are many. They only have about three rows of chairs on the beach and they are packed in very tight. The one day we sat on the beach we were in the back row and all I could see were the chairs in front of me. I don't need a huge beach, but this was stretching my requirements even. They were at 30-40% occupancy, so we had no trouble getting chairs by the infinity pool when we would come out at about 9am. We never tried to get the beds. The service at the pool was outstanding. My husband would stand up to think about moving the umbrella and the pool attendant was over in a heartbeat to do it. He would check frequently to make sure we were okay and he was clearly embarrassed the one day at 9am when I went to get towels and they had none. He brought them to us as soon as they were delivered, but really, no towels at 9am at a five star resort? The food was a very mixed experience. The only option for breakfast was Spices and it was a buffet. If you wanted an omelet you would be fine. But the scrambled eggs were watery and the french toast and pancakes were cold. The selection just got old after six days (actually it got old way before that). The service at breakfast was usually slow and unenthusiastic. Lunch selections at the Deck (we never ate a Spices for lunch) were disappointing as well. There was decent variety, but nothing was made very well. They did meet special requests (chicken tacos were on the menu and they gave my husband shrimp tacos when he requested them). Service was decent to good. Dinners were outstanding everywhere. We ate at all the restaurants and the food was really wonderful. We had been disappointed in Spices for dinners before, but we really enjoyed it this time, and all the others were really fabulous. There were serious lapses of cleanliness at the resort. The one day we ate breakfast inside there was a dead fly on the window sill, the window was dirty and there were crumbs of food on the sill. When we first arrived we hit several \"no's\" and this really surprised and disappointed us. We went to Afternoon Tea the first day and my husband was told no when he ordered a Mayan coffee. They did make it the rest of the days we went. The second day at Tea I asked for a second glass of champagne and was told they were out. Are you kidding me? Now, champagne is a central part of Afternoon Tea and the hours for it are 4-6. I was told they were out at 5. We left and went to the lobby (where there were 3 bottles of champagne on ice) and asked for change (I wanted $20 peso bills for tips) and was told they had none and again the next morning they still had none. Eventually they had them. The one day at Tea (when they ran out of champagne) they were letting people just help themselves to the food (normally they bring it to you). Then the next day when a guest went up to get some food one of the waitresses said to him,\"I'll get it for you\" and she was rather abrupt and then she waited about 5 minutes before she brought him food. Also, Tea is advertised to start at 4pm and one day we arrived at 4:15 and they told us they weren't ready yet. It was apparent early on that it wasn't going to be the \"drop-dead amazing service like I have experienced no where else\" experience during past visits. Each villa has a concierge, but ours was frequently not at her desk. Curiously, one day she was not at her desk, but when I went up to my room and pressed the \"concierge\" button on my phone, she answered. She never made any effort to introduce herself to us (in past years they always have as we check in after they have left for the day). She did notice we drank a lot of water and stocked accordingly. Drink service at the pool was pathetic. There were waiters are they went by frequently, but they rarely stopped and asked if we wanted something. They often walked by with their eyes down like they were trying to avoid looking at you in case you did want something. Although I imagine if I had jumped up in front of them and asked for a drink they would have brought me one. But you shouldn't have to do that. And we do tip, every round, so I don't think that was it. They were friendly enough, but just not attentive at all. The rooms and bathrooms are relatively small as compared to the Iberostar Grand. The bathroom was a bit of a hassle, but the room is no big deal since we don't spend too much time there. In past years they have had dinner shows in the theatre twice a week, but there was nothing offered while we were there. The security does a great job of making sure no one comes on to the property that is not a guest. And it's great not having to wear a bracelet. The age requirement is supposed to be 13 years and up, but we saw a kid who looked younger. With our memories of such an amazing place, it was hugely disappointing. Since this was our fourth visit to Royal Hideaway it's impossible to say what we would have thought if it had been our first. But we know how amazing they can be and they clearly were not this time. Since there are other places that are doing better, that is where we will go next time. Life is too short and the Royal Hideaway charges too much for these kind of lapses.", "Date": "January 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "oak park il", "Title": "\u201cAN AMAZINGLY PEACEFUL AND ELEGANT RESORT\u201d", "Author": "jstocks530", "ReviewID": "UR52202366", "Content": "I recently spent 6 days at Royal Hideaway and don't remember when I've so enjoyed a resort.

We thought we'd lie around the hotel, eat a lot of food and have a nice, quiet romantic weekend. Reading trip advisor and booking over the internet, we thought we were getting a 5 star hotel, but walking around the property, we kept joking to ourselves, \"oops, there goes another star...\" First off, the food is horrible, which is a terrible disappointment, because it's an all inclusive, so we ate food that wouldn't otherwise eat because we already paid for it. The \"steak house\" serves first class airplane food, the Italian Restaurant is awful, and the lunch grill menu is about on par with midwestern country club cabana fare. The pool is nice, but you have to wake up at 6am to reserve one of those cabana beds. I swear there are guests putting their towels and books out on those cabanas in the middle of the night, because by 7am, they are all booked up and gone. We asked our concierge to reserve one for us on our last day, and she said that she did, but she didn't so we never got to experience it. Oh well. We took out the catamaran, but you are not allowed to go out of sight, so it was pretty lame. We thought we'd cruise south for 20 minutes and head back, but apparently, you are just supposed to cruise in circles right in front of the hotel where they can see you. The rooms are outdated and full of bugs. The wallpaper was peeling off of the walls in our bathroom and there were many little things in need of replacement. The mega resorts on either side of the \"Royal Hideaway\" are super noisy. They have ridiculous loud parties every night and it doesn't matter where your room is on the property, you will hear them and be totally annoyed by them. The resort is on the Playacar development, which makes it nice and safe, but it's timeshare city around there, and it felt like we were vacationing on some suburban Florida golf course. We treated ourselves to the spa, massage, pedicure and manicure. These services were nice, but not outstanding. With all of that griping, I should add that the service is unreal. Everyone was so friendly and helpful. Room service comes right away, waiters and waitresses are friendly, and the beach staff incredibly helpful and friendly.

The dance floor was full, many nights, as we danced to the great Royal Band, (who just played spectacularly,at the Riviera Maya jazz festival)with a fabulous female singer, and talented musicians, who insures that everyone has a great time. One evening there was reggae, salsa group, who entertained with a fabulous Bob Marley set, to which everyone danced.

You can float around the infinity pool, (practically a part of the beach) sipping you favorite drink and enjoy the view of the blue, blue waters.

We felt it was amazing at the time and couldn't wait to get back. Now, 8 years later, I'm happy to say it's still quite amazing! A few things to keep in mind: Bring a lot of small bills. Although tipping isn't required, it is only courteous to leave the waiters and waitresses something after a meal. You'll find the service at the restaurants to be as good if not better than any 5 star restaurant in the U.S. If you run out small bills (as I did) the concierge in the main lobby will be able to help you out. If you're booking excursions, I would recommend trying the small kiosk at the market across the street. We were able to get significantly lower prices there than those offered at the hotel. Also - I would highly recommend the ATV/Cave excursion! If you have the opportunity to book the Royal Relaxation package, I would highly recommend it. It consisted of a massage, facial, manicure and pedicure. If you can avoid The Grill Restaurant for dinner, I would recommend doing so. The food there wasn't on par with the other restaurants. One annoying thing we found was that guests would routinely save seats at the pool by placing a towel or something else on the chair. The hotel warns guests against doing this but don't enforce it at all. As others have commented - there is no nightlife at this hotel. When we were here 8 years ago, they had a dinner show twice a week. They didn't have that this time around. The rooms are beautiful. I've seen complaints on here of mold but we didn't find any in the room we were in. The televisions are in definite need of an upgrade. Any so-called 5 star hotel should have a flat screen.

This can be a great resort, depending on what you are looking for. We've travelled to many all-inclusive resorts in the Caribbean, and always have a great time. We don't get hung up in the details, and always manage to have a great trip where-ever we go. Things we liked the most : The resort and the resort grounds are beautiful. The service in the restaurants and at the pool is top notch. The food overall was pretty good. Azia was our favorite, and we ate there twice. The sushi was great there as well. Las Ventanas was very elegant, but the food was a bit disappointing for me. Seemed that they are more into aesthetics than flavor. The Grill is very good as well. The breakfast buffet didn't have a great variety, but was definitely more than adequate for breakfast food. The cabanas by the beach were awesome for an afternoon nap and some reading time. The service around the entire resort is great. We were addressed by name by most of the staff, and they served with a smile. We especially liked Julio and Pamela. The guys around the pool were great, and never let your drink run empty. We did massages at the SPA and that was great. Highly recommend it!!! The infinity pool was really nice, and has a great view out to the ocean. Things we didn't like as much: The resort was only about 25% full, if I had to guess. We saw no more than 20 or so couples the whole time we were there. This is a good thing if you want a really quiet vacation. We are in our 40s and are more into some action while on vacation. We enjoy playing volleyball on the beach, music around the pool, and some nightlife after dinner. This resort has none of these things. There was a band in the bar every night while we were there, but there were never more than 6 people in the bar when we were there. One night we were the only 2 in the bar, listening to a 6 member band play some music. We felt a little outnumbered. Another night there were only 4 of us, since we brought another couple with us. We walked on the beach everyday and were a bit envious of the bigger resorts with more activity and energy. The beach is pretty non-existent. Unfortunately for this beautiful place, it just doesn't have much of a beach. The sandbags are a bit ugly, and take away from the overall beauty of the place. It is a real shame for the resort, as they seem to have been hit harder than the others around it in terms of beach erosion from the hurricane. If you are beach people, go to Secrets Maroma or Turks and Caicos. With so few people at this resort I found myself feeling a bit sorry for them while I was there. Overall it was a very nice trip and we relaxed more than we typically do on vacation. We will probably try other resorts before coming back here, but maybe down the road we would return when we need some real peace and quiet.", "Date": "October 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Antonio, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat place, I would definitely go back!\u201d", "Author": "TexasTraveler82", "ReviewID": "UR45084508", "Content": "My boyfriend and I traveled to Playa Del Carmen on August 12 and stayed till the 16th. This was my first experience out of the country. When we arrived at the hotel we were shown to the lobby where we checked in. We recieved a hot towel and a glass of champagne. The bellman showed us to our room pointing out the different buildings on the property. The property was very beautiful! Plush, with lots of greenery, ponds, fountains and benches along the walk ways. We stayed in the duplex suite. It was very nice, I have posted some pics so I won't go into much detail. There are only a few complaints that I have about the room. First, the room had a very stale, almost stinky smell to it. I just figure for the price, they could put some air freshners in there or something. Next, our room where we slept was literally next to the neighboring hotel and at night the music was loud and didn't stop until midnight. Another thing was that I tried to take a bath and it filled up with dirt or maybe sand, that could be a Mexico thing, I'm not sure. My last complaint about the room was the water temp. I don't know if this is a common theme in Playa hotels, but our water temp was never constant. It would change from what I wanted to scolding hot. One night I tried to shower around 5 or 6 and there was no hot water. There was an infinity pool which seemed to be prime property. I think that since we went the time of year that we did it wasn't too crowded, so it wasn't bad trying to find a lounger. Finding a spot on the beach or at the pool next to the infinity pool was never a problem. There isn't much of a beach, and there are sand bags. So if you are in it for the beach, then this is not the place for you. Service around the pool and on the beach was fantastic! Drinks and snacks galore! There were cabanas to lay in as well. Not all the restaurants were open at the same time when we were there, but I think that we tried all but one. The food was good, some restaurants I liked better than others. Spices and I believe it was called the Grill were my favorites. The breakfast buffet was awesome. Just about anything that you would want, including a cook to prepare an omlette any way you want it.

They built some grand expectations in my mind by touting that they are the only adults-only all-inclusive AAA 5-diamond award winning resort in Mexico. They delivered on a few of my expectations, but fell miserably short on others. First of all, the occupancy was VERY low during our stay. We estimated there were fewer than 50 people there on any given night during our stay. The quiet was good and bad; easy to get a poolside beach chair; zero nightlife. Depends on what you\u2019re looking for \u2013 the low occupancy suited us just fine and we enjoyed our quiet stay very much. Rooms Overall, pretty good. Nice furniture, nice bed, fairly spacious. Again, RH set my expectations and failed to deliver on a few points; archaic/very basic shower head, small tub, old/very small TV. Shining moment The air conditioning in our room was stellar. I was blown away by how well it cooled our room. Best a/c I have EVER had in any room on vacation. Spa Had an 80 minute Swedish massage. Excellent. Highly recommend. Pools Beautiful view from the main pool. Gorgeous. Lovely white sand beach and stunning turquoise water. The infinity-edge overlooking the ocean was definitely a high point. There was really only one other pool and it was directly behind the main pool. Unfortunately, the drink service was lacking; lousy at best. In my opinion, if you aren\u2019t going to have a swim-up bar, you should have great poolside service. We probably walked up to the bar to order and retrieve our own drinks about 75% of the time. And it\u2019s not like the pool was crowded. Another disappointment was that the pool water stained our bathing suits yellow. It didn\u2019t come out in the wash, so every light-colored bathing suit worn at RH had to be thrown out. Again, not what I expected from such an award-winning resort. One major struggle was that the pools closed down very early. They would start removing the cushions from the chairs as early as 5pm. Although it was never posted or discussed, the staff definitely preferred that everyone be vacated from the pool area by 6pm. Food At check-in we were told about all of the great restaurants. Only when I inquired were we advised of the limited availability of the various restaurants. The food, overall, was good but it wasn\u2019t fantastic. Again, given all of their boasting, I expected better. Reservations are required for dinner each night \u2013 this isn\u2019t a big deal because your concierge is almost always available to make them for you and there are plenty of times available. Breakfast Disappointing. Very small buffet every morning and the same menu every day. If you wanted cereal, a pastry, a muffin, cheese or salami \u2013 this was the breakfast buffet for you. As we were informed by RH frequenters, there is usually a second breakfast option with a la carte breakfast. This was never available during our stay. Lunch One option and, again, the same menu every day. As we were informed by RH frequenters, there is usually a second lunch option available. This was never open on our trip. The ceviche was the standout at The Deck. The rest of the food at the lunch spot was decent and they would deliver it to you poolside if you preferred. Dinner By far the best meal of the day. Only one restaurant was open for dinner on our first night. The open restaurants rotated each night and we were able to eat at all five during our five-night stay. We were very disappointed with Spices restaurant. The food was not good \u2013 from appetizer to soup to main course to dessert \u2013 it was all bland and sub-par. Las Ventanas had a rather good menu, but the air conditioning in the building was a miserable failure. It was uncomfortably hot and this particular restaurant requires \u2018formal\u2019 attire. Not a good combination. An otherwise great meal was ruined by incessant sweating. The Grill was by far our favorite restaurant and the steak was delicious. It\u2019s an outdoor restaurant, so expect to be a little warm. Dinner theater Never open during our stay. We are very glad we went and we had a wonderful time. Maybe it\u2019s because we didn\u2019t get the full experience of the resort, but based on this trip, I wouldn\u2019t go back to RH.

We were provided a private car (van) to the resort from the Cancun airport, and loved the resort immediately. We couldn't have been happier with everything from the rooms and facilities to the food and the service. Whether we lounged around the only infinity pool in either direction on the beach or took refuge in the picturesque Thai beds dotting the perimeter of the beach front property, we truly felt like we were alone in paradise. It does help that the resort was at approximately 20% capacity. Not only did we get a discount on our trip prior to going as a result, but we didn't have to fight with other guests for the best spots around the pool or the best tables at dinner. Aside from a few other couples scattered around, you feel like you have the entire 5 diamond resort to yourself. While the resort and surroundings far exceeded our expectations (the sand bags really aren't that bad, you just need to look past them), I think this is a good forum to provide other readers with the cons and pieces of advice if you are considering this resort. So here it goes... take it for what you will, as I still highly recommend this resort. Firstly, come with a LOT of singles, as people are very eager for tips for just about everything. You don't have to throw tips for everything, but leaving a couple bucks for the high tea waitor, or for the pool guy that gets you a drinks is nice to do. This will also come in handy when paying for random things outside the resort, as everyone will claim that they don't have change for whatever bill you have so that hopefully you will tell them to keep the change or they can try to rip you off on an exchange rate to pesos. Next, don't eat at the Spices restaurant. It is the Mexi/International restaurant on site, and to be honest it was horrible. I heard that in other reviews as well, but tried anyway. My mistake. On that note, all the other restaurants are excellent, try them all. Order 3 entrees i you want, order 3 deserts, and share. Most of the offerings are rather 'gourmet', so the portions are small. You won't leave this resort feeling like you just got off a cruise ship with an extra 10 lbs, which is nice. One complaint that I and other guests had was some preferential treatment by some of the workers to a couple that had tipped a manager at the beginning. The best table at lunch was reserved every day (people turned away for an hour and a half from sitting there until this couple arrived). There were private chairs by the hot tub that were reserved by the manager/pool boys as soon as they arrived to work in the A.M. with fake books and towels laid out. This is a 5 diamond resort, and their policies clearly are against this, which makes it all the more unacceptable. Even after complaints to the front desk, there was no enforcement against this practice. To each his own though, I guess. If you don't mind paying a couple hundred extra to a worthless pool manager, you will get whatever you want. The only other thing that I can complain about is regarding their complimentary honeymoon package. Part of that package is supposed to be a complimentary upgrade. That is a lie. We, and other honeymooners that we met, received no such upgrade even after blatantly asking for one. Our accomodations were very nice anyway, but I think that we were improperly mislead. Overall, I would absolutely return to this resort - but with the knowlege gained from the first trip. Don't be afraid to ask for anything, after all you are paying for it. This was the best resort that I have ever been to, so please don't misunderstand any of my remarks. Just use this review and others to ensure you have the best trip possible.

It overflows with charm and it's very clean. That's very important to me. I can't relax if I'm grossed out by my surroundings. The staff was incredibly friendly and extremely accommodating. It's a boutique hotel - just the right size - and the staff soon remembered us by name. If you enjoy being treated like royalty - this is the place for you. The grounds were immaculate and beautiful, food and drinks were fantastic (even for an all-inclusive resort), high tea every afternoon was a nice surprise, pool is gorgeous and large, rooms and bathrooms are spacious, lovely, and well-maintained. Now for the most important part - the beach. I loved it! There were large sand bags placed along/near the coast line, but even that didn't detract from the lovely beach. Plus, we knew to expect that, thanks to traveler reviews here on TripAdvisor. The water is clear, turquoise and the sand bags actually helped tame down the waves a little, which I liked. The sand is the whitest white you've ever seen. One negative point - our room was located near the neighboring hotel's outdoor bar and pool area. That hotel has nightly party and dance events that get VERY loud. We heard blasting music, people telling into a microphone and general crowd noises late at night. We're in our twenties and by no means consider ourselves party poopers, but even we got a tad annoyed by this. It still wasn't enough to wreck our good time. A small price to pay for such a magical vacation!", "Date": "July 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin", "Title": "\u201cWow!\u201d", "Author": "snowy08", "ReviewID": "UR35137536", "Content": "We stayed here in October of last year, and all I can say is \"wow!\"!

I've been to a handful of 5 star resorts in the past but the Royal Hideaway is leaps and bounds bounds above those other resorts in every category... cleanliness, service, location, value rooms. My wife and I almost changed our mind before we left. We were thinking of switching because of complaints about the lack of beach and the overly hyped swine flu pandemic. I'm glad we didn't because we would have missed out on an amazing honeymoon. Although the beach has suffered from past hurricanes there is still plenty of beach to enjoy... although you will likely find you will spend most of the time floating around in the infinity pool or in the hot tubs that are practically right on the beach. In fact if your like my wife and I you likely won't even leave that area. The staff at the pool will look after your every need. They are constantly adressing you by your surname and looking after your every need. They'll bring you drinks while you relax in the pool, cabana or in your lounge chair. If you get hungry they will bring you a menu and you can order whatever you wish poolside... If your on the beach they have green flags that you simply stick in the sand and they will bring you whatever food or drink you wish. As for the swine flu... It seems to be blown way out of proportion. We were informed no one at the resort has been infected and we didn't see or experience anything that would prove otherwise. Some reports on trip advisor indicated that some people have had issues booking reservations for the restaurants but we didn't have any problems getting in to any of them in fact we went to each one at least twice... and if we couldn't get in there was always room service which is included in the all inclusive deal. They will bring you whatever you like 24hrs a day. If your looking for a quiet and relaxing resort where you are pampered with great service than definitely try the Royal Hideaway.

We were not expecting the gourmet meals we were able to enjoy. Each dish was unique and tasted phenomenal. Dinner was never rushed - the service was very attentive. The resort was quiet and peaceful, a benefit of the low occupancy (and the swine flu threat!) It did not bother us that all the restaurants were not available every night - we were able to eat in each one twice. Breakfast was amazing - the view combined with the wonderful assortment of food (the pastries are to die for!) was very relaxing.

Check in was a breeze and we were greeted with a glass of champagne and towel which was a nice touch. We specifically had requested a room in one the villas in the middle of the resort as several other reviewers had mentioned noise from the adjacent resorts. I can confirm that it does get very noisy at night. The rooms are very nice but could use some updating in the electronics department. What 5 star resort in this day and age does not have a flat screen tv? My biggest complaint with the room lies in the bathroom and throughout the whole resort. The plumbing is in serious need of upgrading! As mentioned in previous reviews each villa comes with a concierge. I guess we didn't have the same luck as most. Our concierge Carolina was usually nowhere to be found, and was of no help whatsoever. Luckily the front desk staff who were amazing were able to help us out with all of our requests. With the exception of Carolina the rest of the staff at this resort were more than accomodating and would be the only reason I would consider a return visit, they are the saving grace of this property. Food always seems to be a big topic in reviews of AI resorts. I found the food to be one step above cruise ship food. It was okay. My big complaint would be the room service menu which is in serious need of revamping. The only option for breakfast on the room service menu is a continental option. Which only leaves the buffet as an available option. I believe if the resort had been at a higher occupancy rate the other option which serves ala carte breakfasts would have been available. Take note that not all of the restaurants are open every night. We had a choice between 2 different places every night. I had recently read an article which had listed the spa/salon as one of the top 10 in the carribean. I couldn't disagree more! I went with my sister in-law to have the royal pedicure which was supposed to last for 1 hour and 15 minutes. The treatment lasted about 50 minutes. The staff were cleaning out the bins and equipment in the same room during the treatment. There was nothing luxurious or pampering about this treatment. I could have gotten the same treatment in Seattle for half the cost paid here. The grounds at the resort are beautiful and kept imacculately. The staff at the infinity pool area are amazing and were very attentive. This is definitley a couples resort. While we were there a loud an obnoxious party of women having a bachelorette party took over the resort for a few days. They definitley wanted to party and this property is just not that kind of place. They should have gone next door to one of the loud party resorts.

The staff did remedy this within the first few hours and put us into a much nicer suite. I had let them know we were visiting for a second time, but that didn't seem to matter. The second day a man accused me of pulling his hat off of a pool chaise that he'd been saving since 8 a.m. --it was then 10 a.m. when I put my towel down on the empty chaise. Plus, he apparantly was saving it for a friend as he and his wife were already lounging next to us. He was so rude that my husband and I finally DID move to another spot. I was embarrassed by the whole ordeal and was disappointed to have gotten a first hand example of how money does not buy class. The food was average, the beach was non-existent and the staff was aloof. Completely different than when we'd been 4 years before. After 7 days of mediocrity, we went to Tulum to the Esencia.

Room service was great -- turndown in the evening was always timed after you left for dinner. The food is pretty good -- there two more formal restaurants are Las Ventanas and Azia.

We just had a bad experience at Azia -- seated at 830 and didn't eat until 10 -- and the food was only ok -- can't go to Mexico and expect great Asian food, I suppose. The other two restaurants Spices and Grill are pretty good, too -- the Grill you'll eat at mostly for lunch and poolside -- Spices has a great breakfast brunch. One of the biggest upsides is the exclusivity -- there aren't a swarm of people at the pool or beach -- and much of the staff gets to know you by the end. As for going with an all-inclusive -- we enjoyed it -- we spent no more than $200 for the week we were there, and that was outside the hotel on some drinks, cigars, and souvenirs -- the rest were on tipping the staff (which you aren't expected to do).

Upon arrival, after each couple is escorted to a lovely desk in a gorgeous air conditioned lobby, you are checked in ,complete with chilled scented towels and champagne, you are then walked to the restaurant overlooking the sea, presented to the maitre d, and remembered by staff. Food was outstanding.... elegantly presented... far from the cafeteria line ups of the larger all- inclusives. Champagne was our staple with all meals... There is no massive buffet for dinner. All dining is a la carte. Thankfully a dress code adds to the elegance, thereby eliminating baseball caps and sweatpants from your dining experience. Service was clearly of a Michelin quality. Prompt, efficient, friendly and discreet. There was a buffet for breakfast, but the quality, presentation, choices were superb. You didn't feel like you were in a cafeteria.

All requests were met with a standard response. \" My pleasure ,Mrs. T...........\" An internal newspaper was delivered to your room daily, announcing the newest arrivals and the reason for their visit. i.e. Mr and Mrs. T. celebrating their 25th anniversary.

Hard to stay longer with small kids at home. Also hard to afford a longer stay to be honest. First visit ten years ago for honeymoon and we were hooked. Let's try to sum up. Arrival: You step out of your car and Alvaro the bellman knows your name. It's his job to know who's arriving that day and when. He remembered us and said welcome back. Our last visit was two years ago. The rest of our stay there included meeting with various staff who to us were old friends. Marcos also at the Bellstand. Isis and Luis at the Spices Restaurant. Our old concierge, Arely, who is now the chief concierge. Benedicto at Palazzo's, etc. etc. Reason for coming back again and again: Service! Why most people on Tripadvisor like it? Service! When you walk around the hotel, you will be greeted by name. First word from these guys: What can I do for you? Last word: Is there anything else I can do for you? You might not think the restaurants are worth the price (yada yada yada, sorry, not all of us are millionaires and compare our dining to Parisian Five Star Restaurants). You might not like the location and beach. You might even think the rooms need updating (which is true they need to be). But if you have a poor experience there, then I'm sorry...you are simply one of those people who look for an excuse to be miserable or subconsciously want to be disappointed. This hotel has one goal: Making you happy. Yes it's expensive. I have to believe that this somehow translates to the income of its employees. There are concierges and waiters who have been there 7-8+ years. They are happy there and are genuinely good people who simply enjoy their work. This is hard to find in this commercially driven Mayan Riviera Hotel Zone. This is no Moon Palace in Cancun where your room is one of 1500 (RH has only about 220 rooms). There are no bracelets to wear here to identify you, or to allow you to get a towel, or to identify what level of service you paid for. Brief Word about Tipping: Over the years, we have learned to appreciate good service and have learned to express that appreciation through gratuity. Yes RH is all-inclusive. However, please feel free to directly place a tip into the server's hand or the bellman's hand. They work hard there. They deserve it. Anyone who can afford to stay at RH can afford to give their waiter a ten or twenty after a wonderful full course evening dinner. Summarizing. Yes the grounds are beautiful and immaculate. The view of the water from breakfast in Spices Restaurant - Perfect! Best dinner food will be at Ventanas and Palazzo. Best location are the three villas in the center. Yes the other villas are closer to the adjacent resorts which can be loud at night (some people have had trouble with that). Don't bring your teenagers here. It's not their style, baby. Their misery translates to your misery. Finally, after dinner, take a stroll around the grounds: it's peaceful and beautiful - time well spent. This went longer than I anticipated.

Either these people are hard alcoholics or their taste buds are fried. If you wanted a glass of straight \"Absolut\" vodka, that is exactly what you would get. Whatever you asked for was served. All of our drinks were delicious and had the normal amount of alcohol in them. There was no reason for the bartenders to skimp and they certainly did not.

Don't believe that worn out adage that if you did not tip you did not get very good service or food or drinks. Simply not true. Of course the staff liked a tip ! Who does not ?

Even people working on the grounds had nice smiles for you and everywhere you could hear a very friendly \"Hola!\" accompanied by a nice smile. Everyone greeted you ! And if you wanted to you could ask anyone anything and they would be happy to assist you. It did not matter if they were a waiter or concierge or a person from security. No one pawned you off if you had a question and if they could not answer it. They right away found someone who could help you. Language was no problem at all. Almost all of the staff spoke English very well and the occasional few that were not very proficient were right away aided by someone who was, without the need for them to look for help. That is how attentive they all are. Everyone seems to have a favorite restaurant and so did we. It was Ventanas. The food was great in all of the restaurants but this one was especially great. The food and the service were simply excellent. Maybe I should say extraordinary ! That word excellent seems to be used so often these days that I do not think that it describes this situation enough. The presentation was really artistic. The chef, Florian, who is from Germany, did a fantastic job. All of the food that we had there was of the best quality and taste. It was really the icing to all of the fine food in all of the restaurants. And to make it all the better yet were two of our favorite waiters at Ventanas, Roberto and Pablo. Two of the friendliest, polite, and helpful waiters that you can have. They really helped make our stay just great. We would meet them sometimes in the adjacent bar or at another restaurant that they were helping out in and we were warmly greeted by both of them and made to feel so welcome that we just developed such a bond with them, along with our villa concierge, Riccardo. But this is not to infer that the other waiters in the other restaurants were not friendly. Not at all ! The waiter at Azia, the oriental restaurant, was great. When we took a picture with the \"geishas\" and wanted one with him also, he laughingly said that I wanted a photo with a \"samurai.\" And a samurai he was, in how greatly he treated us when we were there. The waiter at Palazzo, the Italian restaurant was an example of politeness and attentiveness. I think his name is Benjamin and he spoke Italian besides Spanish and English. The violin player was glad to play a request for you and made the atmosphere there relaxed and romantic. Spices was a great Mexican restaurant above \"The Grill\", right by the Infinity pool. Another restaurant with great food and a very nice view. You will read about people complaining about the large sandbags on the beach. Yes, they are there and no, they do not add to the view. But nature does care about the the view. The bags are there to keep the beach from getting eroded. They are in place along many hotels in the area and there is nothing that anyone can do about it. So don't be too concerned. There are areas that you can use for swimming but, like anywhere with an ocean beach, you should pay attention to whether the flags are green, yellow or red if you want to swim in any ocean. There are comfortable lounges everywhere, by the pools or on the beach. The weather for us was gorgeous and there was not an unpleasant moment during our week-long stay. Well, I can go on and on but then it would start to sound like a paid testimonial. In summary, this is a great place to stay for a very pleasant and restful vacation. If you want a loud and raucous place to stay at or if you have young children, then this is not the place for you. Otherwise, you will really enjoy this resort. Nothing is lacking and the most memorable things will be how well you were treated by everyone. Lastly, for those who are at all concerned by security, it was very discrete but also very thorough. You could walk anywhere there day or night and you felt as safe as if you were in your own back yard. If all of this is not enough for you then you must be a millionaire who owns your own mansion on an oceanside strip of land.", "Date": "March 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maine", "Title": "\u201cBest relaxing vacation we've ever had\u201d", "Author": "bankerchick", "ReviewID": "UR26215014", "Content": "If you are looking for total relaxation and a stress free vacation, this is the place for you. We stayed here 3 nights, March 7th, 8th and 9th and to be honest, 5 days here would be all you need to get a great vacation. You literally do not have to do anything, they wait on you hand and foot and accommodate every single request. The rooms are very nice and beds comfortable. We did get assigned a noisy room our first night and the air conditioning did not work but they moved us first think the next morning. I would suggest though if this hotel is at low capacity as they were when we arrived, you should put your guests in the quieter rooms first anyway.... only makes sense.... they do provide you with champagne and a nice towel at check in and you have your own concierge who will take care of all of your requests and dinner reservations. We thought before arriving that this hotel may be a bit stuffy for our taste but it was not. Most everyone there is on vacation and love it there. We met some very nice people. The infinity pool was beautiful and the service by the pool and beach is impeccable, well worth the extra money to stay there. Food - I would not say that the food here at all of the restaurants if 5 star. We felt the only 5 star restaurant was Las Ventanas.... i could of eaten there every evening, the choices were vast, and the service the best from all of the restaurants. The decor is also very trendy and they have a huge wine selection which you do need to purchase and as at all of the all inclusives we have stayed at the wine was over priced. The have a piano bar here as well which is a nice touch. I did feel for the price they should include a better variety of wine which is included with your stay. We ate at the Oriental restaurant and the Italian and by far Las Ventanas was the best. We did a wine flight at the Italian restaurant which was good, although they chill their red wine... which if you are a wine drinker, it's just not the same chilled and tastes totally different, so I stuck to white wine while there. The turn down service in the evenings is great and we really like this with the fresh towels and your bed fixed nice. There isn't alot going on in the evening but you can make your own fun if you meet some other fun people. They do offer different things each evening at the Allegria bar. One of our nicest times was at afternoon tea (not stuffy at all), they had very light refreshments and champagne, and tea and you could have mexican coffees which were my favorite. They make the flaming coffees right there and they are excellent!! They also have a live sax player there in the afternoon and by the pool, very nice touch. I have to say I do agree with some of the other reviews, for the price, the rooms should have nice TV's with more channel options, even though it's not why you are there to watch tv but it would add a nice touch. The business center is very nice with 4 computers and all of the business needs. They have a spa which we did not use but that was nice as well. They do have some of the most immaculate tennis courts I've seen. Service everywhere at this resort was 6 star. The beach does have the large sand bags which is an eye sore but just look at the beautiful turquoise water. One thing I will mention is that there was a lot of bird droppings on the beach chairs, they should really try and scrub the chairs down each evening.... being a 5 star I found this a little odd that the beach chairs would be in such bad shape.... The rooms were a bit musty but they are everywhere in Mexico. The grounds were nice and clean and the hot tubs are wonderful for late afternoon or early evening. Loved that!! We also saw a couple having dinner on the beach which seemed v ery romantic and special. I'd be happy to answer any questions, but we would definitely recommend this resort to anyone. No children allowed which we thought was great and really added to the atmosphere.

It's true the \"sandbags\" (which are the size of a vehicle) aren't pretty, but the different shades of blue in the water still makes for a beautiful view (and from the vantage point of the lounge chairs by the pool, you may not see the sandbags). The pool area was very quiet, with moderately loud music only played from noon-12:30 for the daily water aerobics session. No hard sells to participate. In the late afternoon, there's relaxing live jazz sax. We generally liked all the food. We were partial to the a la carte breakfast in the main building, rather than the buffet by the water. You miss the view, but the food was better. We liked the signature restaurant the best for dinner. We found all the service to be accomodating, refined and friendly. I never once felt like I didn't get something I wanted. It was very convenient having a concierge right outside our room to make all our dinner and activity reservations. I really liked all the nooks and crannies of this (not hugh) property--the little plunge pools, the wrap around deck area looking out to the sea, the Thai beds. They were great for getting quiet, alone time. We had a room in one of the inner villas, so we didn't have any problem with noise from neighboring resorts, but walking around the property at night, you could hear the loud music, so to be safe, bring a pair of earplugs in case you get an unfortunate room assignment.

We were looking for some rest and relaxation and RHP delivered. Overall, the service was amazing and the facilities were great but the food was mixed. Granted, a large part of the reason we had such a good time was because the resort was not crowded (having checked in the weekend following new year's) and we felt we had the entire place to ourselves (we guess about 30% occupancy). Following are some more details: 1) Resort - During check-in, the glass of champagne and the cool face towel was a nice touch. Our villa (#23) was on the way to the pool and beach and was quiet and private. All the Luxury rooms have the same layout, with a comfy bed, dark wood furnishings, plantation type shutters and a large walk-in bathroom and closet area. We admit the television was not a flat screen but we really didn't care since we were usually out at the pool or beach. The fitness area was very small but, again, since we were there after the peak holiday weekend, we had no problems finding a machine for a morning workout. Probably the best part of the resort was the service, and having your personal concierge at your finger-tips was one of the best parts of our vacation. 2) Pool and Beaches - there are several pools around the resort but we stuck with the main infinity pool. We were lucky to get a daybed near the shaded palm trees two of the five days of our stay - however, you do need to get up very early in order to stake your claim. The rest of the time we laid out on the lounges surrounding the pool which got more sun that the shaded daybeds. Weather was close to perfect, around 85-90F every day with a few clouds in the sky. The infinity pool was really nice and there were only a few couples in the pool throughout the day because it was so empty. We didn't really swim in the ocean, so the ugly sandbags which are in front of the resort (and up and down the entire strip of beach) did not really bother us. 3) Food - the food was good compared to other AI resorts we have tried. One word of advice - definitely book all your dinners with your personal concierge together at once or you will be stuck with limited reservation times (either too early or late - we thought the best times were 7-8pm). To start with, Spices for morning buffet was one of our favorites - the omelet station was terrific we think because the ingredients were so fresh. The deck downstairs for lunch also exceeded our expectations \u2013 the burgers and fries were excellent. As for the higher end cuisines, we come from NYC and were not blown away and had mixed feelings about the food. Out favorite was Azia - try to sit at the teppanyake table you got a nice show from the chef. We thought Ventanas and the Grill was okay but did not like Palazzo. The dinner show was worth a night out (kind of like Cirque de Soleil with a Mayan theme) but the actual meal was just okay. Again, much of your experience will depend on what you order as there were times that I had a good dish and my wife did not. 4) Miscellaneous \u2013 the business center had very slow computers, but the resort is enabled with WiFi so I suggest you bring your own laptop or iPod if you want to access the internet. I brought my iPod Touch and had no problems getting a signal from any of the restaurants or by the pool. Also, we suggest that you take advantage of the morning beginner or intermediate clinics from the tennis instructor \u2013 it really helped improve our game. Also, we walked into town a few times and bought some souvenirs and also took a day trip to Tulum and visited the ruins and the beaches. Overall, if you are looking for excellent service and do not want to worry about going out for lunch or dinner every night \u2013 RHP will be a great experience for you. If you are looking for nightlife and lots of people, you are probably better served going elsewhere. We are in our mid-thirties and this place was perfect for what we were looking for \u2013 some rest and relaxation.", "Date": "January 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Short Hills, NJ", "Title": "\u201cVery unhappy with hotel--left early\u201d", "Author": "kellycares", "ReviewID": "UR23448202", "Content": "We had heard wonderful things about the Hideaway, and booked a one week stay there for our family during Christmas week. We were extremely disappointed with the hotel and its location, and left after two nights. First of all, the hotel is in Playacar, a strip of overbuilt mega-hotels that are on narrow plots of land with very small beaches stuck in a suburban enclave. It is odd. While the Royal Hideaway was fairly quiet (what we wanted), the noise at night from the adjacent hotels even had my children begging for earplugs. Loud disco music until 2 am was not what we wanted. Also, Playacar and Playa del Carmen lack the upscale feel and wide, long beaches of Cancun. It just seems tacky and touristy without charm. The hotel's beach was small (maybe 150 yards long total) and had little sand, probably due to the strong currents. The small beach meant that the beach chairs were placed inches away from each other so the beach lacked privacy. I felt like I was in Miami or Boca. (See photos attached) The state of the hotel's rooms were the final straw. We asked for two rooms, one with a king bed for my husband and myself and one with two doubles for my children. When we arrived, my children's room had a king bed , and we were told there were no doubles. I have a boy and a girl--both in their teens, so they needed 2 beds. They brought in a cot, and my kids proceeded to fight over who had to sleep in the cot. This was not a relaxing way to begin the vacation. When the cot was in the room, there was no room to walk around. It was very tight. Our room was small and old--in desperate need of updating. The room had a foul odor (like something died) and there was mildew in the gross- looking shower. I was uncomfortable showering in it. The jacuzzi tub was old and small--could perhaps fit a person under 5'1\", and very skinny. For us, it was basically unusable. Our balcony looked over into another room's balcony, so the room lacked privacy. (See attached photos) Many items in the hotel were in disrepair. At the jacuzzi's few of the jets work and the controls were in pieces sitting on the edge of the pool (did not look like a new problem). The pool and jacuzzis were missing tiles and just looked shabby. The gardens were pretty, though. Lastly the food was mediocre at best. Two of the five restaurants were closed during our stay and we were not forewarned, so the food choices were limited. Given the high cost of the trip (each room cost $5250 for the week, and we had 2 rooms), we expected a 5 star resort. I would give the resort 3 stars at best. We demanded our money back and left the hotel as soon as we could. The hotel demanded payment in full for our stay when we checked in ($10,500 US upfront). The hotel was not gracious about our departure and at first refused to return our money for the remaining nights even though we announced our desire to leave in the morning after the first night. It was an ugly scene and horribly unpleasant. Until they do a major renovation of the hotel and improve their booking policies, I would not recommend going there.

But the beach is an issue that must be addressed. We researched the beach erosion and read here that it wasn't a big deal. We disagree. After traveling all day, and spending a lot of money for a beach vacation we were very disappointed with the state of the beach. Its about half the depth as in the picture you see above, and the section of beach in front of the restaurant is gone. There are large \"beached whale\" looking sandbags in front of every hotel in playacar that are unattractive. But at the other hotels they were placed 50 feet or so off shore, leaving a space to swim. At RH they are placed parallel to the beach, along the shore line. You literally cannot enter the water in front of the hotel without climbing over a large, slippery sand bag. OK, having said that - we just spent a week at RH (between xmas and new years) with our 2 children ages 12 and 14 and the hotel is wonderful in many other ways. The staff is the most responsive and positive we have ever encountered and the grounds and rooms are immaculate. The food was very good and no request was denied. The GRILL was our favorite restaurant by far. Having a personal concierge was a luxury touch that surpassed the service we have ever had elsewhere. You should also know that there were many teens, mostly in college, during this week. Anyone who isn't told by their travel agent that the minimum age is 13 should blame the travel agent. while it is a very peaceful and relaxing hotel, it is not adults only . Few if any of the rooms have ocean views because of how the property is laid out. The rooms however are very comfortable and well maintained. There are a few other things we didn't love. THe fitness center and the watersports area were both under sized to serve the guest population. I started exercising mid day to make sure I could get on a machine. And you have to run to the beach at 8:30 am if you want a hobie cat. The motorized activities (that you pay extra for ) were plentiful. During this busy week it was also impossible to get a lounge chair by the pool. They were gone by 7 am.

This involved many negotiations with Diana Manrique, the person in charge of coordinating for groups and weddings, and she did an exceptional job of accommodating us and making allowances for all the special requirements of the group without really much in the way of additional charges. In our seminar brochure, I offered my own very positive assessment of the food and service, and I was concerned that the place might not live up to this level of high press in terms of the seminar members. However the experience was uniformly very positive for everyone in the group, both in terms of the service, the rooms, the exceptional food, and the general atmosphere at the resort. In fact, most of the people in our group commented that they thought this was the finest resort they ever stayed in. We wished that Las Ventanas had been available, but the resort had their menu every other night at the Grill. I'm not sure why they had two restaurants out of commission (Spices and Las Ventanas) and this probably is not great planning on their part. The tennis pro, Gustavo provided an excellent workout virtually every day, and it was only by dint of working out every day that I was able to not gain a lot of weight, because the food is simply irresistible. Their Asian restaurant compares favorably with the finest Asian restaurants in New York and elsewhere at least in my judgment. Were there any problems? Well, in all honesty, Internet access continues to be a bit iffy, and we could not get decent Internet reception in our seminar room. Additionally, Internet access even with a strong signal, did not allow us to download the New York Times other than the main front page webpage, as there seems to be some kind of incompatibility between their router system and the New York Times website. I also probably think the showerheads could use an updating. However these are small nitpicks and they certainly do not in any way spoil the overall impression of great comfort, superb service and beautiful surroundings. I have read some negative reviews of the place, but in all honesty they seem to be written by people who appear to be fairly \"high maintenance.\" Whenever we had any kind of difficulty or problem, our concierge took care of it immediately and gracefully. Obviously, no place is going to get positive reviews from everybody. Overall, our second experience with this exceptional resort only confirms our extremely positive first impressions. I would recommend this not only for couples but also for small groups looking to have a professional meeting in beautiful resort where you are truly taken care of all the time, and where your cares melt away quickly.

The bellman knows your name (and won't forget it, even if you only see him once or twice). The main concierge greets you warmly with a glass of bubbly and cool towelettes. Procedure is quick and pleasant, unlike several all inclusive resorts we have been to. Each villa has its own concierge that will bend backwards to make your stay pleasant. ROOM: the basic room is great. Separate shower and bath, Very large balcony, very conmfortable king-size bed, lots of amenities, even free overnite shoe-shine ! BEACH: this area has been hammered by several hurricanes and has not yet recovered. But, take a 10 min walk heading South on the beach and it is fine. NIGHTLIFE AND ACTIVITIES: if you are looking for noisy harassing music all day long, not here. If you are looking for late night parties, not here. The Allegria bar provides some interesting evenings (Latin Dance Night, Back in Time-70's ). They have a small band every night but they finish early, by midnight. Several activities are offered but very few guests participate, except the 4 PM bocce tournament ! POOL/SPAS: must be 5 pools and at least 4 spas/Jacuzzis. Around 4 PM, a sax player plays soft jazzy tunes by the main pool. You do not have the hassle of towels here. Have as many as you like. Chairs are plentiful on the beach. By the pool, you need to get there early to pick the best ones. Cabanas are also available, so are outdoor beds. A pool organizer walks around with cool refreshing towelettes late morning. Waiters get your drinks in the pool and ebach areas. RESTAURANTS: A la carte (no buffet except breakfast) restaurants give this resort a certain flair.True, 2 were closed (Las Ventanas and Spices) for renovations. But you still had 3 to choose from. Your concierge can make you reservations for the whole week.The best by far is Palazzo: the service level is near perfect. You won't believe your eyes during the 5 course meal. Azia was fine. The Grill was OK but could be better: service was a bit slow. We had a Mexican show at the Club Royale theater one evening: food is buffet, fair' and you have to rush. You can skip this and hit the Palazzo instead ! Guys, trousers are MANDATORY for dinner everywhere. If you do not feel liek going out, they have pretty good room service If you feel like a late disco night, your concierge can get you evening passes for the disco at the Occidental Allegro next door (2 min. walk). No one will try to sell you a vacation package membership during your stay. This is exactly what we wanted (needed !) and we do consider to come back again next year.

Until this vacation, I was not a fan of Mexico based on previous experiences. The service received at this resort was impeccible. From the first person we met, Manuel the bellman, to everyone else we came in contact with, the service was like nothing I have ever received at any resort in the United States. I had previously read that pool chairs were hard to get, but that wasn't the case during the week of Thanksgiving. There was one group of about 8 who reserved chairs everyday for their group, but it had a minimal impact on the pool area itself. The Allegria Bar is open from 6 pm until 1 am and was a great place to sit outside or inside and have beverages. Yara in the Allegria Bar was wonderful! With one exception (mentioned later), the food was excellent. If you are staying at this resort for an excellent ocean view, stay elsewhere. There are really very few rooms that offer any view whatsoever of the ocean. We were in Villa 23 and our view was actually of some run down thatched roofs of the neighboring resort , but it didn't end up being a big deal. We tried to move, but were unsuccessful in spite of the resort not being full. You can definitely hear loud activity from two neighboring resorts at night depending on the location of your villa. The activities stopped at about midnight. One surprising thing was that two restaurants (Las Ventanas and Spices) were actually both closed during our stay. We thought it was a little strange to have 2 restaurant closed for renovations at the same time, especially during Thanksgiving week. The resort has a piano bar, but there wasn't a piano player present for any of the 7 nights we were there. As previously mentioned, the food was quite good except for our experience at Azia. We requested and were granted seating at the Hibatchi table. The service was really slow (not a big deal) and the food was cold. (big deal) The Grill and the Italian restaurant were both excellent. Carmen in The Grill made the best omelets that any of us have ever had!

Everything about this place was amazing so we decided to return in July, and again in October of this same year. July was by far the best experience because the weather was perfect. October was not as enjoyable because of the rain, but the hotel couldn't help this and went out of their way to make sure that the dinners were extra special, the spa services were a touch better than normal, and the activities at the bar in the evening were adequate to keep us entertained. Let me just say that I love food. We sample the best restaurants in every city we travel to, and the amazing thing about the Royal Hideaway Playacar is that the food is outstanding, despite the all inclusive nature of the hotel. One thing we dislike about all inclusive hotels are buffets. Nearly every restaurant (save the breakfast buffet) can be a coursed fine dining experience and are in fact not buffet style. The quality of the food at Royal Hideaway is superior to anything we've sampled in the Caribbean and it even rivals some of our 4 and 5 star restaurants here in Louisville, KY. The service is the other best thing about this resort. Everybody is there to make you feel extra special. The option of being able to tip the staff members seems like it not only made their day, but it was a nice way to be able to thank them for making our visit so comfortable. The workers seem to really enjoy their job and it shows. The rooms were always very clean and the staff made sure we always had the special things we liked in our room (if they find out you like a certain beer or soda, it's stocked in your mini fridge when you return to your room). The villa concierge service goes out of their way to make sure you have everything you need for your trip, including arrangements for off-resort activities. If you want to sample an off-resort restaurant or bar, they will give you honest critiques to help make sure you pick the best one. If you go in the warmer months the private pools nestled around the resort are fantastic ways to spend an evening after an early dinner. This is not something we've found on many other resorts, and usually the hot tubs are so crowded that you have no time to just relax and enjoy each others company. That's not the case at the Royal Hideaway. There are several pools and hot tubs all over so take your pick and enjoy some champagne after dinner. Oh, and the Thai beds are a great way to spend your afternoon relaxing if you need a break of the sun, want to read a book in the shade, or use your laptop on the complementary wifi to get some work done. You can arrange the curtains so that one person can get some sun while they other can relax in the shade. This place is truly heaven on Earth. We're already making plans to return in 2009. The quality of the food, cleanliness of the rooms and resort, and friendliness of the service was consistently EXCELLENT all three times we visited this year. It's pretty cool to see the same friendly faces welcoming us back by name.

The resort exceeded all of our expectations. From the moment we arrived, we were given the most courteous and professional service. We were seated and offered cold towels and Mexican sparkling wine during our check-in. During this time, we were given some basic info about the resort, we were offered the opportunity to establish credit (for any incidentals at the spa or non-inclusive wine, etc.), and the hostess arranged our dinner reservations for that evening (we were told that in the morning we would meet our villa's concierge and he would make our dinner reservations for the rest of the week). We got our first choice for dinner that first night, which was the Asian restaurant called Azia (our travel agent had actually already requested this for us). I further requested to sit at the Hibachi tables (where they cook in front of you), and the hostess made a phone call. She said that she had made the request, but they could not guarantee. We did get to sit at the hibachi table, and the food was excellent. We also enjoyed a few sushi rolls and a few other appetizers as well. By no means was it the best sushi I've had. But it was good, and I have had far worse in the US. A couple hints about this restaurant and most at the resort. The portions of food are usually smaller than the American sized portions you may be use to. So don't be afraid to order more than you normally would. You paid for it right!!? For instance, a sushi roll is only 4 pieces. On the subject of our villa and room, we were extremely pleased. We were in villa 31 - which is right next to the pools, beach, and Spices restaurant (where the delicious morning breakfast buffet is located). We felt this was a bonus because it was so easy to get to the pool from our room, and we had a partial ocean view--even though we had not paid for an ocean view. I suspect we got such a great villa/room because we later found out that when we arrived on Sunday evening, the resort was only at about 35% capacity. My wife Carla and I definitely enjoyed these first few days the most when we felt like the only people at the resort. It was so peaceful. Back to the room. We had the basic room, and it was plenty for us. It was immaculately clean, the air conditioning work like a champ, and the decor was very nice. The bed was very comfortable. We loved our patio, where we would often read and listen to music on my portable mp3 speaker---and out on the patio there was almost always a beautiful breeze. The room had a shower and separate tub. But the room was not our highest priority on our criteria list. For us, the most important items were SERVICE and FOOD QUALITY. And the Royal Hideaway delivered. I'm not a huge breakfast person, but I enjoyed a fresh omelet almost every morning--along with just about anything you could imagine for a breakfast. All the restaurants were great. At the Italian restaurant, Pallazo, be sure to order the ravioli. At Spices, don't miss the tortilla soup (they call it Azteca soup). At Las Ventannas, the filet mignon was very tender, and had a very enjoyable sauce on top. Also at Las Ventannas, don't miss the chocolate cake (with filling--I think some people call this a volcano cake). At the pool, you can get a surprisingly good cheeseburger fries and onion rings. Don't expect to get a prime steak like at Morton's, Ruth's Chris or some other prime steakhouse. Remember you will be in Mexico. That said, I had pretty tasty ribeye steak at Spices on the last night of our stay. Here are a few things to consider---as this may not be the resort for all people. If you are looking for big nightlife party atmosphere, this probably isn't your place. Sure there is a bar that is open at night with entertainment. But in general, it is more of a quite place. If the beach is a big priority on your list, you probably won't like this place. Due to the hurricanes the beach is not in great shape---and still has big ugly sand bags. It is not easy to take a nice walk along the beach, and quite frankly, not that much fun of an area to swim. But this was not a big deal to me and my wife because we knew about the beach situation. Service and food were more important to us on this trip. One day, we treated ourselves to a deep tissue massage at the spa. I took a steam before the massage, a quick shower, and then I waited for my therapist to come take me to a massage room. The therapist was extremely talented and professional--though I would have liked more deep tissue pressure. But in all, my wife and I both thoroughly enjoyed our time at the spa. On Thursday, I had a little cabin fever, and it was kind of cloudy---so we walked about 20 minutes or so to the town (5th avenue). This a very long street with tons of bars, restaurants, shops, and things to see. I suppose that if you were staying at the Royal Hideaway, and you wanted to get out for some nightlife, there would have been plenty going on. But my wife and always spent our nights inside the resort. I'm glad we got to see the town during the day--but it was very annoying to walk down the street and every few steps a man or woman would try to sucker you into their store. And they never take one no for answer. By the end of our walk down and back 5th avenue, I couldn't wait to be back in our resort where people would not hassle us. I drank tons of water served to me at the pool bar and at the restaurants. They appear to get the water from large sized bottles of water that they pour into pitchers. I also drank tons of frozen drinks and never got sick. The last thing I'll say is that the weather was great. We only had rain for a half hour or so on one of the days. But for the most part, we had a mix of clouds and sun. The humidity seemed very low, it was never too hot, and there was usually a nice breeze. I hope everyone has the same great experience we had.

There was not one meal we didn't enjoy! The rooms are a bit smaller than at other Resorts, but have extra ammenities, such as the shoe shine service and personal concierge. It is wonderful having someone on hand all day to help with any questions, make reservations, etc. The resort is very laidback. There are activities during the day, but they are not non-stop as they are at other AI's. You will not be coerced into doing any of them, and there is no loud music around the pool. Most days we grabbed a Bali bed and read, swam and enjoyed cold drinks from the bar. The only drawback of the resort is the way it is sandwiched in between other resorts in the Playacar complex. We have enjoyed the Paradisus in Mexico as well as the DR as they have a large property and lots of beach for long walks. This isn't true at the RH.

My wife and I have been to 7 out of 11 \"5 star Resorts\" in the last three years. The other 4 resorts were 4 and 4.5 star resorts which were still better than the Royal Hideaway. The Kahala in Hawaii is still the worst \"5 Star Resort\". However, I would have to say the Royal Hideaway is second to the worst \u201c5 star Resorts\", we have been to. We won't be back!! Where to start....... NEGGATIVE COMMENTS: Needs Renovations: All the buildings including outside of the rooms were very out-dated. We had been to many other tropical places that were older than the Royal Hideaway that was kept up much better. However, inside all the restaurants, (except for Spices), were very nice and kept up well. All the pools and Jacuzzis need renovations as well. On all the pools there were either tiles missing, broken, or cracked, or chunk of cement was missing/broken from the side of the pool. Also, most of all the jets in the Jacuzzi were broken. Furthermore, there was Algae growing on the tiles. All the pools and Jacuzzi's were out-dated. Landscaping: The landscaping is not very attractive. The ponds needed to be redone and they did not look good at all. Bugs/Flees/ Mosquitoes What Can I say, my wife and I brought bug spray for our skin after we read other peoples trip advisor. However, it did not help at all!! We used the entire bottle and got bit all over. They need to spray the grounds. We got eaten alive. Spa: The spa needs fixing as well. My wife and I got two 80 minute massages each. However, where we changed, shower, and relax in the steamer/ sauna smelled like dirty socks and mold. Even in the ladies side my wife couldn\u2019t stand the smell either. They NEED to fix that. Also, the massages were only average. Front Desk: We arrive and went to check-in with Jezel. From the beginning everything was a hassle. I asked for a room that was NOT on the first floor somewhere towards the middle. The resort was not full and yet we were put on the first floor on the far side of the resort facing where the workers come in and out. This room was small and had bathroom mold all over the jacuzzi tub/shower. I found it very funny that she told me there was nothing she can do and we should talk to our Concierge about it tomorrow. Also, she asked us if we wanted to book dinner reservations along with the show for the following week since our concierge already left for the day. However, she was surprised when I said yes. Then made it seem like this was the biggest hassle for her like she was doing us a favor. POSITIVE COMMENTS: The Concierge: Our second day I went to our Concierge named Jorge. He was the best!!! Jorge didn't understand why the Front Desk would not give us a room that was not on the first floor; especially since they were not even at half-way capacity. I gave him $50 dollars and told him how appreciated if he can help us out. He said come back during lunch and he would fix everything. We came back and he let us pick all the rooms that they had available on the top floors. There were several which was annoying since Jezel in the front desk said she could no accommodate us. Not only did Jorge let us pick our room but he gave us a bigger upgraded room with walk-in closets and vaulted ceilings. There was No Mold and was Very Clean!!!! THANK YOU JORGE!!!! Also, since we moved rooms we had a different concierge named Louise. He was great as well!! Louise helped us out and was very nice. He knew my name before I even met him and took care of us throughout our entire stay. THANK YOU LUISE!!! The food: One thing that was very good was the food. Our favorite restaurant was Azia. The decor was great and the food was delicious. Azia also had really cute private rooms that were very romantic. My wife and I loved it and it really made our first anniversary special. Also, Las Ventanas and Palazzo were really good restaurants that we recommend. In these restaurants there are good variations of different foods. All dishes were presented very elegant and artistically. The decor is very nice and so is the atmosphere. On the other hand, we do not recommend the Spices restaurant for dinner. The food was not very good for dinner and neither was the service. However, we do recommend Spices for breakfast and lunch. They have a good buffet for breakfast and a descent lunch. Also, the service is much better during the day at Spices. The Service: The service was very good throughout our entire stay. The servers at the restaurants and pool were great. We always had our drinks full and they just kept them coming!!! They were always on top of everything. Also, our Concierges were Excellent!!! Overall: We rate the Royal Hideaway a 4 star Resort. However, it is not worth coming back. If it wasn't for the food and service, we would have given it 3 stars.", "Date": "November 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto Ontario", "Title": "\u201cRoyal Hideaway - October 18-25th\u201d", "Author": "Charlyholly", "ReviewID": "UR21387912", "Content": "My wife and I chose this resort based on a friend's recommendation as well as the numerous great reviews we had seen on this Board. I must say we were really impressed and are in agreement with the multitude of superlative reviews. From a travel background - we've spent the last 15 vacations cruising and thought we'd return to an AI just for a change of pace. We're in our late 50's and have enjoyed Princess/Regent and Celebrity lines so the fact that this was a more casual/smaller and non-party resort really appealed. From our arrival, we were warmly and sincerely greeted and welcomed as though we had been regular customers over the years. Manuel the bellman and Melissa in reception couldn't have been more helpful in making us feel right at home immediately. The resort itself and grounds were immaculate and extremely tastefully decorated and the evening lighting was just gorgeous. We were on the top floor of building 23 adjacent to a next-door resort but really heard no noise or loud party music whatsoever although on the grounds you could hear some music from what I believe to be the Riu on other side. The room was a standard luxury room but we did have a partial oc ean view which was quite peaceful and relaxing the few times we actually sat out there. The layout was actually quite spacious with a really large and well-appointed bathroom. Closet space was excellent also. Azia and The Deck were closed for refurnishing although Azia did open the Friday evening before we went home so we did get a chance to try it. Although not gourmands, we have eaten at many good restaurants over the years and found Las Ventanas and Palazzo to be outstanding in their offerings. Spices was very good but choices were rather limited for my wife who doesn't enjoy seafood. Azia was our least favorite - just not big sushi/tepanaki fans although my seafood dish was very good. Decor in Las Venanas was very chic - Palazzo and Azia absolutely beautiful. Spices was also lovely but the setting on the ocean contributed greatly for us. It would have been nice to try The Deck but in view of all the rain we had, that might not have worked out well until the last day. The Club Royal was a really nice venue and setting although the seat in our banquette was a bit firm - suspect it might have been original and could use some recushioning. Food and show were great though. The service we experienced was likely the best we have ever received as guests. Without exception, we were greeted enthusiastically and made to feel genuinely welcome in all the restaurants. Servers assisted each other to ensure we had everything we needed and always checked to make sure we were enjoying everything. It was quite obvious that they took great pride in providing service at the highest level possible but without any pretension whatsoever which you can frequently run into in expensive restaurants - we've all encountered that at one time or another. We also found the restaurant management in each venue to be very friendly and attentive and they ensured things ran like clockwork. I should mention that the snack bar, although quite casual naturally, also offered excellent service with the same friendliness. I think this high standard of service excellent reflects well on the management and the tone which they set as at no time did we detect or suspect any phoniness from any staff - they truly seemed to enjoy doing a great job of making us their customers happy! What a novel concept!!!! Pool servers were like roadrunners ensuring everyone was fully charged up with their favorite potion at all times/ensuring the fruit tray was on offer or helping people set up their cushions/providing towels etc. Our concierge Rosalia was very helpful and pleasant ensuring all of our reservations were set up - answering any questions and always providing a cheerful greeting any time we met her. Maid service and turndown service was excellent - we were surprised one night by a beautiful swan and another night by an elephant towel creation - really nice touches! The weather.....not really what we had hoped for but who controls it? We had rain every day except the Saturday we arrived and the Friday before we left. Not just the normal expected brief shower but often the torrential downpour which lasted several hours. We had sun each day though in some amount and the Friday we left was a day they would love to shoot travelogues: absolutely gorgeous/hot/sunny! We spent the entire day down by the pools and in the ocean and it was the highlight of our trip. The beach - we had no reference point and did realize there had been erosion so we made the best of it! You could still get in and splash around and it was fine for us. It was also possible to wander up or down the beach although you wanted to be careful going around the breakwalls at each side of the property. Due to the amount of rain, we did at times find time a bit heavy on our hands as at the resort you were limited in options though the day in particular. You could sit in your room/the main building/snack bar at the beach - that was about it, unless you were into fitness or the spa. We didn't use either. In the evening, the piano bar adjacent to Las Ventanas was a nice place to sit for a while but we found the other bar Allegria was a bit small and dark to suit us. The High Tea in the lobby was great fun and the snacks were terrific. I understand there was about 25-30% occupancy during the week and at no time did we feel it was crowded (obviously!). Staffing levels though certainly didn't suffer at any point. All in all, an excellent resort which we would recommend highly to people who are looking for a truly quiet, upscale experience without any stuffiness or pretensions: just impeccable service all of the time! I don't believe we would take a chance on October weather again though, despite the many comments that this has been an unusually wet October.

We thought we knew about all of the nuiances, but there are a couple of things I want to highlight that we weren't prepared for: -The Royal Hideway is sandwiched between another Occidental resort and a Riu resort. While both resorts are noisy, we were really bothered by the noise from the Riu resort, especially at night. We stayed in Villa 30, which is on the side closest to the Riu resort. While our room was on the side of the villa that faced in to the Royal Hideaway, we could still hear the Riu's music at all hours of the night (Jock Jams, Chicken Dance, Macarena... you name it). Closing the doors between our bathroom and bedroom muffled the noise and we were able to sleep through the night., but it definitely does take away from the Royal Hideaway's sanctuary atmosphere. My recommendation would be to request a villa and room facing in towards the gardens and ponds that run through the middle of the resort. -A lot of Trip Advisor reviews complain about the lack of \"ocean view\" in the ocean view rooms. The way the Royal Hideaway is configured, I can't imagine there is a true full ocean view room on the property. Don't expect one. -When we visited, Azia and The Grill were closed, leaving us 3 restaurants to cycle through for our weeklong visit. We were really looking forward to visiting Azia and The Grill, so this was pretty disappointing for us. Since I know the resort has some other rennovations scheduled, I would be sure to contact them to find out what closures are on the calendar during the timeframe you plan to visit. Las Ventanas was excellent and we're glad it was open when we visited. -There's been some debate as to whether or not the resort truly is a \"5-star\" property, and my husband and I both agree it is no Four Seasons. Perhaps 4-4.5 stars would be more accurate. With that said, what makes this resort truly exceptional is its service, as a lot of other folks have mentioned. The service is the part that really is 5-star. -I won't say much about the beach, as others have already commented on it extensively. However, do know that if you wish to spend your days boogie boarding and splashing in the surf, it's simply not possible with the sandbags. If you're only looking to sunbathe and take a quick dip in the ocean to cool off, you'll be perfectly happy. Also, DO NOT climb on the sandbags. I didn't heed other's advice, and I slipped on some algae and whacked my head.:( -Bring a good bug spray.... you'll need it, even around the resort! Finally, I read a couple of people comment that they were unimpressed with the massages at the spa, but my husband and I both had the Royal Experience massages (1 hr. 50 min.!) and we highly recommend it.

We go to this area twice a year and this was our first stay at this hotel. Check in: This went fine with Champagne check in etc upon arrival. We where told at check in that two of the 5 restaurants were closed for renovations. Azia and The Gril, both of which I had heard good things about so this was disappointing leaving only 3 choices for the 8 day stay. We were told we would be staying in Villa 31 next to the pool and closest to the beach, so I was happy about that. In the past at this time of year because occupancies are low I have always been upgraded to ocean view rooms and was hoping for the same here in light of the fact that 2 of my dining options were closed. The Room: We were escorted to our room by the bell man Gusto who was wonderful during our entire stay. However I was somewhat disappointed in my room. The room itself was very nice, but the location was in the back of the building overlooking the path for the workers to travel with loud golf carts, etc. starting at 7 am and right next to the wall separating our hotel from another very noisy hotel. Not much to look at with your morning coffee on the patio. Our room was on the 1st floor. After 4 nights of this loud music and not great view, I did talk to the front desk and was told the hotel was only at 50% capacity but no upgrade or move was offered. 2 days later it rained all night and I awoke to a half inch of water covering the entire floor of my room, including bathroom and closet. They were prompt to respond to clean up but again no compensation or move was offered. The Food: WIth only 3 choice for dinner the menu got a little old. We loved Palazzo, Ventanas was very good Spices was OK. The Club Royale was very good and the show excellent. Breakfast choices were Spices and Ventanas. The omlets at Spices were very good, the rest of the selection got old after the first day. I ordered the waffels at Ventanas for breakfast and they were the kind you take out of the wrapper and toast in the oven. (Not $400 a day food!) The Resort: Overall this resort is beautiful and most of the staff was fantastic. Because of the low occupancie rate we had no problem getting a spot at the pool or beach. The wait staff and bartenders at the pool were excellent! Overview: I would not stay at this resort again. For the money I have stayed at and been treated better by management at other hotels in the Riveria Maya. I have never written a review before even though I travel 2-3 times a year, mostly to this area, but really felt disappointed in this vacation considering the cost of this hotel.", "Date": "October 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cIncredible Honeymoon\u201d", "Author": "DRJNewJersey", "ReviewID": "UR20690840", "Content": "My wife and I just returned from the RH after a week long honeymoon. It was the nicest place we have ever been and I highly recommend it. Let me get the few negatives out of the way first then we can get to the positives. First negative was the mosquitoes, this is the rainy season and they are vicious especially when the wind dies down after about midnight. Bring bug repellent if you go during this time. Second negative is that we were allergic to something there, and both broke out in rashes. The third and final negative was that Azia, the Asian Restaurant, was closed for renovations the whole week that we were there. Those were really the only negatives we had. Moving on to positives, it was almost all positive. We arrived and were greeted by name at the hotel lobby, and given the cool towel and champagne treatment mentioned by others. After check-in, we were handed off to Manuel the Doorman who took out luggage and escorted us to our room in building 26. His attention and the fact that he remembered our names all week made us feel very welcome. We actually ended up having 2 concierges because 2 days into the trip ours left for his vacation. Daya was our new concierge and she did a great job helping with our last minute plans changes. All the food was great, and the service was amazing. We are very comfortable eating at Diners and Chain restaurants, so all of this fancy food was a little strange to us. My favorite food was at Las Ventanas, it was the Coca Bread with Foie, and hers was at the Palatzzo, and she loved the Ravioli. The beach is fine, there are these huge sandbags in the water that are actually fun to jump off, and the way they are situated, they create a swimming pool of ocean water. The pools are amazing, and I really liked the hot tubs at the relaxation pools. We made it a goal to try and swim in all of the pools. We got all of them except for the spa pool. Shopping is close by in a mall down the street, or you can pay a $10 cab ride to go to 5th Ave. We went there but did not feel comfortable and came back after only about an hour. Side excursions (booked through out Concierge were also a lot of fun, we Swam with the Dolphins at Delphinus (Xcaret) and went on a Zip Line/ Tulum tour with a company called Alltournative. I recommend both tours to everyone.

He led us to a private taxi that was to take us to the Royal Hideaway. i Gracias Lomas ! We arrived at the RH late in the evening but were greeted like royalty. The front desk staff was very accommodating and friendly. Since it was late the front desk made a reservation for us at one of the casual a la carte restaurants and had our bags transferred to our room. The property is gorgeous and our room was stunning with marble floors and counters. Dinner was excellent. But it was nothing compared to the beach the next day. Wow. We spent most of the rest of our time at the beach. Food in all the restaurants was wonderful. My only grip is that I didn't bring shoes and my travel agency never told me I'd have to wear long pants and shoes for dinner. We had to go into town and buy some shoes. Not a big deal but could have been easily avoided. Everything at RH was perfect. If I only have one complaint about it, it's that it's a little to upscale for me.

The service, quality, and value we received were all outstanding. On recommendations read here, before we arrived, we requested an upstairs room in a building towards the center of the resort because it is much quieter (due to noise from neighboring resorts). We also made several dinner reservations in advance. I was frankly shocked that my requests were responded to and handled with the utmost professionalism, follow-through and care. Customer service manager Eva deserves the credit and our concierge Ricardo was excellent as well. I knew we were in good hands when I asked him on the first day if it was going to rain, he said \"No, they've been saying it's going to rain everyday for three weeks now, and it hasn't rained\". It only rained on our 2nd to last day, which I give all the credit to Ricardo. ;) In all seriousness though, I have found the advance weather reports about Playa Del Carmen to be much more pessimistic than the results in my three visits. (We showed 30% and 60% chance of rain on every day, yet only experienced one day with any rain at all) My wife had a massage at the spa, which she enjoyed, but wasn't blown away by. The workout room is a bit on the smallish side, but no one was there, so who's to complain? The reception we received with champagne and fresh towels was quite welcome. I loved the fact that the check-in was done from a couch in the lounge rather than while standing at a counter. What a welcome and relaxing change! The grounds are beautiful, and I was really surprised at the perfect design and layout of the resort. This resort is much smaller than many Playacar resorts yet never felt cramped or like it was missing anything. The sandbags on the beach, as commented so many times on this board, are worth knowing about in advance, but any adventurous spirit won't find them too much of an obstacle. The afternoon tea was a delightful break. The food at all the restaurants was very good, although don't be afraid to order more than one appetizer if you have a big appetite, as portions are on the smallish side. My personal favorite was Azia. The best thing I can say about the resort though is sort of intangible. I found the guests for the most part to be friendly, charming, and classier than most at all-inclusives. Hi there to Jim and Susan! The activity coordinator (I forget his name) had just the right amount of charm and persistence to lead people from the side of the pool to participate in bocci ball (not too far!) or water aerobics without being to pushy, loud, or obnoxious. The staff tries just a bit harder to make things right, including replacing our DVD player in our room that wasn't working. At this time of year the resort was at about 33% occupancy, which was great for pool space, dinner reservations, and poolside drink and food service. I never got the feeling they were holding back (except the restaurant closings) due to the low season. There are towels waiting for you at the pool chairs. Areas that I found a bit frustrating include the restaurant closures (Palazzo was closed throughout and Azia and Ventanas were closed on a couple days, the inflexibility with reservations was sometimes a bit annoying, but I found you just have to plan ahead and stick to the plan. The pace of restaurant service was at times a little slow as well. Outside the resort, we went to Dolphinus, which I enjoyed, but my wife found to be absolutely priceless! We went scuba diving and rented jet-skis, all with the help of the friendly and knowledgeable staff at the resort. You can find better prices down the beach, but not enough to make up for the convenience and security of knowing they are right there at the resort. We went into town, which if you've done once anywhere in Mexico, you've done it already. We also booked our trip through Costco, which seemed to save us about $200 per person, and found their service to also be excellent. They called us in advance of our trip to tell us about the restaurant closure and also confirmed we received necessary documents. The best endorsement I found about this resort is how many people I met who were there for their 7th time, 9th year in a row, or were already planning to come back. I can't wait to come back again next year, and am a bit ambivalent about writing this review for fear that next year will be more crowded!", "Date": "September 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cSheer luxury and bliss\u201d", "Author": "Cuddles1201", "ReviewID": "UR19880321", "Content": "We returned from the Royal Hideaway hotel after a two weeks holiday, and I could have stayed longer. We went on the 13th August to 28th August) We always use trip advisor when selecting our holidays and hotel (it\u2019s our holiday bible,) and they didn\u2019t fail us with this one. The reviews we read were spot on, and we felt we knew the hotel even before we arrived. Check-In After a not so good 10 hours plus flight from the UK we landed in Cancun and sailed through, (about 5 minutes.) We then had a private transfer to the hotel which took around 45 minutes. As soon as the taxi arrived the doors were opened for us and our baggage and hand luggage were taken from us. We were then led into the lobby and seated for check-in, where we received a cold towel and glass of champagne, which really set the atmosphere for rest of our holiday. This was a really nice touch- we were exhausted and hot. We requested villa 25 or 26 and a top-floor room, and we received a top floor room in villa 25 overlooking the relaxation pool. I had requested this in an e-mail and they remembered. We were then told that we had to book for dinner and was asked if we wanted formal, casual or room service. We opted for casual at Spices. The bell boy then took us to our room which was fab and explained everything to us, and told us if we needed anything just contact the desk. It was after 6.00 and our concierge had already left. Resort The resort is exceptional, everywhere you look there are fountains, relaxation pools and streams, the gardens are exceptionally well kept. Our villa was near to everything- almost central, and well positioned. Room Our room (2524) looked out onto the relaxation pool and towards the beach, although we cannot see the sea. It also had a great sunrise and was cooler in the afternoon which was great. The room was very nice and the bed was very comfortable and huge. The bathroom was quite big and the bath and shower was fine. The shower in the bath is a lot more powerful than the shower in the cubicle, which could have done with being more powerful. The robes and slippers provided was also a nice touch to have. I loved the hairdryer; it was very hot and dried my hair really fast. It usually takes about 45 minutes to dry my hair. The minibar was stocked with what we wanted and Ricardo (our concierge who was excellent) provided whatever we wanted. If you wanted anything after your concierge had left you just phoned room service. The turn down service was a nice touch and they change the towels frequently. Pool/Beach We are beach people and most of our time was spent on the beach and in the sea. I read reviews that said there weren\u2019t any beach, but there is. There are sand bags on the beach; however that did not affect us. We even used them as loungers in the water. On our last day they had covered up my favourite sandbag and was widening the beach. There are two pool area and the infinity pool. I didn\u2019t use the pool, but the infinity pool was great. It was right on the beach so you could relax in the infinity pool and people-watch. The staff on the beach area was fantastic and would bring you drinks and if you went in for a dip, they replenish your drink without you asking. We even had our lunch on the beach; they just bought you the menu from the Grill. There seemed to be plenty of chairs and they are very comfortable. The security guard would put up the shade for you without you asking, which was nice. You could use as many towels as you wish and can take them to the relaxation pool with you. Food/Drinks The food was really good, especially at Spices, The Grill and Ventanas. We weren\u2019t so keen on the Azia. My husband liked the Grill and Spices the best because they served up bigger portions. The best was foie gras, fillet of beef and chocolate souffl\u00e9 at Ventanas. The Italian restaurant was closed for refurbishment. You have to try the afternoon tea, it was sheer luxury where you could have anything even champagne. Service/Staff The service and staff were really exceptional and outstanding. Everyone was always smiling and they genuinely wanted you to have a great time. They did anything to make you happy and went out of their way to make sure you were satisfied and had everything you needed. They always said that you were welcomed when you said thank you or gracias. The resort is very safe and they are strict about letting people in, especially on the beach. People from other resorts would stop and try and sit on the chairs to take a picture or try and come from the beach to have a look or use the facilities; however they would be immediately stopped. You didn\u2019t wear bracelets at this resort. If you go to 5th Avenue, take water with you and wear a hat as it is very hot without much shade. Also be aware of the prices when eating at \u2018Mexican\u2019 restaurants. Also went you go the Chichen Itza, Tulum or any trips, take a towel and the umbrella that is provided by the hotel. These places are very, very hot. We went to Tulum for half a day and Xel Ha in the afternoon. On hindsight I would just do one at a time. Xel ha is a whole day if you want to do everything. Try and go to the Cenotes, they are fantastic. If you want a night life you could easily go into town for 50 pesos, or take a 20 minutes walk. we went to the Allegria Bar most night where we made friends with quite a few couples, especially Alice and Frank We really had a great time and we will definitely be back. As I said our concierge Ricardo was excellent. When we decided to go to Mexico we were going to book at the Iberostar or Rui, but we are really pleased that we chose the Hideaway I would and have recommended this place to a few of my friends and we thought it was fantastic.I hope this review was helpful.

We always take a 10 day trip at Christmas and were thinking about coming here so we decided to go and try it out. Check-In We were greeted kindly and led into the lobby and seated for check-in. We received a cold towel and glass of champagne, which really does set the tone for the week. We requested a top-floor room, which we received, but our room was not quite ready yet so we were then shown around the property and brought to the deck for lunch. We had a nice lunch and then went to our villa where we met with our concierge who explained everything to us about the property and she showed us to our room. Resort The resort is beautiful. The gardens are lush and well taken care of. There was no penny-pinching when it came to building this resort. Everything was gorgeous. Room The room was great, very clean and the bed was very comfortable. I had read that some people found the rooms to be small and I didn\u2019t at all. I know we were on the top floor so the ceilings are vaulted, but even if they weren\u2019t the rooms were plenty big enough, I don\u2019t know why you would need more room. I had also read that some people found the showers to be small and I didn\u2019t get that either. Unless you are a gigantic human being there is plenty of room for two, let alone one. Some people had also said that the rooms need some touching up and I can\u2019t understand that. Some of the wall-paper was peeling a tiny bit in the washroom, but that will always happen in a humid climate and is certainly not something that is going to bother me while I am on vacation. Some things that I will comment on is that the robes were a bit small for my boyfriend who is not large at all and having a few more drawers for clothes would have been nice, but I am not complaining at all, just a heads up. I read that some people did not like that there were not that many English channels and we had no problem, we only watched t.v. in the morning and at night and we made use of the dvds that they had in the lobby. I loved the hairdryer, it was hot and blew really fast. Always plenty of drinks stocked in the fridge and if you ran out of something you could always call room service to bring you anything if it is after 6 and your concierge is gone. Pool/Beach The pool area has two pools and the infinity pool was fantastic. It was right on the beach so you could lounge in the pool and people-watch. The staff that works the pool and beach area were fantastic and would bring you drinks in the pool, on the beach or at your chair and you never had an empty glass. The sand at the beach was great and the beach is very well maintained. People were constantly working on reversing the erosion, raking or cleaning up any sea weed that washed up. The sand bags are there and it is difficult to swim right from the beach in front, but you can walk literally 30 feet and swim fine. The water was beautiful! There always seemed to be plenty of chairs and they are very comfortable. The thai beds are a definite must! It was the perfect way to spend a day to lay in the beds and read or nap and then go to the beach or pool and then come back and lay down. I loved that it was unlimited towels. Food/Drinks The food was really good. I hate the term \u201cfoodies,\u201d so I won\u2019t use it, but we definitely enjoy good food and eating at nice restaurants and we were not disappointed. It is not perfect and not the same as 5-star dining elsewhere, but it is definitely really good. We slept through our reservation the first night so we ordered room-service and it was good. I had lasagna and my boyfriend had a clubhouse. The menu is not huge but there is definitely enough to choose from. We ordered coffee and fruit to the room every morning. I loved the coffee! We only had breakfast at the buffet in Spices and it was good. The usual eggs, bacon, pancakes, fruit, cereal, cheese, meats, etc. There was an omelet station and also always some Mexican breakfast items that were really good. We had lunch most days either by the pool on our pool chairs or on The Deck. This menu is pretty large and you can get things like burgers, pizza, sandwiches, salads, etc. and there is also fish dishes and other \u201cnicer\u201d things to eat here. I loved the onion rings and obviously as everyone else has said the chips with guacamole is so good, I ate so much guacamole here! You could sit down and eat with a different menu upstairs at Spices and we ate here once. It was good and I would have eaten here more but it just never seemed to happen. We had dinner only at Las Ventanas, Azia, and the Italian restaurant, twice at each. We did the tasting menu at Ventanas and I really enjoyed it, the food was good, not great, the presentation was really nice. I was actually not looking forward to the Asian restaurant, we eat a lot of Asian food and I thought it was pretty good. The \u201cspring roll\u201d was great! The sushi was ok and the mains were also ok. The Italian restaurant was good, the ravioli is so good! Overall we were impressed with the food. The drinks were good. I wouldn\u2019t say the liquor was top-shelf, maybe we were just there when they had run out of some, but there was no grey goose vodka, they had absolute and stoli, which are good, but not the same in a martini. Every day by the pool there was a drink of the day and they were all really yummy! The beer is fresh and cold. The house wine included was ok. There were some that were not drinkable at all and some that were actually ok. There was a chardonnay that was ok and a Mexican cabernet sauvignon and an Italian Montelpucciano that were pretty good. The wine list of bottles and glasses that you could buy had some nice bottles and they were not too expensive, maybe 10-20% more than at a restaurant at home. Service/Staff The service and staff were unbelievable! Everyone is always smiling and they genuinely enjoy their jobs and want you to have a great time. They will do anything to make you happy and go out of their way to make sure you are satisfied. This is what made our trip so great. When you say gracias or thank you they reply with \u201cmy pleasure\u201d and I love that! The pool and beach staff were amazing, they work so hard and are always smiling. Everyone was really great. Miscellaneous It is a very safe resort and they are strict about letting people in, which I really liked. People would try and come from the beach to have a look or something and they would be immediately stopped. I loved that there were no bracelets. The town is really nice and safe and you can get anything that you may have forgotten to pack. 5th Ave. is kind of like a street in the U.S. with Starbucks, etc. but there are some neat places in town. The golf course is across the street and it looked nice. We went to have a look at it and planned on playing but never got around to it. The weather was really good. The forecast said Isolated Storms everyday and it only rained for literally 5 minutes the entire time. Right when it starts raining the staff take away all of the pool chair cushions and 15 minutes after it is done raining you would not even know that it had rained because everyone is mopping up all of the water, I thought that was a really nice touch. We really had a great time and we will be back. I wanted to go and check out the new Iberostar Grand to see if it would be somewhere we would be interested in going but I don\u2019t see how it could be any better than this. If the beach was a deciding factor for us then we would possibly go there, but we went in the ocean everyday and the sand bags did not bother me at all. I would definitely recommend this place, we thought it was fantastic.

We were blown away! It was a great trip from start to finish! When we arrived at the resort, we were greeted with champagne and cool towels. We had chosen to upgrade when we booked our trip, which we were happy with and I would recommend. This included a second floor room, turn-down service, a bottle of champagne (other than the one you get upon arrival), chocolate covered strawberries one night in our room, 2 luxurious Royal Hideaway robes and a candlelight dinner on the beach. We stayed in Villa 25, which was the perfect location because we never heard the neighboring resorts at night. Not to mention, Riccardo was our concierge and he was beyond excellent! The daily \"newsletter\" is sweet - announcing any special occasions. The restaurants were incredible. I would recommend NOT going to the dinner show and going to one of the restaurants instead. The show we saw was like a cheesy, low budget acrobatic musical (it was terrible). We stayed at the resort for 10 days, so we opted to go to dinner instead of going to a different show. The mixed drinks were great - always try the special of the day. We were disappointed in the house wines. They weren't that fabulous. When we purchased a bottle of wine, it was waaaaay overpriced. The roantic dinner on the beach was great. Overall, the wait staff and entire resort staff was wonderful, friendly, professional and helpful. The spa was great except for the fact that a group of friends purchased 2 (very expensive) massage packages for my husband and I as a wedding gift. When we arrived at the resort, they did not have record of this (due to an apparent computer glitch), so we booked our own massages. After we spent over $200 on massages, when we returned to our room, the certificate was there. When we called to ask the spa to credit us one package, they said no. I mean, who doesn't love going to the spa? Well, going 3 times in 10 days looses its luster. Not to mention, the reason our friends purchased the spa packages was so we didn't have to spend much money out of pocket (which we ended up doing). The way the spa handled this was disappointing, but the spa services were amazing. The pools were great, the waiters at the pool were very attentive (request the Don Julio Margaritas and the rum runners!), the fruit kebabs were delicious, but watch out for iguanas sitting under your chair! At times the pool area was overcrowded and guests would reserve seats, which was annoying because then you couldn't get a chair without a struggle. Apparently there was a conference at some point during our stay and twice all guests were booted from the pool area at 2pm so they could set up for a dinner. It was a little inconvenient to have to pack up and relocate after getting settled in. There are a few other smaller pools which are fun, but not as many beach chairs. The beach was good, but still being worked on to rebuild after some erosion. We wanted to partake in watersports, but the water was too rough to go out into the ocean. The breakfast buffet at Spices was great - they had everything you could imagine, the sit down breakfast at Las Ventanas was amazing - be sure to ask for the smoothie menu and try the Popeye! Don't let the green color freak you out! It actually tastes like Cantelope! We took a side trip to Chichen Itza through Apple Vacation Tours. It was only $100 per person and totally worth it! I would highly recommend taking the day to do this. If you book through Apple, you do have to wake up early, but you are back at the resort before dinner. We also took a side trip to the Lapis jewelry factory, which was disappointing - I wouldn't bother with this. They tried to hussle the tourists. Again, this was a wonderful trip and the perfect honeymoon location. A few hiccups, but that happens anywhere.

I have listed the things that made this a top choice among our destinations as well as some things that if we had to choose to change we would. We will definitely be returning! What makes the Royal Hideaway perfect: 1. Greeted with smiles, champagne and scented cool towels. 2. Bottle of champagne was waiting for us in our room celebrating our second return. 3. Drinks are premium and top shelf (Don Julio margs) as requested. 4. Signature drinks are passed around to begin the day...I recommend the Crocodile Cooler. 5. You never have to leave your chair for a drink, food or umbrella. The staff lives to serve. Javier was great. I recommend a small daily tip. It is not required but the staff truly works above and beyond to make sure you do not have to lift a finger. 6. Upon arrival to our room on the first night in from the beach we were welcomed with a bubble bath covered in fresh flowers as well as a sweet letter and a bed covered with flowers (which we did not request). Thanks Ricardo from Villa 25! 7. Gourmet cuisine. Each dinner is perfect. My husband would recommend Las Ventanas as his favorite and I would have to say that Azia was my fave (the best sushi). 8. The beach is by far the cleanest and the least crowded. There is also a beautiful infinity pool. 9. There is a magnificent breakfast buffet. I also have to say that they have the best coffee I have ever had. 10. The beds and rooms are wonderful. Many of the villas have small private pools to relax in after dinner. 11. You are encouraged to take as many beach towels as you want for the beach and your room is restocked with bath towels at turn down. 12. Playa is only a $5 cab ride away. Be aware that it is HOT and many of the shops are not air conditioned. 13. Fridge is stocked with what you request. We requested extra waters and each day we were provided plenty. Changes (if we had to): 1. If you are not a fish/seafood lover, the dinners will be limited. 2. Gift Shop is pricey so make sure you have what you need. 3. Cancun airport sucks. Customs takes quite a while. 4. The dinner show is not that great and it is the only buffet dinner. 5. The house wines are ok.

The boys were loud, splashing around the infinity pool and playing football while others, mostly couples were trying to relax.

The area in front of the sandbags is about knee deep, while the area directly beyond the sandbags is over your head. As a result, it was difficult to get back over the sandbags once you were out there and I observed one person that had to be rescued by the hotel staff.

There are some obvious differences from the moment you arrive. The lobby is different from any I've seen at other all inclusives. You do not stand or sit at a desk but instead are directed to a sofa or comfy chair, your luggage already taken away by the bell boys. They bring you a cool, scented towel and a glass of champagne. You stay there and they bring everything to you to get you checked in. As the bell boy brought us to your room, he pointed out where restaurants were, etc. We were on the second floor in building #24 closest to the pool and beach. The room had vaulted ceilings and a huge bathroom with a walk in closet complete with safe. There was a shower, jacuzzi tub and double marble sink. There were comfy robes and slippers in the closet. The rooms were cleaned at least twice a day, with turn down service at night which was a nice touch. The pools were small but they didn't need to be bigger because it is a small hotel. We had no problem getting a seat by the pool every day and more than one day there were empty seats around the pool. The service was usually good by the pool and there was a very nice pool concierge who would come around and let you know about activities (salsa lessons, spanish lessons, yoga, pilates, etc) but was never pushy. One day we did have poor service around the pool, it was very busy that day (Saturday) and every seat was taken around the pools and there were only two waiters to serve all (including the folks on the beach). With that said, I've never received waiter service at any other all inclusive and the service was good except that day. They would bring lunch right to your lounge chair. The service in the restaurants was wonderful. My favorite part was a waiter named Victor who responded to anything you asked for with , \"Yes, of course\". Our favorite meal was in Azia. It was declicious. I found the food to be good to fair - mostly it was a bit bland. Although as I said, the service was excellent and if you asked for more they were happy to oblige. The cocktails were good, although you have to ask for the good liquor or they'll just use the crappy stuff. And, they have plenty of good liquor. As many have mentioned, there is no night life. Although we were usually so full from dinner that one drink was all we had after dinner. The only bar open late is at the front of the property but if you go to the pool area the bar there is open because the restaurant is open. We would sit on the deck overlooking the water and the waiter from the restaurant would bring us drinks. Skip the show! It was terrible, although the buffet was good (the only buffet offered is with the show as everything else is ala carte.) We had an excellent couples massage in the spa. We checked out the gym, 3 treadmills, an eliptical machine and weight machines. If you are a beach person, this is not the place for you. The beach is small and full of sandbags to stop the erosion.

To this day I am still overwhelmed about what a wonderful trip it was. Like many of the other gushing reviews there is much to love about this resort, but what is prompting me to write now - all this time later - is to set minds at ease about people new to \"all inclusive\". I recently returned from a stay at a very gross, dirty, cheesey and disappointing all inclusive elsewhere in the Caribbean and was surprised when my husband said he feared that's what our honeymoon was going to be like. So for the \"All Inclusive fearful\" - this is NOT the Breezes, Sandals, Club Medd that you fear. This is a high class establishment employed by warm friendly and eager people who genuinely want you to have a good time. The amenities are high-grade and the service is impeccable. Yes, the beach is a bummer. Yes, scheduling your meals with no 'non-reservation' option was a bummer. Yes, rising at early hours to claim one of the few deck chairs is a bummer. And the reviewer who talked about the bar tenders not necessarily knowing all the American mixed drinks is true. But we did get some yummy and funny concoctions in return. I stuck to champagne the whole week so I was fine (Honeymoon High)! In return though, you have a quiet, relaxing stunningly beautiful resort with great food, and wonderful ambiance. We did go to town a few times, we did even walk once or twice - which is nice. After staying at a crappy all inclusive in Curacao where the AC hardly worked the internet came at a charge per 15 minute interval, the food was crap, the ambiance and clientele was more like a city YMCA in the summer - RH remains an oasis. I'm hopeful for a big anniversary, like 5 years or something, we'll go back. I know it's a big world and there's a lot to see, but my memories from this trip were so warm, I'd love to go back!

We've stayed at several all-inclusives in the Riviera Maya region and RH was not the worst we have tried, but certainly not the best. One of the reasons we chose to stay at RH was it's proximity to Playa del Carmen which was a big plus. However, in hindsight, it didn't make up for all the small disappointments Rh supplied. We stayed at Excellence Riviera Maya last year and it is the best we've found in the region so far, so all comparisons are based on that. The grounds at RH are lovely and well maintained and the small size of RH in relation to some of the mega-resorts that are springing up all around that region lends it a more intimate coziness than many (including Excellence). However, that small size also works to Rh's disadvantage as you will see. The rooms are nicely furnished and comfortable, but lacking some amenities that we have enjoyed at other properties. For instance, there were fewer English TV channels than we have had at other resorts. No, we didn't go to Mexico to watch TV, but it rained quite a bit the first 2 days we were there so more TV would have been a welcome addition. Also, the bathtub and shower were only large enough for 1 person at a time. Excellence had a large, soaking tub big enough for 2 and a walk-in shower that would also accomodate a couple. Overall, the room was smaller and not quite as nice as Excellence. Also, the housekeeping staff had the annoying habit of leaving the door open any time they entered the room for anything. Not a big deal, except that it allowed a constant flow of bugs and mosquitos into the room. We would spend part of every night swatting at the bugs that housekeeping kept letting in every day. The dining experience was not up to our standards either. This will not matter to some others, but it was a big negative to us: you have to make reservations for dinner for every day of your stay. There are no places to eat at night without reservations except for a limited room service menu. Unlike Excellence, there is no snack bar or grill to just grab something to eat after dark. We live our whole lives by schedules and having to schedule our dinners for time and place every day is not something we wish to do on vacation. We have stayed at all-inclusives where no reservations were required. It makes a huge difference if you aren't planning the last half of your day around a set meal time. Also, not a big issue, but dinner required closed shoes, long pants and a collared shirt at every restaurant on the property. The food was just OK. More thought and effort goes into the presentation of the food instead of the preparation, especially breakfast. The food could and should be much better. The wait staff is very friendly and attentive for the most part. I'd give them an \"A\" for effort. But there is a fine line between attentive and intrusive, which is something some of the staff members fail to realize. It's hard to enjoy a meal and a conversation when you are interrupted every 2 minutes by a waiter asking if you need anything. I'm sure some of that is attributable to the blasted reservations system since they need to turn the table in a specified time or their reservations will get behind. But if I need something and you are always nearby, I'll get your attention. Otherwise, leave me alone to enjoy my meal with my wife. And I got the distinct impression that in some of their nicer restaurants, the waiters were downright pretentious and snooty! That's neither necessary nor justified. Get over yourselves. The bar/bartending situation was probably the low point of the whole property. As long as you stick to the basics: beer, margaritas, simple mixed drinks, everything is fine. But stray from their normal fare at your own peril. My wife ordered a Bahama Mama on several different occassions from different bars and no two were alike nor would any of them fit our standard definition of a Bahama Mama. That drink is pretty standard anywhere in the world and we've ordered it in many places with familiar results. But not here. Same with an Amaretto Sour. These aren't exotic drinks, but we may as well have asked for something totally off the wall. And while there are plenty of places to get a drink during the day, at night most of the bars except for two small bars both in the main building and one window next to the pool become part of the restaurants so there isn't much room to just sit and enjoy a quiet cocktail. Also, the beach is converted into a dining under the stars experience which all but eliminates a walk on the beach after dark. Again, it's the small size of the resort that works against it as every square foot of space is utilized and reutilized throughout the day. The beach is nice and well maintained, but a little small due to erosion from recent hurricanes. They are trying to reclaim some of the eroded beach which results in some rather unattractive scenery but we understand the purpose. The pools are scattered throughout the property and some of the less obvious ones can be nice little secluded areas you can use for some quiet R & R at times. The main pool areas suffer from the usual problem of too many people and not enough chairs so arrive early if that is important to you. We used the spa services which are a big item for us. The spa was pretty good, but again, space is at a premium and there is little in the way of luxurious extras. When compared to the Excellence spa, the massage services were of the same quality, but the facilities are sorely lacking.

We have traveled to other all-inclusive resorts so we had basis for comparison. RH stood out in a number of areas: The Service was impeccable! You really get what you pay for. 1. Twice a day maid service, including turn down every night. 2. A building concierge who take care of all of your needs. The mini fridge had Pepsi, but I like Coke. So, Ramon made sure I had Coke in our fridge. 3. The staff calls you by your name and remembers you 4. You can take as many towels as you want from the pool and no towel cards needed 5. Servers actually walk around the pool, hot tubs, beach, taking drink orders, you don\u2019t have to flag them down. The food is delicious! We\u2019re spoiled living in Philadelphia and I\u2019m a picky eater. At most AI\u2019s, I\u2019m sick of the food by the end of the week, but not here. The homemade guacamole at lunch is to die for. I ate filet mignon almost every night and it was cooked perfectly. Most of the restaurants bring you sorbet before the Entr\u00e9e to cleanse your palate, very classy. The alcohol was great for an AI. Corona on tap, Stoli and Grey Goose behind the bar. Frozen drinks are made with a blender, not poured out of a machine. Each restaurant has different specialty drinks, which keeps it fun. Every flavor of margarita you could ask for. Other points we liked about the RH: 1. The crowd was mostly couples and honeymooners so we did not feel out of place. There were many couples in their 20\u2019s and 30\u2019s and everyone was there for the same reason, to relax with their significant other. People were always willing to take a picture for us. 2. The resort was a great size at 200 rooms. You recognize the other guests, get to know people, it\u2019s not over crowded at the pool or beach. 3. Proximity to Playa del Carmen. On the cloudy days we took a 5 minute/$7 cab ride into town which was great for eating, drinking, shopping. This place isn\u2019t necessarily for you if: 1. You are with a group of friends looking to have a wild vacation. The resort is really geared towards couples and there is little nighttime entertainment. We met 2 sisters that were having a good time, but commented that they didn\u2019t realize the clientele was mostly couples. 2. You want to take long walks on the beach. Yes, the beach situation is unfortunate, but it is what it is. The whole stretch is the same way. At least the RH works on it daily. I love the beach, but we were perfectly content floating in the pool and looking at the ocean or laying on the beach but not really frolicking in the ocean. To sum it up, we had a great time and I would highly recommend this resort to any honeymooner or couple. They really set a high standard and I\u2019m afraid no other AI resort we go to will ever compare!", "Date": "June 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City", "Title": "\u201cSpectacular!\u201d", "Author": "StacySki_NYC", "ReviewID": "UR16949630", "Content": "We just returned from a 7 night holiday at the Royal Hideaway, and could not have been happier! We are seasoned travelers, and have very high expectations. All of our expectations were met, and continuously exceeded throughout the trip. It is the attention to detail that made this experience wonderful. Service: The service at the resort was outstanding. Prior reviews had stated that there were some difficulties with service - we noted none whatsoever! From the moment we arrived, we were treated well by a respectful and kind staff. The check-in process was extremely smooth (and complete with champagne). Everything was very efficient. Rooms: The rooms were extremely clean, and well maintained. One couple we met commented that they felt the room was a little small, but being from Manhattan, we felt that the size was extremely generous. Besides, how much time do you really spend in your room? The furnishings were top of the line and very tasteful. Restaurants: I can't say enough about the restaurants. They were fabulous - not what you expect at an \"all-inclusive\" resort. We are \"foodies\", and were blown away, especially by Las Ventanas. The tasting menu was phenomenal. It does take a couple of hours to get through the whole menu, but this was something we absolutely loved. The portions were a decent size, and you could order whatever and how much you desire, should you still be hungry. Again, it's the little details that make this a top notch resort. The glassware at the bars and restaurants is Riedel, and the proper utensils are provided with every course. The service at all of the restaurants is right on point, attentive without being pushy or in your face. Tipping is not required but with service as great as it is, it's hard not to want to tip. Tipping is very appreciated by the staff, but definitely not expected. (We tipped in USD, pesos are not necessary) Beach/Pool: The pool area is beautiful and very well maintained. There are ample chairs and seating along with umbrellas to shield the hot sun. There is an attentive wait staff to serve drinks and lunch pool and beach-side. As others have pointed out, the beach is still not in the best shape after Hurricane Dean last year. However, the resort is working very hard to fix it. It is absolutely possible to swim in the sea, with little inconvenience. Certainly not a deal breaker! Overall, this was an amazing trip with top notch service and food. Our expectations were absolutely met and exceeded. This resort is a 5 Diamond resort for a reason!

We felt as though we experienced two vacations in one. We enjoyed relaxating with cocktails, cool towels, and fruit kabobs delivered poolside, playing at the beach, and some water sports during the day, and going back to our room to get dressed for dinner each evening as the whole resort shifted into a more romantic and elegant ambience. Yes\u2013 the beach was indeed framed by large obstructive sandbags, but it really did not put a damper on our experience. I am however, glad I had a \u2018heads-up\u2019 \u2013 wouldn\u2019t have wanted this to be a surprise. If you live for long romantic strolls on the beach, this may disappoint, however there is more beach than last year. My husband and I were happy to take our daily beach walk, sometimes encountering areas open to the sea which made for great photo opportunities. We could also peek into the days of vacation goers at the other resorts and we were thankful to get back to our Hideaway! It seems that everyone at our resort was there for the same reasons as us... relaxing, pampered, worry-free days and evenings without loud wild partying; although, the unlimited Belvedere martinis and Don Julio tequila shots didn\u2019t hurt a bit! Do take advantage of the 'tequlia class' and 'martini making 101'. The wildest parties went on at the properties next door (thankfully, they cooled it down around 11pm each night). If you are early birds or if you think noise will put a damper on the experience you expect, request a room facing the interior gardens of the property. Regardless, DO call (not more than a week ahead of your arrival)and request your room if you have a preference. Villas 27 and 31 are closest to the infinity pool and the beach \u2013 a top floor request will ensure you vaulted ceilings which lend a much roomier more open appeal to your accommodations. While you are on the phone, book your first night\u2019s dinner reservations. They are strict about this, you have to make them ASAP husband and I believe that if they did not stick so closely to this code, and force late-reservation-makers to dine at 6:00 or 9:30, they simply would not be able to seat everyone at the ever important times of 7-8. If you feel stuck in the time you get, pass along a monetary tip to your concierge and ask politely if they could \u2018try their best\u2019 to get you in earlier or later, go ahead and take the undesirable time slot just incase, but you just may get lucky... On the subject of tipping, only once was our tip refused (very classy) but in every other instance accepted graciously... they don\u2019t make a fortune and they never brushed off a little extra as if it were \u2018expected\u2019. Find a waiter you like early on and tip him well, he will be more likely to remember your faces and what you like to drink... you may have a friend for the whole trip. Please get used to the idea that places around the infinity pool are routinely involved in the \u201cI got here early and put my things here so this spot is mine for the day\u201d game. We learned this very quickly and did just fine. We never saw staff remove anyone\u2019s belongings to enforce the \u201820 minute rule\u2019 \u2013 not once. Note that unless you want quiet seclusion to sleep or read, the Thai beds may be overrated... they are off the beaten path a bit and not in much sun and frankly, they were simply way too comfortable. Depending on what you want \u2013 I would not go down any later than 7:30 to \u2018claim\u2019 any particular spot. Restaurants were all beautiful. We believe it depends upon one\u2019s personal taste and dining style to pick a favorite. House wine selections were much improved since last year. All inclusive wines are the same at every restaurant. Know that if you are a sushi fan, the maki rolls at Azia are quite nice, sashimi was fresh and tasty as well. You may like to try their 'sake-tini'. You may show up to their sushi bar nightly starting at 6:00 and order (sushi only) with out reservations. This is a great option if you have very late/early reservations elsewhere and need to fill in any gaps or if you are sushi addicts like us (we stopped in nearly every single evening for a fix). If you want to be seated outside at any of the restaurants (great night time view of Cozumel) request it specifically \u2013 Palazzo seemed the only restaurant where ordering one item for each course proved to be too much \u2013 pasta or entr\u00e9e \u2013 not both. Ventanas was on the other end of the spectrum with very small portions \u2013 simply feel free to order a few appetizers to start. The breakfast buffet at Spices was quick (you have to get back to your spot at the pool) and satisfying. \u201cSnack Bar\u201d is an understatement \u2013 do try the cevechie, guacamole, and the shrimp cocktail - the little wood grilled pizzas are good as well. There is also seating upstairs at Spices for lunch - still casual but a differing menu. You may even opt to order some items poolside. One of the only issues I believe the resort has to come to terms with is whether they want to remain a romantic, intimate, once in a lifetime experience for some, or cater to large groups whom are simply there for free or as a reward of some type and do not realize how being loud and obnoxious can affect the people whom are there for the romance, intimacy and \u2018once in a lifetime\u2019 experience. My husband and I have become so spoiled by the dining, service, and relaxation offered by this beautiful resort, we worry that we will not be able to vacation anywhere else. Our awesome TravelCorp travel agent has suggested a couple other properties that he feels we would enjoy, but when it comes to booking our all-inclusive delight - we keep coming back to Royal Hideaway... *Feel free to ask us any questions.

People always ask us, \"Why do you keep going back? Doesn't it get boring?\" No way! We love the personal service. Pros: Every staff member greets you with a smile. 1) The bellboys are prompt with your luggage and with getting you a taxi. 2) The concierge in our villa always helped with every need in a timely fashion. 3) The waiters/waitresses are always checking on you to see if you need anything (never had to ask for a drink). 4) The maids always clean your room twice a day (and never knock on your door to ask to clean your room). I still have not figured out how they do that. 5) The grounds keepers do a wonderful job (and you never see them except when it rains). Within five minutes of a rain shower, the staff is outside mopping up the water off of the sidewalk! 6) The food is always wonderful. The evening meals are comparable to Brennan\u2019s of Houston and Mark\u2019s American Cuisine. This is saying a lot, since these restaurants cost around $130 to $160 for two people per meal. The service is better at the Royal Hideaway than at home. 7) Our favorite expression at the Royal Hideaway (that every staff member says) is, \u201cIt is my pleasure, sir/madam.\u201d I have never heard that from anyone in the US. 8) Most of the guests are very nice and charming. We met a very nice couple from Chicago on their honeymoon this year. Hi, Josh and Natalie. 9) The spa was wonderful. The staff at the spa is a lot more personable and friendly than here in the US. Cons: 1) Groups are distracting and disruptive of other guests. I also get the feeling the staff is \u201cput off\u201d by the groups. Who can blame them? The groups are loud and obnoxious. The groups usually take over one or two of the restaurants during the evening meal. The best part about the groups is their departure. 2) The beach is in the process of being fixed. While we were there they added about 10 to 15 feet of sand. Conclusion: As you can see in this brief review, the pros outweigh the cons.

We had done significant research on this property, particularly from TripAdvisor, and we found all of the reviews to be right on with what to expect when you get there. First, I will say that the service is better than any other resort/hotel we have ever experienced. The pool staff, especially Reyes, was our favorite, as they always made sure that you had a full drink in your hand. The waiters at all the restaurants are extremely nice, and call you by name. Our concierge was very nice as well. The grounds and rooms of the resort are gorgeous, and just what we were expecting with a five diamond resort. We had requested Villa 24, which is right by the beach and the pool, and were given a wonderful room in that villa. The bathroom was huge and beautiful, however the shower was incredibly small. The beds were comfortable, and we loved having a porch (we were on the ground floor). We did not recieve the included turndown service for two nights, which could have been because we were only gone to dinner for about two hours. We tried most of the restaurants and the Friday night dinner show. We enjoyed them pretty equally, and the food was good to great, but not as fantastic as some of our favorite restaurants as we were hoping. The view on the veranda at Palazzo was incredible. We really enjoyed the dinner show at Club Royal, Mexico Contemporano, which had talented performers and an authentic, huge buffet selection. I'm not a huge fan of asian food, but Azia was the only restaurant available on our first night, and I was pleasantly surprised - it might have been my favorite meal! We were dissapointed that they didn't accomodate us more on our anniversary (the first night), we mentioned it while booking our reservation and to our concierge, but this was never acknowledged in any way. Also, we were stuck in our last choice restaurant sitting in a group setting. The resort was full during our stay, which made it impossible to get a beach bed or a chair by the ifinity pool (unless you tried at 6:30 am). However, the pool chairs were super comfortable, and we loved the seating area on the deck by the ocean. The sandbags on the beach are a little unsightly, but it didn't bother us a bit. Our biggest issue with the resort (which almost made us give it a 4 rating) was the transportation to and from the airport. We had major miscommunications regarding the transportation we had booked directly through the resort. When we got to the Cancun airport, no one was there waiting for us and we were forced to pay again for our own shuttle. When we were leaving, the on site travel agent, who books all the transportation, was a confused mess and couldn't find our resrervations. He finally found it, and we finally made it to the airport, but not without having a negative first and last impressions of the resort.

Everyone is warm and genuinely friendly. You are greeted with champagne and a cold towel!! Your villa concierge will sit down and guide you through the planning of your nightly dinner reservations (one piece of advice - avoid the Tuesday night show; it is a set menu and the show is not very good). Try to call ahead and book your first night so you can avoid eating at 6 or 10!! Book Palazzo or Las Ventanas! The service is AMAZING!! Everyone seems to genuinely enjoy working here and it shows in the way they treat you. There is an abundance of people to meet any request or wish you may have (coconut ice cream by the pool in the afternoon...).

Make sure to bring small bills to tip the staff - they were very appreciative of tips!! Overall, the food is very good (avoid the beef dishes, which are only fair) All rooms and facilities throughout the resort were extremely clean. The rooms are very comfortable, but small (the showers are very small!) The comments about the beach are accurate. It is very small, but the resort is doing what they can to bring it back. It will take time for this to happen. You do have access to the Riu's beach next door, which is significantly bigger. You can choose to lounge by the pool or participate in activities - water aerobics, horseshoes, Spanish lessons, dance lessons. They also offer SCUBA. jet skies, parasailing, etc which cost extra. Make sure you get up early to ensure good positioning at the pool - most chairs were taken by 7:30!! One bad thing...the fitness center (if you can call it that) is extremely small and the equipment is outdated. However, we were told that they are planning to expand and renovate the facility and Spa at the end of this year. The spa was excellent.

Azia is unique a fun for one night. Spices and the Grill are recommended for lunch. The Foie Gras with Creme Brule is tops!! Also love the macho nachos and ceviche for lunch! Guests: Everyone we met was fun and friendly. In fact, we traded emails with several couples also honeymooning and plan to see them again. Lots of repeat visitors.

The facility is plush, the accomodations are all beautiful (we had a junior suite but poked our heads in to many others to see the differences), the service is pampering, the food was very good and there was not a care in the world there but to relax and enjoy. My husband especially enjoyed sitting across a desk with a glass of champagne for the check-in process. Our suite was not ready yet, so we meandered our way to start investigating the property. We went down to The Deck (aka The Grill) for lunch where we greatly enjoyed sitting out on deck facing the beautiful blue ocean. The onion rings were especially tasty. Then we went to our suite which definitely took our breaths away. We entered into a marble floored duplex that had a stall shower bathroom, a bar area with a stocked fridge, a small round table with four chairs to dine, and the living room with a TV. At the far end was a balcony with a relaxing hammock for two as well as a table with two chairs. We then proceeded up the winding staircase to another balcony which offered a magnificent albeit limited view of the ocean and two chaise lounges for private sunbathing along with yet another table and two chairs. The bedroom also offered another balcony but we didn't use this one. The bedroom was huge, beautifully appointed, had a beautiful fan overhead, and the bathroom had twin sinks, another marble stall shower and a separate tub with a shower head which was waiting for us with bubbles and rose petals! Talk about romance!!! Each of the villa buildings are three stories and have a concierge desk in the middle where you will have someone to make your reservations for dinners and take care of any other concerns. We dined at the Italian restaurant(sat outside on the verandah), Azia (the japanese, sat at one of the two tapanaki tables) and Le Ventanas. We had the buffet breakfast at Spices, and also a breakfast at Le Ventanas. Selection at Spices was great - and make sure to view the crazy chandeliers there (the back room was the nicest to sit in with incredible views of the ocean and one of those chandeliers). The atmosphere at Le Ventanas was especially enjoyed one morning - very very soothing and elegant. On the beach, we loved that we could order lunch from the Grill's menu and it is brought out to your lounge. We also loved the awnings that they attached to seclude two chaise lounges together from the sun, wind or just to have privacy. The beds, altho difficult to get, we did get to enjoy as well - just a real treat. I can't stop gushing about how wonderful this place was. If you want anything negative.... wished it was closer to the airport (it was about 45-60 minutes each way).... customs getting into Cancun cost us a 60 minute line wait!....service in Azia was not very good at all....being a gourmet cook and also jaded with New York restaurants we felt the food was good to very good but could have been better......didn't try the spa (not enough time but it looked beautiful and peaceful).......people complain about the beach because it is in bad shape due to the hurricaines, but we sat on it all three days preferring that to the pools.....undercurrent in the ocean was scarey (I assume because the bags packed to retain the sand on the beach might create this)........at times the language barrier was difficult but not a deterrant......and I also didn't like that the security guard on the beach who was eagle-eyed for intruders didn't speak or understand english when I inquired about the reason for four armed men who were walking the beach (only saw them that one day - don't worry!).

The room and bathroom were very nice and were kept very clean. Everything seemed very quiet to us. We did not have any trouble finding a spot at the pool - although we tend to be early risers and usually got there around 7:30 am. The pool chairs are very nice and the pool was always sparkling clean. The view is nice - the sand bags were still there but it didn't affect our view of the beautiful ocean at all. The service is top notch. It was wonderful to sit by the pool and have someone come by to bring you drinks and food to order (guac and chips, etc.) We found the restaurants to be very nice - lunch at Spices was great - we had dinner at Las Ventanas, Palazzo (twice), and Azia (twice). Honestly, we would have gone to Azia three times if it had been open our last night there (we went to Palazzo again). The food was of good quality - some people may find the portions smaller than US restaurants, but you can always order more or get additional courses (we never needed to). I highly recommend the Royal Hideaway for anyone looking for a relaxing vacation. I am 33 and my husband is 41 -I feel like we were about in the middle of the age range.

In our opinion, one of the strongest qualities of this resort is its personalized service thanks to a wonderful group of people. Staff members are very professional, efficient and courteous yet so very friendly and willing to help. It is always a real pleasure to be greeted and assisted by familiar faces; it makes us feel at home! Another strong point of this resort is their ability to maintain a relaxed and serene atmosphere even though Playacar has gotten very busy in recent years due to the increase in the number of hotels. When you are on the hotel grounds, the setting made of water falls and pounds, and the exquisite tropical foliage creates a feel of tranquility that we have not yet found else where. We have been to other resorts in the Riviera Maya, such as Iberostar Paraiso Grand, Secrets Capri and El Dorado Royale, and although we found them of great quality and very enjoyable, our preference continues to be the Royal Hideaway. We enjoy the fact that all the restaurants are a la carte, and that they provide attentive service in a relaxed atmosphere. The menus offer a wide variety of choices, and the food is excellent and always well presented. We also enjoy the concept of villas, each with its own concierge. Special thanks to Cynthia for making this last vacation a true pleasure. We enjoy the soft music (mostly classical & instrumental) around the pool, on the beach, and throughout the resort. We appreciate that the activities are offered in a very discreet manner. We enjoy the fact that it is a small resort (only 200 rooms), and that there is no need to wear a bracelet :0) For us, all of this somehow makes this resort feel less of an all inclusive chain hotel. As many others have mentioned, the beach has suffered severe erosion in recent years which resulted in the lost of its charm. They are currently putting a lot of effort in order to control and restore the beach. Sadly, because of the numerous huge beach bags, long leisurely walks are no longer possible. Hopefully, they will find an appropriate long term solution to resolve this issue. To sum it up, even with the unfortunate beach situation and the population increase in that area, the Royal Hideaway continues to be our place of first choice for a vacation of rest and relaxation. In our opinion, the tranquil setting and high quality service places this resort in a class on its own.

Here's the lowdown: Grounds: Absolutely beautiful! The staff works hard to keep the grounds immaculate. Everyday we would see employees landscaping to help keep everything in tip top shape and it shows. Accomodations: I have to say, the room was smaller than I thought it would be. Although the bathroom was spacious, I found the countertop cramped and actually had to move stuff around and stack things so that I could comfortably fit my tolietries. I wish the bathtub were bigger, as it could really only fit one person and was about the same size as a tub you would find at your house. We stayed on a top floor and had valuted ceilings, which was really nice and helped make the room feel bigger. The bed linens were okay - not the best and not the worse. The doors to our balcony came unhinged twice during our stay and all we did was try to open them. Also, our balcony faced a neighboring resort that had mayan shows every night, so it could be very loud. My husband and I had to laugh as we were honeymooning but all we could hear was a live rendition of \"Living in the Wild, Wild West.\" However, if we closed the balcony, we couldn't really hear it as much. Also, our balcony overlooked the service road, so we saw employess hustling and bustling throughout the day. Despite these minor inconvinences, we still enjoyed the room a good bit. Plus we were on vacation, so I wasn't going to let these little things bother me. Staff: Very helpful, they are willing to get and do anything for you. Some people said they tipped, but we never did. We came to all inclusive so that we would not have to worry about money. Plus, we paid almost $1000 a day to stay there, so we felt comfortable that some of this money was being passed on to the employees. Maid service: Ours was hit or miss. Sometimes it would be great, other times not so great. We would go to dinner every night around 6 or 7 and return around 9 or 10. Sometimes the turn down service had not been performed (this happened at least 3 nights) while we were out, so it was a little inconvienent when they wanted to do it after we had returned. One night they didn't give us any clean towels and left the dirty ones in our room??? So I had to go into the maid's closet next to our room and find new towels. Also, she would sometimes do stuff like leave a random extra box of tissues by our bed??? I think she was just having an off week or something. I told the concierge about it and he apologized and was quick to try to fix the situation. Another thing that kind of bothered me was they never put the maid cart up. It always sat in the hall right beside our room. I'm not trying to be picky, but I just don't want to see a maid cart full of supplies and garbage bags everytime I come and go from my room. Concierge: He was great at getting us movies, scheduling dinners and tours. He did forget to restock our fridge one day. I also asked him if I could have flavored water which the resort did not keep on hand. He told me he would make special arrangements to get me flavored water and stock it in our room, which he never did. I didn't say anything to him, since it wasn't that big of a deal and I was fine drinking other beverages. Food: We really enjoyed the food at the resort. We tried all 5 restaurants and the dinner theater. Our favorite was definitely Palazzo's, the Italian restaurant. We ate our first and last meal there. Our second favorite was Las Ventana's, then Azia, followed by the Grille and lastly, Spices. We also enjoyed the snack bar for lunch during the day and the poolside service was WONDERFUL! Breakfast was great too, and we alternated between the buffet at Spices and the formal sit down at Las Ventanas. Drinks: Very good - there was nothing to want for. The poolside service was always prompt. They anticipated your needs and even walked around with trays of frozen drinks just offering one for you to try. My favorite was the San Francisco and my husband's was the Blue Hawaii - so good! Spa - very nice - my husband and I both got a massage and the employees were very professional. It was nice to enjoy the sauna and steam room too. I also got a facial. All services were very relaxing. Activities - We went on a snokeling trip which was a lot of fun and only about 2 hours and $35 a person. The boat left on the beach right by the resort which was convienient. We scheduled it through the concierge and heard about it through another couple at the resort we had made friends with. We also went on a day trip (12 hours) to Chitzenza (I know I am spelling that wrong). It was fun if you are into history and the mayan ruins - which my husband really is. He loved it. The tour included a bus trip and lunch at an authentic mexican restaurant in route, as well as breakfast on the bus. Bars - We went to both bars at the resort. They were both fun and I would recommend going. We didn't want to do it every night, but it was fun for a nice change of pace. We went to casino night and it was okay. You played with fake money and met other people at the resort. We were both usually so full from dinner we just wanted to go back to our room and lay down! LOL! Beach - Yes the erosin is evident, but we didn't let it bother us. We actually like sitting on the beach bags and taking in the sun and rays - they didn't bother us. But you couldn't walk down the beach very easily. We did climb over some of the bags to check out the other resorts, but they weren't worth much. It was obvious that Royal Hideaway was of a different league. We even witnessed our staff escort people away who were obviously not staying there, which was nice. It was usually a family that was trying to hang out by the pool and their kids were trying to get in the water. Don't get me wrong, I like kids, but I chose Royal Hideway for the adult only factor. They had a staff member whose job was to just stand there and keep people out who were not staying there. Pool - We loved the chairs by the pool, as they were padded and very comfortable. We didn't have any problem getting a chair. Normally we would go to breakfast and drop our stuff off in a chair, which didn't seem to be a problem. Half of the week we used the beach beds which were my favorite! We didn't have a problem getting one of those either - usually at 10 am there were still some open. I prefered the ones on deck by the snack bar, as you could still sunbathe there (the others are shaded by trees). Also, these had a killer view of the ocean and were close to the food (only drawback, you were not allowed to order food in the beach beds). Pure paradise! Overall, we LOVED Royal Hideaway and didn't let the minor hiccups take away from our honeymoon. There are going to be problems everywhere you go. What matters is how you deal with those problems. I keep a screen saver on my computer at home of the view of the ocean from the beachbed to remind me of what a wonderful time we had. We will definitely be back - we've already made plans for our 10 year anniversary. :) If you are looking for a wonderful, relaxing, intimate vacation, Royal Hideaway is the place!", "Date": "April 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "SF Bay Area, CA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Destination Resort\u201d", "Author": "omeeto", "ReviewID": "UR14722046", "Content": "I think this resort can best be described as a great \"destination resort\". In other words, if you want to go somewhere and never leave the resort, this is the place to go. If you want to try to use it as a base for a lot of activities, it might not be the best ROI (you will not be able to take advantage of the food/drink you already paid for). I classify observations about the resort as \"Things within the resort's control\", \"Things out of the resort's control\", and \"Things technically in the resort's control, but unlikely to change\". 1 - Things within the Resort's control - 1.a - Service - For the most part, we found service to be quite excellent. Everyone tried very hard to attend to our needs and get whatever we wanted. As described in other reviews, you are given champagne and cold towels upon checkin, and you are shown to your room and the grounds. The bellmen were excellent, giving us ideas of things to do right away. Throughout our trip, we did experience some \"inconsistencies\", where we had to repeat requests for things like extra hangers, and where our room service order was a bit off. It seemed that it was not due to lack of \"effort\", but that some staff were simply not experienced. In other cases, we had very high levels of service .. such as a waiter showing up out of nowhere to ask us if we wanted a drink while we were sitting at one of the resort's benches. Again, they have a large staff and they are obviously \"trained\" to provide 5-star service, but some are just not that experienced. 1.b - Food - As with most other reviewers, we found the food to be excellent. Ventanas is indeed their signature restaurant, although I think the big distinguishing feature is the service and presentation (much quieter, more formal, etc.). The food is great at all the restaurants (we did not try Palazzo's or the Dinner show). The only slight drawback is the timing - Ventanas and Spices are closed on Sunday nights (and I think Tuesday .. although we were not there on Tuesday), so you really have to plan your restaurants carefully. We liked Spices a lot because it had the Mexican flair we felt like having. Note that only Spices and \"The Deck\" (the poolside restaurant) are open for lunch, and that the restaurants don't start dinner service until 6pm. 1.c - Grounds - The resort works hard to keep the grounds clean. There were a couple of quick rain showers that came through while we were there, and within minutes of the rain stopping, staff were using mops to dry out the walkways/staircases. 2 - Things out of the resort's control 2.a - Beach - There are indeed large sandbags that cover the beach. Yes, they are unsightly, and yes, you do get used to them. All the other resorts have these as well. It seems like a unified effort by all resorts would be required to get a sea wall of some sort built a few hundred yards out. It is true that if you are looking for a really wide sandy beach, you might want to look at a different resort. 2.b - Distance from Playa De Carmen - From the map, we thought we would be able to walk easily to the downtown from the hotel. Indeed, it is probably only 2-3 miles, but since the beach has been eroded, it would be hard to go all the way up on the beach. The sidewalk would probably be not too bad, but we did not try it. If there were some specific walking trail, it would have been handy .. but again, this is out of the resort's control ... if you want to take advantage of the \"Playa de Carmen 5th Avenue\" shopping a lot, its a point to consider. Its about $5 one-way by cab. 2.c - Other resort noise - Indeed, as noted by some other reviewers, the resort to the south of Royal Hideaway is exceptionally noisy. They seem to have daily \"spring break\" like activities like pool racing, etc. So you hear this \"announcer\" on a mic shouting about what to do and who won. They shut off promptly at 11pm, so its not really an issue at night .. but they do have these activities for most of the afternoon. 3 - Things \"technically\" in the resort's control, but seem unlikely to change 3.a - Villa design - the Villa design is quite interesting ... all opening to the center where the is an open air courtyard and the \"villa concierge\". This design is actually a bit noisy .. we heard some folks slamming doors early in the morning and could hear houskeeping moving around. They could probably improve this by using better (heavier) doors or some sort of sound proof retrofiting. There is also no elevator. This was not an issue for us (we actually requested top floor because it has vaulted ceilings), but is something to consider. 3.b - Room condition - The rooms are very nice and decorated well. All marble throughout, with a separate shower stall and jacuzzi tub. Also they have nice ceiling fans and sliding wooden-paneled doors over to cover the windows. But it is true that they shown signs of wear. There are rust corners in some of the windows, and the windows themselves are a bit old. Nothing really seemed out of the normal \"wear and tear\" for a beachfront hotel, but my opinion is that an overall retrofit is in order. Again, the walls could be thicker .. we could hear when the groundskeeper drove by in his golf cart ... 4 - Other things to note - 4.a - The Concierge Villa is more of a \"resort butler\" then what you would consider a traditional \"concierge\". They are tremendously helpful to the comfort of your stay - you cannot even enter your room without them seeing you from their desk and saying hello. They fill your mini-fridge with whatever you want, help you make dinner reservations and, each night, give you a daily printout that reminds you of where you have a reservation and what the next day's activities are. However, their ability to recommend off-resort activities seems to be a bit limited. They do work with the on-site travel agent on tours, but we were a bit mis-informed about ferry and island details when we wanted to take a day trip to Cozumel. Don't get me wrong .. they provide a great service, but for proper setting of expectations, it is important to note that off-resort activities are outside of their expertise. 4.b - Another thing to note is that the resort seems to take away all the poolside chair cushions at sunset. I think this is to make sure that they are all cleaned for the next day, but if you want to sit by the pool under moonlight, it can be uncomfortable (we would grab a couple of towels .. they keep the towel table quite fully stocked .. but it is not the same as a cushion .. I am pretty sure that if we asked someone to bring one out, they would .. but we did not want to act that pretentious ;-) ) 4.c - They have many great \"downtime\" activities in the afternoon ... like Mexican arts and crafts and scuba diving in the pool. These were perfect for calm relaxing times, and fit the bill of what we wanted. If someone wantsmore of a \"nightclub\" and party atmosphere, this is not really the place ... this is compounded by the aforementioned lack of walking-distance proximity to downtown Playa de Carmen. All in all, we found service to be very attentive and the resort well worth the money. You had to \"try\" a bit to get all your money's worth .. During our day trips, etc. we obviously were off resort so did not get to eat/drink what we had already paid for .. this is probably something that helps them make a healthy profit. If we stay here again, I think we'd minimize leaving the resort and just enjoy the poolside service and restaurants.", "Date": "April 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bronxville, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat service, lovely hotel and small (but nice) rooms\u201d", "Author": "MrsDougherty", "ReviewID": "UR14641339", "Content": "This hotel is beautiful -- well-kept gardens, gorgeous lobby and restaurants, and nice pools. The standard \"luxury\" rooms are small (about 350 square feet), but are very nice and very clean. The service was also great -- everyone was eager to please. The concierge for our villa was always helpful in making arrangements, the servers at the restaurants were eager to please, and we were never left without a drink while lounging at the pool or beach. I was a little worried about the quality of the food and drinks I would find at an all-inclusive resort such as this one, but was pleasantly surprised. The food at every restaurant was great and the quality of the liquor/wine was very good. Our favorite restaurant was Palazzo and our least favorite was Ventanas (which was somewhat hit-or-miss -- my husband's food was disappointing while mine was great). We did really enjoy having breakfast at Ventanas (highly recommend the French toast) as it was far less busy and far more relaxing than the buffet. I've seen some reviewers complain about not being able to get reservations, but we just had our concierge make all of our reservations for the week when we checked in and didn't have any trouble (you just need some flexibility in terms of what time you want to eat, as you may not always be able to get the 8 PM reservation you want). I've also seen some reviewers complain about the bags of sand on the beach, but they really aren't that much of an obstacle. Unfortunately, the beach was devastated by the hurricane and the resort has to use these bags (which are working very well) to restore sand to their beach. I actually enjoyed the \"wading pool\" created by water trapped on the beach side of the sand bags. So, no, it's not ideal to have these bags around, but they are necessary to restore the beach. The reasons I give this resort a 4 rating instead of a 5 are (1) the size of the rooms (too small), (2) the noise at night (most of it from the neighboring resorts), and (3) the large groups that seem to frequent the resort. The hotel does a fairly good job of keeping things quiet on its own grounds, but the loud music from the adjoining resorts is very annoying (especially if you're just looking forward to a quiet night on your terrace or want to go to sleep before midnight). There also seem to be a lot of large groups (corporate events) that stay at the resort (there were 2 different corporate \"takeovers\" of the resort while we were there). It's just annoying to encounter 50-70 people in the lobby / at the pool / etc. It makes the resort less upscale in my eyes and certainly less relaxing.

I will say that they did do a lot better job of this than most of the nearby resorts. That said, the ocean was really too rough the entire time that we were there to be swimming. They have five restaurants to chose from for dinner, two casual and three formal. The food was excellent in each of them, and they are decorated in a very high standard.

This we did through Eva, the customer service representative, and we found her helpful and obliging. Due to her efforts, our stay ran like clockwork and we encountered no problems at all. The staff were all so helpful and enthusiastic and would bend over backwards to oblige. We were fortunate enough to have the services of Ricardo in Villa 25 and we all loved his enthusiasm and can-do attitude. The housekeeping staff were also excellent and did a wonderful job decorating our room for the birthday festivities. Both our daughters were with us in different rooms in the same villa and they too felt the hotel is just wonderful in all respects. We had dinner in all the restaurants and they all exceeded expectations. Most days we would get together in Spices for lunch and we were always given a sincere welcome and great service. We cannot speak highly enough of the hotel and can hardly believe the few negative reviews we've seen lately on this website. It is true that work is going on to try and restore the beach but we never found this hindered our stay and the hotel has tried very hard to correct the unfortunate after-effects of Hurricane Wilma. The pools are also a great alternative to the beach and there was something for everyone here - our young loved the big, main pools and we enjoyed the smaller and more secluded pools - and the hot tubs there. So all in all, it was a first class experience in a first class hotel and we hope we can keep returning to enjoy it in the years ahead.", "Date": "March 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cThe Perfect Place to Relax\u201d", "Author": "Baileyponey", "ReviewID": "UR13917968", "Content": "Having just returned from a 7 night stay at the Royal Hideaway, we want to share our experiences. We read Trip Advisor and it was a big help in making our decision of where to stay. This is a small resort in comparison to most others in the area. It is the perfect place for peace and quiet and it has a sophisticated atmosphere. The resort was not full during our stay, which was to our advantage. Service is prompt,a big staff on hand, the waiters, pool boys, and hotel staff just want you to be pleased. We did not wait long for anything, drinks & food come quickly poolside or on the sand, be it water or alcohol. Fun \"drinks of the day\"! Fresh fruit kabobs, cold towels and a face spritzer are offered as well. They will bring you anything off the menu of The Grill during the lunch hours. There are plenty of poolside & beach chaises. They fill up fairly fast in the morning but empty out in the afternoon. We didn't use a beach bed, there are several on the grounds. If you want a cabana on the beach just ask and it is delivered & set up quickly. We ate at all the restaurants. Spices,for breakfast, offers a \"buffet\" which is so much more, omelets and eggs cooked to order, it should please everyone. The view outside on the deck is spectacular. You can eat inside at Las Ventanas, an ala carte breakfast, choices are more limited, excellent as well, just a more formal atmosphere. Spices served great shortribs for dinner! The Grill for lunch is good, shrimp cocktails, fish tacos, wraps, salads, etc. They frequently have a barbecue set up by the pool, so you can have something different than the lunch at The Grill . We enjoyed Azia, the Pan-Asian restaurant, excellent sushi, spring rolls, salmon, a fun and pretty place. Easy to overeat there. Las Ventanas (with a piano bar) is beautiful, the food is innovative (due to the two star Michelin chef) and delicious, the turbot and filet are wonderful. We ate there twice. If we had anything to do over again, it would be to skip the Mexican show (did it for the \"culture\"). It was ok, the meal (their only true buffet) we did not care for. We would get another dinner in at one of their other great restaurants. The Italian restaurant has had great reviews, it was good, but we've had better in other cities. Service, however the food is (which has to do a lot with peoples tastes and willing to try new things) is top notched, no matter where you eat you don't even have to put the napkin on your lap! Most of the food choices are very interesting, and nice to have dinners in beautiful places and cooked to order. Go to tea time-it's not just tea, it's champagne, wine, flaming coffee drinks, chocolate desserts, tiny sandwiches, an enjoyable outdoor area to cool off and get a little something before dinner, all while listening to the saxophone player. We had no trouble booking into restaurants or changing later. (You should ask to book all nights when you meet your concergie the first time, can change later). This can be a problem at other all-inclusives as we heard from a gal at the airport. Security at the resort is excellent. We observed them approaching beach walkers if they wandered up too far, as we would have expected them to do. We are the only resort in the area that doesn't require wristbands, easy to spot the people who don't belong. I would have worried more if I would have seen people just walk in and keep going! We paid for this security as well as all else. They give you a daily paper with the events for the coming day. There is a little nightlife, karoke contests, a Studio 54 set up at the Allegria bar, etc. We can't say how many people attend as we were usually too tired ourselves after hours on the beach. It appeared that the pool and poolside activities were popular. Room service is 24 hours, prompt and polite everytime. The luxury rooms are more than adequate, separate shower and tub and double sinks. Yes, some probably need a little updating, which is not unusual for any resort. They have marble floors, double sinks,separate shower & tub, plenty of hot water, comfortable beds and pillows. Not once were we interupted for room cleaning. It was always done when we were out of the room, twice a day. The beach, yes, as all the other resorts have the erosion problem. If you have to you could still find a spot to swim, however most days during our stay were red flagged. Didn't spoil a nice walk on the beach at the waters edge. The sand is beautiful. white and soft. It didn't matter that the large sandbags were present, it is interesting if you see them filling one! The pools are fantastic, water clean, infinity edge pool delightful. There is plenty to do offsite if you want to. The Aviary is $20 and a 20 minute walk, beautiful birds in a small jungle. Playa del Carmen is a little further for shopping and nightlife, or a ferry to Cozumel. As has been said before on this site, this resort spoils you for any place else. Yes, you pay for it, but as the saying goes.... You just need to decide for yourself what type of vacation you are truly looking for as well as can afford. Large resorts far out number the small ones here, makes this place even more special. It was just what we were looking for. There is truly nothing horribly wrong with this resort.

Here are the findings after we came back: Service: The service meets and exceeds everything you read about. You are pampered from the moment you arrive until the moment you leave. It's amazing that only after a few hours, the people know your name. From then on, you are catered to either at the beach, in the restaurants or when you have any requests. The service we had was always friendly and professional. There is housekeeping in the morning and turn-down service in the evening. The housekeeping knows your schedule (probably through reservations and what the concierge notices) and works around your time. Restaurants: Each restaurant has a different vibe and menu, so you are treated to a different experience with each place. Las Ventanas is a sleek, chic restaurant with white furniture and dark accents. It has an international menu (ranging from fish to steak to ox). It also serves breakfast with an a la carte menu and is a great option because the breakfast buffet at Spices can get busy. Plus the menu is different and offers some great choices. Azia is an Asian restaurant that also has a nice clean look, but differentiates itself with Las Ventanas by having a muted orange, yellow hue to the lighting and decor. It's menu is Asian with a Teppanyaki grill or some Thai choices. Palazzo's is traditional Italian that has somewhat ornate decor and is very dark. The Grill is down by the beach and is similar to Las Ventanas with the white on white furniture, but with open walls to the outside, you get the feeling that you are eating outside which is nice. The menu ranges from fish to steak to shellfish. Spices is Mexican/Caribbean and is clean and colourful. The dinner menu doesn't seem to follow what you would think as Caribbean cuisine, but since I don't live there, I am not one to judge. Spices also serves lunch with a more traditional Mexican offering. Room: The room was spectacular. Very clean and had a number of amenities, including robes and slippers. AC and ceiling fans are in the rooms as well as your own balcony. Bar fridge is stocked repeatedly with whatever you desire (just tell your concierge). The shower heads could use a little updating, but otherwise, they were fine. Grounds: The grounds are amazing. They are always cleaned and taken care of. Each day there are a number of people who must work on them, but you don't see them much. They manicure the lawns and bushes. They remove coconuts from the palm trees if they are getting close to ripe. They do it all. Very impressive and relaxing to walk through them. We always enjoyed our slow walks from our villa to the restaurants. Spa: The spa is very clean and relaxing, but expensive. I was treated with professionalism and got a very nice massage. Go early to enjoy the steam room and sauna beforehand. You can take a shower there too and relax for a while before and after your massage. It's very quiet and relaxing. Beach: A lot has been said about the beach and I say honestly, that the beach is fine. There are sandbags, but after an hour, you don't really notice them. They are a necessity given the beach erosion that plagues the area. There are workers out there constantly making the beach better and each day it looks better and better. There is enough space for all the chairs and then about another 30 to 40 feet of beach until the water. There is plenty of room to walk around. 90% of other resorts south of Playa Del Carmen (but still in Playacar) have sandbags too. The difference is that the Royal Hideaway seems to be the only resort working on making their beach better. You can walk the whole beach, going by each resort and you can really tell that the RH has been successful in their restoration effort. The other resorts have sandbags, but don't seem to be putting in the same effort. The result is that the RH has room to maneuver around and the other resorts become chaotic with their beach chairs dragged everywhere. The beach itself is clean and soft. There are spots with shells, but the workers rake them out so there is just sand left. I was very worried about the shape of the beach, but compared to the other resorts around in Playacar, the RH had one of the best. Their efforts have made a difference. Pools: There are small pools around the grounds, but most people hang out at the two by the beach: the activities pool and the infinity pool. These happen to be closest to the bar too. Each chair is given a rolled up towel at the start of the day, so you don't have to bring one if you don't want. There is a hut close by if you want more towels as well. The pool service is great and you are never without a drink. From time to time, there is fruit and cool towel service offered as well. A very nice touch that goes along with the \"exceed\" part of the expectations. Other: There is some noise from neighbouring resorts, but that ends between 10:30pm and 11pm. Make your reservation in advance (a day or two) to get the timeslot you want. Email them to reserve a dinner place for when you arrive or else you might not get a timeslot that is preferable. Outside The Grill is a wood patio that extends along the beach and has some chairs and couches. It's a great place to hang out and have a drink or else go out after dinner and listen to the waves. Overall, it is a great place where you are attended to in every way and the only thing that you have to do is relax and enjoy. Yes, it is expensive, but you truly get what you pay for.", "Date": "February 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "oklahoma", "Title": "\u201cNot what we hoped for\u201d", "Author": "tulsagirlOklahoma", "ReviewID": "UR13603614", "Content": "Recently returned from the Royal Hideaway where we met another couple.

The overall service attitude was terrible, terrible, terrible. First we were told the nicest restaurants were full and we could't get in until our last night. On that night they closed that restaurant, cancelling our reservation-so they could move staff over to the show that evening. We were therefore never able to eat at Las Ventanas the nicest restaurant. The concierge messed up the reservation times on other evenings and we felt she was constantly trying to direct us to the restaurants that were less desireable. The food in the restaurants was mediocre. One afternoon they ran out of towels on the beach. The hot tubs were cool, not even warm and the staff was just not willing to be helpful. Oh, I forgot about the wakeup call which never came on the day we were to depart and the room service order which simply never arrived.

We went for a 5 day getaway, and regreted every minute of it. First, the room we paid extra for was not available and the only solution they could offer was to downgrade us despite the fact that the hotel was almost empty (as per their bell boy and the fact that most of the villas were shot down). The manager was rude, unaccomodating. The food was good, but the service was spotty: at times too overwhelming, at times rude. The beach was a disaster: sand bags in multiple layers (see pics) covering the entire beach; the only place to enter the water was to the right of the beach and that area was shared with a four star family resort (was a great idea for a couples only vacation!!!) Could not even walk on the beach due to it's disasterous condition. The brick wall overlooking the beach was under the construction during our entire stay with very easily excited working crew drilling and fixing it all day long. So was the selling point of the hotel, the terrace overlooking the beach. Upon check-out, we requested a letter reflecting the fact that our accomodations were downgraded so we could get refunded on arrival. Another manager was once again exceedingly rude and tried to black mail us into signing the letter saying that we were satisfied with the stay in return for the letter we needed. What a disasterous hotel! They must have paid a lot of money to buy all the \"awards\" they have on display in the hallways!

We\u2019ve traveled extensively for the past four years. It\u2019s become a hobby to go new places and explore. The Caribbean seems to be our favorite playground and with that said, the Royal Hideaway became our new favorite destination. Cancun\u2019s airport is quite nice. We didn\u2019t have any issues with it other than the time share people wanting your attention. Just keep walking. We used Best Day Travel for our transportation to the hotel. They were nice, friendly and efficient. The drive took about an hour. We were the first dropped off. Playa Del Carmen is amazing. There are not many discernable differences between it and say, Miami, only on a more quaint scale, for sure. Rich culture, beautiful homes, attractive shops and restaurants are everywhere. Take the time to explore. There wasn\u2019t one second on my entire trip that I didn\u2019t feel 100% safe. The resort is breathtaking. With out a doubt they have the most beautiful grounds I have ever visited. They are groomed, manicured, clean and simply amazing. Check in was a breeze and they towels and champagne are what is expected but they even take it up a notch. These towels, which you will see them handing out every where, are scented with the most amazing scent. I smile just recalling it. Every single worker I encountered was happy. Not once did I see anyone that didn\u2019t look pleased to assist you or be where they were doing what they were doing. I think that is a true testament to this resort. The room is nice. Marble everywhere. Spotlessly cleaned and well stocked with toiletries and amenities. We did face the \u2018loud\u2019 resort that people complained about but we never had any real issues with it. It wasn\u2019t THAT loud. It did impede our view a bit, but honestly, we didn\u2019t spend much time in the room. We watched a little television at night before we went to sleep and found adequate English speaking channels to occupy us. I loved the open air concept of the center of the building. Our concierge was always pleasant and consistently gave us practical advice. Housekeeping was also good, but I think I preferred the evening turn down crew to the early afternoon crew! As you know, nothing is ever perfect. I can say that about this place too but all the things not perfect are small matters to quibble over. The dining options are fantastic. We love food and consider ourselves \u2018foodies\u2019. We booked all of our reservations our first day and were able to get in at all the better restaurants as we wanted. Azia was my husband\u2019s favorite. He loved the sushi but I wasn\u2019t too crazy about my meal. I am not a fan of mushrooms and they seemed to dominate my dish, again, it\u2019s a small matter. Las Ventanas was excellent, as was the Italian place. I would skip the show and buffet. It seemed awkward to me and the food wasn\u2019t the best I have ever eaten. They even had to dishes set up awkwardly (for instance, the soft taco stand was not in a convenient place to the toppings). We thoroughly enjoyed the breakfast buffet every morning as I could get an egg white omelet prepared the way I wanted along with fresh fruit and cheese and bacon. Love bacon. The grill for lunch was great. The Cajun turkey salad was simply fantastic with beautiful field greens. Spices BLEW me away. I would have eaten there for every meal if I knew about it first. The lime soup is what dreams are made of\u2026\u2026drool Main quibble concerning service, and I have found this to be true at most all inclusive places, is the inability to keep nonalcoholic drinks filled. We drink boring iced tea, no sugar please, with most of our meals. Also, the pacing of courses took too long in the nicer places. It wasn\u2019t really a problem though, I was just always in a hurry to enjoy my outside time. Pool is pretty. There are lots of hidden ones for those looking for seclusion. People do play the chair games early around the pool. However, I prefer the beach and that was never an issue there. They do it with the Thai beds though and that IS an issue. Those beds are fantastic. However be considerate and move your stuff so other people can enjoy them too. That is what we did and it made some peoples day. The sand is perfect, the ocean water is the most beautiful shade, and I didn\u2019t have any real issue with the sand bags. I was very proud of how hard they are working to make the beach what it was. What I was not very happy about was the water temperatures in the pool and all but one Jacuzzi. Cold, cold, cold. They really do need to heat that pool and make sure the other, smaller Jacuzzis are at the proper temps. Also, while I didn\u2019t mind to beached whales (sand bags), I did dislike that the other resorts haven\u2019t made as much progress and due to that it is almost impossible to really have a long walk on the beach. I recommend letting your fantastic beach servers keep you well intoxicated (and believe me, they will) and just enjoy yourself. Another bit, we did tip. It felt like the right thing to do, but no one made me feel like because I tipped them I would get better service. I ALWAYS got great service. Even if we didn\u2019t do it, so don\u2019t feel obligated, but if you feel like it by all means do. If you want to explore ruins or something to that effect, check with your concierge for their advice. I wouldn\u2019t want to do a guided tour. We took a cab to Tulum and explored at our leisure. The activity directors can be a bit too peppy for me there. I prefer to be left alone and they try to get people involved and social with other people. The afternoon fruit cart and tea were highlights for us. Around four every afternoon we went for our snacks and coffee or champagne. The sax player was a nice touch and the seating there was divine. I am going to give this review a five star review. However, it really deserves a four and a half.

The food is excellent for an all inclusive and it really does not matter which restaurant you go to. They are all very good. We were a bit disappointed with Las Ventanas. I know it is the upscale restaurant at the resort, but the menu is extremely limited and you will need to order one of each course. Very small portions here. Azia, the Asian restaurant was excellent, as was The Grill at the beach. Spice's was also very nice for casual dining. I guess being an NY snob, I am spoiled with an assortment of fine restaurants but I was still quite satisfied. On the downside, the resort is definitely starting to cater to more groups and we had a rowdy classless group to contend with. One person in particular was extremely loud and annoying to pretty much everyone. I'm sure he would have been the perfect companion at a rock concert but not here. The business center is also in need of updating. The computers (4) run P3's and are very slow. Basically, crawling along. If you need to conduct business here, bring your laptop since there is adequate wifi signal throughout the resort. My suggestion would be to leave it home and just enjoy. You can walk into town in about 20 minutes and it's worth the trip. It is built up and safe.

We had never been at an all inclusive nor have we taken long crusies so that it was a new experience for us. We have however travelled extensively for many, many years. YES..SI...The staff is the best part of the hotel. Professional and Friendly. They make the experience extremely pleasant. The footprint of the hotel is actually very small with two adjacent resorts very in evidence. Although we did not find that the noise from the hotels next door that annoying, I think that it's ridculous for people to think that the RH is a quiet hideway when the tacky sounds come wafing over while you are at the pool. Enough has been said about the beach situation. Most of the rooms in the villas do not have any ocean view . Having stayed at the Manele Bay in Hawaii and the Anna Mandera in Vietnam, which also utilizes a garden villa arrangement with many of the accomodations not having ocean views ,the Royal Hideway is far inferior. The majority of the balconies are small with only two straight back small chairs and a tiny table. No chaise lounges and not private at all. The bathrooms are nice and having a walk in closet and plenty of drawer space is a plus. The bath amenties are high quality but average, not much better than a Hamptons Inn. Certainly not the 17 that you get at the Halakulani on Oahu.They do have a scale, which you probably don't want with all the eating and drinking you will do. But, you should weigh your luggage. American Airlines.really means 50 lbs. They also have this large shoe butler box in the closet, which seems ridiculous. Are you polishing your sandals? The rooms are an odd shape with a lot of wasted space. There is armoire which contains a small second rate old style TV (the remote didn't even have a sleep timer). The armoire also included a DVD, but in this day and age of large flat screens why you would even want to get a movie to watch on that TV is beyond me. There also was a small refrig which was stocked with soda beer and water. They seemed to figure out what you liked and stocked more of that. For us it was water. Again, the staff is very good....even those that you don't see. We had asked for coffee to be at the room each morning and it arrived promptly everyday. The bed was hard, the pillows not great, old fashion blanket in between sheets. In this day and age of fluffy duvets and great bedding in ** and *** hotels, this is not luxury. They also had this small alarm clock, without any kind of digital read...and it went off our first morning at 5a.m! Re Restaurants. You do have to do the reservations when you arrive but you can make changes, although this can be tricky because they do have some days when some are closed. We found Las Ventanes far and beyond the best...but....you have to be someone who wants, and is used to very inventive, creative cuisine. Las Ventanas would hold its own in any major city anywhere. Very sophisticated food. We had the tasting menu the first night that we ate there and it was terrific and had wonderful wine pairings with it. We liked it so much that we changed a reservation and went there for dinner again. We did not do the tasting menu and it was still excellent. One of the things that I found really second rate about RH was the wine selection...or should I say,.... lack of it. They basically had the same blanc de blanc and chardonnay at all the restaurants. The choices on reds was also limited. Although the wines were good you could get really tired having the same ones. They had wine lists and you could pay extra for a better selection but the lists we looked at only had very pricey wines. When we returned to Las Ventanas and I asked if we could have the white that had been used with the tasting menu they said that there would be an additional charge. This seemed nuts since they didn't charge extra to have the tasting menu. Considering that they serve top shelf liquor they could do a lot better with their wine choices. Have a sit down lunch at Spices. You can get a great piece of fish and excellent Mexican food. We thought the Grill was average, Palazzo was very decent but the first courses were far superior to the mains. Re breakfast, the buffet at Spices is average at best, They didn't serve any kind of smoked fish, and the cheeses were boring, no coissants or decent rolls. The waffles and pancakes looked awful...hey, you can make your own waffles at most Marriotts. The non buffet breakfast at Las Ventanes is fine, but nothing to write home about. The wait service however makes up for anything lacking in selection. We had a laptop with us. At the hotel in Cancun I was able to access from the room at a minimal charge. There are no port in our room for internet access at the RH. The hotel is \"wireless\". The conceige had the computer people bring some kind of wireless booster which sat right in our room but the access was still annoyingly spotty. The business center did have about 5 or 6 computer and I saw people using their laptops at the pool. We have traveled extensively and stayed at all categories of hotels and although this probably is as good as you get for an all inclusive it is not a 5 star facility. Don't get me wrong you will have a very pleasant time, as you probably will eat and drink far more than you planned to.", "Date": "January 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cStill Great\u201d", "Author": "CraigJ", "ReviewID": "UR12790979", "Content": "Just returned from a 10 day stay at the RH - we've been there several times, our 1st trip in Nov 2000 and 1st trip since hurricane Wilma.

It was our honeymoon and we stayed for 10 nights. From the minute we arrived at the hotel, we were led into the lobby of the hotel (which was gorgeous!) and given champagne as we checked in. Everything was always taken care of...anything we needed. We actually had forgotten to take a bag from the airport and our concierge made all the arrangements and while we sat on the beach, she located our bag and got it to our room. I would definitely recommend making your reservations when you get there, if you care what time you eat. We just took what was available and didn't stress about it. We actually ended up changing some of the reservations because we loved certain restaurants so much. To be honest, the food here is INCREDIBLE. I have stayed in all inclusive hotels and nothing has ever compared to the quality of food that you at the HIdeaway. The staff was phenomenal. They were always so helpful and always willing to get you another drink if yours was looking a bit empty. It is a smaller hotel and if you are looking for a quiet and relaxing time, this is the place. We took a walk down the beach and let me tell you, the second we arrived back at the Hideaway we were relieved. The other beaches from the other hotels on the strip were crowed and loud. We are young, but on our honeymoon, this was exactly what we were looking for. The Hideaway makes you feel like you are on your own private island! The room was amazing. We had a room with a view of the ocean, on the top level of our building. There are numerous buildings of rooms, only three levels high. If you can score a top room, I would recommend it. You have cathedral ceilings! And the bathroom was beautiful. All marble. No doubt the HIdeaway leaves nothing to be desired about the rooms... I would recommend getting to the pool and beach earlier rather than later, but there was always a seat no matter when you went. It just depends on whether or not your develop a preference for a specific spot. Oh and do bring money for tips. You don't have to tip the waiters every time, but, they do take care of you more if you give them something to thank them every once in a while. They are all so nice... In all, this was a phenomenal location for the most wonderful honeymoon. We can't stop telling people how fabulous this place is. Everyone that was there while we were there were either honeymooners or couples looking to getaway. The crazy thing is most of the people who were vacationing there had been to the Hideaway numerous times. Once you experience this place, you won't be able to go anywhere else. We are already planning for our next trip. I hope these comments help! Oh and if I were you, I would arrange for a private transfer from the airport to the hotel if it is your honeymoon.

My husband and I honeymooned at this resort in 2006 from August 28-September 4. It was the perfect, relaxing honeymoon that one could ever ask for. Just to give you some background info: both my husband and I (in our mid-late 20's) have traveled pretty extensively thus far in our lives, so we are a little harder to please, having been on many vacations together in our 7 years as a couple. This is by far one of the best vacations we have ever been on. RESORT: The resort is smaller (I think a little over 200 rooms) and divided into villas. Each villa has their own concierge service that will cater to any need you have. The resort stands out from the others next door and hearby bar far! It is classy, upscale, and meticulous compared to the others nearby. ROOMS: My hyusband and I got a basic room and we couldn't have been more pleased. It was cleaned daily, stocked with plenty of towels, and the bed was very comfortable. The balcony/terrace area was over sized and because of the shape of the building, each terrace was very private. BEACH/POOL: The infinity pool was absolutely amazing, but what we liked best was the decks right below the infinity pool. If you got lucky, you could snatch up one of the 3 or 4 \"lower decks\" with a hot tub, 2 lounge chairs, and a table. These were the located in between the beach and pool, so access to either one was central. The beach itself was also amazing---soft sand and crystal clear water. There were waiters coming around constantly to wait on you hand and foot for snacks and drinks. RESTAURANTS: Being very accustomed to fantastic food my whole life (I reside in Long Island, NY), our standards are always very high. The restaurants here are by far the best we've ever experienced at an all-inclusive resort. Our 3 favorites were as follows: PALAZZOS: This was a great Italian restaurant that we ate at 2 out of our 7 nights. The view overlooking the Caribbean is amazing, as is the wine and the food. My picky husband loved their feduccini al fredo and their chicken franchese. Truly exceptional! AZIA: Trendy Asian restaurant where you cook to order. You felt like you were in a NYC-style restuarant, and the food was amazing! THE GRILL: We also ate here 2 out of 7 nights. This was by far our favorite. It was located right alongside the beach/ They had fantastic dinner and dessert options, and they had a Mariachi band playing one night and a piano player the other night to spice up the ambiance. We were more than pleased with our lobster and filet mingon. One a side note, the homemade salsa and chips (and guacomole) is a MUST TRY!!! It will spoil any Tortilla chip you ever have elsewhere! We had these 2-3X a day while lounging at the pool or our room. SERVICE: Above and beyond! Truly felt like a queen and king while on our honeymoon! Aboslutely anything you asked for was accommodated., SPA: My husband and I got a couples massage indoors while we were there and we thoroughly enjoyed it! OVerall, the resort is gorgous. Perfect for a RELAXING vacation. Not too much nightlife going on, but in town you can find more \"jumping\" nightlife. This is more a relaxing vacation spot, with some things to do at night, but mostly nothing too much going on.

We loved the size of the resort (under 200 rooms) located in various villas. This was the first time we did not have an ocean view as the few that they offer were all pre-booked. But it really didn't matter because the view from our 3rd floor balcony was gorgeous, including the sunsets. We were amazed at the elegant food presentations in all of the restaurants. Service was supurb as was the quality of the food and beverages. Our room was beautiful and housekeeping did an excellent job. Everything was restocked on a daily basis. This resort has 2 pools -- one with an infinity edge, and the view from the infinity pool to the ocean is fantastic. We had lunch everyday overlooking the ocean and the food was outstanding! The entertainment director was phenomenal, also. While there is not a lot of nightlife on the grounds except at the Allegria Bar, we had a great time dancing several nights. We also had a terrific time playing bocce ball on the beach everyday. I think this resort is ideal for honeymooners who want a nice quiet atmosphere and older couples who just want to relax and be waited on hand and foot! All of the staff was very friendly and there were not any language problems. If you wanted to experience more nightlife, you could go into town. We were happy to just dance, drink and relax all week. We were asked to fill out short questionnaires after several meals at different restaurants, and we felt that Occidental must really care about what we think! The only negative is that our building's concierge, who can book all of your dinner reservations for the day or the entire week failed to mention that there are two evening dinner/shows that we could have gone to and also that lobster is served once a week at one of the restaurants (the Grill, I think) for a slight upcharge.

It has a great view. Afternoon tea is perfect for a tiny afternoon snack. One other complaint we had was the way people save pool seats. People get up early, throw a couple books down on the lounges, and sometimes don't come back for hours. I don't think it's fair to the people who are stuck w/o a chair for the rest of the day.

We were travelling with my mother who has mobility issues and we had no problems. There are elevators to all the main areas of the hotel and ramps right down to the beach. This resort would be very suitable for someone confined to a wheelchair. Negatives - I would say that any negatives would not be a \"deal-breaker\" if you are considering this resort. The beach has suffered some damage and the sand bags are an eyesore. However, the service at the beach and pool area combined with the overall beauty of the place more than compensates. There is some noise from surrounding resorts and this may be an issue for light sleepers and people that want total peace and quiet. It is not \"offensive\" - you just hear music from the neighbouring resorts at night depending on where you stay . Food - the restaurants are outstanding . It is like dining in a fine restaurant every night of the week. Food is a very personal thing though and it may not suit everyone . The choice and diversity is certainly there and dining every night is a true occasion. This is NOT a resort for people that like non-stop entertainment.

The pools are amazing and you are given cool towels and fresh fruit. Basically, if you want lunch by the pool or beach they will bring it to you there as well. My husband and son learned how to scuba dive while we were there by very well trained gentlemen. They loved it. Tennis was excellent, my son had a wonderful lesson and learned alot. Golf was perfect. Bring lots of ones$ and remember to tip. These people work so hard running around to make sure you are happy.It isn't said that you have to tip, but being a resturant owner, it is just a way to show your appreciation. It goes a long way... They have afternoon Tea in the lobby with sandwiches and champagne or mexican coffees that they flambe tableside for you. Housekeeping was just terrific and as was the turn down at night. Our family just loved the whole place, had a very relaxing and fun time together. We will make this our Thanksgiving destination every year from now on. One thing we noticed was we were staying in Villa 24, our villa was quiet at night. Don't get a villa close to the RUI resort unless you want to hear lots of loud music very late. You can request a certain villa before hand. Villa 24 is closest to the beach and to the bar.

After moving into a new house and planning a wedding, we needed a place where we can go to unwind and be pampered. The Royal Hideaway fit the bill. Upon arrival, one can see that the facility was well-maintained. It was a beautiful property. You can see staff members working all week to ensure that the grass, trees, and bushes were manicured. The staff was extremely friendly. Every hostess, waiter, entertainment coordinator, and concierge called you by name. We took advantage of the spa facilities a few times during the week. The spa facilities were beautiful and inviting. Each villa had their own concierge!!! When we arrived we were introduced to our villa's concierge. She was responsible for meeting our every need. If we needed to make our restaurant reservations, needed more bottled water in the room, or to book an excursion, our concierge was there to help. She was like our villa's personal camp counselor. The pools were beautiful, however the beach was in the middle of renovation. It seems that the hotel lost most of their beachfront last year When we were there (Nov. 17 - Nov. 26), the beach was still under repair. However, employees did say that they would be finished in the next 3-4 weeks. If you are looking for an \"active\" daytime, the Royal Hideaway is not for you. Although non-motorized water sports are included (and motorized are available for an additional fee), there was nothing much to do except relax by the beach or the pools. This was fine for us, but others may be bored. There were 2 entertainment coordinators who ran activities like water aerobics, but it was the same CD each day they did it . There was no variety. The afternoon activity schedule was pretty lame. (ex. - bocce, spanish lessons, napkin folding), but as I said, if you are looking for something active to do, like beach volleyball, it is not available at the Royal Hideaway. Evening activities were not much better. Although the two dinner shows were well-done, the activities such as karaoke, casino night, and salsa night were pretty basic. It was nothing exciting. The restaurants were very classy. The hosts and wait staff went out of their way to make sure you enjoyed your experience. We felt the food was very good, but there needed to be a bit more of a variety. Although each restaurant had its own theme, they still served the same basic foods just with different sauces. We highly recommend the Dinner for Two on the beach. It was amazing!!! We had 2 staff members serving us. When we went, it was a beautiful night and a full moon. It was an unforgetable experience. We recommend that you book it for the middle of your vacation to leave time for a raindate. Another couple we spoke to got rained out. Overall, we would highly recommend the Royal Hideaway for those couple who are looking for a little rest and relaxation.", "Date": "December 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "PA", "Title": "\u201cAll The Good is True\u201d", "Author": "ScottJD", "ReviewID": "UR11096871", "Content": "I couldn't say it better than Mica Puppy.

The first was five years ago to celebrate our Honeymoon. The first time there we were absolutely in awe of this place. The condition of the resort was first class as well as the food and service. We truly felt this was a 5 diamond resort. This time....not so much. Although they are constantly working to keep up the condition of this resort, we felt it was showing it's age a bit. Not quite as clean and pristine. The food this time had changed drasticlly for the worst. We had one outstanding meal at Las Ventannas and several ok meals at the other restaurants. The service once again was top notch everywhere we went. This next comment is for the hotel management. Whatever you are paying Mauricio and Cynthia, triple that amount! Those two are the most valuable assets this resort has going for it. They both are warm, friendly, caring people that went out of their way to make us feel comfortable and entertained. As most reviewers will tell you, the entertainment is not what this resort is all about. But Maurcio and Cynthia certainly made the best of what they have to work with. We had fun with them, enjoyed their company and personally miss them. We would come back just to experience these two professionals again.

We were joined by a pair of our best friends who too were celebrating their anniversary. What a great time we all had. While there is no doubt that the RH is a 4 star and not a 5 star resort, do not let that influence your decision as to whether to go to the RH. The food: RH's breakfast buffet at Spices is very good. Isis the waitress was always there to take good care of us and the drinks that the bartender makes are fantastic too. Best part of the breakfast buffet is by far the French toast with chocolate sauce and bananas. Surely your dietician will be proud. The other option for breakfast is at Las Ventanas. Its al la carte and the service was ok, but nothing like what you get at Spices. Lunch is either eating poolside, snackbar or again at Spcies. We recommend eating at the snackbar and having Reyes as your waiter. Reyes is a funny, witty man who is willing to bring you stuff that is off the menu. He pushes the tequila hard (as does everyone at the RH) but since your on vacation, be sure to indulge. For dinner, we sampled each of the restaurants. We were very impressed with the Italian restaurant and las ventanas. Stay away from Spices for dinner, unless of course you want to visit Eduardo who was by far the best waiter we had during our trip. The Room: We stayed in a standard room and our concierge was Ricardo. Everything you have read about Ricardo on this site is true! He is a great concierge and was always there willing to assist us in dinner plans, tee times, spa treatments or trips to beautiful Wal Mart and Xel-ha. The room was nice, but not amazing. The bathroom was large and there is plenty of room in the closets. Nightlife: Everyone going to the RH knows that you aren't there for a spring break partyfest. However, Mauricio and Cynthia really are great. Nightly activities range from karaoke to trivia nights to singing in the piano bar. They both get everyone involved and having a good time. One highlight was a rock and roll band played one night in the allegro bar. The main attraction there was this bongo player who beat the drums like no one we'd ever seen before. He was simply amazing. I forget his name, but trust us, you cant miss him. He rocks! Other advice: 1) Not a big difference between the infinity pool and the pool right next to it. Thus, no need to set an alarm for chairs but do put something down before you go to see Isis at Spices for breakfast! 2) If you are looking for an ocean to swim, go somewhere else. The sand bags are a downer. 3) Bring bug spray! There are mosquitoes everywhere at night and we were eaten alive 4) Stay away from Playa del Carmen at night. Not much going on here, don't waste your time 5) We did not see either show, but peered in once to see what it was like. Other than a great bongo drum player (see above), there is not much going on at the show, so don't waste your time. 6) 12:00 noon = water aerobics with Mauricio or Cynthia!! These two have more energy than the Energizer Bunny. They go all day at the pool and then till the week hours of the night! They are so enthusiastic about their jobs, its great to see. 7) Sushi at Asia restaurant is not great if compared to the better sushi dens of the major cities in the USA. Also, while we sat at the hibachi grill, the chef was not interested in a show. His only interest was cooking. So if you want a show, go see Mauricio or the bongo drummer! Service is 4 star and not 5 star. But then again, the prices are more reasonable than the 5 star places in Cabo and include all the tequila you can drink Bar is top shelf. That means Don Julio Resposado and Grey Goose for all!! If your taking a round trip in a cab, the cab driver will probably stay and wait for you for little or no charge. We went to Xel Ha and the cab was $45 each way. For an additional $10, the guy sat there all day until we were ready to go home. In all, we loved our time at the RH. We wouldn't recommend it for honeymooners, though we see many there. We saw the most of groups of married couples and we believe that this is the perfect was to experience RH.

Overall we loved every second, but there were a few things that we would consider not up to par with a 5 star hotel. Check in: Very nice, we were handed fresh towels and champagne right away. Being our honeymoon, I emailed the resort and so did my travel agent to request a villa in the center with a inner facing room so avoid the noise from neighboring hotels. With that being said, guess where they tried to put us. After the whole the resort is so full speech, the were able to find us a perfect room in Villa 25. Rooms: Our room was immaculate, the housekeeping was perfect. The bed was okay, nothing great, but nothing to compain about. Spacious with a separate bathroom area. Our villa concer. was Ricardo, he was very nice and helpful. Spa: I specifially wanted a treatment at 8am the day after our arrival since I tend to sunburn the first day and get to sore. I tried to make an app. before we arrived which they would not let me and insisted they would have something available. They were booked the whole day, but I was able to get something at the time I wanted the following day...It was soooo worth it. I think her name was Rosa and I got the Royal Experence massage....AMAZING!!! Pool and Beach: The pool chair game was in full force. We slept in and just grabed any chair that was open the first few days, but decided to play along with everyone else the last few. Both pools are very nice, so its really not a big deal. The beach was a bit small, but still beautiful. They are getting a barge of some sort in the next month that will allow for a much much bigger area. Pool water was FREEZING, but the ocean was perfect. The staff at the pool area was amazing. They are all so friendly and attentive. We tipped quite a bit, they were always working so hard. Food: Lunch we thought left much to be desired. The snack bar served typical burgers, qusadillas ect. I like to eat relitivly healthy, and thought there was next to nothing to chose from. Spices serves lunch too, It looked better, but all mexican choices, not my favorite style cusine. The Guac and salsa they serve was outstanding, so I would often fill up on that!. Dinner: The grille: Our favorite, wonderful manager, and servers. Simple food and the most romantic setting. We went back 3 nights!! Azia: Pretty good. Nice atmosphere. They should add more sushi choices, they just have 4 rolls and are very basic. We both liked out dinners alot and returned again. Las ventanas: Beautiful, but to fancy for us. SMALL SMALL portions, so order each course. Everything was tasty, but we left hungry. Great service. Palazzios: Very nice, but too dark inside. Menu was good so was the service. Small portions as well, and believe me we are not big eaters. Spices: we did not go, not our favorite cusine. The restaurant is in a perfect location, right on the beach. Beautiful inside. Bars: Very nice, but gets loud at night. We thought we had the noise from other resorts to worry about, but they were quite compared to allegro. They had a band or loud music playing until 1 for about 5 nights. it might have just been our villa location, but you can hear it clear as day. So much for going to sleep early!

Well I think we chose well....it was absolutely fabulous. Yes its at the top end price wise but its most definitely worth it in our opinion. we stayed here from 1st to 15th October. Where should we start...I suppose from the moment we landed in Cancun airport (after 10.5 hour flight) we were treated like royalty. We had a very swift transfer in a mini bus...just us so no other stops en route which was great. We were met at the hotel by the bell staff - Manuel was lovely, very welcoming and took us immediately round to reception where cool towels and glasses of champagne accompanied a very efficient check in procedure. He then showed us down to our hacienda villa (we were in Las Tulipes No 25), which although at the top end of the hotel was in a central position so it was peaceful and we had a view overlooking the water features and tropical gardens. Manuel remembered us and every time he saw us around the hotel he greeted us by name. We had one of their basic luxury rooms, upstairs on the second level with a vaulted ceiling. Well if this is basic then its fine with us. We had a huge very comfortable bed in which we both slept like logs (clean sheets every day); very well appointed bathroom and a great balcony area. We could not fault it. The room was cleaned every morning and then again at night during the turn down service. The staff were absolutely amazing and couldn't do enough for us. Our villa concierge was Rosalia...well what a lovely lady who again was at our service every day from 8 till 5. To be honest we didn't need to use her an awful lot but she always had a cheery smile and greeted us by name. Of course you have to pre book all your meals via your concierge but to be honest this isn't a big deal and we had no trouble getting the restaurant or time of choice. We were also able to change bookings with out any trouble too. I think the hotel was fairly quiet our first week there though. The restaurants are all very good. We ate in all of them whilst there; our favorites being Las Ventanas, Azia (sitting at the Hibachi bar) and the Grill. We ate in las Ventanas on our actual anniversary evening, the staff knew and our dessert came out with a congratulatory message piped in chocolate around the plate!! Palazzo was also good but Spices was better for lunch than evening in our opinion. Breakfast was very good in Spices (buffet style) and for extra style the a la carte breakfast in Las Ventanas made a lovely change. We experienced the Mayan show in the theatre which was ok but the food which was buffet style was disappointing - its about the only thing in the whole 2 weeks that we wouldn't recommend. Afternoon tea at 4pm was a little luxury you have to try... listening to the saxaphone whilst eating bite size sandwiched and cakes is a real treat. We tried room service too and this was excellent....although a limited menu it was good, well cooked and presented. Evening entertainment consisted of 2 bars...the relaxed, chilled piano bar, and the more up beat Allegria bar. On the whole we tended to spend a relaxed evening eating a nice meal followed by a drink and then taking an early night. We were early risers as I don\u2019t think we fully adjusted to the time difference from the UK, so went down to breakfast at 7.30 most mornings. The pools are fantastic. We never had any trouble getting a sun bed, even by the infinity pool on most days. And although the Thai beds were popular we were able to use these too if we wanted. We did end up by the other pool sometimes but to be honest its no big deal. The pool snack bar staff are constantly wandering around asking you if you require any drinks or food......they were all so attentive and friendly. You could ask for anything and they would make it. I tried many drinks that I have never tasted before and enjoyed most!! And the pool concierge staff - Mauricio, Cinthia and Claudia are great too. they arrange all the day time activities (water aerobics were great with Mauricio), help with putting up parasols and generally attending to your every comfort. They come around with cool towels, cooling spray and yummy fruit skewers 2 or 3 times a day too. We also met the resident pool wildlife....Pancho and Margarita are a pair of iguanas who live right by the pool. They seemed completely non plussed by all the guests and regularly tucked in to lettuce and fruit supplied by the waiters or guests!! Unfortunately the beach is under attack from the Caribbean. Since Hurricane Wilma and more recently Dean they have lost a significant portion of it which is a real shame but you cannot defy nature and despite some heroic efforts with huge sandbags they seem to be losing the battle. This isn\u2019t to say though that its not a nice place to sit. It is...there are plenty of sun beds with shades and it was lovely swimming in the warm turquoise waters. we had some rough weather whilst we were there and some days it was too choppy to go in but on the whole we swam in there most days. Playa Del Carmen is a short taxi ride or 40 minute walk away - its got a fairly big shopping centre and bars etc, plus the ferry across to Cozumel. we only walked in once to buy a few souvenirs and have a look round... that was personal choice. There is a small shopping plaza just 2 minutes from the hotel in Playacar itself for immediate necessities and this was all we needed really. I really could go on and on about this marvelous hotel. I am sure that for those travelers who have experienced other 5 star hotels and commented on here how this hotel is not up to their expectations there may be faults; but we can honestly say we have never stayed anywhere like it and couldn't find anything negative.

If you are looking for relaxation, good food, excellent service, and happiness, this is your spot. Check-in: so smooth, welcoming, and simple. I wanted to check in again every day! Accommodations: My husband and I stayed in a 1st floor junior suite in Villa 29 (Las Azucenas). Our villa had no more than 24 rooms. The room was exactly as it looks on the hotel site.: beautiful, clean, and elegant island decor. It was spacious enough for us to stretch out, store baggage, and not feel like we were going to fall over one another. I loved the bathroom layout (shower closet, whirlpool bathtub (standard sized tub), plantation doors). Our \u201cRoyal Memories\u201d package included Bvlgari amenities and the super soft Royal Hideaway robes to take home. When we walked into the room, it felt like they really were happy to have us there and they were ready to attend to our every need. If you get a 1st floor room, try not to get one with the service path in the rear; it can get a bit noisy as they are transporting items to/from various locations on the site. Oh, the room veranda was also great; but go for a 2nd floor room with a hammock. Dining: I would definitely recommend dining on the beach as the highlight of the dining experiences (included in our package). I also recommend the breakfast buffet at Spices. The wait staff (Alphonso, Victor, Salvador, Jaime and hosts Cynthia and Marisol) at the restaurants were great and ensured that we were fine. The attentiveness by the staff was not annoying, but they will ask how things are going and pay attention when you even look like you have a question. Concierge This was the very reason our stay went smoothly. Antonio was the concierge for our villa and he made it happen! He ensured we remembered our dinner reservations; reminded us about various features of our package that we had forgotten/not scheduled; and gave us sincere recommendations. Service: I can't say enough how well this resort shows attention to detail; from noting the occasion of our visit (5th wedding anniversary), to the turndown service; to ensuring the room was welcoming every time we returned. I loved this. In fact, everyone knew our names pretty much every where we went. Beach at the Resort: For relaxation, go no further than sitting on the beach. There were plenty of lounge chairs and cabanas. The pools are steps away from the beach. The beach wait staff never forgot about us and there were activities when we were ready. I liked the bocce ball and the pastry/craft lessons offered by the staff. Shopping: Royal Hideaway is close to the little town of Playa del Carmen (5 minute taxi ride; 20 minute walk). If you want to pick up some souvenirs (with little authenticity), go to Fifth Avenue (Avenida Quinta) and negotiate - do not pay full price for anything (unless you want to). I picked up some nice hand-painted tiles for our kitchen. The various store owners will call out to you to buy stuff (though I was not bothered by this because they were not aggressive or rude). Do not buy anything at the resort shop; the items are available for much less from Avenida Quinta vendors. There was also some artwork at the resort and off of Avenida Quinta \u2013 be ready for $300 (USA). Airport: Nice airport, but stay away from the resort peddlers at the exit. Go straight out the door to the shuttles or to the shuttle counter. The peddlers look very official; the airport allows them to have space near the ground transportation. They are not mean, but know that unless their official name tag says the name of a ground transportation company, they work for one of the resorts. Entertainment This is not a \u201cparty\u201d resort; it is for simple activities, relaxation, excellent service, and food. The Mexico Fiesta at Club Royale left a lot to be desired; you won't miss anything if you skip this. If you want a bit of the authentic Yucatan, take a tour. We went with the Cancun Line tour company on an excursion to Chichen Itza and it was nice; included food, and souvenir shopping opportunities. In fact, other people we met said their off-resort tours were great, especially the tours to Xel-ha and Tulum. Guests The resort had several other couples, a few girlfriends groups, but that was about it. We never had any problem with noise from the folks at this resort (though you may hear a party at one of the two neighboring resorts at night).

We really loved the hotel, the excellent and friendly service as well as its tropical kept grounds but in our opinion the hotel has one weakness... We arrived at the resort and were immediately greeted by the friendly bellmen who took directly care of our luggage. We were brought into the lobby and sat down with the receptionist for the check in. One of the bellman brought us moist towels and a refreshing glass of sparkling wine (the Mexican sparkling wine they serve at the Royal Hideaway is outstanding and much better than many Champagnes). We checked in and were brought to our villa. We stayed at villa 24 which is right at the pool and next to the Occidental Allegro Playacar. We didn't hear any noise coming from the pool or the neighboring resort. Our concierge was Margarita and she was with everything very helpful and attentive. I read in several reviews that people were complaining about the mattresses... well I can only say that we slept very well and enjoyed that the mattresses weren't too soft. The room itself was really nice and clean. Almost every morning we ordered cappuccino with the room service. The room service is fast and the cappuccino heavenly! We had breakfast at Spices and Las Ventanas but preferred Las Ventanas. You can't sit outside and don't have the beautiful view like you have at Spices but everything at Las Ventanas is freshly for you a la carte prepared and with the service during breakfast you fell like a King/Queen. During our stay we got really lucky because the hotel was only about 40% booked. We never had to fight for any loungers/beachbeds and were able to get a beachbed every day. The pool service is good, waiters were walking around constantly to take orders and serve you drinks and snacks. It didn't matter how crazy your drink order was and what kind of liquoire you requested for your drink - they were always on top of it. The food at the SnackBar was really nice. Try the Acapulco Style Shrimp Cocktail or the Veggie Wrap - both are really yummy. Tea Time! You have to try it. Almost every day we had tea time and it was fabulous. That was for us the highlight of the day and nothing was more relaxing than sitting there, having a cup of tea/coffee or a glass of champagne being surrounded by unbelievable friendly staff and listening to the sax player. You can choose between a wide selection of coffee, tea or just enjoy a glass of the nice sparkling wine. The Mayan-Coffee is wonderful and its amazing to watch how it is prepared. They serve you little sandwiches - which were ok - and also small pastries which were fantastic. Dinner... Azia and Palazzo were our favorites. The service and food were outstanding! Spices is nice, food is good and again wonderful service! Our worst dinner experience was at Las Ventanas. We think that this restaurant - THE flagship restaurant of the resort- is a real weakness. In every restaurant we ate the restaurant manager came to our table at least once a night to make sure the service and food exceeded our expectations. Not at Las Ventanas. We made 3 reservations for this restaurant and the food got worse from night to night. We even tried to switch our last reservation but unfortunately weren't able to. The waiters at Las Ventanas are doing an awesome job and are so friendly and attentive (try to get a table with Eddy) - again above and beyond our expectations. The manager in contrast is quite disappointing. One night my husband and me ordered the same main dish - seabass. My husbands fish was cooked perfectly but mine was raw inside. We sent the dish back with the manager (it just happened that he walked by our table without saying hello or anything). He assured that we will get a new piece of fish right away. The second piece of fish came, it was charred outside but again raw inside. The manager didn't came once to our table to make sure that the second piece of fish was ok. One thought came directly into our heads: Hell's Kitchen... it wouldn't hurt if Gordon Ramsay would teach the chef a bit about cooking and he could bring Jean Phillipe along to teach the manager how to be a good Maitre'D. That night we left the restaurant quite disappointed. But when we stepped outside we realized that the show in the theater was still going on. We went to see the end of the show and as soon as we got into the theater Gustavo - the manager of Spices - greeted us very cordially. He offered us directly 2 chairs and asked us if we would like something to drink. Gustavos absolutely pleasant conduct made up for the bad experience we just had and we asked ourselves why the manners of Las Ventanas manager are so poor?!?!? The all inclusive wines which are offered at dinner are really nice. We are wine lovers and really enjoyed the Montepulciano as well as the Chardonnay. We had a look at the wines you could purchase but thought that these wines are overpriced. Entertainment... Daily activities are offered at the pool area. Try the aqua gymnastics with Cinthia and Maurizio - it's lots of fun. Cinthia and Maurizio also rock at night as they organize the night entertainment at the Bar Allegria. Casino Night, \"Studio 54\" Night, Salsa lessons etc. both of them are just wonderful, always in a good mood and making sure that you have something to laugh. Thanks guys, you made our vacation even better!!! We loved hanging out at night at the Bar Allegria. Again fantastic service and absolutely nice and friendly waiters. Also to mention is the main concierge Juan. He is very attentive and cordial and always making sure that everything is ok.

To be a 5 star resort, I expected to have a extremely comfortable bed and the food to be the finest. I did not experience that. The restaurant Las Ventanas was pretty good but you must make a reservation. Our trip was designed for us to relax and unwind before the birth of our second baby, but we were so tired and uncomfortable every morning after tossing and turning on that bed. When we left Mexico we were more tired and exhausted than before! Overall, we felt that the whole Cancun/ Playa del Carmen area has become overly comercialized and expensive. We probably wont be traveling back to that area again. We've traveled to many other exotic places in South America that were less expensive yet exceded our expectations in beauty, comfort, and food quality and were at the most 4 stars.

The beach although smaller, but is still fairly nice-the ocean is beautiful and the staff are very nice -but again up keeping- not as good as previous years-there were empty glasses from previous days left on the beach and no cleaning of the seaweed and sand as previous years. Again, my husband and I pretty much put up our own cabana everyday-where as previous years staff was always willing and ready to do so. Our villa concierge was never really around-not a big deal since we really didn't need his/her services-but when we did need him to give us a new key for our room(ours stopped working mid week) he totally dropped the ball. I would think it would be a priority-never the less we were able to use our 2nd key card without difficulty.

We stayed September 13th through the 20th. It was a little more expensive than some of the other resorts in the area, but well worth it. They really try to pamper you here. From the moment you walk into the lobby, they hand you a cold refreshing towel in one hand and a glass of champagne in the other. This was nice after the long morning of traveling. Then the ROOM, wow! Very nice rooms! One of the nicest I've stayed in, especially in an all-inclusive resort. The bathroom has double sinks, a toilet that sits away in its own little room so you don't stink up the entire bathroom, a standing shower and a bath tub with jets. Oh yeah and a walk-in closet with a safe. The room also has a king size bed and its pretty comfy too. The TV could have had a few more channels but its really no big deal. They do offer free DVD rentals, (we didn't rent any) but I heard the selection wasn't that great. You shouldn't be in the room that much anyway!! The maids were great, your room gets cleaned 2xs a day and they leave a treat on the pillow! Our villa concierge was Manuel, he was very nice and helpful. We gave him $50. on the 1st day. He didn't really do that much. He booked our reservations for dinner each night, our excursions, and got us a taxi when ever we needed one. They offer compilmentary shoe shine and they iron 2 articles of clothing for you when you arrive. We were under the assumption that he would be ironing our clothes everyday so that is why we tipped him so well. Manuel was very friendly and offer to help us with anything we needed. The POOL area is also very nice! It was very hard to get a spot by the infinity pool. We didn't the entire week. Who wants to get up at 8am to go reserve your spot? That stinked. I noticed that there were towels on alot of the chairs by the infinity pool that were not in use. There was no problem finding a spot by the activities pool which is right behind the infinity pool. If you do get a spot at the infinity pool its nice because there is an entrance to the water right below your chair. If you don't you have to walk all the way around to the side, which can be hot on your feet. They also have about 4 relaxation pools around the property. Some of them are heated and some aren't. You can also night swim which is nice. We didn't because my husband was sick of swimming. But it looked like fun, there was never anyone in any of those pools. The beach is nice but alittle to rough for us. We cut our feet quite a few times on rocks. We enjoyed the pool better. But whatever floats your boat. They had the beds on the beach too but they were also always full. We thought the service by the pool was overall pretty good. We maybe had to get up 3 or 4 times the entire trip to go get a drink at the bar. It didn't bother us to get up every now and then. They also serve food by the pool or you could eat at the snack bar overlooking the ocean under a umbrella. We tried alot of things on the menu and they all were very good. We liked the pizza alot and the chips and guacamole and the chicken quesadillas were also very good, and the shrimp cocktail was good. I could go on and on. They were our favorites. Also don't forget to try the drink \" Riviera Maya\" it was very good and it looks like the mexican flag. Very tasty! OH and the mojitos...... OMG!!! The best mojitos you will ever have, made from fresh ingredients, sometimes they would run out of mint but it never took them long to get more. When they are out of mojitos try the \"carapiedene\" (I probably spelled it wrong). It is also very good and made from fresh ingredients. The FOOD: AWSOME! We only had one bad thing and that was the crab enchalada appitizer from Spices. That was the only thing we ate all week that we didn't like. Our favorite restaurant was The Grill. We like the food and the service there. The manager Oscar is very nice and will always remember your name. We ate there twice. The surf and turf grill was excellent. Our 2nd favorite was Las Ventanas. We also ate there twice. The tuna steak was great and so was the chocolate desert! The wine selection at all the restaurants could be a little better but it was ok. I liked the Shiraz. The chocolate martini at Las Ventanas was great!!! And so was the lemon drop martini. Try them! We also liked Spices and Palazzo. We didn't eat at Azia. Like I said we only ate one bad thing the entire week. Room service was good too. We would have liked to get eggs for breakfast instead of the continental breakfast that they offered. The breakfast buffet at pices was really tasty and so was the a la carte breakfast at Las Vantanas. You better be prepared to EAT if you stay here!! Theres not much to besides eat and swim and drink. They feed you so much its hard to get drunk. We were a little confused on tipping, I know they say tips are included but when you recieve such good service you feel the need to tip. So we left around $5-10 for dinner and $3 for breakfast and lunch. They do work very hard and they do a nice job. I noticed some people tipping and some weren't. We went to the Allegra bar once, it was corny. We didn't really like it. The bar by the pool was open on some nights but only til 10. We liked that bar the best. The piano bar was nice, but they played the same songs over and over. We booked the royal romance package which included dinner on the beach, which got rained out and we tryed to reschedule but couldn't. We were a little bummed about that, that was the reason we reserved that package. But we did have a nice dinner at the Grill that night with champagne. But it still wasn't on the beach! We also got chocolate covered strawberrys and a bottle of champagne on arrival, and 2 robes to keep. We were disappointed about the dinner,we payed extra for that and they didn't even try to reschedule it. We went to 5th ave. There are alot of shops and resturants there. We rode the ATVs, swam with dolphins at Delphinius, snorkled and jet skied.Jet skis were over priced $65 for 1/2 hr. and they cut our time 5 min short.The Dolphin swim and the ATV excursion were alot of fun. We really enjoyed the ATVs. Its about 4 hours long, they take you to feed monkeys and other animals andthey take you in a cave with bats and to a swimable lagoon. That was our favorite.We went snorkeling through the hotel, I wouldn't recomend it, unless your a beginner.They do offer scuba lessons for free and they even certify you, we didn't find out until our last day, otherwise we would have taken advantage of it. All in all we had a fantastic time at the Royal Hideaway! I will definately be returning to this resort! It was a fabulous honeymoon!

The staff can not do enough for you- from anytime I made a call and being greeted by name, to a midnight request to the concierge- everything was greeted with \"my pleasure\". My 15yr old son was badly sunburned and had a acute bout of pain/itching around midnight- I phoned the concierge hoping that the closed hotel sundry shop carried benadryl- they did not; however, the concierge arranged to have staff member go out to a pharmacy and purchase the medication for us and hand deliver it to our room less than an hour later.

We had a great time at this top-notch resort and I just want to touch on a few points. The Resort- The grounds of the Royal Hideaway are immaculate. From the moment you step foot on the property, it's easy to see why so many people love this resort. Both the buildings and the grounds are very well maintained. The Room- Our room was the standard luxury room. We tried to upgrade to one of the suites at check-in since we were honeymooning (we even took our marriage license), but were told they were unavailable. Our room was very nice with marble floors and a comfortable bed (not like the reports from other Mexican resorts complaining of hard beds). It was cleaned twice daily and our mini bar was also restocked daily. Our only complaint was with the room location. Our travel agent had specified a room in one of the villas on the inside of the property due to noise issues I had read about in other reviews. Instead, we were put in one of those villas that faced a neighboring resort. At around 10:00 every night, they played extremely loud music, ranging from Michael Jackson to something that sounded like a sacrificial ceremony. This would usually last well over an hour and was a little annoying if you were trying to sleep. I will say, though, that the sounds died down after midnight. After speaking to our very helpful concierge, we were transferred to one of the inner villas and had no more noise issues for the rest of our stay. The Food- The food was very good at all of the restaurants. We especially liked the Snack Bar for lunch and Palazzo (Italian) for dinner, although the Grille was also good if you are a steak-eater. I wouldn't worry about making reservations before arriving at the resort unless you are going to be there for only a few days. Our concierge arranged all of our reservations our first day there. I would recommend trying all of the restaurants once if you have never been and have enough time. The Beach- Sure the beach has eroded over the past couple of years from various hurricanes (per one of the resort workers), but it's not really a big deal. When I was selecting a choice for our honeymoon, I almost chose another resort over the Royal Hideaway because of the beach situation. I'm glad I didn't. The beach bags aren't that big of a deal and it's easy to just walk right around them. The water is unbelievably beautiful and I didn't run into any gigantic rocks in the ocean like you might find at other Mexican beach resorts. The only downside is you won't be able to take a nice stroll down the beach for now, but in the grand scheme of things, it's not a big deal. One of the workers did reiterate to me that there are plans in the future to expand the beach. The pool- The chair-saving tactics are often a topic of discussion. Everyone tries to get a prime spot at the main pool with a view of the ocean. It is true that people get there early in the morning, mark their spot, and then come back several hours later. I found on more than one day if I got to the pool before 8:00, I was able to snag one of these remaining prime spots. So, if you're wanting a spot at the infinity pool, my advice would be to get up early. No one seemed to have a problem with those marking a spot, going to eat a quick breakfast, and then returning to their spot. As a matter of fact, many people did this. However, it did seem rather rude for some people to claim their spot only to return after several long hours. My advice would be if you see a couple of chairs marked with only beach towels that haven't been occupied in a while, point it out to the staff. They were glad to clear them out and give us those chairs. In the end, don't fret over the chair situation either. The Staff- We found the staff to all be very helpful and friendly. Our favorites were our concierge, Luca, and one of our servers, Jaime. On that note, I highly encourage everyone to tip these workers even though it's an all-inclusive. They deserve the extra money and are very grateful. In conclusion, we thoroughly enjoyed our time at the Royal Hideaway.......including the food, the service, the resort itself, and our friends from Oregon we met on the last day.

We arrived at 7:30pm and I knew dinner was reserved ahead of time at 9 so we had enough time to get to our rooms and freshen up for a nice late dinner. I emailed the RH a few days before our arrival for a special favor and the best table closest to the beach at the Grill. The favor was a letter to my new wife and I had no expectations of it ever materializing as it was sort of a shot in the dark. Well to my surprise they did it! Our maitre'D Oscar greeted us from day one and throughout our stay he popped up at all the Restaurants we went to almost as if he was following us. He would call us by our surname and ask us how everything was. That is one of many royal treatments. Every day was magnificent from breakfast with the Caribbean Ocean in front at Spices to Dinner with an acoustic guitar played by what to me was an authentic Mariachi at the Grill. The resort is truly a couples experience and the staff go out of their way to make sure you are one with your mate. The pool (water aerobics) and bar entertainment was unlike other resorts that are geared towards sex and perversion. This place was classy. Again I will reiterate like the other reviews that this it is not a rock out with your **** out type of resort and it's best kept that way. I am 32 and I like to tie one on and party hard but for a honeymoon it was perfect. Breakfast at Spices was nice but the young lady hostess consistently got our surname wrong every single time and I would correct her and she would say oh yea sorry but she would do it every time we went there. She seemed to be the only one who didn't remember our last name. Our concierge Eva was pleasant but we never really used her services other than reserve supper times and book 1 excursion. As for answering my questions of where to dine in town or where to shop or what to do she was sort of aloof. Never making any suggestions and in the Mayan Riviera she could have sold us many excursions. Oh well no loss for us as we enjoyed chilling in the resort anyhow. Room service was awesome as it was quick and always on time. I would call for a wake up call and cappuccino at the same time and room service always beat the phone ring. The only down side was you can only order continental breakfast and no eggs or bacon or meat for room service. It was not on the menu but I never asked. I guess it wouldn't hurt to try. Housekeeping was sub-par as once again we only got 1 towel swan one night out of the 10. We must be jinxed with not getting that as we stayed in Puerto Vallarta last year and everyone else got a towel animal every day and we never got one although we consistently tipped 4 bucks a day hoping that we may get the one unicorn towel animal. On top of that our floor had a stain and there was the same plastic lid on the floor from the 2nd day until the last and we tipped 40 pesos daily. The 1st day I tipped 6 US $ then the 2nd $5 then after that 40 pesos every day. Boo for housekeeping. Don't get me wrong, turndown was fantastic. We should've tipped her instead as she deserved it. The beach was amazing even though it was not a long stretch or the fact that there were sandbags. I've been to nice beaches, this one was not even close to nice but it did not bother us one ounce. There was nice soft sand when you went in to the water and lots of it. The bar was nice as it had a \"jungle patio\" so you could sit outside or sit inside. Either way the air conditioning in the whole place was not very good. You could only cool off in your rooms. All in all it was a Royal experience even though a couple bad apples were present, it did not ruin the whole fresh fruit basket of a honeymoon. Would I go again? Love to but it's a maybe.

Champagne was provided upon our arrival and check in went smoothly. The room wasn't going to be ready for an hour or so but we were told to grab lunch by the beach. That, in my opinion ended up being better than simply going to the room first: chips, guacamole, beer, exellent main courses by a cystal clear sea. We requested a room on the 3rd floor as we heard they had vaulted ceilings. It was nice and worth the trek upstairs each time (plus you can work off some of the food and cerveza if you know what I mean). Luca was our conceirge and he was great. I loved how the room had a fully stocked mini-bar and a DVD player (we brought some DVD's from home and watched Simpsons episodes before bed:,). The bathroom, sink, closet shower, and jetted tub were all in a separate section of the room, it was almost like another room itself. The balcony was nice, however we did not use it much since it was so hot outside and the sea breeze wasn't as effective as it was on the beach. We loved the turndown service each night (they'd leave chocolate!!!!!). The breakfasts were great. We ate at Las Ventanas, which was a la carte ,most of the time and it was hardly crowded (perhaps people didn't know about it?). The food and service was extraordinary. The breakfast buffet at Spices was a good alternative. You could make your own omlette there and they offered \"brunch\" type items like tostadas and enchilada which was nice as we were often \"late\" risers on the trip (9-10AM). Lunches were good as well, especially if you liked Mexican food (thus I loved it and my wife thought it was ok). They offer the typical American food like burgers and philly steaks which were all very good, however, their Mexican cuisine is where they shined! We enjoyed having lunch served to us on the beach!! Dinners: a topic on its own. UNBELIEVABLE! I loved having 1.5-2 hours for dinner every evening, it was an event, we weren't rushed, it was always intimate, and the service was always perfect! Having several courses and drinks was so nice. We would have water, wine, appetizers, soups, breads, main course, and then finally dessert. By the end of the trip we learned to pace ourselves with eating so much early on and save room for the main course. All restaurants were very good, however, Las Ventanas and Palazzo were by far the best! We had 11 nights there and 3 of the nights we ate at Palazzo, 2 at Ventanas, went to 2 dinner shows, and each other restaurant once (we left the resort once or twice during our stay for dinner). Azia was our least favorite but we are not sushi fans. I'd recommend trying to get a seat at the Hibachi table (we missed out and that seemed like fun). The dinner shows are nice and since this is one of the few nightly entertainment offerings I would strongly recommend it since the food is great as well. Drinks were great but I forgot about requesting top shelf liqour until the second week. They will make you anything, with anything and have top shelf liqour available (Grey Goose)! Sometimes the service around the pool was lagging but it never bothered me to go to the bar myself and get one (I can only sit/lie in a chair so long anyway). There was not much night life and it seemed hard to meet people. We met one nice couple from a resort town in Georgia but we met them later during our trip and hardly ran into them. We went to the Allegria bar which had a nice outdoor section and once went to the Piano bar which had comfortable chairs and exquisite martinis. I'd recommend doing the tea time and trying their \"Mexican Coffee\" which has tequila and is excellent (even if you don't like tequila). We only got to tea time once as it is in the late afternoon and it is hard to leave the beach/pool area (thus it was never crowded). The hotel also has a business center with internet so we were there daily, it was awesome (although one of the four CPU's was out of service for our entire two week stay which seemed odd)! In terms of tipping, we left the concierge $10 at the beginning and end of our trip. We also left $2 at breakfast, $3 at lunch, and $3-$5 at dinner. We would tip pool/beach servers usually $1per trip until we realized it hardly made a difference and saw one sever who did not seem appreciative. We did not see many others tipping so I imagine we were on the high end of the scale here but I have mixed feelings: technically tips are included so we really shouldn't tip anything (we are getting what we paid for). However, after the great service, especially at breakfast and dinner, you want to tip! We also left $10 for the housekeepers at teh end of the trip. Manuel, the bellhop was fantastic. He always greeted us, remembered our names and even had conversations with us about life in Mexico. We left the resort for cave snorkling at hidden worlds which was excellent if you like adventure (hiddenworlds.com, it is not offered by a tour company so we booked online and hitched a cab). We also went swimming with the dolphins and to Xel-ha. Playa Del Carmen was walking distance which was great. I did get Montezuma's revenge and Luca our concierge ordered me some prescription drugs which did the trick after 3 days. However, for four days I had major stomach problems. It could have been from having ice in my drinks at Xel-ha, from the Mexican dinner show buffet at Royal Hideaway (how long things were left out), or getting beef cooked medium at Palazzo. It was one of the three but just be on the lookout. Get your meat cooked medium well at least and be careful when you leave the resort! Oh and as for the sandbags- not a big deal. As for the pool chairs, during our stay if you were up by 8 you had pick of any chair. Around 9 most were taken by the main pool, the pool next to it had chairs available but they wouldn't be the ideal ones (didn't matter to us).

I will give an honest evaluation of our experience. However, others may have had a different experience. Nevertheless, let's get right to it! The drive from Cancun's airport is approximately 45 minutes. I would suggest taking a private car, otherwise you will be in a van with 8-10 other people and since Playa Del Carmen is so far away you will have to make numerous stops along the way to drop people off at their resort and vice versa on the way back to the airport. Just understand that it could take up to an hour and a half to get to and from the resort as was our experience. The driver of our van even stopped along the way at a convenience store to get a drink and encouraged the passengers to go in a \"buy something\" from the store. His brother must have owned it! Upon arriving we were greeted with champagne and cool towels. Once we settled up on the rental agreement with a representative they ushered us to our room. We had a standard (luxury) room and it was quite nice. The furnishings and decor were pleasing, however the location of our room was not the best. It was a ground floor unit toward the back of the resort. Right out our back door was a large cement wall that runs down the side of the resort separating it from the resort next door. Also, right out our back door was a path that the staff and maintenance crew uses to ride in golf carts which are loud and obnoxious at 7 am. We were then encouraged to make all restaurant reservations for the week. We had never been there before so we were unsure as to which restaurants to eat at more than once or skip altogether. Our favorite dining experience was at Las Ventanas, but all were nice. The food presentation is fantastic and the taste is satisfactory. By the 4th or 5th day our stomachs were not very happy, but we made it through. Also, understand this, there is not much to do at night other than dinner which is ok because dinner is going to take at least an hour and a half. A couple of our dinners took 2 hours or more because of the length of time between courses. The best part of dinner for us was the ambiance. Live instrumentation and candle light made the dining experience very romantic. During the day there is much to do such as parasailing, kayaking, swimming, basketball, and even biking. We chose to just lounge on the beach and around the pool. This brings me to the most annoying aspect of this resort. The pool chair situation. People will literally get up at 5 or 6 am to simply go out to the pool and place their towels and books in chairs around the pool. They will return to claim their \"saved\" chairs after getting a few more hours of sleep. Pool chairs are at a premium because there are simply not many of them and by allowing people to save chairs in this manner it only makes it worse. We saw people in arguments over the pool chairs. That's no way to spend your vacation. The resort should post some guidelines about the use of pool chairs. Needless to say, we spent most of our time on the beach since we were unwilling to get up at 5 am and play that silly game. The beach was small and crowded. The water was a little cool but absolutely beautiful. The views are spectacular! The resort grounds are exquisitely manicured and is truly a beautiful environment. It is extremely romantic at night whether you are taking a stroll down the beach or sitting on one of the numerous benches throughout the property and visiting. Overall, the service is very good, though our private concierge didn't speak or understand English very well. No problem there though. I mean we were in Mexico. We would place our breakfast order at night and our breakfast would be delivered to our room at the time we specified each morning. We really enjoyed that. We would return and probably will at some point in the future, but 4 or 5 days is sufficient for us.

The resort was beautiful, clean, small enough to walk from the beach to the lobby in a few minutes---perfect! The open air lobby area is so breathtaking!!!! Food: WONDERFUL! I can't rave enough on how good the food was. We were both blown away by the quality of the food and the drinks. You want grey goose--you get grey goose! You want JWB, you get JWB! We loved the chocolate truffles for dessert at the Azlo restaurant!!!! This is not the food you would expect at an all inclusive resort! Rooms: We stayed in the basic room--it was perfect! Big enough for us to be comfortable, cleaned 2 times a day (with turndown service), always restocked the fridge with water and beer! And if you order room service, order some wine with it! Activities: Plently to do-Spanish lessions, scuba lessions, water aerobics daily (don't miss-Edwardo is the greatest!), beach games and make sure you venture to the activites area---lots to do there as well! Always music/fun after dinner at the Allegro bar. If you go to show,make sure you do the piano sing-along--so fun!!! Service-top notch! We tipped our concerage, bell man and all servers---we simply feel you if take care of them--and they will take care of you! And they did!!!!! They don't make you feel like you need to tip--but its appreciated! All-in-all....perfect place! We are already counting down the months till be can return! Perfect for a honeymoon or romantic getaway! Some of the reviews talk about the chairs at the pool--we never had a problem getting a chair at the beach or pool.

Our accomodations were perfect- we always like to be as close to the beach as possible and our villa was just that. We were on the top floor which had much higher ceilings than rooms on lower level. My husband and I had plenty of space (expecially in the marble bathroom). My husband was even comfortable in the jacuzzi tub in our room ( he is 6 feet). The resort is immaculate, we always saw staff scrubbing, watering, pruning and shining every inch of the property.

Cinthia at the activiity center, Gustavo at Spices/The Grill, Fernando at Palazzo, and others just couldn't do enough for you and it always seemed effortlessly. The rooms were very well maintained and the rooms were cleaned twice a day with turn down service. The resort was very clean, even the public bathrooms by the pool were constantly being cleaned. We ate at all the restuarants and never had a bad meal. Service was very prompt and friendly. Palazzo was our favorite, especially the night we ate on the balcony. Las Ventanas was also very good (piano and live singer nice touch), Las Ventanas was also very good for breakfast. The Grill also has excellent food and nice with the open air atmosphere. Azia was excellent and also fun to all sit around the grill. Spices has an awesome breakfast and lunch too. We went to the show on Tuesday night. Set menu which was good, and the show was good too, just nothing great, but it was a nice change. We also did the piano bar and Karoke which was fun. Edwardo and Marrisso are great entertainers they made the night a lot of fun. Live music outside Bar Allegria also very good and relaxing. The hotel has a policy that doesnt allow them to sit big parties together for dinner, usually no bigger than 6, which was very dissappointing, but they did the best they could to accomodate us. It was always handled very nicely. We used the spa once for massages, they were very professional. The massages were great. Nice pool by the spa too. The sand bags are a necessity, you get use to them after the first day. You can go over them or walk to the end of the bags and go in where the wave runners go in. Not a big deal. The Royal Hideaway has the nicest beach that you can check out for yourself if you take a walk down the beach. We all had a fabulous time.

While the restaurants, drinks, staff and service are great - we did notice more \"groups\" visiting the resort. Some restaurants were closed at various times - in order for the resort to host private parties. We also notice - primarily at the pool - alot of chair saving. The resort clearly has rules - if a chair is unoccupied for more then 20 minutes - the resort has the right to remove articles in order to accomondate other guests. This rule is not enforced - and the hotel needs to enforce this rule in fairness to all guests. Beach chairs are usually not an issue - plenty of them to go around. One distrubing aspect, my wife and I booked a dinner on the beach (extra cost) - signed the paperwork (covering cost) and at the last minute the hotel cancelled our reservation - stating they were overbooked - and Hotel Management did not authorize the extra table to be set. To top it off, our hotel account was charged with the dinner - and it took three different people to credit the account. All in all, the Royal Hideaway is a great couples resort - keep the groups out! Questions to the resort are answered timely when e-mailed via the hotel's website. The hotel should be concerned about other (new) competition in the area - and should pay close attention to detail and handling its guest concerns. PS There are many notes about the sandbags on the beach. All must remember the serious hurricane that hit the area two years ago (Wilma).

There were always plenty of chairs at that pool and we just turned around and used the infinity pool. Restaurants - Our personal favorite was Palazzo. We also liked Las Ventanas, The Grill and Azia. We did not eat dinner at Spices. Portions (except for Azia) are very small, however, you can ask for as much food as you want and they will bring it to you without a problem. We always drank wine with dinner (merlot) and had no problem with it. We only tried a white once or twice and that was also fine for us. We live very close to NYC and are used to eating at all the best restaurants. No, we do not consider any of these restaurants five star but for an all inclusive they are definitely upscale. Service is very nice and all the people try to make it a very nice experience. Breakfast is either a at Spices which is a buffet or Las Ventanas which is a sit down breakfast. We were OK with both of them. Lunch was at the snack bar, by the pool or at Spices. We either went to the snack bar, ordered by the pool or ordered room service. There could have been some more choices for lunch. Rooms are very well appointed and kept immaculately clean. Mini fridge was always stocked. We were in building #26 and it was very quiet. Our conceirge, Beatriz, was very nice, but we did not use her much except for dinner reservations and spa appointments. It was my birthday while we were there, and she was very nice in arranging a birthday cake for me. The private pools were just that. We found three of them (don't know if there were more) and there was never anyone at them. I don't know if people don't know about them, or it was just the time we went, but it was very nice. None of the \"hot\" tubs we used were hot!! It actually was very strange. They all said, \"caution, 104 degrees\" They were all barely luke warm! If you crave night life, this is not the place for you. Twice a week they have a show. We went to the Saturday night one and did not enjoy the show or the food (buffet). We cancelled the Tuesday night show and just went to one of the restaurants. Almost every night after dinner we went to the piano bar and had an after dinner drink and listened to the FANTASTIC piano player. They also had a singer. Other than that, there was the Allegria bar where something was going on each evening (karaoke, salsa, etc.). A little too loud for us, but fun anyway. Afternoon tea was nice. Champagne or coffee, little sandwiches or pastries. Mayan coffee is delicious. We never ate any of the sandwiches, because they appeared to be left outside without any refrigeration. The cakes were good and so was everything else. The business center was always available to e-mail home. Only once were all four computers taken. People do respect the fact that you are not supposed to be on there forever. Coffee is available in the center all day. The spa was great. We had a wonderful massage and everyone was extremely professional. Wished we had gone more! All in all, Royal Hideaway met all our expectations. I am curious though, I just read a review that said that everything was handicap accessible. There are many stairs up to Spices, and when we asked if there was an elevator, we were told no.

When we stayed two years ago it was an intimate, quiet resort which is what we found so charming. The vibe however has changed and the large groups have taken over. It's unfortunate that it has lost some of it's charm. Also while we were there the air conditioning in our room was broken for two nights. It was extremely uncomfortable and I got a different answer from our concierge everytime I asked for an update. We were not compensated in any way, not even an apology. The water in the shower constantly switched from hot to cold so we had to take quick showers or baths. Do not get the Royal Relaxation Package when booking your room. This package is a rip off and you only get an express manicure/pedicure, a 25 minute facial and a 30 minute massage. We also were supposed to receive a royal turn down service as part of the package. The only thing they did differently was draw a bath with petals in it. Had I not turned on the bathroom light I wouldn't even had noticed it.

Our room was beautiful. We hadn't been in the room more than 2 mins when the phone rang? We thought \"Who could this be?\" It was our conceirge (Manuel). He apologized for not greeting us upon arrival but he was another guest and invited us to his desk to set up dinner plans and any excursions we would like to go on. Manuel was fabulous the entire trip and really made our honeymoon special. Anything we needed he took care of it. As for the restaurants, we loved them all. Azia and Palazzo was our favorites, we ate at Azia two times. Our 1st night and our last. J'aime was our waiter at Azia and he was very good. He was unfortunately off for the night the 2nd time we went. We ate breakfast, lunch, & supper everyday for 7 days and only had one bad dish between the two of us in that period of time and even it was edible. I would say one bad dish in 21 meals is pretty good. Especially when you are having 2 appetizers, 2 main dishes, and 2 desserts for every meal.

Overall the grounds of the hotel are beautiful, the rooms are very nice, clean and spacious, the pool and ocean time was fun, and the food was great. But what made the experience was the amazing service this resort offers. I can't imagine it being any better. The workers seem very happy to be there and they are there for you. They make it seem as if you are the only guests staying there. All you have to do is ask for something and they bend over backwards to make it happen for you. They are very personal with you learning your names and continuing to call you by name your entire trip. We were very happy with the Royal Hideaway and give it a 5+ rating and would recommend it to anyone for a honeymoon.", "Date": "July 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201c2nd Trip not as great as the first\u201d", "Author": "sailfish85", "ReviewID": "UR8130432", "Content": "My wife and I had a great time, but I think it is time for a change. I will give you our pros and cons of our second trip. Cons: 1. We talked to some people from one of the groups at the hotel. Most of them had never been to an AI in Mexico. They seemed to think the service was slow and complained constantly. 2. The beach looked horrible. I realize the hotel cannot help the errosion problem, but if I spend a lot of money for a view and good service, I expect it. On the other hand, it was kind of fun to watch the drunk people try to navigate over the sandbags. Pros: 1. Miguel at the Grill was the best. Every waiter should take lessons from him. We never had to ask for anything (he anticipated every step of our dinner). Every time I looked up, he was watching our table (and the others he was serving). 2. We did not use the tour guide at the hotel, since last year we booked with the hotel's tour people and had a terrible time. We booked through Custom Travel for the tours we wanted. For example, we booked a fishing trip at Maroma Beach. We had a great time since we caught a 7 foot sailfish. 3. The food was excellent as usual. 4. The maid service was done twice daily. I would also like to add, the conceirge took notice of the times we left the room and coordinated the maid service accordingly. Very professional. Over all a great trip, but we need to find a place with the level of service of this hotel, adults only, no groups, less than 200 rooms at the hotel and with a beach that looks great.

I read Trip Adivsor religiously for about a month prior to our trip and was somewhat nervous of what to expect. First of all, carry on baggage is the way to go... getting your luggage takes forever and wasted precious beach time! Upon arrival, you are offered champagne and cookies as you check in which was great! You are immediately taken to your room and then we were off to the pool! I kept hearing about having to wake up at god awful times to get chairs, but we never had this problem. I was up by 8:30 every morning and had no problem getting chairs by the pool. The chairs facing the ocean (by the pool_do fill up quickly, but if you make friends with the pool staff, they will have your chairs reserved for you every morning. I suggest making friends with them the first day and tipping them then. Beach chairs were never 100% full. We had dinner at Las Ventanas(highly recommend the pasta appetizer as well as the potato appetizer), Palazzo's (recommend the halibut) and the Grill the first night (so-so, but a great view). I had no problem with the house wines as mentioned in previous postings... it's not the best, but a typical table white wine. You do need to request the top shelf liquor if that is what you are wanting and the pool area, towards the end of the day, seems to run out of absolut and grey goose. Definitely try the Miami Vice! We did see some people tipping a dollar for every drink they were brought, which they probably received quicker service, but for the most part no one tipped like that. We did tip at the end of the day for the most part if there was someone we felt deserved it. We did not use our concierge very much at all, just the first night to make our dinner reservations for the entire trip (which is a must)- it is very hard to get the time you want, and we ended up eating at 7:00 or 8:00 which is fine. You will find that at 7:00 most restaurants are empty as people tend to eat much later. The staff is great, very friendly although we kept to ourselves most of the time. My most useful review- for those that are in a wheelchair- this hotel is 100% accessible (except for the beach itself of course)- all restrooms, restaurants, etc. are entirely accessible. The food is okay, not the best i have had, but we are foodies and expected 5 star meals... not the case, but still very good. All guests are incredibly friendly and we did not have any problems with people being loud or obnoxious, everyone seemed to be on their best manners. The rooms do have very thin walls, so be prepared to be awake by 8/8:30 because of the noise in the main area of your villa and the people above and below you. All in all, a wonderful place! Not sure if we will go back since we like to visit different places, but we can see why people do! Oh by the way- definitely get the Royal Experience at the spa- German gave me the best massage I have ever gotten!

We also didn't mind having to climb over the sand bags to get to the ocean. We rented wave runners for $50 a 1/2 hour and used the kayaks for free. We also used the fitness center a few times and had no problems. Everyone was extremely helpful and treated us with great enthusiam. Our favorite restaurant was Azia. We ate there twice. At our first dinner at Azia I asked about the special. private rooms. We were told that anyone can sit there and if we wanted to sit there for our next dinner we would be able to.

One person who has never been to a top-of-the-line hotel may think that a 4-Star hotel is the most wonderful trip ever, while a person who has traveled regularly to high-end resorts would never even consider that same hotel. I have traveled extensively throughout my lifetime and am told that I have much higher expectations than most people. My travel perspective is based on trips to the Broadmoor in Colorado Springs, the Hotel Del Coronado in San Diego, the Breakers in Palm Beach, La Quinta Resort and Club in Palm Springs, the Arizona Biltmore, various Four Seasons, various Ritz Carltons, etc...I listed these by name so that other travelers can relate my experience with the Royal Hideaway with hotels/resorts that are considered very high-end. Does this resort deserve its 2007 AAA 5-Diamond status? Absolutely! We just returned from the Royal Hideaway last month (June, 2007). We selected the Royal Hideaway for our destination wedding after literally weeks of research and we could not have been more pleased. The words, \"all inclusive\" have always been synonymous with \"tacky\" to me. I have never stayed at an all-inclusive resort and was truly terrified of what this experience could end up being after hearing about other people's experiences with all inclusive resorts. For example, I was worried about being \"stuck with\" bad restaraunts (we're \"foodies\")and mediocre service for an entire week. Our trip to the Royal Hideaway has now set the bar for us when it comes to all inclusive resorts. We had stellar service, terrific (and very, very clean) accommodations, wonderful meals, and an all-around wonderful week at the Royal Hideaway. Our concierge (Ramon) was great fun and greeted us each morning with a cheerful hello and smile. We loved coming back to our villa (consisting of only 16 rooms) to tell him about our day's adventures (or laziness!). He took care of everything from getting my husband's wedding shirt pressed to contacting our wedding coordinator with a question to making reservations for dinner to booking our off-site excursions. He did it all and made our week very relaxing for us! Our family and friends stayed in different villas within the resort and their concierges were just as nice and helpful to them and us. For instance, our friends' concierge made dinner reservations for all of us for one night even though we weren't all staying in his villa and Ramon booked our friends' excursions even though they weren't staying in his villa. Everyone at the Royal Hideaway is so kind and they truly aim to make your trip a true vacation away from your normal life! The rooms were immaculate. We did not upgrade at all - we stayed in the basic luxury junior suite. It was definitely large enough for the two of us for the entire week. I did take some advice from someone off of this site and requested \"inward facing\" rooms for our entire group. We all got them and were very happy with them. You could hear the loud nightclubs at a neighboring resort late into the night if you stood by an outward facing room. Our balcony was very large - but given the heat and humidity - we did not take advantage of that. Our room was (obviously) cleaned daily but we felt that they went above and beyond what you would typically see in daily room cleaning - the room smelled clean each and every day (which can be difficult to attain in that type of humidity). The meals truly are gourment and deserve the raves that many people have given them. We enjoyed each of our meals but particularly loved Palazzo, Azia, and Spices. Many people had the attitude that Spices was not that great because it was casual and was open for breakfast and lunch each day, while the other restaurants were not. We had the best service at Spices and we went there twice for dinner. Their dishes were a bit lighter and their tortilla soup was amazing! One hint - they do make bananas flambe for dessert at Spices but make sure you request it when you put your order in - they run out of bananas early. The lunches at Spices are terrific and are a nice change from the run-of-the-mill meals at the Snack Bar. Palazzo was beautiful and the meal was fantastic. The server was much quieter than the servers at the other restaurants - but that was a nice change of pace for us. Azia is fun - but be sure to request seats at the Hibachi grill. We had our wedding dinner there and were put in the private room (no Hibachi grill) and then went back later in the week to sit at the grill. The food table-side is obviously better and we enjoyed our second meal there more than our first. I am not a sushi eater but my family and friends are and they raved about the quality of the sushi at Azia. Ventanas is a great adventure if you order their pre-selected, 6-course meal. If you are with a large group, try to request their private room - you will love it! The Grill was disappointing for us - but we met several couples who thought it was wonderful. I think it's a matter of taste and we tend to be more adventurous with food than most people and The Grill is exactly as it sounds - a grill. We did not make it to Club Royale which was disappointing - but we'll do that next time. They do have afternoon tea each day from 4-6. This is a well-kept secret, it seems, because there were not many people there each day. Their Mexican and Mayan coffee is so good and even in the extreme heat - you will love it! Try to be sure to catch tea at least once during your stay! We are already planning our return trip for next year. I have never felt so \"taken care of\" at a resort/hotel in my many years of traveling as I did at the Royal Hideaway. I am usually ready to get back home after a week away but I truly was sad to leave.

The service at this facility, while still above a lot of hotels, is not what it use to be. When we arrived in Cancun, we had previously arranged for a private car to pick us up. We arranged this through the RH Travel company and was told that someone would be waiting outside, with our name on a sign and even told us what sort of clothing to be watching for. No one was there and we had to ask several other tour people to help us out. They finally found our reservation, highlighted in yellow on their sheets, yet seemed unaware that we would be waiting. They took us to a line that looked like we might be getting on a bus and I protested. They finally told us that a car would be coming shortly. We waited and did finally get our private car, but our driver didn't even apologize. As a matter of fact, he wasn't that friendly at all. We got to RH and although the greeting was with all the normal fanfare, it seemed a bit colder. Not the usual very friendly staff that we had encountered before. We were in building 31, which is a great villa, but our bed was harder than a rock!! I couldn't sleep the first night, despite having been up since 2 a.m. that morning. It was ridiculous. I complained the next morning to our concierge and he promised that he would have the maids put something on the bed. Ricardo (our concierge) was incredible. He did everything he could to make our nights easier to sleep. Unfortunately, even with the mattress pad, it was a poor nights sleep. After the 2nd night, we moved to Bldg 24. Again, great room, but they must have changed the mattresses since the last time we were there. The beds and linens in this place really aren't what you should find at a 5 star hotel. The atmosphere at this resort has changed. The staff, although polite and nice, seem to have become hardened to the guest. We have always tipped for everything, being that they don't make all that much money and we noticed that this time they, the pool staff never even bothered to thank us. It was strange. Also, the pool staff is lacking in people!! One day we were there, no one was getting any drinks. People were lined up at the pool bar, ordering their own. There is no way that you should have to do that all day. During our trip, there was several large groups, including a wedding of 60-70 people. This made for a very loud pool side. The RH seems to be catering to these type of groups, but being that they only have 200 rooms, it becomes harder to relax, with loud parties around the pool. I think the whole time that we were there, we only met one couple there on their honeymoon. Most people are now coming to this resort in groups. We traveled back here to get a relaxing week, away from large crowds and to be pampered, just like before. It didn't seem to happen this time. There are a few good things. Like I said, Ricardo, the concierge in Villa 31 was outstanding. Also, the manager of the Grill was very gracious and even wrapped up a few after dinner truffles, when I commented on how good they were. That's the kind of service that they use to have throughout the whole hotel. Not so much now. We did meet some really great people and will always remember that. You can still count on wonderful food and drinks. That shouldn't let you down. The beach is erroding, but that's not the fault of the resort. There is word that they plan to bring in sand to fix the issue. The pool chairs are mostly taken by 8 a.m., but you can always find a place to lay out....it may just be the beach area. All in all, it's still a nice resort, just not what we are looking for anymore. We want to get away from it all and relax. We don't want to have to worry about loud people, serving our selves or wondering if we are going to get any sleep on the only beds available.

To give this review perspective, we've been fortunate enough to do a lot of travelling and stay in a lot of high end resorts. Overall, we had a nice trip and enjoyed ourselves, but we found many aspects of the hotel to be very disappointing. I will start with the positives. The grounds are lush and well manicured, check in was pleasant and there was no line to wait in, the service was very good and on par with other 5 star resorts, the spa was relaxing and quiet, and the pool chairs were comfortable (the beach chairs were another story...). We enjoyed the food at Ventanas, Spices, and Palazzo - it was just wonderful. I won't go into more detail since its all been said in other reviews. For the negatives, I will list them in no particular order: 1. The house wines were awful and almost undrinkable. My husband and I like to drink wine, but we usually only spend $10-$20 bucks per bottle in a store, so we are by no means wine snobs, but we found the house wines to be just awful. I heard many other guests saying the same thing. Since the resort serves Belvedere and Grey Goose vodka, one would expect better quality wines. The wines they served would cost no more than $5 per bottle in the U.S. 2. The beds were not comfortable and the linens were not as nice as most 5 star hotels. This is picky, I know, but the bed was on par with a Holiday Inn and not a 5 star hotel. 3. The sand bags - this has all been said, but they are truly ugly and take away from the natural beauty of the beach. What has not been said much on this forum is how dangerous and slippery they are. A girl slipped and broke her ankle while I was staying here. 4. The food at the pool bar was not that good and got old pretty quickly. 5. Room Service - the menu had only a handful of items on it. 6. Lack of beach views! This was a big deal to me, even though I knew going in that we would not have a beach view. For this hotel class and price point, it is a real shame that most of the rooms do not have beach views. Instead, we looked at other people's rooms and balconies and overlooked the very loud resort next door. I would never pay to upgrade to a beach view room because even those were pretty far from the beach. 7. Azia - some people love this place, but we thought it was the worst meal we had. The sushi was mushy and not good quality at all. Perhaps we are spoiled by living in a big city and eating sushi all the time, but we were very disappointed in this restaurant. 8. Management - the air conditioning broke for 24 hours while we were there and the power went out for hours at a time. The management offered little explanation - and the stories often changed. When it was all over, they sent everyone a small plate of chocolates. In my opinion and that of many other guests, the hotel should have done more to compensate for a great inconvenience and a very uncomfortable night of sleep (it was 96 degrees outside!). Just a couple other things: If you are looking for a honeymoon spot that will make you feel special for being on your honeymoon, do not choose this place. Almost everyone at the Royal Hideaway is on their honeymoon or celebrating an anniversary, so the staff will not make a big deal over you. The upside for us was that we met a lot of really nice couples! Also, we tipped throughout each day and at meals - it is not required, but the staff works hard and is so friendly that we felt good about tipping. Based on my observation, tipping is pretty common here.", "Date": "June 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "waco", "Title": "\u201c10 year anniversary...better than honeymoon\u201d", "Author": "roxxisoxx", "ReviewID": "UR8002043", "Content": "Royal Hideaway was fabulous from the moment we walked in until we had to leave. I am going to do my best to give tips from our experience in several categories. I hope it helps you as it did us! Transportation to hotel- RH is about an hour from the airport. We were planning on taking the ADO bus which would have been the cheapest ($8pp) and second to most direct route (private taxi being first) from the airport. Unfortunately, when we arrived and tried to catch the 11:45 bus, it was at a different terminal than we were. Grey Line Express, by the doors as you exit the terminal, charged us $24pp to get to the hotel with 3 other people and they gave us 50% off ($41) to book our return trasportation by private taxi right then. It worked out fine, but know that if you end up with a lot of people in your transfer that your time will slip away on your first day unless you get dropped off first. The hotels on the Mayan Riviera section of the road (before Playa) take forever to reach the entrances. If you want to get to your hotel the fastest and are not concerned with money, carry your bags on and get a private taxi as soon as you get off of the plane. For $82, we would have been off of the plane and on our way within 10 minutes of landing. As it ended up, for $48 and $41 for the return we were gone within 15 minutes, but probably lost between 20-30 minutes dropping off 3 folks at 2 resorts on the Mayan Riviera. Homework on RH- You are already ahead of the game by reading Trip Advisor. Do as much as you can because all of the information helps you have a better experience. Make sure and call or email the hotel a week out and schedule your first dinner and request a room. I suggest requesting a top floor so that you will have the vaulted ceilings. We didn't end up with a partial oceanview, but we did get a room in the interior. The majority of the rooms should have some kind of gardenview, except for the outside of the farthest villas. I would try to avoid those if possible unless your villa also has a partial oceanview. Check the map that the concierge shows you when you check in. We started out getting the shaft and luckily I knew to request something better. Restaurants- I don't think you can go wrong. All of the food was excellent. If you are worried about small portions, just order more. We loved Azia and Palazzos. Las Ventanas was fine, but after being outside all day, we found it difficult to eat such heavy food. The portions are small, but the food is extremely rich. We got room service one evening...don't waste your time unless you or your loved one needs it. We are non-smokers, but requested smoking for dinner so that we could sit outside. I think this is a great idea if you want a little more privacy and it adds to the tropical feel. If it is too windy, opt to eat inside. You can also eat sushi in the bar at Azia without a reservation and dessert in Las Ventanas. If you have late dinner reservations this is particularly good information to know. Also, we had a 10PM reservation at Palazzos and showed up about 8:45 and they were able to sit us. For lunch, we ate at both Spices and the Snack Bar. Both were good, but Spices would have to be considered the better of the two. The Snack Bar food can be served around the pool or ocean which turns out to be a pretty great deal. I recommend the chips/guac, ceviche and veggie wrap. Soups were fabulous in every restaurant. Alcohol- If you ask for a margarita you will get one with well tequila. If you ask for a margarita with Don Julio, Cointreau, and floater of Grand Marnier you will get that as well. Some people don't ever figure that out. You can get Heineken and Bud Light from cans and Corona and Negro Modelo on draft at the pool. Pretty much anything you want liquor wise is available. You can try 100 year old tequilas at Spices. You will see the bottles when you walk in....just ask to try one. Be careful with this one though! Tipping- We tipped the majority of the time, although not every time. I do think it helps, but the service is great regardless. I enjoyed seeing the happiness on their faces when they received the extra money. Entertainment- We didn't participate in any of the planned activities. We did go and hang out with new friends in the bar during Karaoke night. Beach chairs- We never had a problem getting a chair on the first row of the infinity pool. We did not get up early to save chairs, but we were always there by 8. We would drop off our magazines and eat breakfast and then go back. That seemed to be the norm. We never even tried to get a bed, although I probably would like to have one next time if our timing is right. Things we didn't do this time- We were slugs and we really just wanted to chill. The breakfast at Las Ventanas looked really nice and the menu was first rate. Try it if that suits you and know there is no dress code at breakfast. Dinner at the Grill and Spices is more casual, but guys always have to wear pants regardless. The menu at Spices looks fabulous. Spa- services looked great, a little pricey...even if you don't work out, go in for the iced tea in the work out area. The whole area smells awesome. Beach dinner- not really our thing, but it looked romantic. Keep in mind, there are possibly 4 going on at the same time, so you are not alone on the beach as you would hope. Wind and rain could cause issues there as well. The bath tubs were jacuzzi...and they provided bath foam. Again, next time. Sandbags- No biggie to us, but we are not big ocean swimmers. Definitely isn't great, but what are they supposed to do. It is extremely difficult to walk down the beach. We could easily walk next door and that was it. Again, no biggie for us, but I can see where some wouldn't like it. In closing, keys to me are: 1. carry on luggage, do not check bags 2. call/email ahead and schedule dinner/villa 3. ask for premium liquors 4. relax and be pampered 5. ceviche by the pool", "Date": "June 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbia, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cA good time, but with reservations...literally!\u201d", "Author": "Stellabella02", "ReviewID": "UR7989826", "Content": "We stayed at the Royal Hideaway for our Honeymoon June 10-13th.

To me, this is a waste of money and I think that someone who pays ALOT of money to stay at the hotel should be allowed certain graces. Also, when we got there, most of the nicer resturants were booked. I did not get to have dinner at ANY resturant that I wanted to. We wanted to see the dinner show, but were told it was booked up. This to me was unacceptable. If we are guests at the hotel, we should be able to go see the show! On our first night we did not have any reservations. We went to the Grill and the Host made it seem like he was doing us a special favor by finding us a table 30 minutes later! Hello? We paid for an all inclusive stay. We should be able to eat! On a better note, we did have the dinner on the beach which was just wonderful. Our waiter was VERY courteous and friendly. It counld not have been better. Our room was nice, but I have been in similar hotel rooms of equal quality. The beach was gorgeous, even with the sand bags. The bags have developed algea on them, so they look more natural. The endless drinks were a major plus. The waiters will even come up to you while swimming in the pool and take your order. I recommend the strawberry coloda and the blue hawiian. While you are at the resort, I HIGHLY recommend taking a ride on the wave runners.lt will cost you $50 for 30 minutes, but it is totally worth it. It was the highlight of my trip. We also went snorkeling. I only recommend this for people with experience. We had no idea what we were doing and there were no instructions what so ever. We did not enjoy it at all, but the boat ride to the coral reef was alot of fun. The room service was fabulous. They were extremely fast! Our conceriage, Julio, was a bit lacking. We requested refills of bottled water from him, and hours later we still did not have anything. We did not get any water until we called room service. The club sandwhich was awesome! We did sneek off to Fifth street for some shopping and we hit some of the local clubs and bars. I highly recommend experiencing the night life. Some of the bars are REALLY nice and there is no cover. All in all, I had a good time at the RH, but honestly, I would not return. I was extremely upset that we could not go to certain resturants and that we were on a schedule. I felt unwelcome in that respect and I dont think we deserved to be treated that way.", "Date": "June 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh, PA", "Title": "\u201cHoneymoon!\u201d", "Author": "Lariah", "ReviewID": "UR7988091", "Content": "The moment you walk in to the lobby, you are handed refreshing moist towels and a flute of champagne (well, sparkline wine:)).

We chose the Royal Hideaway after much research and from the outset it seemed to match our criteria....it had to be somewhere we could fly to relatively quickly (my husband couldnt take an enormous amount of time off of work, and I am TERRIFIED of flying, so the less time in the air the better) ,it had to be located in the beautiful waters of the carribean, it had to be all inclusive, it had to be no children allowed (we not only wanted to have a break from OUR kids, we didnt want to deal with OTHER peoples children either) and it had to have a romantic feel to it. Royal Hideaway was on the mark with every single item on our list. There was not one thing about this resort that I can complain about....the food was amazing at each restaurant we tried --we did not try Azia, as we are not big sushi fans but heard from others it was excellent. Palazzo (Italian), Spices (Mexican and Carribean) and Ventanas (gourmet) were all AMAZING, even though the portions are quite small by American standards....I have to admit that our first night when our dinner was served, we looked at each other and quietly giggled, both of us thinking \" wow, we are going to starve to death down here\" but the food is so amazing that it frankly satisfies without overindulging, and because it is all inclusive, if you are still hungry you could order more if you wish...we never did because the appetizer, main course and dessert seemed to be filling enough after a day in the sun and lots of wonderful drinks. Our room was located in Villa 26 and our concierge was Ramon who couldnt have been nicer or more helpful, always smiling and willing to help us with everything....our room was beautiful, not an ocean view, but we were down by the pool and ocean so much it really didnt matter. We signed up for the Royal Romance package, so we received complimentary bathrobes from the hotel, an assortment of fine bath products, a bottle of champagne, and chocolate covered strawberries. It also included dinner on the beach which we tried to schedule twice but it rained both nights so we had to eat elsewhere, but they tried to make it as special and romantic as possible for us anyway. Our waiter, Juan, went out of his way to do everything he could to make the night of our anniversary just amazing. I just cannot say enough about the service and the feeling of romance that is at this resort....we absolutely fell in love with each other again, and we couldnt have picked a more wonderful place to do so. The only negative I can think of, and it is not something the resort itself can have any kind of control over, is that there were a few people staying there that obviously had a lot of money and they made no effort to hide the fact, acting very snobbish to the staff and the rest of us \"poor folk\" I certainly didnt go down there to make friends, but there is nothing wrong with just being friendly to people, and some of the guests apparently didnt see it that way. But like my husband pointed out, the nice thing about this resort is that the staff treats everyone equally, and they didnt bring Joe Millionaire's drink any quicker than mine, and treated us as if we were royalty. (We did get to meet some very nice couples however which made up for the others....hola to Brian and Irene from California, we will never forget the sexy water aerobics class!) I know that some reviews on here have mentioned different complaints, but I just cannot in good conscience support any of them. The only explanation I can give for bad reviews is that either they just had a very rare and unfortunate experience, or some people just cant ever be pleased. Although we are not frequent travelers and have very little to \"compare\" RH to, we frankly could not imagine anyplace that could have made us feel more romantic and pampered....in all honesty, if things had been much \"fancier\" it would have seemed too snobby to me, and I was looking for a place that made us feel welcome and comfortable.......it was perfect in every way.

My husband and I stayed June 9-16 for our belated Honeymoon. The week practically flew by! We selected this hotel through Hotwire, because it is the most affordable option for travel, and because it was one of the only 5-star rated, all-inclusive resorts. We scoured reviews and finally just decided to go for it. Let me break down the main components of the trip for you: Service: The service was really good. It wasn't as perfect as some people claim, but it was really very good. All of the staff was friendly and outgoing, from the groundskeepers all the way to the people you see the most of, such as the wait staff. Check in and out were easy and efficient, plus any questions we had were answered in a timely manner. My husband is from Mexico, so is, obviously fluent in Spanish, which allowed for much more relaxed and friendly relations with the staff. I wouldn't say that the service is totally incredible, but it is well-above average, and we did tip everyone. Food: After reading the previous reviews, I had really high expectations for the formal restaurants such as Palazzo and Las Ventanas. Honestly, I wasn't that impressed with these. The ambiance in all of the restaurants is great. Spices seems to get a bad rap from everyone else, but we thought it was, by far, the best of the restaurants. I suppose that most people aren't used to authentic Mexican spices and cooking (I am not talking about the Tex-mex crap, which is in no way indicitive of Mexican food, people. There is a 99% chance that if this is your first trip deep into Mexico, then you have never even tasted real Mexican food) and so don't really appreciate how wonderful it is. Eat there for lunch and order the Caribbean Ceviche and fish tacos, and at dinner the chicken mole was incredible. I thought Palazzo was wayyy to heavy and over-flavored. I thought the same of Las Ventanas, but it was better than Palazzo. We didn't make it to Azia, though many claim it is the best. I had a sick tummy the last few days, so we canceled the Azia reservation. I have read that many other people suffered from stomach upset as well, but blamed it on the water or food. My feeling is that we get sick because of lack of self-control. We eat wayyyy more than we usually do, drink so much more alcohol than we usually do, and our stomachs can't handle that degree of over-indulgence for an extended period of time. Oh yeah, the Spices breakfast buffet is great as well. Room service is not even worth mentioning, it's not that good. Pool: I never saw a lack of pool chairs and really dont understand the obsession with snagging a lounge by the infinity pool. The other pool is literally on top of the infinity pool and offers the same views of the ocean. To wake up at 6 am on vacation is absurd! Especially for a lounge chair!! Sleep in, relax, and get a lounge chair by the other pool. Trust me, there is no difference! They come by periodically with cool towels and fruit kabobs, and take drink orders often. They do not enforce the 20 minute rule, but it would be hard to. If you go swimming for half an hour next to your chair, you should be able to keep it. Beach: Yes, there are sand bags. It is no big deal. The water is still beautiful and fun to swim in, and there is plenty of lounging room. All of the neighboring resorts also have sand bags. With the hurricanes getting stronger from human pollution and negligence, we should expect things like this. Deal with it. Rooms: The rooms are lovely. Very simple, elegant and clean. We had a room right next to one of the \"loud\" resorts, but it was not a problem for us. I was able to sleep quite easily, which was probably aided by my nightly cocktails. Very comfortable and very pretty. Overall, this is not an active resort. It is romantic, intimate and quiet. It would not be enjoyable for teenagers or party people, if that is what you are looking for. You dress for dinner, which is nice. If you stay at an upscale, expensive resort, you should dress for dinner, it just increases that luxurious vibe. We went on a couple of excursions, took a lot of sun and naps, ate far too much, drank far too much, and relaxed. There are free bike rentals, and it is nice to ride the bike into town to look around. We would definetly recommend this resort. We won't necessarily return, not because of a bad experience, but because we want to have other experiences in other towns and environments. We are not the type of people to always go back to the same place. We think it is important to see many places, to expand our view, not limit it.", "Date": "June 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northern Virginia", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Resort\u201d", "Author": "travelsfor2", "ReviewID": "UR7847240", "Content": "We stayed at the RH from June 6-11.

It is clearly stated that there is a 20 minute rule for holding a chair. After that, staff can remove your things, but nobody does! We were at the pool by 8:00 every a.m. and all the chairs by the infinity edge pool had flip flops or books on them, NOT people. Could we move them? Yes but nobody did and we dint' want to be those people. We heard that people got up at 5/6 a.m. and reserved chairs and then went back to bed.

Like others, since I use TripAdvisor so much, I feel it's a responsibility to let others know. My husband and I went to Royal Hideaway with a group of friends, in April. Please know that we had a fabulous time. It was booked through Vacation Express out of Cincinnati. I believe our hosts and the travel agency made up for any flaws in our visit. Let me start by telling what was wrong. * Julio was our concierge and basically missing in action. I tried finding him several times and he was seldom at his desk. If he was there he was talking on the phone and wouldn't make eye contact. However, I did see him helping others, so our experience may have been isolated. (Our travel agent made all of our dinner reservations.) * The hostess at Azia insisted that we did not have a reservation, and was EXTREMELY rude. When it became apparent that I was getting upset at her continued insistence that we didn't have a reservation, a waiter stepped in and took over the situation. We did have a reservation, but in a 5 Diamond resort, there should have been more diplomacy. * Housekeeping was spotty on a couple of days. One morning when we hung the sign on the door that said they could clean the room, we returned later in the afternoon to find it hadn't been touched. There was no housekeeping person to be found. . . .and no Julio. However, I called the front desk and someone came immediately. *Food in the nicer restaurants was spotty in the ala carte restaurants. The best meal turned out to be at Azia, surpassing Las Ventantes (exceptional service), poor at Palazzo. I realize that my tastes may be biased as I am a former chef. While nothing was horrible, it just doesn't rate 5 Diamonds. *Suspected that the Sunday Pilates teacher was high as a kite, but she was only there one day and not the regular staff. Now for the good stuff. *Room was lovely and clean. We felt very comfortable. Loved the jacuzzi tub, since we're bathers. * Beautifully manicured grounds. * Lovely spa . . . had four massages during stay. I was having a shoulder problem and my massager worked very hard on the shoulder. * Really enjoyed the breakfast at Spices. I loved all the fruits, sausages and cheeses and mostly made my breakfast from these. Staff was always cheerful and greeted you by name. Loved the watermelon juice! * Activities staff was always cheerful, engaging and extremely hard-working. * Loved the afternoon tea. * Loved being greeted with a warm towel and champagne upon arrival. * Loved the pools . . .aways clean and neat. Didn't care that I couldn't get a lounger by the infinity pool. Just wanted an umbrella and the staff was always willing to accomodate. * Loved the quiet. We lead such hectic lives that it was such a wonderful opportunity to do nothing. The sound of the ocean, and the soft sounds of the sax player in the afternoon is soothing to the soul. *Room service was prompt. We always ordered coffee in the mornings and it arrived sooner than promised. Loved the Mayan coffee. It was always delivered with a smile. (We didn't use the coffee maker in our room.) * Felt safe and secure during our stay. I have read many reviews of other resorts and the stealing that occurs. That was not an issue for us. The room safe worked perfectly. *Check-in and out was fast and efficient. . . . and we barely had to lift a hand. We travel a lot and do our best not to be ugly Americans ( I understand why people from other countries feel that way about Americans). In fact, we go out of our way to speak the language (even if poorly), not be demanding, and take an attitude of \"things happen\" on vacation. At the end of our week we both said it was the most relaxing and pleasant vacation we've taken in our lives.

We were in building 23 next to the Riu I believe. We slept with the door opened every night and the noise from that hotel wasn't loud at all., it didn't keep us up at all. We were there when the air conditioning was down, and it was uncomfortable, but not unbearable. The following day, we had received a personal letter and a plate of gourmet chocolates apolozing for the inconvienence. The restuarants were excellent, we didn't have a bad meal at all. I can't say which was our favorite, we loved them all equally. The comments that I've read about Ventanas surprises me. Any 5 star restuarant in NYC is pretty much the same. The ingredients were very good, that's whats important. I can't think of any all incluvise resort that would service carvier & foie gras. In my opinion that's what make a restuarant a 5-star. As for the wine, I can't comment, I'm not a wine person. We met a couple that have been going to RH since it opened, back in '98. A total of 21 times, can't say I would make this my only vacation destination, there are tons of other places I want to visit, but this couple was also much older.

I actually won the trip from last summer's Tripadvisor sweepstakes. However, this does not prevent me from being completely forthcoming in my review. The Resort: Truly beautiful and well maintained. The grounds are nicely landscaped. The main building is 5-Star and containes the lobby and 3 of the restaurants. The main building is nicer than Sandy Lane in Barbados which has been redone. The rooms are very spacious and modern. The beds were very comfortable and the sheets and bedding were not Frette or Anichini but still nice. The bathroom was travertine and had a separate tub and shower. The shower was strong and a good size. I give very low marks to the awful, dirty, and small outdated hairdryer they provided. This was not acceptable. Drying my hair is not a daily necessity but I certainly did not want to use this thing to do it. We were in building 30 and were not bothered from any noise at the adjacent hotels. Dining: We ate at Palazzo twice and Ventanas once. We loved Palazzo and found the food and atmosphere 5-star. They were kind to suggest a side order of pasta with our main course so we didn't have to order a full portion. The entire meal from appetizers to dessert was wonderful. The house wines were good but not excellent. Our meal at Ventanas was less than satisfying. I should add that the food at Ventanas is \"molecular\" we had the \"tasting menu\" because these are the \"most popular \" dishes according to the restaurant. The first 3 courses were horrible and the last 3 quite good. So it was a mixed bag. I would suggest ordering from the regular menu. The design and atmosphere of Ventanas was in the Mies van der rohe style but we wished the food was better or that we had better success chosing from the menu. Our major grievance with Ventanas (if you can call it that) is that the waiter knew were not enjoying the meal. He asked how each course was and we kept saying terrible. He never offered to deviate from the tasting menu or to offer us something else. He just didn't seem to care. As we did not eat here again we have no way of knowing if we could of had a better experience and a far superior meal. Breakfast at Spices everyday was excellent and there were some good choices on the buffet. It was odd though that one day we could get bottled water and grapefruit juice but the next morning that wasn't to be. They just said \"no\" without an explanation. Pools and beach: The 2 large pools were very popular but it was always possible to find a chaise during a very busy weekend. They use nice heavy cushions on all of them which was an added plus. However on our first day we went to the little kiosk to get towels and they didn't have any. One hour later around 4pm they still didn't have any so we gave up. I think the staff should have been able to find towels somewhere. As far as the beach goes it was fronted by \"hippo size\" sand bags but accessible without much effort if you go around them. The water is crystal clear and very beautiful. They have many umbrellas around the pool that provide adequate shade for those that don't want full sun. On one day a powerful gust of wind came out of nowhere and blew several umbrellas over almost injuring 10 - 15 people. One man did look like his arm was hurt. I should note that on 2 of our 3 day stay the resort lost power and air-conditioning. It happened at night so it wasn't too bad but at Palazzo they only served dinner on the terrace due to the heat. The people in the main building looked very uncomfortable in the heat but they did not complain. I felt sorry for them. We did get power back on our last day. The concierge said the power problem happens once a year. It is a power company thing and has nothing to do with the hotel. This seemed believable. One final note: On our departure day at 5:00am we heard someone lightly tapping at our door. This was quickly followed by loud banging on our door. We asked what he wanted and he said \"room service\" but we did not order any. We said \"wrong room\". The person then said \"don't you want coffee?\" We sternly said \"no\" and the person fnally left. As it turned out no one at the resort had ordered coffee at 5am and we were also told this was not a hotel employee, as if this would make us feel better! Whether we had opened the door and we going to be robbed or worse we have not idea. It was scary and did not seem to be taken very seriously by the staff. They seemed embarrassed kind of just brushed it off. They said they don't know of anything like this happening. Obviously something like this could happen at any hotel or resort. This is just a word of caution. Overall we had a wonderful time and greatly appreciated the luxury of winning a free trip to this resort. I would rate the resort 4.5 stars. Although some of the following remarks may be trivial to some, if RH could change the tasting menu and/or food at Ventanas, offer some better quality house wines, ensure you can get a towel at the pool and update the hairdryers I would increase the rating to 5 stars.", "Date": "May 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat, but not perfect\u201d", "Author": "chupahunter", "ReviewID": "UR7705472", "Content": "My spouse and I just returned from a 4 day stay at this resort. We had a great time and this place pretty much lived up to my expectations. In short this is not a 5 star property, but still is worth visiting. Facility in General: The RH is a well laid out facility. It is not a mega property so you can walk anywhere in a matter of minutes. The grounds are well manicured and the staff is truly wonderful and will assist with any need you may have (I cannot say enough about the staff). Mexico in general does not match the US or many other countries when it comes to quality in construction or good detailing and this was somewhat apparent here, but overall the facility is top notch. Keep in mind there are no handrails for any exterior stairs or ramps on this property (except for the villas) which the designer in me loves, but I understand others may have a problem with this, especially if you are disabled. As in past TA reviews, both adjacent resorts have music at night which you can hear throughout the property. It is best to get in one of the three middle villas which shelter the noise to some extent. The beach is still eroded with sandbags, access to the water can be had at the north end of the beach and many people were enjoying the water through this access point. It did not appear to be dangerous to me. Villas and Rooms: Try to get in one of the middle villas, 27, 26, or 25 where 27 is closest to the beach and 25 is closest to the main building. Request a top floor which has vaulted ceilings. The rooms are well appointed and detailed. Beds and linens are okay but not great. Lighting and fan controls are in the headboard which is great. The bathroom is spacious and is tiled with travertine stone and a jetted tub. Shower has good pressure but lacking on heat sometimes. There is a mini fridge that your villa concierge keeps full with whatever you want. Pools and Hot Tubs: There are two main pools near the beach, and three other \u201cquiet\u201d pools scattered around the property between the villas. The two beach pools are the busiest and they are adjacent to the bar and restroom facilities. The quiet pools were dead. I did not see very many people using these pools at all. I would speculate the reason is you could not be served at these pools because they are far from the bar and restaurant. The chaise lounges at the beach pools have cushions and the beach chairs do not. For this reason the pools chairs fill up first but there were plenty of open chairs on the beach. Waiters are very attentive and will bring you whatever you want. There are 4 hot tubs adjacent to the beach pools. All 4 appeared to be broken as they were not very hot, more like lukewarm. We tried to use them each day of our stay, but did not want to stay in them for long because of the water temp. Restaurants: In general all the food is high quality and very good. You really cannot go wrong at any restaurant they offer. My recommendations are as follows: Breakfast \u2013 Las Ventanas (a la carte) better than Spices (buffet). Much less crowded at Las Ventanas. Lunch \u2013 Snack Bar \u2013avoid the sandwiches - then Spices Dinner - Las Ventanas \u2013 Signature Restaurant and you must eat here no matter what, it is excellent. Keep in mind it is closed for dinner on Tuesdays and Fridays due to the shows in the theater so plan accordingly. Then the Grill (Snack Bar transforms into \u201cthe Grill\u201d at night) for steaks and seafood. Then Palazzo, Italian food. Room Service: The room service menu is very limited. Example--breakfast is either a bread basket or fruit plate. The bread basket was 2 pieces of white bread toast sans crusts and 2 small rolls. Fruit plate consisted of very very thin slices of melon and strawberries. Lunch and dinner options are limited too, maybe one type of hamburger or sandwich. I would not rely on this for your meals; your best bet is to hit one of the restaurants. Tips: Take the ADO bus from the CUN airport to downtown PDC, and then take a cab to the property. The PDC bus terminal is right in the center of downtown on 5th Ave. and is about 50 feet from the cab stand. The ADO bus is so easy and is $8usd per person and the cab ride to the resort from the bus station is $5usd for two people. These buses are about as luxurious as you can get, they are very new, extremely clean and comfortable. On the trip down they were playing the movie Eight Below with the English audio track. Bus ride is about an hour and the cab ride is 5 minutes. Get on Google Earth and get familiar with the lay of the land. Google Earth has the Panoramio feature to which a user can upload pictures of the area tied to a point on earth. It is similar to the pictures on trip advisor, but defined to a point on earth to which the image was taken. Call the resort no earlier than one week to request your villa number/floor, and to book your first nights dinner reservation. Ride one of the resort bikes into town. Bikes and locks are included with the stay. The ride is safe and about 10 minutes to the southern edge of the shopping district. You can park and lock the bike at the south end of the mall or near the ferry pier. Get up early and get a Thai bed, totally worth it. Or wait until sunset, when they are pretty much deserted. Summary: My spouse and I had a great time and this resort is one of the top three in the PDC... for now. Although I would recommend this resort, it should be noted that over the past 5 months the RH\u2019s trip advisor user rating has dropped from 1 to 4. I speculate the reason is due to beach erosion and the large groups of people from pharmaceutical conferences etc. With the Iberostar Grand just open and the Mayakoba crown jewels (viceroy, rosewood, banyan tree) on the verge of opening there are now better facilities and the RH is no longer the top property, and sadly never will be again. That said, it is a great place and the staff is as good as any Ritz or Four Seasons.", "Date": "May 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cGood...not great.\u201d", "Author": "Sheri76", "ReviewID": "UR7704987", "Content": "My husband and I just returned from our trip to the Royal Hideaway (May 19th - 26th), where we celebrated our 1-year anniversary. Like most of you we had read several of the comments on trip advisor before booking our trip and can find truth in almost everyone's comments. To us there is the problem (inconsistency). Yes, the service was great (85% of the time), yes, the food was good (80% of the time), yes, you can walk down the beach a bit to get into the water without having to climb over the hideous, and dangerous I might add, sandbags, but who wants to do that? I understand that the latter issue is of no fault to the Royal Hideaway, but none-the-less it takes away from the \"beach experience\". For a five star resort the service and food should be exceptional 100% of the time. This should be rated as a four star hotel. Of course there is nothing wrong with a four star hotel, as they are better than most, but if you are expecting a true five star resort you will not find it at the Royal Hideaway. Some particular comments from our trip... The resort itself is immaculate. The grounds are well kept, the pools are super clean and in general it is what you would expect \"paradise\" to look like! There are several pools and jacuzzis spread out throughout the resort, so if you prefer a nice quiet, secluded pool instead of the larger and more populated infinity pool you will have no problem there. Speaking of the infinity pool, it is true that you need to get there before breakfast starts at 7:00 if you would like a seat, otherwise you will need to settle for the pool behind the infinity pool. It's not that big of a deal, but once the seats are taken they are typically taken for the day. The \"20-minute\" rule definitely does not apply regarding the unoccupied seats, so do yourself a favor and don't try to play by the rules because nobody else does. We did not like our concierge, Julio, at all. One three separate occasions we had the \"do not disturb\" sign on the door and he knocked on our door anyway. The first time we let it go...by the third time my husband was not so understanding. Our villa (Las Margaritas) was extremely loud, so taking an afternoon nap was completely out of the question. The housekeeping staff and the concierge would yell back and forth to each other all day, which my husband and I found completely unprofessional and rude. The luxury room was an adequate size and looked exactly as shown on the Royal Hideaway website. The restaurants themselves were all beautifully designed. The portions of food were all adequate with the exception of Palazzo (Italian restaurant). One big overall disappointment was the wine. I understand that it is an all-inclusive resort and bottles of Opus One are not going to be available at dinner, but it would have been nice if the wine they did offer was at least drinkable. The bottles of shiraz, cabernet and merlot that were offered were AT BEST $5.00 bottles of wine. For a five star resort I think that is unacceptable. My husband and I did order a nice bottle of wine one night, but it was certainly not worth doing every night considering the mark-up. I reverted to the mixed drinks and my husband to the beer. --Side note about the mixed drinks- you can order the same drink at the pool bar, allegria bar and piano bar and it will taste different every time and sometimes bartenders will know how to make a drink at one bar but not at the next. Just another observation about the inconsistency. We ate at Azia (Japanese restaurant) twice, and received mediocre service the first time and terrible service the second time. The service the second time was so poor that after being seating a half an hour late and having to wait another 20 minutes for our drinks my husband went to the bar and ordered us drinks. We did see the show at Club Royal, and it was actually pretty entertaining. It wasn't a Vegas show by any means, but it was nice and the food and service there were both great. The Grill (Mediterranean cuisine) was very nice. The gentleman who plays the saxophone during the daily tea time also plays the guitar at the Grill, which is a nice added touch to the ambiance of the restaurant. Finally, our favorite restaurant was Las Ventanas. This is the Royal Hideaway's signature restaurant, and it shows. The service here is exceptional, and what you would expect the service should be throughout the resort. The food selection and quality was by far the best here and I would highly recommend going here on one of your first nights. We did not eat dinner at Spices since we ate breakfast and lunch there a few times, so I cannot comment on the dinner there. The lunch menu at the beach club is okay, but it gets old fast. I have to say, Luis, definitely is the best waiter there and you can tell he enjoys his job! There was really no night life to speak of at the Royal Hideaway. My husband and I went to the Allegria and piano bars on a few different occasions and they were nearly dead at any given hour. We went to \"Fifth Avenue\" in town, which has shops and such. I would tell you that across the street and about 50-feet to the left of the Royal Hideaway are the same type of shops that you are going to find in town and you will feel much safer there. Also, the shops in the departure section of Cancun airport are fantastic. I wish I would have known because I would have just done all my shopping there. All in all - the Royal Hideaway is a nice resort. I would not rave about it and I would also not say that you will have a terrible vacation if you go here. I would only say, know what is important to you on your vacation, and if you are willing to accept certain flaws as aforementioned then you will enjoy your stay. If you prefer to truly experience a five star resort experience then keep looking.

The Royal HIdeaway exceeded our expectations in every way, the staff are so friendly and helpful, they could not do enough for you. Our room was very well equiped, very comfortable and did not have a musty smell as some other reports have suggested. Our concierge (Manuel) was lovely, he made us feel relaxed and worry free from the minute we arrived. The restaurants were great, we thought that there was a good choice of food at a very good standard in all restaurants, and again the staff serving us were friendly and very knowlegable both in the food they were serving and in a variety of languages, (we had a lot of fun with them teaching them some welsh words!!) The Hotel, grounds, pool areas and the beach (even with the sand bags) were all beautiful and maintained to a very high standard. We had some lovely relaxing afternoons at some of the smaller pools as not many people use them so we were by ourselves and it was lovely - especially as we were honeymooners! The location of the Hideaway is perfect as it is a very short walk away from some shops for souveniers etc., and Playa del Carmen is about a 15 minute walk away with lots of shops, bars, restaurants and nightclubs. We walked to Playa several times and it is very safe to walk during the day and night.

We had been looking forward to this trip for a long time and I must say we were both a little disappointed. It is a nice hotel but I do not think it is a five star hotel and I do not think it is worth the extra money you pay over many other Mexican hotels. This was our fourth trip to Mexico in less than 18 months and this was almost twice the price we paid for the other hotels we stayed at. The major issue, which I was aware of prior to booking, is that, other than a few rooms, the rooms do not face the ocean. I now realize that when we are on a vacation of this type, we need to have a room facing the ocean. When we travel we usually pay for an upgraded ocean view room but we did not do so here because the price differential was so great. Another issue which was not a factor when we booked but developed a few months before our arrival was severe erosion problem with the beach. It was impossible to walk along the beach to the right of the hotel as the beach had eroded all of the way to the foundation of the building. You could walk a little way to the left and then ran into the same problem. One day we took a long walk along the beach but had to go out to the street and then \u201csneak\u201d through another hotel to get to the beach. The service and food were good but not substantially superior to that available in other area properties. I suppose if you create a lower standard for Mexican properties, you could call this \u201cfive\u201d star but in a major US city or in Europe this would be four star at best. We ate at the The Grill which was not very good, Spices and Azia were very good and our favorite was Palazzos and Azia. We ate one night at Ventanas and although it was interesting, the servings were extremely small and I thought it a bit pretentious so we cancelled our reservation there for later in the week and ate again at Palazzos. The desserts in each restaurant were for the most part little commercially pre-made frozen desserts. An example of why this is not a five star property was the orange juice. One of my minimum requirements on a luxury vacation is freshly squeezed orange juice. When I arrived at breakfast the first morning and saw the large two or three gallon plastic containers of orange juice being stored behind the bar I realized this requirement was not going to be met. The person behind the bar in the breakfast room was making some fresh juices out of other fruits or vegetables so I asked him if he could use the equipment and the oranges he had to make me orange juice and the answer was no. That is the same answer I received when I asked for a Mexican coffee at the 6:00 PM closing time, even they had not started to close. A five star hotel does not say no to those kind of requests. Also, a five star hotel does not forget your request for a wake up call which happened to us the only time we attempted to use that service on our last morning. The hotel offers free wifi internet. It did not work the first day but they sent someone the third day and got it working. It stopped working again after the fifth day and I assume they would have fixed it again if I asked. They also have three computers in the business center if you do not want to bring a laptop. Both wifi and the computers are free. The gym is on the small side but I was able to have use of whatever equipment I wanted when I went there. As the week went on, I notice some people had trouble getting use of a treadmill from time to time. The spa was extremely expensive but was inviting and appeared to be professionally run. There were more than an adequate number of pool and beach chairs. The daily list of activities states that if you do not use your chair for 20 minutes the staff will remove your belongings to allow someone else to sit their. That is not true. The first morning I went to the pool at 7:00 AM and all of the chairs were empty, other than a rolled up towel which the staff places on each chair. I returned about an hour later and each chair in the area where I wanted to sit had personal belongings placed on them and only two of them were actually occupied. People did arrive to sit as the morning wore on but for the rest of the week I reserved our chairs prior to 8:00 AM and occupied them about an hour later. We really enjoyed Playa del Carmen. The hotel is about a 20 minute walk from the downtown area. There is a long area of street that is blocked to vehicles and it is very vibrant with lots of restaurants, stores, bars and other establishments on either side with many people walking around. The staff was very friendly and the maid service was efficient. The bar tenders and waitstaff were also friendly and efficient and they all appreciated tips. Because of the beach situation and lack of ocean front rooms I am not sure we would return to Royal Hideaway even without the substantial cost differential over similar properties. Once you factor in the substantial cost increase, I think you can have a better experience by going to another property and paying for an upgraded oceanview room and making wise choices about where you eat.", "Date": "May 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "The Brits in Germany", "Title": "\u201cThe British Version\u201d", "Author": "jane13g", "ReviewID": "UR7591720", "Content": "Just returned from 2 weeks of being pampered and spoilt.

I usually vacation in Jamaica with my husband every year and after traveling to Playa I still prefer Jamaica but I cannot find fault with our trip. Others have said it but I will say it again - the staff is outstanding and the customer service is excellent. They really went out of their way to make our group feel welcomed. Much has been made about the lack of beach \u2013 the beach is small but not as bad as I thought it might be. Yes there are giant sand bags out front but it\u2019s only about 20 yards to the left to enter the water at the next resort \u2013 not a big inconvenience. There are 5 rows of beach chairs and still probably 10 yards to the water. One of the reason I prefer Jamaica is because the resorts are more spread out \u2013 the beach in front of the hotel is very narrow so the chairs are a bit crowded but that is the only drawback I could find. As we walked up the beach (sometimes through the water and sometimes crawling over sandbags) we could see that many other resorts had much worse erosion problems. Another positive is that the small size of the resort limits the number of people on the beach so it does not feel over crowded like some of the other resorts seemed to be. Food and drink service on the beach was ok \u2013 a staff member came by fairly regularly. But they truly pamper you at the food. A staff member came by probably twice as often for food or drink orders plus they came by a couple of times a day with cold towels, spray water for misting and fruit kabobs. It was never a problem to get a large group of lounge chairs on the beach but we had to have someone out early to get a group of chairs by the infinity pool. We were able to get a group of chairs at the other pool mid morning. The food was good to excellent. The sandwiches by the pool were just ok and I could not get a decent frozen drink (tried everything). I gave up trying and just had diet Pepsi or champagne after the second day. Everything else was pretty wonderful. We had a private dining room and the tasting menu at Ventanas which made the evening very special. We also had a really good meal at Spices. We went to Club Royal one night for the show \u2013 the buffet before the show was fine \u2013 traditional TexMex but since we are from Texas it was nothing special. The show was pretty hokey but I guess these things usually are. The breakfast buffet was great and more than I really should have eaten. The spa was fine. I purchased the Royal Indulgence package. Services were comparable to what I receive a spas locally but the spa was a little warm \u2013 I felt uncomfortably sticky at the end of my massage. I would probably skip next time especially since there are several world class spas at home. The gym was small \u2013 3 treadmills and an elliptical \u2013 I was there at 6:45am and it was pretty crowded with 3 people working out. There was also a weight room I did not use. Our room was in building 30 which is right next to the neighboring property. We could have talked to the people in the pool from our balcony. It was fairly loud at night from the neighboring property and in the morning you got the clattering of the carts as they wheeled dishes etc to get ready for the day. The room itself was fine, very clean, maybe a little small but the bathroom was huge. The balcony was very small and had uncomfortable chairs if you are spending any period of time out there. The place seemed to close up shop around 4pm everyday \u2013 we hardly saw anyone at dinner or at the bar at night. We left the resort one night in search of something to do but did not find anything within walking distance. There were several corporate groups while we were there. They did close the pool early one night for dinner and music \u2013 we were at the beach that day so it was no inconvenient for us. I was a little annoyed when they tried to kick us off the beach at 4pm the next day. Turns out they were setting up for a wedding which was the next morning \u2013 seems like they could have waited longer before they had to do that. We did see a couple of teenage boys (probably 14 or 15) with parents (guessing the son and a friend) who were drinking and entirely too much. Dad told the boys to go easy at one point but that did not seem to slow them down as they were already sloppy drunk. But even sloppy drunk they were pretty quiet (not the same for some of the other guests) so it did not bother us too much. We did not see any young children. I almost thought the resort was going to flub our departure. We did not leave for the airport until 7pm and we had no dinner reservations. At 6pm we started looking for someplace to eat before we left and were told that since we had no reservations and no room to order room service to we could not eat (they would not let us order room service to the lobby). After going around with the concierge a couple of times she finally agreed to order room service to one of the meeting rooms for us. By this time it was getting close to our departure time. At 6:45 we realized the food was not going to make it and were getting annoyed. As the bus pulled up the concierge came out with a room service waiter with a platter or sandwiches, a platter of fries and two shopping bags full of drinks and condiments to take with us.

Just to briefly highlight a few of our comments: Check-In: Juan and his staff where awesome; the towel/champaigne combination is inviting and the process is quick and seemless Lodging: I agree with other reviews in that I'd definitely request villa 31 or 27. We stayed in 31 (2nd Floor) and our room did have a semi-beach view. The rooms we felt are adequate, but I could see how (especially if you're staying a week) how you might begin to feel closed in...but hey, you don't go to the RH to stay in your room. The balconies are nice to and great for reading, having drinks/room service etc. Pool Area: Was fabulous, yeah out of the 7 nights there I had to reserve chairs for my wife and I about 5 times but I didn't mind getting up and doing it...there's definitely a price the RH has paid in having the rep it has and that's that it's a lot more \"active\" than it was in 2001 when we came for the 1st time. The most noticeable feature is that they were a lot more busy (booked out) and it shows especially at the pool area and particularly with business groups. The staff down there is still top shelf (special shout outs to Alfredo-bartender, Fernando, Luis etc...they're all good! Restaurants/Entertainment: As we both like to eat, we were both pleased with the restaurants...we've been back since the upgrades to AZIA and had a fabulous meal there. I enjoyed Las Ventanas for dinner the best, my wife loved The Grill which goes to show you that they are all indeed good. Presentation is great, the food is wonderful and again what can you say about the staff, but nothing short of spectacular. We ate at Palazzo twice and probably had our most well rounded meals there (from appetizer to dessert). Never did dinner at Spices but did sit at the sushi bar at AZIA one night before having dinner at another restaurant and it was outstanding! We alternated for breakfast between Spices (more buffet style) and Ventanas (a la carte). Both are excellent. The french toast and mushroom/goat cheese omelette at Ventanas are outstanding. The one thing I will say is if you're looking for \"nightlife\" the RH isn't for you (but you are only a $5 cab ride away from Playa where they bars/clubs etc.). They do have the Bar Allegria and it's a nice indoor/outodoor bar area that each night would have a theme (i.e. Salsa, 70's night etc.)...The activities team (shout outs to Eduardo and his crew) do a remarkable job! understand, these are the same folks who are leading all the activities during the day (i.e. spanish lessons, water aerobics, cooking lessons, handing out cool towels and fruit on skewers) and then turnaround and work their tails off till about 12-1 in the morning! Salsa night was fun and the 70's night was, I'll say entertaining:)... Workout Facility/Spa: No spa treatments this time, but we both have had in the past and I highly recommend the couples massage/exfoliation. Also there is a pool just outside the gym that is nice to take a dip in after a nice run/workout - locker room is fully equipped with showers/bathrooms, steam room and sauna. Tea Time: I didn't have much of an appreciation for this 5-6 years ago but do now...we actually stumbled onto it one day when coming back from being in town and I have to say, it's pretty relaxing...tea, coffee, champainge etc...await you up outside Ventanas along with music (usually a sax player). In short, we loved our stay and will be back for sure!! No comments regarding the beach because Mother Nature is out of their control...it's an unfortnate situation up and down Playa and I got the sense they are doing all they can to make the beach as nice as they can...FYI, you can still access the ocean, you just have to step over a sandbag, it's not as dramatic as other reviews have made it seem.", "Date": "April 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sacramento, California", "Title": "\u201cToo Stuffy/Great Service\u201d", "Author": "Travelbest717", "ReviewID": "UR7433227", "Content": "Beautiful grounds, amazing service, but way too stuffy for our taste.

My wife and I travel a lot but not to \u201call inclusive\u201d resorts so were a little unsure what to expect. We were booked through Air Transit holidays, which provides the flight and transfers. From the airport we traveled to the resort by bus (about 45 minutes). We were the first off the bus (a big plus) and the last to be picked up on the return. The resort is a 20 minute walk to town. The walk is past nice houses and large resorts. The resort is low density; small two story buildings that house the rooms. Rooms: The basic rooms are clean and nice but not spectacular. The bar fridge was stocked with soft drinks, beer and flat water. We requested sparking water and thereafter never had to ask again. Beach: Much has been written and I will not repeat. Yes there are large ugly giant greenish slimy sandbags fronting the beach \u2013 this is mother nature\u2019s work not the hotel. The Mexican government will, I am told start to fix up the beach. Service: Excellent and professional. The staff are well trained and seem happy to see you have a good time. We decided to tip at the end of the holiday and this did not affect the quality of service. Some guests choose to tip with each service provided. Food: There is nothing better than having a great breakfast on a terrace facing the ocean. Lunch is available in the snack bar (ok food nothing special) or in a restaurant \u2013 a fried fresh whole fish was available daily. Dinner is 5*+ in two restaurants Palazzos and Vantanas. We ate there twice and the meals and service were great. Azia, the Asian restaurant was ok. The food at the Grill was also ok but the ambiance of eating next to the ocean made up for the food. We did not have dinner at Spices since we ate breakfast and lunch there. Alcohol: Available during the day at the beach and in the evening at the bars. The house wines are almost drinkable. I decided to order wine off the menu with dinner at additional cost. The average bottle of the lower end wine on the menu was around $50.00. The hotel should have better house wines (4 to choose from). Most people seemed to have the house wines. Summary: We visited friends in Cancun at a large 5* hotel. It was nice but nowhere near the quality of the RH. On the bus back to the airport a number of people asked about the RH. I asked about their resort. All stated the liked their resort but there was a lot of \u201cbut\u2019s\u201d \u2013 they had to pay off someone to get a restaurant reservation, only buffets, extra charges, noise, kids, poor service. This was not the case at the RH. WARNING: There is nothing at the RH to do but relax, eat, drink, watch the ocean, listen to the ocean, get sun, maybe use the gym (small but ok) have a massage, do yoga, and then eat and drink again. Complaints: the beach, conventions at the hotel (the attendees liked to drink too much), the high cost of better wines and the fact our seven day holiday was over, well, in seven days.

On our bus ride in from the airport we knew we probably made a good choice by the reaction of the bus driver when he asked where we were staying. He said it was the best resort on the mayan riviera and we'll take his word for it! Our only other experiences were secrets capri and erc. The grounds are really beautiful with several small pools placed throughout the resort and 2 main pools (1 an infinity pool) near the beach....or what remains of it. The beach is still there for laying in the sand and sunning yourself (5 rows worth), but access for swimming is a little dicey. You really can only enter the water from the far side of the resort due to huge sandbags placed near the waters edge and along every resorts beach as far as the eye can see. The water past the sandbags looks beautiful, the waves can be fun and there is a lot of activity happening on the water (jet skis, kayaking, etc.). I heard the gov't will be building an artificial reef along this area but who knows when. It didn't take anything away from our enjoyment of the resort but if easy, quick access to the water and long beach strolls are vital then consider someplace with a nicer beach. Unfortunately, if you do, you'll miss out on all the other things this resort does so well. The service is fantastic! They will provide you with almost anything you need to make your stay more pleasant. The drinks are top notch and it would be unusual to finish one before you are offered a refill. The food was excellent. This is the one area that we can be quite picky about and we found the dinners true gourmet dining. In gourmet style, the portions are small but you can have as much of it as you want. The house wines were ok but a nice bottle(extra $) at their signature restaurant, or Pallazo, enhanced the meal. Keep in mind we're picky when it comes to food, but what can i say, we like to dine out. FYI, the pool area did get busy by 9:30 or so but i was amazed at how many people thought a lounge was taken if they saw a towel rolled up or even layed out on it. Unless there is someones personal gear placed on the lounger or directly next to it, then it is free for the taking. The staff place the rolled towels there first thing in the morning, and if a towel is layed out but with no gear it's safe to assume the lounger has been abandoned. We never had any confrontations by following this rule. We can't be mindreaders so if you want to save your spot, put some personal item down to signal your intention to return. The staff won't enforce the 20 minute rule but they do mention it in the daily activity sheet you receive in your room. If you want to enforce it, have fun! All in all, i didn't mind paying the price. You get what you pay for. If it's a stretch to go to RH, i found secrets capri and erc to be a close runner up. Hope this helps you. p.s.

They open at 12:30 and have wonderful food. The food was great at The Grill, Palazzos and Azia. I can't comment on Spices or Ventanas as we didn't eat at either this visit. Okay, to the negative parts. There was a large group of plastic surgeons from Canada the first three days of our trip. They basically monopolized the pool chairs, restaurants, and everything else. It was interesting people watching though. During their stay, the pool service was spotty and they actually closed a few of the restaurants to accomodate the 60 plus in their party. Once they left on Sunday, I would say the resort was only at about 50% capacity for the remainder of our stay. The reason we wont be back??? KIDS & CHILDREN EVERYWHERE! There must have been 30 - 40 teenagers and at least 10 kids around the ages of 5-10. My husband and I were in total shock! I don't have kids and I don't want to have to deal with them on my vacation. The majority of them looked absolutely bored to death. They had a retro night at Allegros and we were really looking forward to it. We headed that way and in front of us was a swarm of teenagers heading for the bar. There was also a 13 year old boy sitting at a gambling table at Casino night. I feel that RH has a few options here: 1) Enforce the no kids under the age of 13 2) Change the minimum age to 18 3) Welcome children of all ages We voiced our disappointment upon checkout and all we got was \"Oh, so sorry\". I was hoping for an explanation but did not get one. I did want to comment that the beach was in better shape than I had anticipated. There was room to walk on the beach but the bags are still there. I saw several people venture out into the ocean every day and never saw one person have a problem sliding over the bags. I never thought I would say it but we won't be back. For the amount of money that we spend at RH, I expect the rules to be enforced regarding the children.

We have visited two years running now and even requested to stay in the same room, which was granted (we called the hotel directly after booking on line). Both trips were fantastic. We did notice the 2nd trip that a year had done alot to erode the beach further but it's still large enough to hang out on as we found most people stayed by the pools. The reflection pools were our favorite although there is limited wait staff to bring you your frozen drinks (!) at these pools but we almost enjoyed the short walk to the bar to stretch our legs and cool off some. One thing that annoyed us both times is the lack of 'policing' the pool sun lounger situation. If you are not up early ie. 7am then good luck trying to get a nice lounger poolside or one of the double cabana beds as people put their towels and books down before breakfast and then often don't use them until midday -- huge bugbear of mine. Same thing can be said of the pool floats -- very annoying but that's people for you - that will and does happen everywhere. I can't say enough good stuff about the RH -- the food, the attention to detail, the service, the good quality drinks, the gardens, the flower arrangements all make this a true 5* resort. The only real thing to critique is that it's quiet at night. That was fine for us as that's what we wanted but if you're looking for nightlife then you won't get it here. There is one bar/lounge to drink in and that's where we went pre and post dinner. For us it was perfect as you tend to overdo your quota of drinking during the day anyway. It's amazing how tired being in the sun can make you. The gym is adequate and you need to visit everyday in my opinion otherwise you'll come home 8lbs heavier (despite trying to be a little careful with food choices). The food is all so yummy it's so hard not to eat all that's offered. Be sure to book ahead with reservations for dinner for your first night. You must make reservations for the rest of your stay the day you arrive as the restaurants fill up quickly and you'll be eating either very late of very early or not in the restaurant of your choice.

We couldn't get back over the slimy sand bags - the waves hitting the bags created a vortex that knocked us off our feet - despite the fact that we are both strong swimmers. The bags are obviously helping to reclalim or protect the beach (ie they have been able to enlarge the area for sitting) but make swimming extremely dangerous. There are lots of rows of chairs and that is not the issue. There are lots of places to sit on the beach because virtually nobody swims in the ocean in front of the hotel. The issue is safety and, to a lesser extent, unsightliness. The hotel should be honest with customers and travel agents. Occidental Hotels lied to my agent when I enquired about this issue before the trip, having read other posts. They said there was no problem at all and sent a photo that ended just before the sand bags. If you want to swim in the ocean, or go for walks along the beach (which is impossible) go somewhere else. There is better swimming next door at the Allegro but even there it was quite choppy. We spent extra money for cabs, food and beach chairs at Mamitas Beach Club in town since the swimming there was fine, but should not have to do that considering how much we paid to stay here. If you are a pool person, the resort is very nice. The spa pool in particular is gorgeous and tranquil, with lots of birds in the surrounding trees. We were usually the only ones there. We got up at 6:30 and managed to get a thai bed looking out to the ocean one day. It was wonderful. There are only 7 of these. Were very annoyed that one bed was \"claimed\" by putting books on it (German ones) for the entire day and the people never showed up. The hotel states that it removes items after 20 minutes but that is definitely not true. The chairs around the two main pools facing the ocean are very popular and are also claimed very early in the morning, but you can usually find something near the pools later on. As I said, lots of empty chairs on the beach although these are not padded and are less comfortable. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful and the food is generally good, especially at Ventanas and The Grill (not so much Azia or the Mexican Show buffet). If you go, you might want to order double appetizers at Ventanas since the portions are small. Loved the seafood chowder at Pallazzo but the mushroom soup was foul per my friend. Ventanas breakfast is generally good (Eggs Benedict in particular) although they have trouble keeping the food hot (cold toast and rock hard butter every morning, cold pancakes one day). The food at tea was awful - mystery meat sandwiches and dull pastries. They have some great pastries at breakfast so don't know why they can't serve them at tea. My friend loved the Mexican champagne! We went to Cozumel one day and rented a jeep, which sounded like a good idea at the time but driving in town was really stressful. Nice to see the Eastern beaches, which are wild and mainly deserted. If I had it to do again I would take a cab from the ferry dock to the beach (Dzuiha?) which is just south west of town and where you can snorkel right off the beach. We went on a snorkeling trip booked from the hotel and it wasn't very good, although it might have been if it was a calmer day. Very choppy water had everyone feeling sick. They said it was a 10 minute boat ride to the site but that was a total lie. And the reef we went to south from the hotel didn't seem very healthy compared to others I have seen. When we got back the water was too choppy for the boat to come in very far (possibly again due to the sand bag situation) and we had to be ferried in by jet ski. The jet ski overturned with one couple on it and the man, who was unable to pull himself back on, had to make his own way into shore, with some difficulty. The staff on the boat couldn't care less. All they cared about was the snorkeling equipment that started to float away. Because of the beach situation, I would not return. If they are able to fix this and remove the sand bags it would be worth considering but I would personally not return after being lied to by Occidental.

Once we decided on a tropical beach vacation, we agreed on the following criteria in selecting a resort/location (not in any particular order): safety, ease of travel from the US (ie, no plane flight > 5hrs/transfers, etc.), good food (my husband is extremely picky and I'm a \"foodie\" for lack of a better word), exercise facilities (if we're eating and drinking all day, we wanted to be able to work off some of those calories!), and no children. We were also very content with the idea of a resort that was fairly self-contained - we aren't the types that feel like we have to venture out to nearby towns for entertainment and excitement. We were basically happy with the idea of lounging around all day, reading and drinking by the pool, taking a few swims, working out, and eating good food. That was the goal. I have to say, Royal Hideaway exceeded every expectation we had for this trip - it was a remarkable experience, we loved every minute of it, and we're already planning a return trip back. Upon your arrival, you sit with one of the main resort concierges for check-in, during which you are brought glasses of champagne. We arrived around 1pm and were told our room would be ready at 2pm, but we could put our bags with the bellman, and could have lunch in the meantime. We were then escorted to Spices for a lovely lunch on the balcony overlooking the amazing water of the Caribbean. It was a wonderful way to start our holiday. Our room was a standard luxury. The rooms are very nice, but not necessarily the most impressive aspect of the trip. They are nicely appointed, not huge, but all seem to have balconies with seats outside (some have beautiful hammocks as well). TV with cable (including international CNN and the American networks), DVD and CD player. The buildings and gardens are beautiful and very visually appealing. There are at least 4 smaller, more intimate pools that I saw sprinkled throughout the property that are virtually deserted throughout the day that you can use if you desire a more quiet, private experience. The two main pools near the beach and snack bar/Grill area are very large and quite nice, especially the infinity edge pool. There are also 4 hot tubs around that main area, that are really nice to jump into after a cooling swim. Some people would take their drinks with them into the pool, but we never witnessed any rowdy, inappropriate behavior. The guests are a good mix of honeymooners, older married couples, and families with grown (high school or college-age) children. About 20-25% European (mostly German, some French and British as well), 20% Latin or Central American, 10-15% Canadian, and the rest U.S. citizens. Beach - a lot of commentary has been devoted to this. This was my first visit to the resort, so I can't say how much it might have changed since Wilma. The beach is big enough that it can accommodate 5 rows of beach chairs and there is still a very wide swath of sand for walking before you enter the water. There are numerous huge sandbags just beyond the water's edge to try to stem the erosion. You can enter the water a few steps away, just in front of the neighboring resort (a break in the sandbags). While we were there, the current was always fairly strong, so we never really went swimming in the ocean. However, we saw lots of people from both resorts do that daily. My impression - there is still a white sand beach and beautiful green-blue water. The surf can be a little rough to enter, and I'm not sure if that can be at all attributable to the sandbags. The beach isn't huge (think more along the lines of the French Riviera, in terms of space and how close the chairs are to one another), but it is still very pretty, and you can get in the water. If you are looking for ONLY a beach experience, this resort is probably not for you. If you want some beach, and can be happy with the overall experience, including taking advantage of the beautiful pools and the beach view, then you should have no worries regarding the current state of the beach here. Beach chairs - another topic that has generated much discussion. The \"prime\" chairs are clearly considered to be the ones surrounding the perimeter of the infinity-edge pool, with a gorgeous view of the beach. Although the hotel's daily newsletter reminds guests that unattended belongings on chairs will be removed after 20 minutes, this is never done because nearly all the guests seem to \"reserve\" chairs, sometimes for hours (>4 hrs was the longest stretch I was aware of). That being said, we never had trouble getting two chairs next to each other in this \"prime\" location. The first morning, we lucked out because we probably didn't arrive until 9:30 or 10. The morning at 9, and after that, I was usually there between 7:40 and 8:00 am. I would say that by 8am, probably 60-70% of these chairs had been reserved; however, there were still TONS of open chairs on the beach, including the first row with an unobstructed view of the ocean, and TONS of chairs around the other pool. Finding a nice place to sit for the day will not be a problem, and if you want the infinity-edge pool, you don't have to get up at the crack of dawn for it. Food - we ate dinner at Las Ventanas (2 nights), Azia (2 nights), and Palazzo (1 night). We never had anything less than a spectacular dinner at all of those restaurants. I know some people have negatively reviewed Azia or Palazzo, but my husband and I have pretty high expectations and we were never disappointed. We usually had lunch at Spices or the Snack Bar, both of which were good (would definitely recommend Spices over the Snack Bar). The breakfast buffet at Spices was good, but we ended up eating the other 4 mornings at Las Ventanas for the a la carte breakfast. It's just a very elegant, civilized setting, and they had lovely egg-white omelets, as well as fresh-made oatmeal. You could also get pancakes, waffles, french toast, etc. there. I hadn't seen many other reviews comment on breakfast at Las Ventanas, and I think it's a shame if people don't try it, because it was one of our favorite aspects of the stay there - a very elegant experience. Gym - Totally adequate, and actually pretty good as far as most hotel gyms go. Two rooms - one with an elliptical machine (Precor), and 4 treadmills. The other room had 3 exercise bikes, and multiple Cybex weight machines, along with a full bench of free weights. Both rooms have TVs and there are towels, and a refrigerator full of cold water bottles and orange juice. My only comment would be that ideally, they could trade out a treadmill for a second elliptical machine, but the gym was never very crowded (usually only a couple of people at a time). Business center - 4 computers with internet access, and supposedly the whole resort has wireless (didn't bring a laptop to try it out). The service - the most outstanding aspect of the resort. Everyone is incredibly friendly, attentive, warm, and welcoming. They really go out of their way to make sure that you are enjoying yourself, and will try to do anything to help you in that regard. By far the best service I've ever had at any resort, hotel, or restaurant. There are multiple waiters who serve the pool/beach area, and will bring you lunch to your chair, cold moistened towels, spritz with cold water, fruit, etc. You feel incredibly catered to and pampered. Activities - they offer lots of activities continually, although some things seem to be better attended than others: yoga, tai chi, water aerobics, Spanish lessons, bocce ball, scuba lessons, sala dancing, karaoke, etc. I think if you went to this resort with a large group of friends, that might be a great way to take advantage of some of the various activities that are constantly offered. All in all, it was a magical trip. We loved every minute of it, we loved the staff of the hotel, and we can't wait to go back. If you decide to go, I hope you enjoy this resort as much as my husband and I did.", "Date": "March 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cGreat Trip\u201d", "Author": "carson01", "ReviewID": "UR7203310", "Content": "I have stayed at some of the top resorts around the world.

The Royal Hideaway has a personal concierge for each villa (which has about 16 rooms), who is responsible for scheduling your dinner each night along with any other additional acitivities you may wish to do while you're there. They have something going on every hour at the resort, if you wish to participate. Some examples include: scuba diving lessons, dancing, Spanish lessons, boccie ball, tennis, yoga, pilates, tai chi, ping pong, water aerobics, and many others. It is so great to have these options, in case you want to do something besides laying out, drinking, and eating all of the time. Because it was an all-inclusive resort, I was originally concerned about the food -- I am a picky eater. However, each one of their restaurants has DELICIOUS food, all with an incredible presentation too! Be sure that men pack khaki pants or slacks and a polo or button-up shirt. They prefer you not wear shorts to the restaurants at night because they have a more dressy atmosphere. The servers at the resort are extremely friendly and want to help in any way they can!

Ok, the beach has gone and as Europeans like a sandy beach with palms and usually prefer the beach to the pool area, they may be a bit jealous to the nearby RIU, which reflects the idea of a beach of most Europeans. But, on my opinion, there is no comparison with the RIU Palace. First of all you don\u2019t have to wear this bothersome arm wrist. There are strict security controls at the entrance gate, which gives you a good feeling of security. The service is excellent, really 5 Stars and so are the rooms, especially after being remodeled, when we last stayed there 4 years ago we thought that they need remodeling, now they have had it and it\u2019s perfect now. Room maintenance/cleaning is very attentive and clean. Room service/food is very prompt although the choice is not too big, but it\u2019s included. They stocked the minibar according to our wishes, great! Pool area is very nice but you have to get up early, say at least 9 am to get a good bed at the pool. Usually no problem for Europeans as with the time difference we get up very early without problems. But on my opinion, paying that much for a hotel, everybody should have a guaranteed bed at the pool. No discussion on that point, I don\u2019t know how the hotel can resolve the problem but they have to. But I think what realy will delight even the most demanding guest is he quality of the cuisine. Forget all you heard about \u201eall-inclusive\u201c. It is a genuine \u201eLeading hotel of the world\u201c with the kind of Restaurants one knows from these hotels from overseas, even better. Especially \u201eVentanas\u201c has a stylish, clean and very \u201eurban\u201c interior with a top notch gastronomy. I think the food can be compared to food of Restaurants having around 16 points on the common scale in Europe. Only the service of the waiters, though being very cordial, is not as sophisticated as the cuisine. I don\u2019t think that there is another resort hotel which serves an 8 course \u201emenu de degustation\u201c to their guests with the corresponding wines on an all-inclusive basis. The Asian Restaurant too is very classy. And, again, it\u2019s not just the ordinary \u201esweet-and-sour\u201c or cheap Thai, here we are talking about Teppanyaki Grill and Sushi on demand, again on an all inclusive basis. The only letdown is the Italian Restaurant. It serves very good food, but it is not Italian food as served in Italy but Italian food as served in the US. For lunch I suggest going to the spices instead of the snack bar. The Menu of the snack bar might appeal more to the straightforward taste with burgers, chicken wings, Ceasar Salads etc. At Spices you also can sit outside but there is a nice choice of Mexican food with a more cordial service in a relaxed an chic atmosphere. The only annoyance is that you have to book your dinner reservations well in advance unless you want to eat at 9'30 pm... The Cocktails also are very good and made with famous brands. The wine, well, when I\u2019m in the Caribbean I\u2019m not in a \u201ewine-mood\u201c, it\u2019s to warm and the wines are not terrible. To give you an Example, what is served as Champagne can be compared to the common Spanish sparkling Wines one can get for around 10 \u2013 15 Euros at Supermarkets throughout Europe. So, have a Mojito instead, or ask staff/another Guest for advice on a great Cocktail. The atmosphere is very relaxed and not as stiff as it can be in comparable lactations elsewhere. On the other hand, don\u2019t expect to see the latest on style and fashion. If you are into that, than go to Sardinia or somewhere else in Italy. Fortunately there is virtually no animation or organized activities as there are no children and only very few teenagers. So it is very quiet although sometimes some guests might form a group of joking people and having fun with a few drinks, but it never turned into primitivity, at the most frisky I would say. So, go there, you won\u2019t be disappointed if you want to relax, eat very well and get pampered in an easy and relaxed atmosphere with only very few other European guests.", "Date": "March 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york", "Title": "\u201c30TH ANNIVERSARY TOTAL R AND R\u201d", "Author": "seanote", "ReviewID": "UR7119888", "Content": "We have just returned from a 6 night stay at RH for our 30th wedding anniversary.

We vacationed there with two other couples. All in all, we were very pleased but I don't feel that RH quite reaches it's 5-star rating. The physical property itself is very beautiful and in immaculate condition and all the public areas are fabulous. The grounds are kept highly manicured and we often wondered how many full time groundskeepers they employed in order to do so. The swimming pools are just OK, a little small and not particularly attractive. I noticed a few very small tiles missing below water level, which is a pet peeve of mine. The rooms are above average in appearance and very well appointed. One of the issues I had was with the concierge situation. Beginning about after lunchtime, many guests took care of business with their concierge whose desk is located in the center of the villa. Their voices are amplified by shape of the building, and this makes an afternoon nap very difficult. I also had a few issues with our maid not refreshing tea/coffee supplies, and one time she didn't return our bathmats or robes for 24 hours. This isn't typically a big deal to me, but when a resort claims to be 5 star, I expect a lot. We also had a poor experience in Palazzo on our last night. We had 9:30 pm reservations, and we arrived on time, but were not served our first course until 10:20 pm. After about 11 pm, we were about the only diners left in the restaurant and they began going through their closing duties while we were still dining. We were still waiting on our main course after midnight, and the manager came over and tried to get us to leave because it was so late. He explained that because we ordered all 5 courses, that is what was taking so long. He was annoyed that we ordered so much food, and tried to make us feel bad about it. But, the food was fabulous, as it was in all the restaurants during our short stay! Afternoon Tea was good one day, and poor the next in both service and snacks. Ventanas was good, Azia was very good. Breakfast was always wonderful and lunch in the \"snack bar\" was also excellent. I've never had such delicious and well-presented food before at an AI. One other negative about our stay involved a group of business people who arrived on Friday afternoon. They basically came in and \"took over\" the resort pool areas and two of the restaurants (Spices and The Grill) were closed for dinner for two nights in a row for private parties. Setting up for their party on Saturday night that was held at the Grill and by the pool began about 3 pm that afternoon and we were basically ran out of the pool area. The employees began setting up tables and removing any chaise lounge that wasn't occupied. It was an uncomfortable situation for those of us who enjoy late afternoons by the pool and hot tubs. All in all, I'd have to say that I enjoyed the trip but probably won't return unless I get a really good deal (price wise).", "Date": "March 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cRomantic all inclusive paradise\u201d", "Author": "GGChicago", "ReviewID": "UR6918037", "Content": "Royal hideaway is fantastic. I have been to other all inclusives in Mexico and what sets this resort apart from the others is service and food. The way the resort makes you feel like royalty is all the difference. My wife and I are in our early thirties and we were looking for a second honeymoon and this resort was it. First of all, the resort tailored to what we were looking for. If you want a resort to feel Romance, then the hideaway can provide that through fantastic restaurants. We ate lunch daily at the outside grill which was good but not as great as spices where you can order slightly better selections off a menu. Palazzo and Las ventanas were great which provided the ambiance we were looking for. Each restaurant is beautifully decorated and makes you feel a touch of gourmet and fine dining on a nightly basis. I would rate the restaurants as a major highlight of our stay and give them 5 out of 5 stars. I have to comment on how much I like the locals. They seem so humble in their service and they are very likeable. I do enjoy that about going to Mexico. The pools were very nice. It is extremely quiet at the Royal. There is no loud music but occasional soft jazz by the pool including a live sax player in the afternoon. This is important to know since this resort offers sophistication, quiet, and great service. Most couples are drinking pina coladas and mixed drinks but their are no microphones or activities that are loud by the pool like some other resorts.....no children are allowed which adds to the couples resort mentality. The beach is the only complaint about this place right now. They have a beach to walk on, however, they have sandbags in place to stop the erosion, it takes away from its beauty and swimming in the ocean was very difficult while I was there. Hopefully, the can do something to make it better. You could still lay on the beach as I did and search for shells and the water is a beautiful turquoise and still gives you the ambiance of waves crashing in....so that is nice. We did get up early to reserve chairs the first day...around 8am but plenty were still available and I would recommend getting up early to try the beds by the pool. They are so comfortable and the waitors can bring you your drinks.....it was nice having everything included....we could drink and eat as much as we wanted and not worry how much money we were spending. Special hello to the friends we made on the beach beds who were Iowa hawkeye alumnis and to our friends from Chicago on the north side.

The service was great and room service was prompt. I used the shoe shine service where you drop your shoes in a box outside the room and they shine and clean them up for you. Your concierge can answer any questions you might have as each room is assigned one. We skipped the Royal theatre based on previous reviews and the Allegria had some activity each night which included......Karaoke, casino night, live music for after dinner drinks.... The grounds are so beautiful with private relaxtion pools and perfectly manicured grounds with tropical plants and foliage.....Awesome.

We never had to wait in line even for breakfast and lunch. We had a room bordering the Occidental Allegro, but it was silent: no noise problems at all.

The beach was very windy, at some spots, but the pools were mild. Drinks freely flowed everywhere, and you could ever order food to your chair. The food was decent. Desserts everywhere were beautifully presented and delicious. The breakfast buffet at Spices was better than the ala carte at Las Ventanas. Las Ventanas had the best dinner. Palazzo had mediocre food with the slowest service, and they got our drink orders wrong multiple times. Sushi at Azia was mediocre (we're sushi connoiseurs), but we ate it all. (We didn't expect much...after all it's Japanese food in Mexico!) We had no digestive troubles: ate fresh fruit, raw fish, beef and eggs not well done, and I had the authenic Huitlacoches mushrooms. (And no pre-vacation prepping with probiotics...) The afternoon tea is also a great midday refresher. Fruit was also served every afternoon at 4:00 by the pool by cart so you don't even have to get up. We walked into town the first day. Try the mangoes at the fruit cart by the beach, but the coconut was tasteless. It was nice to walk around and explore. My only complaints, if you call them that, were 1) we got some mosquito bites.

We found all the staff extremely pleasant and helpful. We were due to check in by 11pm on 2/16 but because of an unexpected plane delay we did not check in until 2 am. The concierge who greeted us was very nice and very efficient she made sure our luggage was in our room before we got there. We ordered some food and it was delivered in less than 10 minutes-granted it was 2 am! In the morning we went to our Villa concierge to make all dinner reservations and had no problem getting reservations for 7 or 7:30. We stayed in Villa 29. Didn't have a problem with noise from the resort next door. One night I heard their music but it stopped at 11pm. The beach is not what is advertised. The water is beautiful, the sand soft, there are about 20 huge sandbags to help stop the erosion. The good thing is that water flows over the bags and creates a pool of water in front of the water bags. To get to the actual water, you need to climb or slide over the bags-no big deal. It just doesn't look very pretty. There are people working every day sucking up sand from the bottom of the ocean and trying to build the beach back up but it is a short term solution. Rumor has it that a major beach overhaul will take place in March. The chair situation is not as bad as I thought. The chairs are very close to each other on the beach and there are a lot of them. The staff will place a hood over your chairs if you want shade. Never was there a shortage. The pool chairs are close to each other too. There are 2 pools, the infinity edge (lower) and the activities pool (above). The chairs by the infinity edge go right away because you face the ocean and the chairs do not go around the entire pool. We had no problem getting 3 chairs around the activities pool as late as 10. The staff puts rolled towels on all chairs. So sometimes it looks like the chairs are saved but they are not. The first day we tried to tip the pool guys in hopes that they would help us get chairs the next day and they would NOT accept any tips. They explained that they would get us chairs and an umbrella if there weren't any available and to not worry, it turned out they were right. We ate at all the restuarants. The food is good for an all inclusive. The menus are not extensive. There is alway a chicken, fish and beef. The dishes are not your standard everyday preparation, so if you should dine at Palazzo and want spaghetti with tomato sauce or chicken parm-you are not going to find it. The presentation is beautiful and the service is good. You are not rushed, your drinks are refilled quickly. The staff explains every dish. The drinks are made with named brand alcohol and wine is also included, however if you order a bottle of wine there is a charge. There is a decent wine list-by bottle only. There is not much to do in the evenings. They have Club Royale which offers dinner and a show once (maybe more) a week. The show is ok--do not expect Broadway or Vegas type productions. Acrobats and singing mostly. At the Allegra bar they have nightly events...kareoke, salsa dancing, 70's etc. You can walk into the town of Playa del Carmen. It is a 25 min. walk. Lots of people walking along with you-there are many different resorts and villas along the way You will find Senor Frogs, Carlos and Charlies, lots of bars and restuarants including Burger King and Starbucks. Lots of the typical flea market shops and souveniers. The town goes for several long blocks. The ferry to Cozumel leaves from this area. Not sure of fee. Along with a bus to Cancun, about $3 per person. If you don't want a 25 min. walk to buy your souveniers, walk out of the resort, make a left go about 3 minutes and you have a mini area that has all the same stuff. If you want to walk along the beach, more than the 100 yards of the resort beach-go into town and walk that beach. The gym is tight and has the basic equipment. Didn't do spa treatments. The resort has 2 well lit tennis courts along with a basketball court. There is also a library of sorts and the towel hut has some magazines and games you can use. It is about a 40 minute drive from airport. We made sure to have private transfers to and from airport otherwise you stop at every hotel along the way. A cab is about $45 each way. We had our daughter with us. There were a few other teens there too. Not much for them to do but relax and that seemed to be fine with them. If you need entertainment and enjoy pool volleyball and poolside bingo, lots of music this is not the resort for you. This is a very quiet, peaceful resort.

We chose the Occidental Royal Hideaway because it was a 5 star all inclusive. We were reserved with 2 adults and one child, a 15 year old as provided through Travelocity. We booked our airfare and hotel and completed our contract with Travelocity by paying in full. When we arrived at the hotel, The Occidental Royal Hideaway, our travel voucher was reviewed and accepted at check in. The day before we left, the reservation desk called our room at 7:30 p.m. on a Friday and said that there was a problem with our reservation. We went to the desk to speak with Antonio and he explained that Travelocity did not pay for our daughter. We showed them our reservation confirmation and they said that they already had a copy of it, but Travelocity was not paying them enough for our daughter. They said that the Royal Hideaway did not have a childs rate and she should be counted as an adult. We said that Royal Hideaway had this information when we checked in andour daughter was with us at check in, why were we not told this at that point. They did not have an answer that made sense. They said that they had just spoken to Travelocity and if Travelocity would not pay for the difference, we had to pay the additional $2,450! We only had one room and although the resort is all inclusive, our daughter did not eat $2,450 worth of food in 6 days. They said that we must pay the rack rate because she was not reserved as an adult at the time of booking. We explained that Travelocity accepted the reservation knowing that she was 15 years old. They said we had to pay or we could not leave the resort. We tried unsuccessfully to call Travelocity and we were left on hold and transfered from agent to agent for several hours on two occasions. Anel, the hotel desk manager at The Royal Hideaway even suggested that we should pay for the phone call made at their desk since were were using their phone! We called our credit card company and they said that we could pay the bill and put it in dispute. The next day, when we paid by credit card, we tried to denote this on the paperwork that Anel, the hotel desk manager made us sign, but she would not let us and tore up the copy with our complaint. Anel said that we could not denote our complaint our her paperwork because it did not \"look good for the hotel\". She went as far as telling the bell man not to let us leave until they had the copy of our complaint back. Anel also would not let us have a copy of their registration form, which they forced us to sign. For two days, we asked to speak to the hotel manager, Jean Agarrista, and we were told that he was not in. We asked why this was not brought to our attention sooner. They said they didn't know until the night before we left. We asked how much they were paid by Travelocity for the hotel stay, they said they didn't know because it was a travel agent rate. But we were going to be charged full rack rate for our daughter. Travelocity admitted that they made the error on their website, but they then kept us on hold for 80 minutes before we had to hang up to make our flight This issue was between Travelocity and The Occidental Royal Hideaway and should have been resolved between them. The Occidental Royal Hideaway did not want to deal with Travelocity because it was much easier to hold our family hostage and demand payment from us, a American family without support in a foreign country. It was extremely upsetting to us and our daughter. They even demanded that our 15 year old daughter, a minor, sign their registration form before we left. We have stayed at other five star hotels and resorts around the world (Ocean Clubin Paradise Island, Halakalani in Oahu, Kea Lani in Maui, Hotel Gritti Palace in Venice, Hermitage in Monte Carlo etc.) We have never, ever been treated with such disrespect and hatred. It is unfortunate that this happened. The property is beautiful and with the exception of everyone in the registration area, the staff (wait staff, housekeeping concierge etc.) were very polite and helpful. More unfortunately, this expierence has spoiled our view of what we thought was a beautiful country and I doubt that we will ever return to Mexico.

I want to share two basic conclusions I have come to before giving my review. 1st Do lots of research before booking anywhere. Decide what is important to you. Are you bringing kids, teens? Do you want quiet or activity etc etc. 2nd There is no perfect resort and for me that is good news. I need to keep looking. My goal is to vacation two times a year once to try a new resort and once for a return visit to a favorite resort. This resort will be a return visit. My review will be based on the resort only. Not conditions they can not control i.e.. weather and beach. Staff: They were helpful and genuinely kind and friendly. From check in (our room was ready at 2 and while we waited we were escorted to the spa so we could change for the beach) to bars, to dinner, to our final departure when two bell attendants waived goodbye. They want you to have a great time. And they are just nice people. Rooms: Lovely. We asked for a quiet room in the middle of the property. No room was available in the middle, but we were given a quiet room in a side building closest to the beach and pool. Grounds: Lovely, lush, romantic. winding through fountains,flowers and trees. Restaurants: Nice background music, beautiful setting and wonderful food. Loved Ventanas, and Palazzo. Spices was good not great. I asked them to grill mahi mahi with garlic butter sauce(not on the menu). They did and it was wonderful. Breakfast was very good. Bars: We loved listening to piano music at Ventanas. Also loved the music at Allegria. Unpublished is the bar at Azia with fun different drinks. In general the drinks were tasty, not fabulous. So so wine. Tea: Our favorite thing to do was listen to the great sax player at tea time in the beautiful outdoor lobby area. Fun sandwiches and pastries. Great Mayan coffee and Champagne. Pools: The main two pools were disappointing to me. Ovals with tightly packed chairs. We chose to lie by the many quiet relaxation pools or the quiet deck in front of the beach club. Beach: Another disappointment. Not because of the beach erosion, but because (check resorts own photos) it is crowded with chairs. Very few private spots or palms.. The water and sand are beautiful. We will go back because the overall experience fits us. Quiet, beautiful, sophisticated yet friendly. Tea time, bars, food, relaxation pools and quiet areas. The perfect resort would have less people at the main pool and a beach with private areas under palm trees. I am still looking for the perfect resort and am going to love every minute looking.", "Date": "February 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "natick, ma", "Title": "\u201cExcellent in all ways but price!\u201d", "Author": "naticktraveler", "ReviewID": "UR6813825", "Content": "My wife and I stayed here in Jan 2007. Overall a very good stay, but still too expensive. The location is good, but the resort is in the midst of 10-15 neighboring resorts; there's no exclusivity in this area. Here's a quick summary: Pros: -Ventanas. Superb food, I had the cornish hen & fettucine/mushroom dishes, and both were truly 5-star quality. The other restaurants were of average quality. -Excellent appearance. The lobby, grounds, pool area & rooms were all excellent & well maintained. -Staff. Most were friendly and helpful. Cons: -tipping. Its supposed to be included but most Americans tipped for preferred service - truly absurd, as now most staff provide preferential treatment for those willing to tip. -price. Frankly $650+/night is simply too expensive for any property that isn't a true 5-star in all aspects. -reserving of pool chairs. This seems to be well documented, but I'd add that chairs with rolled towels on them are available; the staff prepare chairs that way for guests in the morning -- they are NOT reserved. We mistakenly thought any chair with towels was taken. -dinner reservations. We made dinner reservations for all four nights when we first arrived. Yet we could only get 6pm or 10pm reservations - quite absurd. -drink selection. All bars except the Piano bar at Ventanas offer Absolut, Dewars, etc. To enjoy Black Label, Grey Goose & other truly top-shelf brands, you have to go to the more time-restrictive Ventanas bar.", "Date": "February 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Near Milwaukee, WI", "Title": "\u201cThree times is not a charm...\u201d", "Author": "nodarkroom", "ReviewID": "UR6812236", "Content": "Excellent food Water leak in room not fixed promptly \u201cLuxury Oceanview\u201d rooms overpriced Pool great no problem getting good chairs Be sure and call ahead to reserve your day of arrival restaurant dinner Friendly staff at pool and restaurants Not only is beach gone but you can\u2019t \u201cbeachwalk\u201d to north or south Huge 30\u2019 sandbags prevent easy access to surf and ocean swimming RH seems to be filling up with business groups not couples Entire restaurants are closed some nights to handle large business groups Management smiles and makes promises but never intends to keep them With no beach and ability to walk up and down the beach to other resorts RH is overpriced and we don\u2019t plan to return. If \u201cno beach\u201d isn\u2019t a problem for you and you like great food and service this is still a great place to stay My wife and I just returned from a six night stay at Royal Hideaway (February 10-16). This was our third stay and a lot has changed since our last visit. Yes, there were some things that were better but many of the things that made Royal Hideaway \u201cspecial\u201d are gone. One of the highlights of RH is the food. Our meals were spectacular. The selection, presentation and quality of the food is equal to the best available in large cities in USA. I had called RH one week prior to our arrival to reserve a restaurant selection for the day that we arrived. We selected Las Ventanas and the meal was superb. A second dinner at Ventanas turned out to be my favorite meal of the trip. My wife\u2019s favorite meal was at Palazzo. The Azia has changed from our last trip from a Thai oriented restaurant to a Japanese/Chinese theme. Our complaint last time was the Thai theme had too many \u201chot and spicy\u201d dishes. The new Azia had numerous menu items that looked good and our waiter explained each item making our selection easy. The food and presentation were great. We also had several great meals at Spices. We had daily lunch at The Snack Bar and breakfast at Spices. I just can\u2019t say enough good things about the food at RH! Now for some of the things that disappointed us. We arrived before the 3PM check in time and we had a two hour wait until our room was ready. During this time we were able to eat and have a drink \u2013 no problem. During our last stay we paid for a Luxury Oceanview room and stayed at the building known as \u201cLas Margaritas\u201d which was right on the beach facing the ocean. On this trip we again paid for Oceanview room but were placed in building 22 on the third floor. This building is almost in the front of the resort and is about two blocks away from the beach. Yes, if you go out on the balcony and look between two other buildings you can \u201csee\u201d the beach. After checking I realized the mistake was mine. Both our old room and the new one indeed were \u201cOceanview\u201d and we had just been lucky last time to have a room that close to the beach. Had I known this I would not have upgraded to \u201cOceanview\u201d. After arriving in our room we washed our hands and took a walk. Upon returning my wife noticed a lot of water on the bathroom floor. We assumed that the housekeeper had spilled something so we called a housekeeper and she took care of it. We again washed our hands and left the room. When we returned the water on the floor was back. This time I look around and discovered that the drain under the sink was broken and as we washed our hands all of the water was running down the wall and eventually ending up on the bathroom floor. I tried to call the concierge but got no answer so I walked up to the reception area and asked how I could contact the main concierge. The two men on duty asked me what the problem was and I explained the water problem including the fact that I thought I had identified the source of the water. Both men appeared to understand me (I was not upset) but after listening to me they said that they would solve my problem by sending over someone with \u201cmore bottled water\u201d! Wow talk about a language problem\u2026.I again explained and this time they got it and told me that they would \u201cimmediately\u201d send a repairman to our room. I returned to the room and realized that our luggage still not had been delivered to the room (we had been at the resort for three hours). I called the bellman and he said he would rush it over. Time passed. We sat waiting for our luggage and the repairman. Finally our luggage arrived. We decided to get ready for dinner. We finished getting ready for dinner and walked over the front desk and told them that the repair man had not arrived. It had been about 1 \u00bd hours since I reported the water leak. We had dinner and returned to our room and the leak had been fixed and did not return during the balance of our stay. We did not have any problem in getting good chairs next to the pool. We left our chairs to go to lunch and there was never a problem with anyone trying to steal them. The beach is gone. You cannot beach walk to the north or to the south because the water is up to the buildings. This was our biggest disappointment of the trip. My wife is not a swimmer and not being able to walk up and down the beach is a bummer. This point alone would prevent us from returning to the RH. I am a good swimmer but found it very difficult to get over the huge (big as trucks) bags of sand that RH is trying to use the stop the beach sand erosion. Drinks were available at all times and were very good. The only thing I noticed was that most of the tropical drinks seemed to taste the same. Still they were very refreshing. The RH must use a different way to deliver hot and cold water to the rooms. It is very hard to adjust to the correct temperature for your shower. When you turn the faucet to change the temperature it takes 20 seconds for the water temperature to change. RH\u2019s attempt to fix the beach involves six men shoveling sand from one area to another. They also have a pump moving sand towards the beach. During our stay I saw no progress whatsoever. In looking back several months from other posted photos the beach hasn\u2019t improved at all. In our first two visits we noticed almost everyone staying at the RH was either a couple or part of a small group. This time we noticed large groups of 30 to 45 business people. I believe that lost beach has resulted in RH discounting rooms to large groups to keep the resort 100% filled. It was 100% filled for a portion of our current visit. Other posts have mentioned that RH staff constantly makes promises that they never have any intention of keeping. For example, during check in we told the check in person that our flight out left at 10:30 PM and could we workout a later check out time. He told me that he thought it was possible but he needed to check with his boss who was returning one day prior to our departure date. As the date approached I spoke with our building concierge who indicated that we could probably get a \u201ccourtesy room\u201d that we could use the day of our departure but we would have to wait until the day we left to find out for sure. We checked the day of our departure and were told that since they were at 100% filled we couldn\u2019t stay in our room past noon or get a courtesy room. The told us we could use the spa to shower later in the day and that worked out fine. I would have preferred, since they knew all along that they would be at 100% filled, that they would have told us during checkin that using the spa was our only option. I could have saved myself a lot of time checking back and forth during the week. We had friends staying at the Iberostar Quetzal about \u00bd a mile to our south and they treated us to a day pass at their resort. We had a wonderful time.

Stay away if you're looking for a structured party atmosphere, if you don't appreciate fine food, or if you're looking for the finest in rooms. For dinner, two of the five restaurants are truly 5 star restaurants. Palazzo and Las Ventanas are the best. The other three are four stars on a good night, three stars on a bad night. Breakfast and lunch options are more limited -- good, but not outstanding. But the reality is that it's tough to eat more than one fine meal a day, so we didn't see this as an issue. Service is outstanding and polished. We heard \"no\" only once. (we essentially tried to get breakfast pastries delivered to the pool) The pool bar service is unbelievable. I don't think we ever went more than 10 minutes between being offered a drink, fresh fruit, a cool towel, etc. There thankfully is no \"forced\" fun or activities, and since the resort does not allow children, it is a mature and very relaxed atmosphere. However, there was very little in the way of nightlife which depending on your interests may be a drawback. For those seeking a late night party, jump in a taxi and head to town where the scene is more authentic and energetic than that typically found on a resort. As of February 2007, they are still rebuilding the beach. As a result, it's a bit of a chore to get to the water. You basically either need to walk out on a series of huge sandbags, or walk over to the adjoining resort and wade in there. Neither are huge deals, but if you prefer the sea to the pool, it might be something to think about. The pool area is full as very few people opt to use the sand chairs. Furthermore, the best chairs with a sea view are saved by 8 a.m. While we hated sinking to this level, after a couple of days we gave in to get chairs with a view and the cooling breeze that comes with it. The rooms are very nice, but not as nice as the nightly rate would seem to dictate. They are clean and well appointed, but seem somewhat dated given that I believe the resort opened in 2000. Request a top floor room as the ceiling is vaulted and you won't be forced to listen to chairs scraping on the floor above you. (we switched after the first night) Also, some ground floor rooms have views of things like utility cart paths. Consider booking directly with the hotel in order to be able to specify a room preference. Make your dinner reservations either in advance or when you check in. Capacity seems to be managed so that diners are spread evenly throughout the restaurants and throughout the evening. As a result, it can be difficult to get a table in the better restaurants even on nights that the resort is at less than capacity.

I could not have wished for anything better for our honeymoon! From the second we arrived at the front gates to the last, sad second of saying goodbye to the Bellman, we felt like and were treated like absolute royalty. Our location in Villa 24, Las Orquideas, was the closest to the beach of any of the Villas. Our room did not face the ocean or the pool, but we were certainly not there to stare out the windows! We were literally 10 steps to the pool area and about 20 to the beach, who could complain!?! The entire staff was warm and welcoming and could not seem to do enough for all of the guests. You don't have to get up out of your beach chair all day if you so desire. The waiters bring drinks quickly and will also bring you any menu items from the Snack Bar (large menu). Other staff circulate throughout the day with fresh fruit on carts, fresh towels and a refreshing mineral face spray. My husband and I especially loved the waiter Reyes at the Snack Bar, Karina at Las Ventanas Piano Bar/Tea Time/Allegria Bar and LOVED the \"jack of all trades\" Energizer Bunny Fernando!! These three really went above and beyond and were so, so nice! Yes, we tipped everyone and they certainly appreciated it. How can you not when they do so much for you?? We ate at all of the restaurants with the exception of having dinner at Spices. We only had buffet breakfast there but it was terrific. Las Ventanas really blew us away! You felt like you were in a chic NYC restaurant and the food was on par with that feel. The Chef is doing an amazing job there. Azia and Palazzo were also very good! Palazzo was a bit of a heavy meal for me but I have no complaints about the quality of the food! We didn't have anything at all that was not good. We always ordered several appetizers to try different stuff. Be sure to get a shrimp cocktail by the pool and a Leaping Lizard drink! Yummy! On a side note, ALL of the bars have Grey Goose but the Snack Bar waiters told us they only had Stoli and Absolute. If you want it, be sure to tell them that you know they have it and they will get it. Also, be sure to go to afternoon tea! So much fun and the food and Mayan Coffee was great! Be sure to have Karina make yours!! Yes, the pool chair game is in full effect, but we didn't have any trouble finding some spot to relax in. It may not have been a pool front beach bed each day, but who cares. Anywhere you lay there, you are in the warm sun of Mexico with wonderful service all around you. If the location of your beach chair ruins your vacation, then anything will and you will never be satisfied. I can't say enough about The Royal Hideaway!

On Feb 1st, we watched the neighboring Rui Playacar Hotel's beach lose 4 feet of its embanked sea wall and a giant palm tree fall into the sea. The waves were so powerful that there was no one swimming for 5 straight days. Now that you have been made aware of this serrious issue confronting the area of Playa del Carmen, let me return to why the hotel itself deserves a 5 rating. This hotel has exceptional service, comparable to the best Asian resort hotels. From check in to check out, the service was just plain great. The noise from the Rui Hotel can be loud so request a room on the quieter side. The pool areas are a bit conjested but we never had an issue as we sat on the chairs on the sand by the beach. They will bring little tent covers to put on two adjoining chairs. Two pools were cool and comfortable. We used all 5 of the hot tubs more than the pools. PDC is a gated community and you can run around the entire communjity on the sidewalks. It is a 5k loop run. The other reviews here on this site covering the food, spa, drinks and undersized gym are accurate. I read two of these reviews and had a small test. One reviewer had wished that they served diet coke versus pepsi. So I requested it for my room and the concierge put it there daily. Another review complained that there was no grey goose vodka and I spoted it now being served at the paino bar. The office people here said that they do read this site often and take these comments seriously. Just wanted to add 2 unplanned trips that were suggested by the tour guide in the hotel. We went to the historic site of Talum, overlooking the sea 45 minutes to the south. We had the bellman arrange a taxi who took us there waited the 2+ hours and returned us for $90. If you do this 1/2 day trip, wear your bathing suits under your walking clothes. The veteran visitors and locals walk right pass ths site and straight down to the beatiful small beaches at this national park. We wished that we had done this since there is no useable beach at our hotel. Another suggested day trip we did on our own but the tour office can arrange it as well (I speak coversational Spanish). We walked into PDC (25 minutes) and took the 9am ferry to Cozumel for $10 each. We rented a jeep wrangler at Budget (all the agencies are 2 blocks up from the ferry) for $90. You drive out to the west beaches for snorkeling, then down to the south point to see blue waves at the national park with the lighthouse (We paid $5 to enter or $10 if you do some other things) and then over to the East side with the long beaches and surfing type waves. Per the hotel guy, we stopped at Chen Rio for an on-the-beach lobster lunch ($40 total) and headed back inland where you stop at a Mayan historic site. Then back on a 4pm ferry. It was a nice day drip to explore something other than the hotel. You can contact Sarah at the hotel's customer service email spot on their website. She is very helpful for a Mayan girl straight from Calgary. My wife and I haven't decided if we will be coming back here as so many of their customers do. If you want to be pampered and just relax, this is a great place to go. If you want a beach and more adventures, there are other choices.", "Date": "February 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "NYC Area", "Title": "\u201cSo, so.\u201d", "Author": "Ralph1968", "ReviewID": "UR6720179", "Content": "Great spa, great food, great personnel. However......only through an extremely broad definition of the word/concept 'beach' could I consider that this resort has a 'beach'. There are 3 rows of chairs lined up like spaces in a parking lot...then its about 3 feet to the water. Then just a bit of water and the Geo Tech inflated bags begin-----accompanied by hoses in an apparent attempt to reclaim some sort of beach. I just returned from 7 days at this resort. The pools are nice, but by 7am at least 90% of the spaces (including all of those directly at pool side) are 'reserved' by very early risers. So, having no intent of getting up at 5 or 6 am to walk down to the pool area and place a book or sandle on a chair, I usually got left out. The resort supposedly has a policy where , after 20 minutes of no activity, they can remove personal items from a chair (at least the resort has a blurb on the front of their daily news letter about stuff left on chairs unattended for over 20 minutes). Ha. Never saw stuff removed and a chair made available even when I questioned resort employees about it. The resort management seems to encourge reserving chairs. Heck, I could live with a 90 minute limit on inactivity. But I saw chairs go unused for 2 to 3 hours and the resort personnel did nothing (I know. I could move the stuff. But, I'm not in a confrontational mood and why should I have to?) I think 'all inclusive' includes management managing the pool area. I've been to a lot of resorts, and its never this difficult to get a good place by a pool or the beach. But, given the condition of the 'beach', its very hard to find a nice place to take in some sun. While I've seen a problem similar to this one at other resorts, I've never seen it this bad. A few other points. In my opinion, the rooms are average for this type class of hotel/resort. Everything worked, but they weren't anything special. And, make sure you get a room in one of the center buildings (that is, unless you would enjoy the loud music/noise at night from the neighboring resorts).

So it was with trepidation that we booked an all inclusive for our vacation. That said I utilized my best resource, TripAdvisor, and decided that Royal Playacar Hideaway seemed to have the right mix of high quality and small size that we desired. We requested a garden room in the inside villas (25,26,27) so it would be quiet and we had a semi-ocean view in villa 27 which was perfect. We were on the bottom floor and would suggest the top floor since people dragging their chairs early in the morning can be most annoying. The rooms were very nice. I went to hang my cloting and the rod feel off the closet wall. I told Ava our wonderful concierge and with-in minutes it was fixed. All the lights can be dimmed from the bedside as can the speed of the ceiling fan be controlled. We had a nice bottle of chapagne in our room when we arrived. We had reserved in advance our first nights dining at Ventanas and it was really a nice dining experience. The next moring at the resonable hour of 9 I set out to get chairs by the pool. All the seats seemed to be taken as they had towels but I found two. The next morning I asked the staff how all the chairs could be taken so early and they told me that they put out the towels as a curtesy so I found that most chairs were actually available despite having towels on them. It is true they only have 7-8 floats for the pool but no one uses them all day. If you are too shy to ask a fellow guest if the float is in use then ask the activities staff and they will find one for you. They were wonderful, particularilly Julio who is charming and very helpful to everyone. Security does a great job of keeping out those who do not belong on the porperty so it is very safe. On day two my in closet safe jammed and could not be opened. This eventually required that the safe be drilled and replaced. All this was done with-in two hours, and Ava came to the pool to get me when they opened the safe. Otherwise they did all the worked while I relaxed. All the food was good, not great but much better than avarage. They are in deperate need of a decent pastry/desert chef. The tea could be nice but what is tea without scones? The buffet associated with the show was really the only terrible food but the show was entertaining and a nice way to pass time. The gym really requires some updating of machines and some maintenance of machines. That said I was still able to run every morning on the treadmill and my husband was able to lift weights daily. We never found availabliity a problem. We had a couples massage arranged by Ava as well as manicures and pedicures. The massage was great, the other services very average. Do not waste your money on a blow out! The town of Playa is about a 25 minute walk and it has sidewalks all the way to town. We ventured in twice and it was fun.

There are two main reasons to go to the Royal Hideaway: the service and the food. The service there is by far the best we have seen, better than the Ritz and Gran Lido. Whether it be housemaids, concierge, bartenders or waiters, there is always someone around with a smile; they do not know the word no. The food is outstanding, with all of the restaurants easily the equivalent of any new york eatery, and certainly above the normal all-inclusive caribbean fare. The nightlife is quiet, so if your looking for a loud disco and partying till dawn this is not the place. They have 2 large pools near the ocean where most people congregate, one being an infinite pool. There are also private plunge pools scattered throughout the easily negotiable property. The beach(or lack thereof) is an issue, which the hotel is aware of and is currently renovating.

Just to get the negative out of the way, there is little to no beach left. I heard a few stories of upset guests cancelling their reservations on arrival. About 3 weeks ago, they lost most or all of it to storms/currents. If you look at the pictures in the 'candid photo' section, and saw what it was like now, you'd be in disbelief - I am. What's there now is enough room for 2 rows of chairs, packed like sardines, and a makeshift beach/pile of sandbags. They are working hard to recover, but that only adds to the frustration as your view of the water/beach is filled with workers, sandbags, and the sounds of dredging machines. Overall, we got over it, and thoroughly enjoyed the infinity pool. We were up and in our seats by 6:30, but didn't mind as the sunrises were beautiful. Amazingly, being there to get chairs our 2nd day before all but 3 other people, and having sat in my chair for over an hour (I don't agree w/the reserving of seats w/a magazine and not returning until lunch time), I STILL had someone try to take our chairs when I got up to go to get my wife out of bed. Also, that same night, our non-smoking room became filled with stale smoke from adjoining rooms, or others in our building through the air conditioning and under the door from our neighbors. It was really bad, and at best, they were only able to temporarily stop it. We just did our best to spend as little time in the room as possible. We didn't go there to sit in a room. On to the positives.... Las Ventanas was the highlight of the trip. Service, food, wine was all incredible. We ordered off the menu for wine, $52 for a 2001 Joseph Phelps Merlot, well worth it. And it was a steal (or a misprint in our favor) as it was $140-180 at all the other restaurants. Our server made the meal, bringing us multiple recommendations. I regret not remembering his name. Our concierge Luz was great, and all of the staff in general made for such a pleasant trip. The pool staff kept our drinks coming, and catered to any need they could. Breakfast at Spices was great, and the lunches @the pool bar were great too. Azia and Palazzo were above average, but not as good as Las Ventanas. As everyone suggests, it's worth the wait for an outside table at Palazzo. Make reservations w/your concierge. Busy time for dinner was 8:30-9:30, which works out great if you go to tea time between 4-6. Dinners were nicely paced (what's the rush!), except for our meal at The Grille, we went at 7:30, and were out by 8:20, with appetizers, meal and coffee. Overall, we had a great time. Please take our negatives for what their worth. The beach was a bummer, but we loved the infinity pool and got over it. The smoke in the room was a real bummer, even as 2 former smokers.

The grounds were beautiful & the food/bar service was fantastic. The check in greeting was the best we ever had, and we do travel frequently. The other reviews were very accurate, we too stayed in building (33), and found the noise from the hotel next to us very loud. We did request another room, however the resort was at full occupancy. Since we were out most of the day, and the noise level dropped after 11pm, we decided not to make a fuss about it. However, I do suggest when you book your villa you request an inward facing room in the middle of the resort. It is also true that you need to get up no later then 8am to get a good spot by the pool, the hotel does need to lay out the chairs better (also they only have 8 floats, those need to be reserved early as well) The food was fantastic for an all-inclusive. Las Ventanas reminded us of a NYC type dinning experience. Azia was great, we requested seats at the hibachi table and were really impressed with the food (we had fun talking with other couples too). The service at the pool & bar area was also great. My only problem was with the check-out, we had requested help with our bags, and told our villa concerige we had a pick up time at noon. The bell hop came late and we rushed to the front (being told I had to get to the airport at least 3-4 hrs. before flight time due to long lines at the airport), then the front desk basically ran after us to sign a check out bill. By that time we were running very late and I told them this. At the time of check-in we gave them a copy of our credit card for incidentials. Like I mentioned before we stay at hotels all over the world and I never had to physically check out. Usually the bill just gets charged to your credit card automatically. I just found it a little upsetting that due to our circumstances they would not let us leave the resort to catch our flight., and just bill our credit card for any balance due. They acutally closed the front gate on us, and had me get out of my car service to sign the credt card statement. Which held us up another 25 min. We did actually just make our flight. Honestly, for a 5 star service oriented hotel, they should not have kept us knowing we were trying to catch a flight. All in all it was a beautiful hotel and we did have a relaxing time.

I always have to balance the interests of all members of the group, ages 18-84, with my main concern for my elderly mother and aunt. The Royal Hideaway (RH), while quite pricey, met our expectations in all but a few ways. First of all, the grounds are exquisite and very easy for my mother and aunt to walk and manage levels with elevators or ramps discretely placed around the property. The rooms were really beautiful and comfortable. The beach was indeed washed away but great effort was made to provide chairs for those of us who chose to sit there. The quality of the chairs should be upgraded for such a high end resort as they were quite uncomfortable. The chairs by the pool were much nicer and appeared to be reserved quite early but it wasn't impossible to get a chair at all. Our waiter on the beach, Eddie, was fabulous and came by often. We never sat at the gorgeous pools so I can't comment. The noise issue mentioned in an earlier review was almost nonexistent. A few times we heard that jackhammer next door, but it was a minor nuisance if that. Other members of the family used the gym often and commented that it was tight and there were too few machines, but they managed to use it daily. We never used the spa services. My biggest complaint was the food. There was no shortage of food, but it\u2019s quality and selection was lacking considering the price of the property. The breakfast buffet was adequate but never changed other than in minor ways every day. The snack bar menu was just OK and the food was average at best. Dinners varied but I never was blown away by an entire meal. Here\u2019s how I review the restaurants: Spices: Good food, SLOW service (dinner took three hours, lunch two!) Ventanas: I am a simple eater so it was lost on me. We had a private dining room that was nice, but the food was anywhere from disgusting to excellent but the portions reminded me of \u201cThe Emperor\u2019s New Clothes\u201d where everyone said how great he looked but he had on no clothes! Three tiny bites of steak? A whiskey glass of potato emulsion (does that sound appetizing anyway?) I know a lot of people won\u2019t agree, but we had a great laugh at that place. Azia: Great ambiance, average food. The Grill: Nice ambiance, average food, Club Royale: Fun concept, other than the soup, disgusting food, lame show. Palazzo: Our favorite, but still not fabulous. My main complaint about all of the restaurants except Spices and the Club Royale-we were a group of 10 from five different cities and we wanted to eat dinner together at ONE table. Nope!!! Impossible!!! Why??? We can\u2019t figure it out. We could have a table of 8 and 2, 6 and 4, 5 and 5, all or most adjacent to each other, but not together. That only tells me that the RH does not encourage groups to visit because frankly, dinner was the only time of day where we were all together and this was a serious flaw in our vacation.

We were a little weary of the fact that it was an all inclusive resort but our experience was nothing short of amazing. I just read a terrible review about noisey construction that went on at a neighboring hotel and it made me want to cry. I was staying at the hotel for 10 days, (after that review was written), and we had NO problem with loud construction AT ALL! Here is our review: Restaurants: Las Ventanas- The most beautiful in our opinion by way of decor. The presentation of the dishes was on par or better than that of any NYC restauarant. The food was fantastic, (tasting menu). Go to the bar early to have a drink. (We gave a tip to the live piano player both of the times we ate there. He was amazing). Palazzo- Italian. Yummy pastas. Seafood soup was great. We ate here twice as well. You can't go wrong with this menu. Sit outside if you can. It is so romantic to see the resort while eating. Azia- Very cool decor. Sushi is eh. Sashimi is sliced like lox, (not our favorite). Actually a lot of people loved Azia but we ate there twice and had two negative experiences. The service was great and we loved getting drunk on the Saki but the food did not compare to other restaurants. Others said the hibachi was great but we missed out on that. Spices- We loved Spices. It overlooked the ocean very pretty. Mexican food was good. We both got the short ribs as per another recommendation, (I think it is the best thing on the menu). The Grill- SOOOOO PRETTY! We ate there at night, (also opened for lunch). It really was strickingly pretty at night w/the candles lit. But the food was average. I could not chew through my octopus. My husband really enjoyed his swordfish. Worth it for a night but not our favorite. Beach/Pool: The pools were perfect. There are a ton of pools on the property and even the pool by the spa is beautiful. We will admit that it was pretty tricky to get chairs right around the main pool. People wake up at 6:00 in the morning to save their chairs. You could always get a chair but it might not be the really comfy ones around the pool, (which was fine with us). My husband and I didn't mind waking up early to watch the sunrise, (since we went to bed so early every night) so we always got good chairs. We got a bed 3 times which is really worth it. Our last day we woke up late and took two chairs on the beach, (which is small). I loved being right up to the water. The ocean was very turquoise and very peaceful. We swam in the ocean, (kayaked and boogie boarded). Had a blast and got great color! Even if you don't get a good chair, don't get stressed about it, get a raft, it's even better than the chairs. Service: To keep it short, best service I have ever experienced. They knew our name, what drink we wanted,... we really felt like they knew us. Advice, give tips, they really appreciate it and they need the money more than you do. Most people do not tip but all of the service was exceptional and we were all too happy to do it. If you need anything your personal concierge is gauranteed to be two steps ahead of you, whether you need reservations or some extra toothpaste. Weather: Do not look at the weather channel there because not once were they correct. Every day called for rain. It rained ONE night, (we ran back to our room in the rain and put the TV to see what the weather channel in the room said and it was the first time it showed a clear sky). Very funny. (PS even accuweather.com said it would rain every day and we had PERFECT WEATHER) Advice: GO! GO! GO! We will surely be back.

Service and cleanliness are way above superior. Just a few nitpicks but this is really a very nice place. Nitpicks: they have to solve the chair issue - there should be no need to get up at 5am to reserve a nice chair (yes, 5am); more and better chairs are a must; also more of the daybeds would be nice; get rid of the plastic chairs, they have no place at this type of resort This is not a beach hotel - there are nicer beaches on the East River...unfortunately, the hurricane has really wiped out all the beaches in this area. If you like big nice beaches, go somewhere else; if you stick by the pool anyway, then this place is very good (as long as you get your chair reserved). Our concierge was not very helpful - i spoke with some people who were very impressed by theirs, unfortunately ours was not on top of her game; our laundry got lost, our room was late getting cleaned - minor stuff but not necessary. Activities should be better organized, private tours and boat trips should be the norm; they shouldn't try to push you in with other tour groups. Music by the pools is not great...how bout a little jimmy buffett or dave matthews? Spa could be a little bigger and less busy; people kept walking past me during my massage. Gym needs to be a little larger as well. It was very busy every morning. Again, these are nitpicks. We had a very enjoyable week there. It was great food and service and the place is very well kept but for $750/night, things could be a little nicer. Remember, this is not a 5 star resort...it is a Diamond rating, given out by some friend of Donald Trump's. It is not Michelin ratings. Not a big deal but it is important to remember the source of the ratings. It's a nice place to spend a few days or maybe even a week with another couple or friends but it is not off the charts.", "Date": "January 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "moorpark, ca", "Title": "\u201cMediocre\u201d", "Author": "abd", "ReviewID": "UR6561628", "Content": "First let me clarify; my rating of the resort as a 2/5 is in comparison to other top resorts we've stayed at (Princeville Kauai, Hyatt Maui, Bellagio, Boulders, Sanctuary at Camelback, JW Camelback, Enchantment Sedona). Compared to lower tier resorts like the Hilton in Waikiki or on the Big Island, Royal Hideaway would be a 4/5. We chose Royal Hideaway based on the Trip Advisor reviews posted here. We also requested, a month in advance, a top-floor room in the center of the resort, also based on the reviews posted here. We received a top floor room, however it was on the very edge of the resort, right over the fence bordering the Occidental Allegro resort. The music and M.C. from the show at the Allegro was extremely loud, even with our air conditioner on high. We called down to the front desk and the next day were able to move to a room in the center of the resort where we were not able to hear the neighboring resorts at all. I would have preferred to have been able to move that night, or even been given the room we requested in the first place, but at least we were able to solve the problem. Since we were at the resort during the first week of January when many schools are on winter break, the resort was full and there were a lot of large family groups. This made it difficult to get chairs at the pool. One person in the group would get up early and reserve chairs for the entire group by putting a book or article of clothing on the chair even though many of the chairs reserved ended up not being used most of the day. I read other reviews about how the drink service around the pool was great. We found this to be the the exact opposite. While they did come by fairly often to take orders, it took a long time to get the order and twice mine was incorrect and twice it was forgotten completely. I didn't order anything complicated either - just lemonade or sparkling water. We were most disappointed by the food. We were expecting the incredibly small portions, but we were not expecting the incredible bland taste and mediocre quality. We have stayed or eaten at many top resorts and restaurants and there is no comparison when it comes to food. We thought Azia was the best restaurant, although the sushi still paled in comparison to what we get at home in suburban Los Angeles. The breakfast buffet at Spices was fine, like your typical hotel breakfast buffet. I would recommend that over the a la carte menu at Las Ventanas. We were very disappointed by lunch at the Snack Bar (I admit we didn't try the other option - Spices). The food just didn't taste good. We also expected there to be easy access to snacks like ice cream, cookies or candy available, and this just wasn't the case. You could get a few sweets during tea (that is, if you are able to get a table) or you could order ice cream at the snack bar or through room service. I'm sure many of my issues about the food have to do with it being all inclusive. We have never stayed at an all inclusive before, so perhaps our expectations were unreasonable, but we are certain we will not stay at an all inclusive again. We didn't drink enough alcohol to make it worth the cost and we would gladly pay more for better food! I'm not saying the resort is bad, it's just not what we were hoping for.

The Royal Hideaway failed totally in this regard. During the last four days, construction started at the neighboring hotel. Two jackhammers started to demolish a retaining wall right at their beach about twenty to thirty yards away from our beach. This noise travelled all the way to the two main pools. This made it impossible to spent time at the beach or the pools without feeling like beeing in the middle of a construction site. Everybody who is familliar with teh kind of noise a jackhammer creates, knows what I am talking about. After talking to management, I was told that this will last for weeks not days. I immediately contacted my travel agent representative who in turn contacted the hotel. He confirmed that there is nothing the hotel can do about it and that this situation will last weeks. He was also told that some compensation for the inconvenience will be forthcoming from the hotel. This never happened and on our last day I checked with hotel management why they promise something and then do not deliver. The answer Lisa Martinez gave( by the way not personally but through her front desk person), was that there are plenty of smaller pools available, away from the noise and that this construction site is at a neighboring hotel and therefore not the hotels fault. She was not willing to do anything for me. Fine, but why promise it in the first place. Also, do I fly all the way to the Gulf of Mexico to stay at some smaller pool in order to avoid noise? Shouldn't I be able to enjoy the beach at a five star resort? Furthermore, the neighboring hotel belongs to the same Spanish hotel chain, by the name of Occidental like the Royal Hideaway. So, I assume the hotel knew about the construction long before it started and knowingly did not inform anybody. The hotel itself is beautiful. Beach is very small. There are plenty of chairs available, at the pools and on the beach. Service at the restaurants ranges from great to very poor. All you guys out there, who like to wear jeans in any restaurant, do not worry, we saw plenty of people wearing jeans in every restaurant. I think they should enforce the dress code but it looked like nobody cared. The breakfsast buffet was mediocre at best. Our concierge, Rosalie, was fantastic. Front desk is very arrogant. I know that this review contradicts all the five star reviews on this website, but I gave you my honest asessment. We stayed at the Royal Hideaway before and twice at the Secrets Capri.

What a great place. My wife and I have been to multiple all inclusive resorts in the Dominican Republic and our recent visit to the Royal Hideaway in Playa del Carmen proved to us that this resort is THE BEST. We celebrated our 30th anniversary in early December Check in was very pleasant and efficient (champagne, cool towel, etc.). Our concierge Rosalie in building 23 was courteous and friendly. No, there are not 23 buildings on the grounds! There are approximately 8 residential buildings on the property, some two stories and some three stories. Only 200 rooms in the entire resort. The grounds were always being kept clean. While we were there the waves took away part of the beach. The resort next door lost its retaining wall. Hurricane Wilma really did some damage to the whole area. Each of the resorts has spent many pesos recovering from the damage of Wilma Our room on the 2nd floor or a three story building overlooked one of the multiple \u201crelaxation\u201d pools. It was well appointed, very clean. Rooms have a free electronic room safe, 2 bathrobes, a single person whirlpool tub, and a full standup shower. The walk-in closet is off the bathroom (enough room to leave your bags out), with closet rod, safe deposit box and shelves to store your \u201cstuff\u201d. A separate toilet room is to the right of the dual sinks. The room is cleaned 2 times per day. You can get it cleaned when you want it (just ask), and there is nightly (yes, every night), where your bed is turned town, soft music turned on, and new towels supplied in the bathroom. The windows in the bedroom had very good room darkening shades. You need to close the door to the bathroom to keep the rising sun from interrupting your sleep (there is no window blind over the frosted bathroom window) Some days there were towel displays on our bed when we returned to our room and some days there were flowers in a vase. We tried room service 2 times, once for continental breakfast and once for an afternoon snack. Both were quick and exactly as ordered. There\u2019s a CD player in the room. I suggest you bring a male to male mini jack cable with you (available from Radio Shack) and you\u2019ll be able to plug your Ipod into the stereo system (via the microphone jack)). There is also a DVD player (you may borrow DVD\u2019s from the front lobby). Limited English TV stations. They offer a shoe shine service (just a tip is needed) and they do have laundry service (for a fee). There is a small deck off the bedroom with 2 chairs and a table. The resort was basically \u201cbug free\u201d while we were there. You have not had afternoon tea until you\u2019ve had it at the Royal Hideaway. There were assorted tea sandwiches, and sweets (which were different each day). The assortment of special coffees (those with liquor) was wonderful. Make sure you try the Mayan Coffee. It was fantastic! Champagne, and a full bar rounded out this special time (4 to 6 each afternoon). A few afternoons there was even a sax / clarinet player. The Royal Hideaway prides itself at only having 1 buffet (breakfast). Assorted cheeses and cold meats, custom omelets, eggs to order, bacon, sausage, pancakes, waffles, special entrees, etc. assorted pastries, etc. You won\u2019t go hungry. Mimosas and Bloody Mary\u2019s flowed freely. There are a few tables on the terrace overlooking the ocean. All other meals are served in a la carte restaurants. You do need to make reservations (however, I suggest you do this when you arrive if you want certain times). You may go to the same restaurant as often as you want. When we visited there were 2 shows, one Sunday and the other Tuesday. We went to the Sunday show which was an international show. Basically, fancy dance moves, high element twirling, etc. We didn\u2019t attend the Tuesday show which is a buffet with a Mexican theme. You may also reserve your first night by writing to [-] 7 to 10 days before arrival. Also, if you are celebrating something special (anniversary, birthday, etc., make sure you e-mail the information too. Lunch at the pool \u201csnack bar\u201d is a sit-down restaurant with a very full menu (shrimp cocktail, burgers, steak sandwiches, chicken breast sandwich, Mexican specialties, salads, desserts, etc.). They serve from 11 to 6 (at which time the \u201csnack bar\u201d is turned into the Grill Restaurant. Waiters come around the pool and on the beach taking drink orders. They will also bring you food to your lounge chair! Thanks Daniel!! The infinity pool is amazing. The resort has approximately 10 yellow pool floats. You\u2019ve read it before, there are people who hog these. The activity staff will take them back into the pool for other guests to use. There are a limited number chairs around the 2 pools pool (I estimated 100). These are wood chaises (3 adjustments) with stuffed pads that are put out each morning. Guests start \u201creserving\u201d chairs at 6 in the morning. There are plenty of chairs (molded plastic with green mesh) on the beach. Towels are not controlled (you can get more than one) and they are around 72\u201d long. Security does an excellent job at keeping non-guests off the property. There are NO wrist bands at The Royal Hideaway. We had dinner 3 times at Ventanas. We love it. Service was fantastic and the food was very gourmet. There is a piano player most nights in the lounge next to Ventanas. The music is also piped into the restaurant. We also ate at the Grill, the Asian restaurant (2 times) and the Italian restaurant. All were fantastic. The mushroom appetizer in the Italian restaurant was wonderful as was the lamb. We never tried Spices for dinner (the Mexican restaurant). The Italian Restaurant has some outdoor tables. The view across to Cozumel from these tables was amazing at night. Top shelf booze throughout the resort. They are cautious in the amount of booze they put into a drink. If you want more, just ask! There is minimal entertainment around the resort. There is an activities team that will run various programs (only if you want, no pressure). Spanish Lessons, Bocce Ball, Pool Aerobics, Towel Folding, Martini Making, etc. Evening entertainment included dance lessons, karaoke, trivia, and a casino night (for fun, no money). The Allegro Bar was opened each night from 6 PM to 1AM. The entertainment staff also goes around the pool during the day distributing fresh fruit and moist towels to cool you off. There are 4 computers in the business center (open 24 hours a day). Please be courteous to other guests and limit your time. I was told the entire resort is wireless and did see guests around pool with their laptops. The gym is very well equipped. You have free access to the steam and sauna rooms (separate for men and women) and the showers in the spa. The shower head here was fantastic compared to the one in our room. We did not use any of the spa services. The Royal Hideaway only serves Pepsi products. I am a Diet Coke person. This was my only complaint about the resort. Make sure you find the time to walk the 25 minutes into town. You will get a flavor of the culture and how the Mexicans live. There is also a small \u201cmall\u201d across the street from The Royal Hideaway. I have nothing but great things to say about the Royal Hideaway.

The room was always kept very clean the king size bed was incredible. The A/C worked just fine and the bathroom was very , nice and clean too! Your building conseirge will handle all your needs including Dinner resevations, airline problems etc.. Our girl was Roselia from suite #23 . She knew it was our 25th wedding anniversary and made sure flowers and champagne were waiting for us in our room when we returned from the beach that day . She made the day special. The beach area is very adequate. You don't have to wake up at 6 AM to get a spot or anything on the beach, I don't know why people still write that . We got to the beach after breakfast at Spices around 9 AM and we were just fine. As we walked along the beach past other resorts we noticed that because of the hurricane last year a lot of them did loose much of their beach areas. After returning from the walk we laid back in the sun and ordered drinks from Victor the waiter on the beach ..Your drink never gets warm with him around! We did see some topless sunbathing on the beach at RH (which I was one )but it was not a problem if that's what you like to do because many of the guests are european and are used to it. Like I said it was not a big deal , most of the beaches had many topless sunbathers. The RH is very , very relaxing so the night life is limited to the Piano Bar and Bar Allegro but no the less we were OK with that . After all we weren't looking for a Cancun type location. Shopping is a few minutes away or a $5 dollar cab ride to Fith Ave. I do suggest that you go if you'd like. There also is a area very close to the hotel that is within walking distance basically the same stuff t-shirts ..etc.. Finally, I found tipping was very much appriciated by the staff. They work very, very hard for you while you are there and make sure that everything is to your satisfaction .

The sand coupled with the temperature of the water gives the affect of a giant bathtub, even the salt water doesn't sting the eyes as bad. The rooms are perfect. I stayed in a Luxury room and although the hotel lists that hardly ANY rooms are ocean view, this room had a great partial oceanview and it was easy access to the pool and restaurants. The bathroom seemed almost the same size as the room itself. The decor boasted classy whites and cremes with chocolate brown accents.

Our stay was extremely pleasant and we would definitely go back. The weather was perfect everyday but the sea was a little rough. It was usually yellow flag and 3 days was on red flag regarding the ocean conditions. Considering this time last year was when Wilma hit, this was very much a 180 degree change which goes to show you can never tell with the weather and mother nature. Rooms: We stayed at villa 27th which was right in the middle and also closest to the main pool and the beach. You had to pay up for a view of the ocean but we didn\u2019t have a bad view either. We were facing the courtyard and could see spices from where we were. Remember to make your request a week or two before via e-mail and people at the hotel are quick to response with your request. We even asked for the 2nd floor and got it. I would ask for a villa close to the beach and facing the courtyard (rather than facing neighboring hotels). Our room had high ceiling, shower, and bath and king size bed. It was very clean and we appreciated the turn down service every evening. Swimming pool and beach and pool side stuff: Beach was a bit small compared to the Riu Cancun which we stayed at 2 years ago. We didn\u2019t spend much time on the beach though. Most of our time was spent lounging by the infinity pool which overlooked the beach. That view there is absolutely breathe taking! When we go to Spices for breakfast at around 8, we would drop some of our stuff off at the seats by that pool. If you didn\u2019t do that, you would have had to retreat to either the beach or the second pool which was further away from the beach. And trust me, you want a view of the beach from the main pool. As for floaters, there were always ones around, you don\u2019t really need to worry about that. And only on the last day, did we finally get to enjoy the Thai beds that they had. They were great!! But once we were done, we made sure to take the towels off so others would know the bed was free. Not everyone did that though. Service: Best part of the entire resort. People there are so friendly and accommodating. Because we new how much it costs to call from our rooms, our concierge had no problems with lending us her concierge phone to make short local calls. We had to call our travel provider and scuba dive centre to make a few confirmations and they allowed us to do so with no fuss. They really make a point to know you by name when you were there. Every where we go, they would be greeting us by last name. Felt like Royalty! Food: We liked Las Ventanas, the Theatre, Azia and the breakfast at Spices the most, which is probably different from a lot of people\u2019s reviews here. Maybe I just ordered the wrong stuff at the other places. I had the sea bass at the Grille and it was way too rough. I gave the sea bass another go at Las Ventanas and it was literally melting in my mouth. So delicious! Spices and Palazzo at night was also so-so with the food being too salty for my taste. Then again, my fianc\u00e9e\u2019s shrimp dumplings at Palazzo was very good. I knew I should not have ordered the seafood chowder which is usually salty to begin with. But after I tried every restaurant, it was time to go already. No going back to try again. At the theatre, I really liked the Mexican buffet that they had there with items like Yucatan style pork, pastries with chorizo and this taco where they would slice off meat from a rotisserie. At Azia, I enjoyed the tri-tip tataki, pad-thai, Azia roll and seafood salad. The rest of the sushi and sashimi was pretty regular as what we would get in Toronto but definitely much better than what we had at Riu Cancun 2 years ago which was really not edible. We have to give them 2 thumbs up for really being able to get across that Asian authenticity. Lunch was a bit lacking though. Although you would find non-typical Snack bar foods at the pool side snack bar, they should really have a buffet. After a few days there with only one place to eat, it can get very boring. I would suggest this is a fine opportunity to make your way out to 5th Ave. to try some of the food there. We enjoyed Babe's Noodle Bar which was on 5th & 10th. Another must try is the afternoon tea. I loved the Mayan coffee that they served. They would also have champagne, sandwiches, cookies, cherries. It was a great snack. Drinks: Just keep them pouring. Our favourites include: Pina Colada, Miami Vice, Dirty Monkey, and my most favourite new drink: Banana Mama. Others were ordering everything under the sun like Tequila sunrise, Mojito, Strawberry daiquiri, Mexican Lemonade, Bloody Mary, Viva Mexico, Jamican Flame. They had no qualms about making fruit smoothie drinks which usually take longer. The size of the drinks was great and the alcohol of course was of good quality. They are definitely not stingy with the amount of alcohol too that they were putting in the drinks. Scuba: We considered going with the on-resort scuba centre Barrakuda but they were significantly more expensive. We thus went with a highly recommended shop from this board called Tank-ha. They were located on 5th Avenue which was only a $5 cab ride away. We enjoyed going there too as there is always a lot to see around town. We did the referral package with them and got our open water dive certification. They were a very good dive shop and even made and effort to call our hotel the first day when they had to cancel our dive because the waters were too rough. Much thanks go to Desiree and Roman from Tank-ha. My fianc\u00e9e got sea sick on the boat. But that was not anyone\u2019s fault. If that didn\u2019t happen to him, we would have done another dive trip at Cozumel rather than do an excursion. Oh-well. Excursion: Because of our schedule with the scuba, we only went on one excursion which was to Coba (we did Chichen-Itza last time already). We did it through Alltournative and found them to be a tad expensive. However, we did enjoy our day which included a visit to a Mayan village, Zip Line, Repelling, lunch, Coba, and Cho-ha Cenote. We had to rent bikes for extra charge ($3 per bike) at Coba which was kind of necessary considering the far ride and the 1 hour time they give. We thought for the $110 we paid, this type of thing should have been at least included. However, they were very good with providing us water which was appreciated. The view from the top of the ruins was very nice. But the explanation of the ruins was much similar to Chichen-Itza. Nightlife: I can\u2019t comment considering we chose not to partake in any even though there was always something going on at the bar at RH. We were super tired each night and with a belly full of food, we retreated back to the room. We would rent free movies from our concierge and just watched that till we passed out. We really appreciated that service. Others: My fiancee used the gym there and said it was much much better than what was available at Riu. The equipment is actually stuff that you would see in a regular gym back at home. They had eliptical machine, weights, treadmills and a good variety of proper weight-training machines. Woops, long one again. But hope everyone can benefit from this info as I have benefited from everyone else.

Our flight was great and we arrived earlier than expected. Breezed through customs at Cancun airport, which is all new since Wilma and very nice. We took the Olympus Tours shuttle van and had several stops along the way so it took about an hour to get to the hotel. When we did arrive, we were met with champagne and a cool cloth. The service from the moment we arrived, until our sad departure was top notch. There were several individuals who stood out as exceptional- Anna at the pool and who also serves as a social coordinator of activities during the day and at the Allegria Bar in the evenings; Mariano, a waiter at Las Ventanas and occasionally at the Grill for dinner and at Spices for breakfast.; and Daniel who will get you anything while you lounge at the smaller pool. We never had a problem getting a chair at either pool nor a float. We did place our towels on the chairs to be saved by 9:00 a.m. On one occasion we saved 6 seats for some other friends we met and someone took one of them while we were at breakfast. The floats may also disappear if you leave them to go have lunch, etc. The breakfast buffet at Spices is great, especially the omelet station. There was fresh fruit, pancakes, waffles, bacon, sausages, cereal, yogurt, rolls, croissants, even some proscuitto and cheese. Las Ventanas is also open for breakfast and that was a la carte and also quite good. Every dinner we had was good. We enjoyed Palazzos more the second time we dined there but be prepared as it took about 2 hours. Service was slow. The food at the Grill was very good but it is not air conditioned and we would not go back only because it was very warm to the point of being uncomfortable. At Azia, the asian restaurant, we sat at the hibachi table and watche our food being prepared. That was quite good. Las Ventanas is rather \"ultra gourmet\" but we did enjoy the food. The chocolate souffle dessert is fantastic. At every restaurant we had ice cream- I loved the coconut ice cream in particular. Our room was the standard Luxury room in Villa 25. Do request a top floor as it has vaulted ceilings and feels more spacious. The balcony isn't huge but is a nice size and there is a table and 2 chairs. TMy only complaint was that we had small ants in the bathroom which still remained even after spraying with Raid. There are a number of relaxation pools around the resort which were definitely very relaxing, especially the hot tubs/jacuzzis. We were the only couple there every time we used one and it was really nice. The grounds are beautiful- very clean and well kept. There was some work being done on the little bridges so we were re-routed at times but it wasn't a problem. There is a business center and free internet service which was convenient and I surprised my daughter with an email one day. The Allegria Bar at night was a lot of fun. We were fortunate to meet 2 other couples and spent quite a bit of time with them during the week. We participated in a couples contest one night, karayoke another night, and salsa/merengue dance lessons on another night. We had a blast. We went into Playa Del Carmen to shop one day and the vendors literally accost you. We did find some good buys on silver and amber jewelry and they will negotiate with you on price. There is also a small shopping plaza across the street from the hotel. You can also take a ferry from Playa to Cozumel. The people who work at the resort are very accommodating. The waiters and other employees do try their best to please and work very hard. This is an all inclusive and gratutities are supposedly included, but tipping is much appreciated. The resort is gorgeous, the people warm and friendly. The pools are beautiful. The beach is not the largest but it is large enough. Beware, there is some topless bathing allowed and we were surprised at the number of women who do sit on and walk along the beach sans bikini tops. All in all, it was one of the best vacations we have taken so far and we have been to a number of caribbean islands and Hawaii. You will be totally pampered. There is a spa on premises where you can get a massage although we did not take advantage of it. We were too busy just relaxing at the pools, eating and drinking! I highly recommend this resort to anyone who is looking for a relaxing, luxurious vacation. There are no children under the age of 13 allowed and we saw not a one. There were only adults- mostly honeymooners or other couples in practically every age range. It is the slow season right now and the place was far from crowded. The weather was perfect- no rain at all and not uncomfortably hot and humid which I found surprising. Our trip back to the airport was fine- had to pick up a few people on the way. Everything went smoothly and although we hit some turbulence during the flight home, we got in on time and we were lucky enough to get our luggage quickly and get out of the airport without a hitch. Go and have a great time- we were so glad we did and we would love to go back.", "Date": "October 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Durham, NC", "Title": "\u201cSpectacular!!

Our hotel room was right by the pool which was fantastic! The beach area is defintely more than 5 feet long. The beach was very clean and they do actually clean the seaweed out of the ocean every morning. They take all the beach chairs down and wash them off and rake and clean the sand every morning. They also take all the pool chair cushions off every night and wash them and put them back on in the morning. There is no detail left out at this place, they truely think of everything. The rooms were very clean when we got there and they clean the rooms twice a day, once in the morning/afternoon and again when you are at dinner. The one night when we got back from dinner there were rose petals on our bed, it was very romantic! All of the restrauants that we ate at were fantastic. We especially enjoyed Palazzo and Azia, they were both very, very good. If you get a group of 6 people you can eat at the Hibatchi table, which is not hard to find people at this resort. We were there for one night and met two wonderful couples that we hung out with during our stay. Everyone there was very relaxed and friendly. We were going to go on a few excursions and we ended up never leaving our resort. Everything was so wonderful we thought why leave. We hung out at the infinity pool most of our time and that is because, Eddie, who was are bartender was awesome. He had our drinks ready for us before we were even done with our first ones, he brought our lunch to the pool so we could eat right by the pool. My boyfriend and I and another couple that we met at the resort decided to take our scuba diving course to get certified and it was alot of fun. To be honest though, I probably would not have done it if it wasn't for our scuba instructor, Valentina. She is the best there is, she was so patient and so understanding, that we could not have had a better instructor. Thanks Valentina for all your help!

The food in the restaurants is delicious- we ate at every one except for the dinner theater. We liked Azia the best, but all of them were very good. One caveat- this was not a problem for us at all, but for some people it may be-There is pretty much no nightlife at this resort.

There have been a lot of positive changes but there were also some very negative aspects of the resort. The food was ok afterall it is an all-inclusive, but better than average. The infiniti pool was much nicer than the previous one although it was difficult finding a pool chair. The grounds are still beautifully manicured and the rooms very clean. I did talk to one of the managers at arrival and he mentioned perhaps changing the policy about allowing guests to wear jeans. NOT a good idea, but if they want to allow those types of people to visit the resort so be it. I have read recent reviews about rude guests and we had a very bad experience as well. There was a group from Texas who was very rude and loud. They were drunk all of the time from morning until night. I guess they wanted to get their monies worth. They were always in the infiniti pool and acted obnoxiously in the allegra bar. Some people have no shame. The beach was a huge disappointment due to the hurricane. Before it was so beautiful, and now small and the ocean floor is very rocky. It also rained 5 of the 8 days we were there and this was very disappointing. BEWARE of the Barrakuda tours!!!!!

We grew up near NYC and Washington DC, so my husband and I are very used to fine dining. But the food combinations and textures were off and not to our liking. If you like scallop emulsion, you will like this restaurant. The very best food can be found at Palazzo. The pasta is delicious. The asian restaurant was also delicious and we ate there twice. It is true what people say about the beach chair situation. We just woke up very early and secured beds and honestly, it is one of the most peaceful and beautiful times to be on the beach.

Before selecting our honeymoon location, I scoured tripadvisor.com for information on each of our possible honeymoon destinations. Above all, Royal Hideaway was the most highly recommended and we truly were not disappointed at all with our selection in the end. From beginning to end, our experience at the Royal Hideaway was exceptional. Upon our arrival to the main lobby we were cordially greeted with friendly faces, moist towels to cool off and a refreshing glass of champagne. Antonio and Juan from the main lobby were amazingly helpful and so friendly that we visited them at least once a day. Our room was clean, sufficiently spacious and provided with a fresh fruit plate and stocked with a variety of refreshments daily. We were in Villa 23 on the third floor and the vaulted ceilings were beautiful. I was extremely happy that our travel agent had arranged for this specific luxury room. My only complaint about the room was the ant problem in the bathroom, which when speaking with other couples, everyone seemed to have the same issue. However, I did see the cleaning staff spraying daily, assumingly to diminish this problem. I suppose given the hotel\u2019s tropical location, pests such as these just come along with the territory. The grounds were impeccable and I constantly observed them being maintained and groomed. The staff was so friendly and the service we were provided was truly amazing. One of our favorite servers was Manuel from The Grill Room. However, all of the staff was friendly and helpful. Tipping is not expected, but a little does go a long way and the service is so good that there is no reason not to tip for it. We had the chance to dine in almost every restaurant and each was excellent. Having been to all-inclusive resorts in the past, I was a little hesitant about the quality of the food. However, there was no need to worry because the food, presentation and service are so amazing that you forget that you are at an all-inclusive resort. Azia is rated their best restaurant and was by far our favorite. In fact, the only restaurant that we did not dine in was the dinner theater, so we ate at Azia for a second time and then went to the theater to see the show. From what I\u2019ve heard and read, that was probably our best move as the dinner theater has a fixed menu with very little selection. Even the 24 hour room service was lightening fast and the food was presented beautifully as well. My only complaint for the restaurants is the reservation situation. We tried to request later dinner times, but were told that they were all booked. However, when going to the restaurant we observed many empty, available tables still available. Yes, you are also tied to the time that you reserve, which while on vacation, can be rather limiting and can not be easily changed. Also, should you ever arrive late for your reservation, they will have no problem letting you know that you are late and threaten that they do not need to hold a reservation for people past fifteen minutes late. I found that rather rude considering that we were only ten minutes late, but fully understand that the reservation system is intact for a reason and if everyone showed up late, there would be no point in holding reservations. I was just disappointed with how we were treated. This occurred at the Grill Room from the host who seated us. He seemed to be the only miserable person we encountered while at this resort. Unfortunately, the Royal Hideaway was severely damaged during Hurricane Wilma and the beach and palm trees still showed signs of its destruction; as the beach was slightly eroded. However, for us, the beach was still acceptable and we were able to enjoy it nonetheless. The pools were beautiful and proved to be more relaxing than the beach anyway. The drink servers by the pool were great! They remembered your favorite drink and addressed you by name when providing your fresh refill. The fresh fruit cart that arrived poolside daily, as well as the cool, moist towels, were a very elegant touch. As stated in other reviews, lounge chairs and beds by the pool are difficult to come by. You do need get up very early to reserve a lounge chair or any of the canopy beds by the pool. However, rising early for this reason has some advantages. For one, you could easily obtain your favorite location and secondly, the sun rising each morning is a beautiful sight. Also, rising earlier means that breakfast is less crowded and you could avoid lines at the omelet station at the Spices breakfast buffet or quickly be seated for breakfast at Las Ventanas. The canopy beds by the pool were one of our favorite features of the hotel. It was so relaxing to take a beachside nap while being shaded from the sun, but still having the sights and sounds of beach and pool to listen to. The music was very low by the pool and was repeated on a continuous loop, which I found rather redundant. However, considering that the volume was so low, if you were in conversation, you hardly noticed the music at all. While we were there, we utilized the gym by the spa. Although small, it was sufficient and rarely ever crowded when we went. The spa was luxurious! We booked couples massages and were extremely satisfied. First class treatment by the staff and the massage itself was wonderful. Will definitely do that again when we return! Overall, our experience was a great one at the Royal Hideaway. Yes, the neighboring hotels are a little noisy, but manageable. Yes, it is difficult to find seating if you do not rise early to obtain a spot. Yes, the reservations can be rather limiting. Yes, the ant problem in a five star hotel is a little surprising. However, overall, we loved it and cannot wait to return and are already planning our next trip back. For a honeymoon, it was perfect and romantic. I would not recommend this place for couples looking for a wild nightlife, as there is none. The Royal Hideaway is geared toward relaxation and luxury. For us, its pros definitely outweigh its cons and we highly recommend it. One word of advice though, definitely be weary of the sales people on the beach selling day trip excursions. We took the Isla Mujeres snorkel tour and were extremely disappointed that we gave up a day in paradise, let alone wasted any money on that trip.

We stayed at the Ritz Carlton in Pentagon City DC in May, and the service is comporable or better at the RH then the Ritz! The restaurants were fantastic, Spices for Breakfast and Lunch (or stay at the pool and have the waitors bring you lunch from the grill...no need to go inside). All of the restaurants were great for dinner, we ate at each of them, Ventanas was the best in our mind, and how would have thought that the Mexicans could have such a good italian restaurant. The rooms were very well appointed, we had a second floor room with vaulted ceilings, and although we were a little further from the beach (building 25) we were centered in the resort and had quick access to everything. The pools were really nice, the view from the infinity pool was utterly fantastic. The hotel puts a towel on each pool chair in the morning. The only \"reserved\" chairs will have books or shoes. We would be at the pool by 9 and got the same chairs every day (this contradicts a previous post...who clearly didnt stay at the RH, because no one in the property uses a megaphone and the music is all calm and relaxing). Cons: There werent any real cons, other than the seaweed situation for our trip. We love the beach, but the storms out at sea were causing some serious seaweed problems. Although the staff actually cleaned the ocean...thats the type of service you get there. The only other con was with some of the guests. Some people are just not good or nice. They walk around feeling priveledged and entitled, this stinks when 99% of the guests are there to relax and have a good time. To those people who are too good for other people, my advice is to stay home and let the rest of us have a blast. The negative reviews come directly from this contingent.

We went seeking peace and quiet, tropical beaches and views and most of all, relaxation. It did not happen. PROS: All the food we tried at the different restaurants was very good and there was plenty of variety to be enjoyed. There are a few raised, double bed-type lounges near the beach that are fantastic, if you can get them. (if you like getting up really early, you're fine. if you like sleeping in on your vacation, forget it...until late afternoon when they're in the shade and no one else wants them.) Very nice, large pools. (Crowded and noisy, but nice.) CONS: Way too loud. They pipe music into the pool area all day long. They also have contests, announcements, games, etc. with people on microphones moving around the pool area that was particularly annoying if you could only get a seat near a speaker. Pretty hard to relax with music blaring at you constantly. The noise did not die down at night either. The first two nights we had music blaring from the resort next door until very late in the night. We then asked to be moved and were given another room away from the neighboring resort. This room seemed much better...until the music from the resort's own bar started up. Crowded. If you're looking to get away from it all, it ain't happening here. If you want a good set of chairs, not too close to the speakers, or you want an ocean view, get up early. As in, real early. Walk down to the beach or pool after 7am, and most of the \"good\" seats are already \"taken.\" Not that anyone would actually be using them for HOURS, but they were reserved for the day. On certain days, a single person would come down early and get towels for literally dozens of the best chairs. By 7:30, you could see about 10 people among 50-60 reserved chairs already. The beach. I think it was actually washed away before we got there. The beach was all of about 5 feet wide. Seriously. Each day, a group of workers filled sand bags and piled them on and against the beach, trying to stave off the erosion. This went on all day long, each day we were there. Sometimes, you even walked on the sand filled bags instead of on actual sand on the beach. Very depressing. To get down the stairs onto the beach you had to wait for the waves to stop, and then avoid the shovels of the workers as they worked to get safely onto the beach. You could walk across the sand/sandbags to the beaches of the neighboring resorts and some were actually a little wider...but not much. The service was spotty and very inconsistent. Most days the kayaks and sailboats were not being allowed out. Not exactly sure why... Overall, I'd have to say it was a highly disappointing vacation. However, if you're looking for good drinks and food, overly-friendly, often-drunk fellow vacationers, average service and lots of loud music, this could be for you. Oh, and beware: the trip to the ruins from the resort takes a lot longer than they say...you spend a lot of the day driving around, picking up and dropping off other guests from other resorts.", "Date": "July 31, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "chicago", "Title": "\u201cbest of the best\u201d", "Author": "wjc07", "ReviewID": "UR5527527", "Content": "I am a frequent traveler and have stayed at many five star resorts including Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton, Fairmont and Rosewood Resorts.

Yes, people would leave a book when going to lunch or the spa...I do not see a problem with this, it was not to \"save\" the chair, simply easier than packing things up, which would have been silly. 2. BEACH: ample space and beautiful! I walked the beach south pass the Gala and north pass the new RIU resort. The beach at most of the other resorts were bigger...but very crowded with lots of people. The beach at RH seemed 2 times bigger because of the number of people and all the room left over. The resort was 96% occipied. 3. FOOD: all of the restaurants were excellent! 4. SERVICE: perfect. Alberto, Victor, Raul (our villa conciere), Ariel (the sax player) and many many others went above to assist everyone. One person in our party got ill and Raul called the doctor. The doctor was at the room within 15 min. A few minutes later Raul showed up with apple juice, soup and fruit, just as the doctor advised. I mentioned that it was my sisters birthday at lunch to one of the waiters and at dinner that evening a cake was delivered and they sang to her. We went to Ventannas for breakfast one morning and they were playing the most relaxing music...after we ate, we went to the spa to schedule a service. I asked the lady if she knew what tape played in the restaurant and she said she would try to find out for me. We then went back to our room to change clothes and a man showed up 20 minutes later with a CD and said \"I understand you enjoyed the music playing at the restaurant this morning and we burned a copy for you\". This is service! 5. ROOMS: This was my 6th visit to RH. Rooms are the same with new linens, pillows, lamps, rugs, and bedding. They are beautiful.

My husband and I like to try new places each year, so after a week's return visit to El Dorado Royale (very nice), we decided to give RH a try for 4 days. It was an absolutely exceptional experience. I wished we could have afforded to stay there the entire time. It's easy to find something to nitpick or critique at any resort. But truthfully, I can't seem to find anything negative to say about this place. We stayed at Maroma Resort and Spa last year, and although nothing can top the unique beauty and secluded beach there, the RH comes close---and actually exceeds in service. From the moment we stepped out of our cab, I knew we were in a true five star resort. The grounds: Stunning, perfect! Like you would imagine royal gardens to be like. The main pool: gorgeous, serene. I thought I would miss the swim up bar, but not having one truly lends to the classy atmosphere---which feels more like a retreat instead of a vacation playground. We never experienced difficulty getting a chair or a float. The staff: like most Mexican resorts, the staff is extremely kind and eager to please/help in any way. This resort takes this kind of service to a new level. Better. More exceptional. But not intrusive in any way. The rooms: gorgeous, classic bedding and decor. The bathroom is spacious and has an incredible walk in closet that allows you an area to put ALL of your things in one place, while keeping the main room free from vacation clutter. The restaurants: great food. We truly enjoyed Ventanas (the best restaurant service I've had in my life). Palazzo and the Grill were very good as well. The afternoon snack bar has an excellent selection. And most importantly....the poolside bar makes the best mojito I've ever tasted! Really. I could go on and on.

We are all used to deluxe accomodations, and RH did not disappoint. For point of reference, I have stayed at Occidental Grand Xcaret as my only other trip to Mexico. I have also stayed at many other top resorts around the world. My brother is strictly a Ritz Carlton-type traveler, though he will occasionally \"slum it\" at a Hyatt or Marriott. We all felt RH was every bit as good as those brands. Arrival to CUN was perfect. Having been there before, I knew what to expect. Immigration and customs was quick, luggage was there, and off we went. We had arranged a private transport, so I knew to just walk outside the building and look for a sign with my name. Nobody pestered me on the way out, only the people behind the \"transportation counters\" asking if we need help. As you know, those are the timeshare people. Just move on. Ride to RH took 45 minutes. We were escorted to sofas in the air-conditioned lobby until Tania came over to check us in. Champagne and cool towels were brought to us while we waited (not very long). Tania took our vouchers and passports and left us in our seats to go back and do her thing. A few minutes later she returned with our paperwork and room keys. Beats standing at the counter like every other hotel. We went to have lunch at Spices, indoors right by the pool and beach. The club sandwich was excellent (chicken and egg salad with bacon, very unusual). Lime soup with shrimp was ok, not really any lime flavor, more like red chowder. Chorizo tacos were excellent and were ordered several more times throughout the trip. Everyone enjoyed their meals. When we arrived at the rooms, our bags had already been placed in the walk-in closets, champagne was on ice, and our concierge Victoria was right there to help us with anything we needed. We sat with Vicky for a few minutes to make our dinner reservations for all four nights, then changed and went to the pool. We arrived at the pool around 2:30 and found plenty of available loungers. The prime seats (at the infinity pool facing the ocean) were all taken, understandably. Having read all the lounge chair stories, we planned to have one of us save seats early each day. I know it's wrong, but if you can't beat em, join em. Dinner that night was at Azia. We started with a sushi sampler platter that our maitre d brought over. It was actually very good sushi. Chicken satay skewers were also done well, along with vegetable spring rolls and pad thai noodles. Teppanyaki was also very good. Overall, a very good meal. After waking at 4am, traveling all morning, sunning and drinking all afternoon, and eating two big meals, we were done for the night. The rooms are as luxurious as any hotel in the world. Very comfortable bed with plush linens. Fluffy towels (also available at the pool with no limit, just take what you want). Plush robes and slippers for two. Bathroom is huge, with separate stall shower and jacuzzi tub/shower, and private toilet room. Next morning, I woke at 5:45 for no apparant reason. Maybe because that is 6:45 at home in NY, and that's around when I usually wake up. Anyway, I figured since I'm up, I might as well get those pool chairs. I brought 4 paperbacks down to the pool to claim my space. I was the only one there. Four loungers, center of the main row. Back to the room to nap before breakfast. Breakfast buffet is at Spices, right next to the pool. We went at 8:30, and noticed that our books were right where we left them. Not only that, but there were still plenty of prime seats available. Breakfast was fantastic. Chorizo omelets (I love chorizo), and a broad selection of other ingredients and dishes. Gave the Lipitor a real workout. Excellent quality for a buffet. Great coffee too. Nobody could be disappointed with this breakfast. Left the restaurant at about 9:30 and noticed still plenty of loungers available. It would be that way the whole trip. The prime seats get taken by about 9, but plenty of chairs always available. Anyway, back to the room for sunscreen, etc. A few minutes later we sat down with Vicky to change one of our reservations. We had reserved Sunday night at the dinner show, but heard from others that it was disappointing. We changed to a different restaurant. Anyway, while we were sitting there, it started to rain. I remembered the paperback books sitting out there, so ran to the pool to cover them. We had the closest building to the pool, so it was a quick run. Anyway, I got to the chairs and covered the books with towels. Now it was pouring. I ran back to the room, soaked. The rain stopped a few minutes later, and we finally got out to the pool. To my surprise, the books were not riuned. Three were library books with a plastic coating. The one book we actually owned did get very wet. Moral: bring library books. We got about an hour of sun before it started to rain again. Torrential rain, violent lightning, and wind blowing the tables and umbrellas away. It would rain most of that day. We spent the day at the bar, the spa, and the internet center (broadband and free of charge, by the way). Dinner that night was at Las Ventanas. Very eclectic menu. Unusual appetizers like lobster over wild rice with a dollop of garlic ice cream (actually very good). Another dish had a drop of mascarpone ice cream, and one of the desserts had bleu cheese ice cream. Ben and Jerry got really creative for this place. Veal medallions with apples was the best dish. Chocolate souffle dessert was perfect--order it with your entree to allow time to prepare. Dinner the following night was at Palazzo, the Italian restaurant. Started with a crab soup. They brought out a bowl with a single shrimp in it. Then another waiter came and filled the bowl with the soup. One of the best soups you will ever eat. Every entree was wonderful. All were presented under silver cover, with the covers removed simultaneously by the waiters. Nice touch. Small portions (as with all the restaurants), but it ended up being a 7 course meal so we were definitely full. Final dinner was at Spices. Interesting gourmet Mexican food, (not tacos and burritos). Started with a tortilla soup. Same presentation as the other soup. They brought a bowl with spoonfuls of guacamole, cheese, chopped chicken, sour cream, and tortilla strips. Then they poured the soup over everything. Delicious. Best entrees were chicken in a mole sauce and filet mignon wrapped in banana leaf. The eats at RH are very fancy. These restaurants compare to the finest restaurants in the world. Menus are a bit unusual, but creative and well executed. All-inclusive wines include a selection of 8 wines that typically sell for about $6 a bottle in the US (Citra Montepulciano, Delicato Shiraz, etc). The Mexican choices from Baja California were surpisingly good. Each restaurant has a more extensive wine list for purchase. Service was impeccable. Little things like the soup service were very noticable. More subtle touches like always serving or pouring from the right, always serving the ladies first, and knowing who ordered which dish without asking. Lime for your water is served on ice in a martini glass. If you ask for a fork, they bring it on a platter. Five-star etiquette everywhere. Bar drinks were plentiful, well made, and served reasonably quickly. All the usual tropical drinks, plus many unique creations, all delicious. Most brands are available if you ask for something specific (no Grey Goose L'Orange, though--had to drink regular Goose or Absolut Mandarin). Wide variety of tequilas, as you would expect. Corona and Negro Modelo on tap. Bottled water everywhere, flat or sparkling. Absolutely no stomach problems, by the way. Service around the beach and pools was excellent as well. Alberto comes by late morning with a fresh fruit cart, serving whatever you like. Waiters will bring you whatever drink or food you wish, anywhere in the resort. I recommend afternoon ice cream by the pool. Want to raise your umbrella or sunshade, someone is right there to do it for you. Always with a smile and never with a hand out. We tipped when the service went beyond what we expected. That included our concierge, Vicky, who did a great job juggling our reservations, finding us at the pool to get our approval, and leaving the confirmations in our room. She even joined the staff dancing to \"Love is in the Air\" every afternoon at the pool. The grounds are immaculate. Rooms are in small 2-3 story round villas with a small courtyard in the center, each one with its own concierge. The walk from the lobby (front) to the beach (rear) takes about 2 minutes. It's a small intimate place, only 200 rooms. The infinity pool is beautiful. Beach is not very large, but it's part of the very long Playacar beach with many resorts. You can walk all up and down the beach and check out the neighboring hotels. The RH beach is still very nice, and is not much smaller than the neighboring hotels. Ocean is an amazing turquoise color, very clear water, a few rocks but nothing to worry about. Sand is soft and clean. Entertainment and nightlife are lacking. Not a problem for us. Our nightly entertainment was enjoying leisurely gourmet dinners and conversation, with plenty of drinks. By then we were ready to end the day. If you need to be entertained, you need to leave the property (10-15 minute walk or short ride to downtown Playa del Carmen). I have a thread on the Yucatan Peninsula forum that will answer any questions.

Our concierge was Gisel who was lovely and managed to get us booked into all the restaurants at the time we wanted. She even managed to find the football results for my husband. Housekeeping kept our room spotlessly clean and we often came back to animal sculptures on our bed made from towels. The pool chairs around the infinity pool were always taken by 7.30am.

During the second week of our stay they moved some table and chairs at the second pool and put more pool chairs, so they seem to be addressing the situation. The service from the waiters around the pools was excellent, they worked non-stop. In the afternoon we often had a delicious Coconut Ice Cream served in Martini glasses.

In fact, there are only 5 entres' and 2 of those are vegitarian. The re-vamped Azia is great with a choice of sushi, hibachi and some Thai dishes. The Grill Reastaurant at the beach was one of our favotites, especially the Argentinian mixed grill. Our only little nit picking issue was the bedding. We thought the sheets and pillows could be of higher quality. All in all RH is still the finest resort in Riviera Maya and a great choice for a wonderful vacation.", "Date": "July 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Asheville, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cPerfect!\u201d", "Author": "Dave8001", "ReviewID": "UR5423258", "Content": "Royal Hideaway was a perfect experience!

All of the staff were extremely friendly and helpful, and they definitely took pride in their work. I would definitely recommend this resort to anyone. FYI- This resort really caters to couples, which was wonderful. So, if you're not travellng as a couple, you may feel a little out of place. The resort doesn't make you feel out of place, but if you are sitting out around the pool, you notice pretty quickly that everyone is \"coupled\" up.", "Date": "July 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Earth City, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cBetter than the Ritz!h\u201d", "Author": "wincha", "ReviewID": "UR5396727", "Content": "We arrived at the Royal Hideaway after a pleasant 45 minute drive in a large van.We were 2nd to be dropped off. Our transportation was included in our Apple vacation package. There was no need to spend more money for a private drive as we would have arrived 5 minutes early. The ride was comfortable. Then we arrived at the hotel and were given a glass of champagne and cool moist towel. The bellman was very nice and my husband made arrangements to go into town with him for the World cup game in which Mexico was playing. Our room was ready and what we requested, the top floor(2nd) in building 25(we requested an interior building). Very nice with vaulted ceilings. The grounds are beautiful! There are gardens throughout and also 2 more private swimming pools and jacuzzis. We already had a reservation for La Venatas for 8pm and then made the rest of our dinner reservations for the rest of the week. We reserved 2 dinners at Azia's(1 after the dinner show) Pallazo's and then dinner on the beach from the Grill which was included in our Royal Romance package through Apple Our first night we ate at La Venatas. It was very good and I would recommend it once. The stewed lobster appetizer was very good. My lamb dinner was also wonderful. We had a few other things that were pretty good. The desert chocolate souffle was to die for. I would rate it 5 out of 5. We ate one breakfast at La Venatas it was fine however very American. We had the eggs with salsa which was very good. Our other mornings we ate at Spices which I prefered. You could have an omlette made to order and their buffet had such a variety you could try something every morning. I really liked the hot dish which is layered tortilla with cheese. Our last morning we had room service for breakfast which was a continental breakfast which was also very good. One other night we ordered guacomole and chips and wings which were good. I would rate the breakfasts 4.5 out of 5. Every day we ordered our drinks by the pool, enjoyed the shrimp cocktail that is served in cocktail sauce in a Margarita glass. The caesar salad with shrimp was also great. My husband is an early riser so he had no problems getting pool chair by the infinity pool and a beach bed. There were plenty of chairs left by 730am. Also the beach service was better than the pool service. We enjoyed the beach beds it was incredible! Also the beach chairs. The ocean is so blue it was incredible. We had lunch at Spices which was very good. The ceviche is wonderful and also their Spices salad. Their shrimp soups were also wonderful. There was a large variety here so we did not eat dinner here since we had breakfast and lunch. The hostess remembered us by name for each meal. the view at this restaurant is also incredible. I would rate lunches 4.5 out of 5. Our 2nd dinner was at Azias. We ate around the hibachi grill with other couples. It was fun and the food was very good. I noticed there were 2 rooms in the back and later asked our concierge about it. So the last night we ate at Azias after the dinner show. We requested the Tatini room and were seated in a room with the table recessed in the floor and took our shoes off. We had the room by ourselves. It was great. We ordered off the other side of the menu which was Asian. The Pad Thai was great, also stuffed shrimp and Sea Bass Satay! I would rate this 5 out of 5 if you can eat here twice! We had dinner on the beach with champagne, white table clothes, tiki torches around our table, they make the sand hard and have lighted bags all the way to your table. The food was from the grill we had shrimp and steak kabobs, everything we ate was good. It was very romantic. I would highly suggest adding a romance package as adding a dinner costs just as much. We also had 2 robes, perfume accessories for me in swan towels, champagne and chocolate tuxedo strawberries. 5 out of 5. Our only ok experience was Pallazos. The service was slow. I'm pretty sure I got sick from the Portabella mushroom appetizer. I heard others did that night also. The clam chowder was the best! My lamb osso busco was very bad. I grew up eating lamb and I couldn't swallow it it was that bad. Something was wrong with the meat. I talked to someone else who said it was great. I guess I got a bad piece of meat. My husbands tenderloin was wonderful. My shrimp pasta was pretty good but my plate had a ton of oil at the bottom which I think they should have tossed it lightly. I was up sick all night. 3 out of 5. We went to the dinner show but took the advice of eating dinner later. Good choice. Enjoyed the ballet company, very professional and very talented. Not to be missed and a very nice theatre. 5 out of 5. My daughter dances, these dancers are very talented. Don't miss the afternoon tea 4-6 it is very cool and breezy up there and they make the best Mexican coffees! The Mayan coffee is the best it has honey liquor, coffee and kahlua! There are also nice appetizers. Except for the bad experience at the Italian restaurant I would give this resort a 5. Great service, the resort and service comparable to the Ritz. The jacuzzi tub in the bathroom is nice and it is a very large bathroom. You have a fridge stocked with water, soda and beer. You can get room service any time also. The computer room had 24 hour access to the internet so you can email and im your family. One evening they had a very romantic area overlooking the ocean with chairs and beach beds with a saxaphone player. We ended up sitting looking at the ocean with cocktails listening to good jazz music. One night was Casino night which was fine. Most of the entertainment is in the bar and we weren't interested. We did enjoy the dinner show. You can watch a DVD from a large collection from the front desk. It was a very relaxing week. The people are nice. I would highly recommend this resort.

Overall, our stay here has been as perfect as perfect could be, taking into account that nothing really can be perfect. In other words, overall, everything was awesome, but there were a few marks for improvement. PROS- Great service, great food, great pools, great beach. Again, awesome service. Very clean. Comfy pool chairs. Very couple-focused. CONS-Crazy situatiom with pool chairs, lack of English is sometimes annoying, service is slow (but coming from the Northeast, it is more my issue to slow down, than theirs to move faster.) Diet soda tastes really weird. Fruity alcohol drinks tasted a little strange, but still great. What follows below are some pointers, which although seem like complaints, really are more of FYIs. Overall, this resort is the best I have ever stayed at, but I have not been to many resorts. The service really is amazing and they are ever-so accomodating. On Tipping - Although technically not required, seems to be implied as the norm. For breakfast and lunch, depending on service, we tipped between $1-$3 USD. If service was bad, or slow, or forgetful, we did not leave anything. For dinner, if service was great, we left between $3-$5 USD. When at the pool or beach and you ask the waiter for drinks or snacks, we did not tip and it seemed OK. We did not have cash on us anyway at the pool. On Dining - Avoid the dinner theater. It is not worth the time, unless you have a lot of time to kill and you are bored with all other options. The show started about an hour late for us and for menu is really limited. Portion size here is really small. If you are a big eater, the best way to combat that is to just order alot of whatever you want. It is all inclusive, so take advantage. I would also advise to be mindful not to waste food because it is a poor country. Utilize your conceirge for whatever you need. Dinner reservations for the restaurants on the grounds are supposedly important, but often times, the restaurants were never packed. The staff says they focus on service, so that is the point of requesting reservations, althought the restaurants never appearing full. Restaurants AZIA and PALAZZO are great. Sushi at Azia was surprisingly good. You can hit the sushi bar at 6pm and then hit your dinner reservation at 8 or 9pm. Tourist Stuff - The shopping areas are 5th Avenue in Playa Del Carmen, a little shopping mall across the resort (and to the left), and Cozumel (which you get to by a ferry). The shopping is overpriced and ridiculously priced. A lot of fake silver is sold so be careful. The store owners will swear it is real sterling silver, but from our experience, even though it is marked, it is not real. There is not any customer satisfaction system here, dont forget. Cozumel was OK, but again, if you do not have time to kill, do not bother. The stores hound you to buy stuff, but they use funny lines like (Buy my junk, let me rip you off.) As for pharmaceuticals, there is a lenient policy here with what you can buy. Keep in mind that there are a lot of fakes and that goes for Cuban Cigars, etc. On Pool Chair Situation - An unfortunate reality. Just get up early and do it. Up at 530am, get dressed, go to the pool, claim your chairs. Get the float rafts, roll them up under your pool chair. Throw an item of clothing on the chair, see the sun rise, and go back to sleep. Dont just roll a towel down because people will claim it, even though you were there first. They are less likely to touch your personal clothing. Magazines can get swiped, so be careful with laying them down. On Beach Beds - As for the beach beds, there are very few of them--perhaps 6 of them. You have to get up earlier for them, but sleezy people lay their towels out the night before to claim them. Do what you want in those situations. There are Security Guards that seem to keep an eye over beds when they are tipped. I personally would report that if I saw it because it is unfair to all other resort guests. Also, if the Security Guards sense a potential guest argument over the beach beds or they were tipped off, they will come to you and tell you that the beds are closed. It is total bull. They did that to me one time and then a few hours later, a couple was laying in a bed that should have been mine. Beach beds are super relaxing, but overrated. Last pointer, bring bug spray. Mosquitos have a field day. Bottomline, this is an awesome resort and you will have no regrets.", "Date": "June 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cA truly 5-star experience\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5361486", "Content": "My boyfriend and I just came back from the 6-night stay at Royal Hideaway, and we were definitely blown away by the quality of the food, the service, and I mean, everything. Arrival: Royal Hideaway is located in Playacar, which is a good 45-min drive from Cancun airport. It\u2019s not a large airport, yet the custom is very efficient. It only took about less than an hour for us to get off the plane, take the transit bus, go through the customs and pick up baggage. We reserved a car service (it\u2019s called Cancun Limo) before we left for the trip and I highly recommend everybody to do so. The round-trip fare for two people is around $144, and you don\u2019t need to share the car with anybody else. Greeting: The hotel has giant gates and was guarded 24-hours a day. The guard needs to verify your identity before letting you in. This makes us feel very safe. The amazing experience starts once we stepped into RH. The bell staff immediately greeted us and helped us with the luggage. He took us to the lobby to check-in and handed us with cool towel and bubbling champagne. After the check-in, another bell-staff led us to our room, and on the way, he introduced the landscape of RH and the location of various restaurants and facilities. Room and Concierge: We lived on the second floor of villa 29, which has a lovely garden view. Each villa has its own concierge staff, which I love, because it ensures he/she will take care of your needs. Our concierge is Mendoza, who did an amazing job in making the dinner reservations, massage appointments and water sports reservations for us. We have read other people\u2019s reviews that it was very difficult to make dinner reservation. We were fortunate to try all of them with no hassle, so applause to Mendoza! Room Service: We are very impressed with the room service. Though it claims as a light menu, we still found plenty to choose from. We have ordered four times during our trip and tried most of the items. The quality of the food is comparable to any other 5-star hotels. We would highly recommend the Caesar salad, the oprah cake, and the three milk cake. Other dishes are also great, but just not as outstanding as those three. The room service is very efficient and professional, which usually takes about 20 \u2013 30 minutes. Pool Seating: Just like other people have mentioned, the pool seating policy has to be improved. My boyfriend and I have to get up early just reserve two seats, and most of the time, they are already occupied. Other than that, sitting by the pool is lovely, provided with the unbeatable oceanic view. We usually spent a good afternoon by reading some magazines and resting in the pool. The staffs frequently come to you and ask if you need anything to drink or eat. The food is prepared by the Snack Bar, which is a major lunch spot by the pool. So, if the Snack Bar is full, having lunch by your pool bench is a great idea. Sports: RH offers free daily activities, and your concierge usually places the activity sheet in your room everyday, so you have an advance notice of what you want to participate the next day. My boyfriend and I joined the early morning tennis. It was a luxury to us because we were the only two students there; therefore it\u2019s more like a semi-private lesson. Our instructor is Leo, who speaks very fluent English. He was very patient and gave us a lot of helpful advices. One thing: Don\u2019t play tennis in the afternoon. IT KILLS YOU. Also, only tennis shoes are allowed on the court. Other than tennis playing, we also participated in Mexican cooking. It\u2019s okay, but not great. RH has evening activities as well, which includes the live music, casino night and trivia questions night. We went to the casino night, and it was a lot fun. Moreover, it\u2019s a good opportunity to make some new friends. Water Sports: My boyfriend and I joined the snorkeling trip, which costs $33 each. We took the boat to the other side of the island which is around 30 min from RH beach. The trip worth every penny we spent. You can make the reservation with your concierge. We also played the kayaking. It was free and with a lot fun. Restaurant: We are truly impressed with every single restaurant. Spice: It\u2019s located by the pool and offers breakfast, lunch and dinner. The breakfast is buffet-style and has quite lot varieties. You can choose from pancake, waffles, sausages, cold-cuts, smoke salmon to danish, fresh fruit and juices. They also have the omelet booth which cooks the omelet from scratch. The lunch offers more Mexican style food. My boyfriend ordered the chicken enchilada, steak taco, and I ordered fried whole fish. They all tasted flavorful. The dinner is also Mexican style, but the menu is totally different from lunch. It has more seafood choices. We will give Spice a 3.5 out of 5. The Grill: It\u2019s also located by the pool, right beneath Spice. It\u2019s the snack bar during the daytime. As you can tell by the name, it offers mostly grilled steak and seafood. The only complaint we have was the lack of air conditioning. My boyfriend and I had grilled rib eye and grouper, and they were nicely prepared. We will give The Grill a 3.5 out of 5. Pallazzo: This is the Italian style restaurant, and we were amazed by the decoration and the plating. The must try dishes here are the leading salad and the clam chowder. The server poured the soup in front of you and you will find a generous portion of clam. We will give Pallazzo a 4.3 out of 5. Azia: This is the Asian style restaurant, and we agreed with other reviewers that this is one of the best restaurants. Everything was freshly prepared, from sushi to sashimi. We also tried the benihana style grill. I had the seafood combination and my boyfriend had the steak with grouper combination, and they were all nicely done. We will give Azia a 4.6 out of 5. Venata: This is a Michelin rated restaurant, and is very contemporary in decoration. It offers breakfast in a la carte style and dinner as well. Every dish we tried was very delicious. The must try item is the crab soup. The soup is very creamy and you will have a generous portion of crab meat. We will give Venata a 4.6 out of 5. Royal Theater: This is a very unique dining experience. In here, you have the opportunity to enjoy the traditional Mexican dancing while dining. The food is good, but not great. We will give Royal Theater a 4 out of 5. RH also offers high tea time everyday from 4 to 6 pm in the main lobby. Petite snacks, pastry and various beverages. If you feel bored at the beach, hanging out for some high tea is not a bad idea at all. Overall, we have a lovely experience at RH, and we would like to recommend it to everybody. This is the first time we stayed there, and we believe it won\u2019t be the last.", "Date": "June 19, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Place\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5353302", "Content": "My wife and I just returned from 5 days at the Royal Hideaway and will return again as soon as possible. As we live in Texas, this is a very quick trip to a very fine resort. This is a wonderful resort with excellent food, service and amenities. All the activities you could possibly want to pursue are available right from the beach. Our room was immaculate and our concierge (Lulu) was gracious and very helpful. Lulu made our dinner reservations as soon as we arrived at the villa. The food was delicious, especially the seafood dishes. We did not experience Azia, but all the others were fantastic. As a side note, Ventanas is not for the \"meat and potatoes\" crowd. Having the phrase \"Truffle Essence\" on the menu should give you a hint. I highly recommend tipping the wait staff working the beach area but if you do, beware, the alcohol content of your preferred beverage becomes lethal very quickly. As far as the pool chair situation goes, it had zero impact to our trip. We did not travel all the way to the Mexican Riviera to lay by a swimming pool and eat guacamole. That luxury can be experienced at your home or at any apartment complex in America. There are always plenty of chairs on the beach and we always had first row nearest the turquoise water. In my humble opinion, take the positive reviews of the Royal Hideaway to heart and the negative reviews with a grain of salt. We have stayed at many places in Mexico and none come close to the RH.

First of all here's how we evaluate our vacation. First and most important is the food, then the service and then the location. The food is great! Every restaurant that we had dinner was like going to a five star restaurant. We liked Pallazo the best (fresh made pasta, try the spinach fettuccini) and Ventana's chocolate souffl\u00e9 should not be missed. All the fish dishes were exquisite. We were not too crazy about the sushi as Azen but that's because we are used to Sushi at Nobu. Breakfast was excellent as well at Spices. We liked the idea of making all your dinner reservations when you first get there, so that way there is no waiting. I wasn't too thrilled with the idea of dress casual for dinners, but it really made dinner a great experience!! There was so much attention to detail when it came to the service. The wait staff and our personal concierge (one for every 20 couples) and even the beach staff were excellent. We never had to ask for anything because they were so great about coming to us. The beach is large enough for the size of the resort. The resort is located on a strip of beach with other resorts but our beach was the best. We were the only resort that had canopies to give you shade so that you could hang out in front of the beach all day without frying. And the beach staff would ask you which chairs you would want, then they would bring out a couple of large beach towels for each chair, they would clean the chairs (if needed) and then they would set up the chairs with the towels and then they would ask you if you wanted the canopy for shade. Waiters came around frequently to take food and drink orders. They would even take some of our drinks away (where the ice had melted and the liquid was warm) and they would bring fresh drinks without having to be asked!!! Some reviewers have complained that the chairs by the main pool and the outside beds get reserved so early that it's hard to secure these. This is true, but to tell you the truth, we wanted to hang out at the beach more than sit by the pool! We can hang out at the pool in Dallas, but we can't see those crystal clear waters and the waves at home. No wrist bands, no hassles, you just go and eat or drink. After a couple of days they even knew and recognized us by name. We are definitely coming back to this resort! Everything was wonderful! We were looking for a luxury resort to relax at and we found it. Since this resort is kind of geared towards adults, you don't have noisy kids running around and you don't have those 18 yr old spring breakers running around. We did plan on going around to some of the sights and tours but after arriving at the resort, we couldn't get ourselves to leave! It's too nice. The tennis instructor is very nice, and they even had shoes that we could borrow (we only brought running shoes).

This place was top notch. The bus ride from the Cancun airport was 45 mins to an hour. Not very much fun and not very pretty. The welcome was great. We were ushered to a couple of big chairs with a couple of glasses of champagne. My colleague was there previously and we followed his recommendations of booking all of the restaurants right away. We did The Grill, Spices and Azia once each and Palazzo and Las Ventanas twice each. We went to see the show at the Club Royale on Sunday and Tuesday - but did not eat there. I could see how booking the restaurants would be frustrating for people who did not book early, as we did. So make sure you book immediately after arriving. You can always switch later - but book something. The food was comparable to the Celebrity Cruise my wife and I went on for our honeymoon. The presentation was incredible. The majority of the dishes tasted great too. If you are not adventurous, do not eat at Ventanas. We loved it. Book the terrace at Palazzo and a Teppanaki (sp?) table at Azia. Azia was a great restaurant as well. The Filet was incredible. The Caprese salad at Palazzo is as good as any restaurant in Toronto. I brought about US$75 in $1 bills to give away as tips. The service at dinner is so good that you feel great about giving $5 to your server. On one occasion, I even called the chef out to give him a tip. I am sure the staff appreciate tips, though totally not required. I really can't say enough about the dinners, they were amazing on their own - but coming from an all-inclusive made it even more impressive. Having stayed at a Riu 2.5 years ago, I can say this - not even in the same ballpark. A completely different level. Every morning, we would wake up around 7, grab chairs by the pool (this was very annoying), work out and grab breakfast. Unfortunately you will have to play the immature game of reserving your chairs with a towel, book, etc. Otherwise, you will not have prime pool real estate. I am a moral person, but I also like good pool seats. Plus, we hated the chairs on the beach. The workout room is good enough - 1 eliptical, 4 treadmills, 4 bikes and weights/Cybex machines. We never had to wait too long for a machine. Breakfasts were rotated between Spices and Ventanas. Ventanas had awesome breakfasts. Eggs Benadict rocked! The smoothies at Spices were always great. The breakfast menu at Spices never changed, but you can easily mix it up for variety. During the day, we just plopped ourselves by the pool, read, swam and just relaxed. This is just what we wanted. We're not big water sport people - we just wanted to totally relax. At around 4, we would grab a DVD, or nap back in our room. Rooms were great, by the way. Second best room we ever stayed in (best was an upgraded room at Aladdin in Vegas. The one knock on this resort was location.

The villa is centrally located and the room is gorgeous. Giant bed (high quality bedding), large room, even nicer bathroom and everything was spotless. We got new towel sculptures daily. Pool \u2013 We are pool people. We enjoy sitting by a pool and reading the day away. This resort has one of the best pools, albeit it quite small. The infinity pool overlooks the beach and gets the ocean breeze. There is no doubt that the pool is the social center of the resort. And because of this, either my husband or I would get out of bed at 5:15 AM each morning to reserve a chair. By 5:40 every single chair was taken. There is no doubt, it is ridiculous, but have encounter the same thing at almost every nice resort I have been to \u2013 it is the nature of the beast. I did notice chairs that were left for long periods of time and I find that irresponsible. Once you are in your chair \u2013 life is perfect. We sat there from the minute we got up to the minute we went to go get ready for dinner. It was also where we got to meet our resort friends and our best memories from our honeymoon were just reading a book at the pool. Note \u2013 we did actually see a fight ensue over a chair \u2013 in order to avoid this, the resort should look into adding more chairs. Beach \u2013 We spent the first day at the beach (we checked in and the chairs were all gone) and it was nice but VERY hot. The breeze passes over the beach and the heat is much more intense. Food \u2013 Breakfast was good, not great; Spices had fresh fruit, pancakes, and an omelet bar but the menu didn\u2019t change. They did have great coffee. We ate lunch at the snack bar and enjoyed it the first 4 days. Then we heard about the fact that you could eat lunch at Spices and we were so upset we missed such great food. Lunch at Spices was our best meal of the trip. They have very authentic Mexican (local spices and seasonings) and every single item we had there was so good. We ate at every restaurant except the Italian and our favorite was Aiza (because of the Hibachi grill \u2013 try the rib eye there!) and Ventanas (we like gourmet dining) for the tasting menu. The two disappointments were the Sunday night show \u2013 the food was not good and the grouper fish was undercooked (we noticed that a lot of people got up early and left) and we did not like The Grill because it was so hot (the lack of air conditioning was a killer) and our food was not cooked properly. All in all, the food was way beyond any AI food. It was excellent and we were excited for every single meal. Guests \u2013 Hands down, what made our vacation so special were the great people we met. There were a lot of honeymooners and even more couples on return trips to the RH. We even met a couple on their 7th return trip. Activities \u2013 We heard from the resort staff that the RH does not want to do any activity that will lessen the peaceful feeling at the resort. Therefore, the activities are all away from the pool and in order to find them, you need to seek them out. The activities staff (great team \u2013 work so hard) will come around and ask you to participate because they do not want to turn into a Club Med-ish resort (where you HAVE to participate in everything). I only joined in three of them (cooking lesson, Spanish lesson and towel sculpting lesson) and they were a fun break in the day. Entertainment \u2013 First, it is important to remember that 70% of the staff to the RH is new. That being said, they worked their rears off to plan events. Some nights they worked (we enjoyed casino night and song trivia) and sometimes they were a bust. We did hear a lot of complains about the Allegria Patio Bar\u2026it wasn\u2019t that great (service was slow) and we suspect that the majority of bug bites were from sitting outside at the bar. All in all, we think the Royal Hideaway is the gem of Mexican resorts. When we first looked into our honeymoon, we were looking at the Caribbean, Bahamas, Tahiti, etc but we could not have been more pleased with our decision. We are already looking forward to our return trip.", "Date": "June 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cA \"B\" for RH\u201d", "Author": "trvlrlvr", "ReviewID": "UR5324781", "Content": "My husband and I have just returned from five nights at Royal Hideaway. I\u2019m not sure under which rating system this would qualify as a five star resort. While it had some fine features, and was certainly more pleasant than the family oriented all-inclusives, there\u2019s nothing particularly unique or luxurious about Royal Hideaway. Accommodations Overall, the hotel property is lovely and any residual damage from the hurricane is minimal. There was maintenance and construction going on while we were there but the work was in no way obtrusive. The rooms were nicely appointed (though a bit overcrowded with furniture) and very clean. Air-conditioning was abundant and noisy. Though we were fortunate to be in a building close to the beach with a room facing the courtyard, those in rooms situated towards the neighboring resorts had to contend with crowd noise and loud music well into the night. The Pool Chair Drama As others have reported, the morning tragicomedy surrounding pool chairs is laughable and yet also intensely frustrating. Guests really do get up at 5 am to reserve the coveted \u201cBeach Beds\u201d and prime chair locations. This wouldn\u2019t be a problem if they then actually used these spots. I witnessed one man reserve eight chairs at 6 am though, as the day progressed, only two of these were ever occupied. Reserving a chair (by leaving books and other personal items there) does not stop the umbrella poachers however. Around 8 am, while the early risers are having breakfast (their chairs and pool floats safely secured), the second wave comes in to claim chairs and \u201csteal\u201d others\u2019 umbrellas. This ridiculous back and forth continues throughout the morning. The resort has a policy against reserving chairs but it is not enforced by the staff. Being forced to get up early to ensure a place to sit is not my idea of luxury. Dining As has been mentioned, dinner reservations are difficult. Our \u201cconcierge\u201d (in name only, as she was of little service) told us we could only get in to any of the five restaurants at 6 or 9 pm. With a little cajoling on our parts we were eventually able to negotiate a better schedule. We had no complaints about the service in any of the restaurants though did find Ventanas and Azia were exceptional in this regard. Overall, Azia was our favorite meal and we were sorry to dine there only once. Ventanas was also good though not extraordinary. Food presentation there is lovely (I overheard one guest dismiss it as \u201ctoo frou frou\u201d) but not all the dishes were successful. There were significant highs and lows to the tasting menu which, oddly, does not change from night to night. The Grill was by far our worst meal. The menu here is in the style of a steak and fish house but the overcooked swordfish I had was a disaster. Spices was fine for dinner but became our first choice for lunch as the snack bar offers only subpar bar food. We were not able to try Palazzo. Breakfast, offered buffet style at Spices or a la carte at Ventanas, failed to impress and after the first few days we skipped it altogether. Activities Other than resort scuba lessons, the daily activities\u2014Spanish lessons, water aerobics, towel folding lessons, etc.\u2014did not appear to be well-attended. My husband, an experienced certified scuba diver, found the diving excursions difficult to schedule but ultimately worth the effort. In the evenings, the Allegria bar featured live music, silly trivia and couples contests, or Karaoke. When it rained, the resort\u2019s extensive DVD library came in handy.

I made dinner reservation at Palazzo in advance to celebrate my husband's birthday. From the moment we entered the front gate, every staff member-the bellman, the registration clerk, the concierge, even the pool bar manager knew him by name and knew it was his birthday, AMAZING!!!!!! Our room was decorated with balloons and a birthday banner. These people know about customer service. We were genuinely impressed. The new infinity pool is beautiful as was the beach area. We loved the sunning beds! Getting up early just to stake out your lounge chairs by the pool is a drag but there were plenty of spots on the beach. The resort property appeared to have completely recovered from the hurricane, and is as beautiful and lush as we remembered. The entire resort is tranquil and serene. This is a place for romance and relaxation. If you want a lot of activities or partying, go elsewhere! I personally enjoyed a shady spot to read a book and a tall cool drink whenever I want one. Food is awesome! I love Las Vantenas. Completely redone, the place is gorgeous and the food is on par with any top rated restaurants anywhere. Reservations can be tough but book in advance if possible. We also enjoyed Palazzo and Azia for dinner and Spice for lunch, you can't beat the ocean view. In my view, the service is what sets RH apart. The staff was uniformly friendly, courteous and helpful. Eventhough tipping is not expected, we did because we appreciated their service.

This was our 15th wedding anniversary and first vacation in 4 years (we have a 4 year old daughter - need I say more?). I wanted a special vacation where I would not have to worry about anything and could just relax and be spoiled and the RH certainly lived up to that. We paid extra for non-stop service from the airport which was nice considering the drive to and from the resort is pretty ugly and not worth spending one extra minute on the road. When we arrived, we were given the customary cool towels and glass of champagne and, because it was before check in time, we were escorted to the beachside grill for lunch. Our room was on the 3rd floor looking over the (non noisy) Occidental resort next door. While the view wasn't that great, it was extremely quiet and we were thankful not to be looking out at the Riu on the other side which rocked each night with loud music and neon lights. The room was extremely clean (a pet peeve of mine) and my only complaint was that air conditioning was WAY TOO COLD. Despite adjusting the temp constantly, I still had to sleep with the bedspread and a robe thrown over me as the vent blew directly on my face. Note - ladies, bring your own hair dryer if you can. The one in the room is so dinky and ineffective, it took me 30 mins and my hair was still wet. Add a little bit of humidity and I had the frizzies pretty bad! The worst thing about the resort is the dreaded pool chair situation. Each morning we would be at the beach by 8am only to find every pool chair \"claimed\" and so we would sit on the beach lounges which were still nice but were too hot if you pulled up the cabana roof (blocked the breeze) but without the cover, you baked in the sun. I desperately wanted to relax under an umbrella at the pool so my last two days there, I woke up at 5:30 am and went to the pool for my chair - ridiculous! Even worse, people made fun of me for actually sitting there at 5:30 in the morning watching the sunrise instead of leaving my book and going back to my room. My not so subtle comments about \"I couldn't possibly be so rude as to claim a chair and then leave it vacant for hours when others would like to use it\" fell on deaf ears. People just advised me to \"get over it\" and \"everyone does it\" but I left with my integrity intact (and some great photos of sunrise!). And that was the only bad thing about the resort. The best thing was absolutely the food! Despite reports to the contrary, we had abolsutely no trouble making reservations for every night (skip the cheesy theater extravaganza and enjoy fairly empty restaurants that night). Except for the first night which was rather early at 6:30pm, we had reservations almost every night at 7:30pm in every restaurant we wanted to try. We ate at Azia 3 nights and it was by far the best and we adore Asian cuisine. Las Ventanas was our next favorite (try the tasting menu and the chocolate souflle is to die for!) but I agree with other reviewers that only those who appreciate fine dining should try this. Whenever I spoke with someone who did not like Las Ventanas, the typical response was the food was \"weird\" and they prefer meat and potatoes. Do not attempt unless you like unique culinary experiences - it's not Applebees. Palazzo was hit and miss - appetizer was outstanding but my husband's pork tenderloin was way overcoooked and my risotto was undercooked. We ate at Spices most mornings for breakfast (decent but not anything exceptional) and lunch a few times (great change from the poolside menu). We ate there for dinner twice and were very pleased. I had the sea bass and it was tremendous. Again, this is not Taco Bell - true Mexican food does not always include hamburger meat and red sauce. Expect lots of fish and delicate sauces - be adventurous, it's a vacation! Our only disappointment was The Grill - we actually left without finishing the food and service were so bad. Perhaps we caught them on a bad night as other travelers had much better experiences but both my appetizer and soup were so bad I could not eat them and did not even attempt an entree as my appetite was shot by then. We were not offered any wine, our waiter could barely understand us, it was hotter than anything (only restaurant without air conditioning) and we had to practically beg for dessert. We finally gave up. Service is generally top notch. One night I overestimated the amount of maki roll and sashimi I could eat and attempted to cancel the rest of my dinner order rather than waste it. Instead, the waiter had my entree delivered to my room so when I returned later I could finish it at my leisure. Another night, we wanted the chocolate souffle at Ventanas but did not want dinner there so the staff agreed to have it sent to our room via room service. Nice touch. We had room service many mornings (Fresh coffee, juice, pastries & fruit) and a few times in the afternoon when we missed lunch. It was always delivered in less than 20 minutes. We enjoyed tea a few afternoons though don't count on it for food - the enjoyment is sipping a beverage and enjoying the breeze. Contrary to other reviews, I actually thought most staff spoke English fairly well and were quite accomodating when I attempted my high school Spanish. Pool service is fairly attentive. We ended each evening at the piano bar or at the outdoor bar listening to music, smoking cigars (my husband not me) and enjoying a cocktail. Weather was fabulous - never rained. Evening breezes were pleasant - daytime temps were a bit warm but manageable. We took a cab into town one day but not worth it - I did not come there to shop and I'm not one who likes to listen to vendors yelling \"I got what you want lady\" all day long. We spent our days reading, eating, lounging...just relaxing. Yes, the crowd is mostly older and I saw only one teenager the entire 2 weeks which is what I wanted. I was vacationing without my child for a reason - I do not want to listen to other people's children if I leave my own at home. There was one group of young 20-somethings that arrived on a Thursday that, to my chagrin, thought they were in a fraternity house or strip bar and constantly yelled \"whoo-hoo\", spilled their beers on everyone and brought their portable stereo to the beach annoying everyone with their music. Luckily they only stayed a few days but PLEASE do not come here if you are a partying, fun-seeking group of people. This is clearly a resort for the well-heeled, conservative crowd who enjoys relaxing, great food, and good conversation. Even the somewhat boisterous crowd from New York - hey Stacey - was well behaved but still clearly had fun. They knew not to let their fun ruin other people's fun. Would we go again - absolutely!

While I think this is an above average resort, I think it falls short of being excellent. First of all, they weren't expecting us. They didn't have our name on the list at the front gate, and I had to show the itinerary from my travel agent to confim that I did indeed have a reservation. We were shown to a ground floor room with an extremely noisy air conditioner. In addition, each Villa has an open courtyard with a fountain (that is on in the daytime) and its own concierge. Well at 8am every morning the fountain would go on and the concierge would start her day, talking with guests and making phone calls. It sounded as if they were in the room with us! Since we are from the west coast, 8am in Cancun is 6am for us. Too early to be awakened in such a manner. After 2 days of this we asked to change our room and they did so. Our next room was on the 2nd floor and luckily the air conditioner was merely loud, but tolerable, and the noise from the courtyard was considerably less. Dinner reservations are difficult. The day after we arrived we booked our restaurant reservations for the week. But unfortunately most nights we had to choose between 6pm and after 9pm as all the other times were taken, which was a bit of a drag. We got the romance package which included dinner on the beach one night which was nicely done. Overall I think The Grill and the asian restaurants were very good. The italian restaurant was ok. Ventanas, which is the signature restaurant was very good but hard to get into. As with most all inclusive places where people don't pay for alcohol, the stuff is flowing all day long. Even the afternoon tea is really a cocktail hour. In fact you can't get a decent cup of tea anywhere in whole resort. I really expected something better than a single Lipton tea bag in a pot (or often just a cup) of lukewarm water. They sould really just call it a cocktail hour if they can't figure out how to make a simple pot of tea. Having said all of this the food was all good, (except for the tea) and sometimes it was quite good. Wines are kind of a disappointment even if you spring for a \"premium\" bottle at dinner as the wine list is very small and prices seem high for what you get. But mixed drinks were excellent.

After arriving and being greeted with glasses of champagne while we waited to checkin, we were impressed from beginning to end by nearly everything the Royal Hideaway had to offer. 1. Service- incredible service, better than any Four Season or Mandarin Oriental we've been to (or at least on par). Everyone went out of their way to help us, and considering gratuity was included we were impressed. We did follow an earlier posters remark and brought $150 in one dollar bills for tipping. Had a nice talk with a bartender there and he said though they don't expect it, it is greatly appreciated. Zero problems with the service here from beginning to end, concierge to housekeeping, all impecable. 2. Food- great food, for the price we paid (3 nights, 4 days) we considered it a bargain. Here's some advice. Azia and Palazzo are the best, we'd have liked to have another dinner at Azia if we stayed longer. Sushi is good quality and food cooked before your eyes (Benihana style). We weren't impressed by Ventana, breakfast is ok, and dinner is rather bland compared to others. Spices is great for breakfast and has the best ocean views. Spices for lunch is the best place as well (Palazzo and Azia are dinner only). The quality of food that room service brings is our only gripe. Usually took 45mins and was mediocre (even the fruit was far better at Spices). Tip: sleep in late, but then wake up and grab breakfast outside your room. 3. Beach- crystal clear water, white sand, private bed-like bungalos (not many of them, so go early, nicest ones are right in front of the bar). Not a whole lot of beach in front of their cots, and no snorkeling but fine for what they offered. When we went late we'd go to their sister facility next door. Someone there made a fuss that we didn't have our \"all inclusive\" bands on, but we said we're from next door and were told we could use these cots (covered). I tried to prevent the lady embarrasment by showing our room card and that it was the same occidental group, but she found someone to complain to and they backed us up. We can use the place next door, but they can't use Royal Hideaway as it is adults only and not the same level of all-inclusive :) evil grin. 4. Alcohol- had some decent drinks, but stick to the top shelf alcohols (ie Don Julio, Tanq, Glenfiddich). Oh, and Royal guests don't wear colored bands, just mention your room number or don't mention anything at all. 5. Snorkeling- we went to Akumel, might try taking the ferry to Cozumel or a tour, no snorkeling to speak of at hotel. 6. Shopping- small strip center area 5mins away by cab, but not much i n the way of high quality shopping. May want to save your money for the duty free shop, or borrow a couple of bicycles from the hotel and explore. (included) 7. Activities- ok, this is perhaps another gripe, seems like most of the activites are geared for an older crowd. The Riu next door was always kicking with good music, while we had karaoke nite and trivia night <yawn> Can borrow DVDs to watch as well. The Royal does host an entertaining Mexican Dance Show, basically ballet folklorico, which is entertaining. BUT, I would avoid the food. Go for the show at 730, grab a few drinks, maybe a snack, but make 930 or 10pm reservations at one of the other restaurants. AVOID the buffet style food served here.

My husband and I are well traveled and in the last few years have stayed at the Four Seasons Nevis, Bora Bora Lagoon Resort & Spa and Las Ventanas al Paraiso. All are Leading Hotels of the World including the Royal Hideaway and nothing beats this place. The service is absolutely unbelievable and the food is to die for. Check-In was fast and we even received a complimentary upgrade to an ocean view room. The Bellboy took us down to the room and on the way gave us a mini tour and explanation of the hotel. As we entered our Villa, Luz our Concierge was waiting at the entrance for us. She took us up to our room and helped us settle in. I asked for extra water and coke in the mini-bar and within 5 minutes she had it up there. She was so helpful throughout the stay. Always had a smile and no request was too much for here. Their new designed restaurant Las Ventanas by Sergi Aroli could be easily compared with the top restaurants in New York. It\u2019s a minimalist style restaurant and has very \u201cchic\u201d food. The different blends of flavors were such an experience. The General Manager spoke with us one evening and mentioned that the chef has a Michel 2 star rating and that they are the only all-inclusive in the world to offer a signature restaurant in their plan. We talked with one couple that did not prefer it, but they explained it was to upscale and fancy for them. They also mentioned their favorite place to dine back home was TGIF\u00b4s. Anyone that appreciates exquisite food will love this restaurant All other restaurants are fabulous and the menus could be compared to any Four Seasons. The best thing is you don\u2019t have to pay individually for things. As this was our first trip to an all-inclusive we were a little hesitant at first and could not believe everything was included. On our last trip to the Four Seasons our dinners alone usually ran between $150usd and $250usd. We also loved the grill they would set-up in the afternoons in front of the pool. One day they had Paella in a huge pot. I could not eat enough. My husband loved the fresh fish they grilled another day. One thing that was so relaxing was to see no children on property. There were a few teens, but they mainly listened to their Discmans all day. There is nothing better than having a nice quite meal or nap by the pool without kids yelling, crying or splashing around. We didn\u2019t really leave the property too much. My husband went across the street to golf one morning and he said the course was really good.

We had arranged transfers through the hotel at a cost of $85.00 for two and when we exited the airport, no one was there to meet us. We finally found the representative and he told us that our car was in an accident. Then he told us that the car went for service. After one hour and four or five other reasons, they got us a car. Upon arriving at the hotel, checkin was alright. The hotel has not changed much since the hurricane. Just the addition of the infinity pool, which is o.k. The beach is badly eroded and the loungechairs on the beach are aout 10 feet from the water. You have to be up between 6:00a,m, and 7:00a.m. to stake out your loungechair by the pools. Many people put their things down and do not return until lunchtime to sit. There are not enough chairs.The second night there after eating at Spices, my husband and I became ill with food poisoning. Many other people were ill also. The staff showed concern but dit not have a clue what got a lot of people sick. The hotel has definitely gone down hill since our last visit in 2004. Service is spotty in the restaurants and some staff are indignant. There is a language problem, many of the waiters do not speak very good English and there is difficulty getting accross. The food has taken a turn for the worse, especially at Las Ventanas where some of the entrees and desserts were not edible. The best meal there is breakfast. The hot tubs were never hot or bubbly.

We were truly pleased with all aspects of this resort. On arrival Enrique greeted us and told us he has been able to grant our request of a room in building 31 on the top floor to take advantage of the vaulted ceilings and close proximity to the pool. The room was lovely and very close to the pool. We were however facing the next resort where after a few hours we realized was going to be too noisy. So we requested that Enrique try to move us to a better room with less noise. The next three nights were were in room 2522 in the interior of the resort. If you go to RH be sure to request a room that does not face the next resort. We then faced the main building and while not the ocean it had a lovely balcony. When arriving you will make your dinner reservations immediately. We found that on several nights the only dinner times were at 10:00pm. While late for us we adjusted our schedules and took an afternoon siesta and then ate a late dinner for those nights. The restaurants were all wonderful in our opinion. The breakfast was good though if I had been there for a week I would have tired of it. The service at the pool was terrific. It is true that you do need to get out early to get a good beach chair. We were saddened to see one guest must have brought a stack of professional dental journals and had one designated person to go out at 7am to put one on about 16 of the seats. Many times the seats never seemed to be taken during the day. I think if I had not had a seat I would have been tempted to remove those magazines. Also people would take the pool floats and put them by their seats so they would always have one. I thought this was a bit childish as the floats should just be left for whoever wants one at that time to float on. If you aren't on the float then it is up for grabs. We only took one excursion with the Morning Glory snorkeling trip for 1/2 day. It was not that great and a very long drive to get there. The road going in was totally destroyed by the hurricane an there was trash every where. The reef was pretty but the boat operator wanted every one to snorkel in a small cirlce. I felt this was a bit confining. I wouldn't recommend this tour. Our consierge was Daniella. She was wonderful. She knew about our 20th anniversary and decorated our room before we moved to our new room. She was also great about reminding us of our dinner reservations and helping us change one. If you had not been here before (which we hadn't) you would not know of the hurricane damage. Seeing the photo of the destroyed Spices restaurant is remarkable. They also have high tea from 4-6pm in the main building terrace. It was lovely to sit and enjoy the sun setting and the cool breeze. Over all I felt this resort is worthy of it's #1 rating.

One thing that happened (which was not RH\u2019s fault) we had some loud girls on the bottom level who would come in all hours of the night all drunk loud and obnoxious and wake us up. One night when my husband and I were leaving for dinner they were running around and screaming in the center court with just towels on. I said to hubbie \u201cnow I know who keeps waking us up at night\u201d. We both thought they picked the wrong property to act like that because no one else even came close. Service was impeccable. Grounds were amazing . Staff very efficient. Food was not as good as last time. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it was good. But something was missing. My husband and I thought they made some things a little too over the top and did not care for the new Ventanas. We loved the d\u00e9cor in the old building, but now it\u2019s this cold modern eclectic type of style. The new Chief\u2019s memu seemed quite eclectic too. Spices the Mexican restaurant (dinner) all I wanted was some simple Mexican food. Some of the items didn\u2019t even look like they were Mexican. I wound up ordering chicken with a chocolate sauce. The Palazzo was also OK. We remembered how last year we were so blown away. Not so this time. Let me tell you one word\u2026.DESSERTS. Every place was excellent. Breakfast was always good. I just love the orange juice. Yummie. I am not sure if I should even get started on the beach beds. One day my husband and I sat outside by the Grill and Spices in one of the cushioned chairs up stairs. We claimed the seats around 8am and noticed that the beach beds just below us were all ready staked and reserved . (well of course 8am\u2026HELLO-of course they are taken). We finished breakfast and back to our spot about 9am. Still no people \u2026.we went to lunch about 12 and back around 100pm no people yet in both the beds. About 2pm someone came by to take a couple pictures and the woman asked her friend if he wanted to go back to their other spot. And they both left (keeping the beds still reserved) 4pm we left and not once did anyone lie in either of the beds. I had to be held back from wanting to say you\u2019re a rude @#$^U*^*!()*&^% to those people. We had a great time and God willing will return. Hopefully they will make some adjustments with the food. The beach beds are really not a big deal with me-I get more upset that people are actually that rude.

We chose the Royal Hideaway based on the rave reviews of their food and service and we were not disappointed. We opted for private transfers from the Cancun airport to the Royal Hideaway and I highly recommend going this route. Our flight landed at 11:30am and we cleared customs and made it to the resort by 12:30pm. The lobby of the Hideaway is truly impressive and we were immediately greeted by a very friendly and helpful bellman who directed inside, providing us with cool scented towels and champagne. Our room was not yet ready, so the bellman guided us to the snack bar, giving us a property tour on the way. The grounds of the Hideaway are immaculate, with waterfalls, and relaxation pools dotted throughout. We enjoyed a wonderful lunch overlooking the bluest waters we have yet encountered (and we travel frequently) and then checked into our room which was by far the nicest that we have stayed in at a Caribbean resort. The linens were luxurious and the bathroom allowed for ample space for us both to get ready in the evenings. Our entire stay was utterly relaxing. The dining was wonderful and we are big foodies. We loved the lunch at Spices \u2013 especially the Chili Relejno appetizer and the Corona on tap. Since we were there seven nights we were able to try all of the restaurants, and while all were four to five stars, our favorites for dinner were Palazzo (Italian) and Azia (Asian). Dinners were wonderful, lasting between one and half to two hours with impeccable service, d\u00e9cor, and food. The portions are sized so that you can enjoy a five course meal and your drink glass is always refilled. Before and after dinner, we enjoyed the outdoor section of the Allegria bar which is beautifully lit at night. The tea service outside of Las Ventanas provides a great break from the sun in the late afternoon. We only had room service once (for breakfast) and it was prompt and very good. We enjoyed the beautiful sunrises twice on our stay which also allowed us to reserve a beach bed for the day (yes \u2013 they are all taken by 6:20am). It was nice to relax on, but in general, the weather is so hot that we spent most of our time floating in the pool (drink in hand) or swimming in the ocean. We only experienced a few negatives which were most likely due to the fact that the hotel had only been reopen for a month. These included a botched dinner reservation through our concierge (who was not very good in general; a more centralized system may work better) and the lack of turn down service twice. Also, several of the staff speak very poor English which can prove difficult when they are in a service position. I highly recommend venturing downtown to Playa Del Carman. The town itself is quite large and has many interesting shops. We road into town using the Hideaway\u2019s complimentary bicycles several times during our trip. Finally, in terms of excursions, our favorite was one we arranged before the trip with Dolphin Discovery. This company was wonderful; picked us up at the Hideaway and we were then guided through encounters with seal lions, manatees, and dolphins. It was an unforgettable experience. We booked a snorkeling trip through the beach activities desk and that was a let down due to the choppy waters. We also used the Hideaway\u2019s excursions desk to book a trip called \u201cTulum Express\u201d. While the ruins and our tour guide were worth the trip, be forewarned that you will spend three of the five hours of this trip on a bus making stops at what seems like every hotel along the way.

Our friends had their things removed from the beach chair and when they asked to speak to security no one would come to discuss the matter. I watched for 2 hours other empty chairs with items on them go untouched by security. We had to check out of our room early because the hotel needed the rooms for \"real \"guests and when we were set to transfer we were told we were not taking our luggage and that it would follow.

Our three night vacation proved to be the most relaxing one we have ever taken. Monday morning back at work we both feel refreshed and recharged. We did however hit the resort on a 100% capacity weekend. We visited Thursday \u2013 Sunday. I think the negatives we experienced were related more to the other guests, not the resort amenities or staff. The overall facility is beautiful. Staff is very attentive. The ocean is bright turquoise blue with rolling waves and a white sand beach. The Guests: Most of the guests were in the 30-40-50 age group. Most were couples. There were several groups of about 10-20 guests. The groups were not necessarily rowdy but they were noticeable, especially at the bars and restaurants. Most of the guests we talked to (and I would guess 75% of the resort) were from the north east area. SERVICES Concierge: Laura was our concierge and was truly a pleasure. She always greeted us by name when we came into the villa. Provided accurate information about hotel reservations and things to do on the resort. She was able to stock our mini-fridge to our request. Generally we felt like she was there looking out for us. Check in: Very cordial. We were offered scented cloths and champagne. After the business of credit cards etc we were offered to be escorted to the snack bar for lunch. One thing I particularly noticed is that rather than telling us our room was not ready at 12:30. We were told check in is at 3:00 pm and our room would be ready 1 1/2 hours early at 1:30. This is the start of the \u201cglass is half full\u201d rather than \u201chalf empty\u201d that made us so pleased with the service at RH. Servers & House keeping: Were all professional prompt and respectful. They ranged from efficient to over the top caring. Raul was our server twice in the Spices Restaurant and he truly made the experience a pleasure. DINING Where to start. Royal Hideaway is an epicurean experience. Their menus are ambitious and in most cases very successful. We are serious foodies and appreciated the care, presentation and complication of the menu. Someone who prefers more simple cuisine might find the menus difficult. We were a party of 4 and was able to have a taste of a variety of dishes by sharing with my friends. Overall the food was beautifully presented and exceeded any expectations. Attention to small detail was the hallmark of service at RH. Snack Bar (11:00 am -6:00 pm) The menu reads like a nice beach bar, salads, wings, Mexican fare like taquitos and quesadillas, burgers, sandwiches, soups and light desserts. The presentation sets this way above what is commonly found at a beach bar. Chips, Pico de gallo and guacamole are served as a starter to all guests. Outstanding items: Shrimp Cocktail. Served in a stemmed martini glass with spicy red pepper around the rim and a large shrimp and lime garnish. The shrimp was chunked and lightly covered in a lime-cilantro- cocktail sauce mix. Excellent quality shrimp with a clean sea flavor. Taquitos with shredded chicken and Oaxaca cheese. The chicken was prepared on a wood smoke grill and then shredded. Fresh made tortillas gave this an earthy but light flavor. Served with fresh Pico de gallo and fabulous fresh guacamole. Bar Favorite: Centario Margarita on the Rocks and Strawberry daiquiri Club Sandwich: Just right if you need something soothing Things we don\u2019t recommend: Calamari (too soft) Cheese sticks (frozen food style ordinary) Cuban Sandwich (Served on a big baguette not Cuban bread, not pressed and heated.) Pizza (not bad, not good) Room Service: All room service appetizers were excellent, same as at the snack bar food. We ordered: Chips \u2013 Guacamole \u2013 Pico Chicken Quesadilla w/guacamole Wings Continental Breakfast \u2013 Room service provided a lovely formal service of coffee, tea, fruit plate and small basket of baked goods. Fresh squeezed juices. Las Ventanas by Sergi Arola (6:00 pm \u2013 10:30 pm) We loved this restaurant. It was sleek and contemporary. The bar is a white marble with lights behind it that make the whole thing glow. White tables, white chairs, white lounge chairs near the bar. Live (but not lively) piano music for entertainment. Mahogany louvers separate the dining room and the lounge. Premium wines stacked in ceiling high racks are protected in glass rooms that forms a wall that separates the main dining area from a private room for 8. Service began with bread sticks and a choice of 3 dips: Chipotle butter, pesto cream or tomato bruschetta sauce. We ordered the house red wind and were served Citra Valpolicella. A drinkable wine, something I would put in the surprisingly good for under $6 a bottle collection at my local wine shop. The wine was served in tall stemware. We were offered a choice of sparkling for still water which was interestingly enough poured into the Riedel stemless wine tumblers. One of the signature items at this restaurant is \u201cseasoned\u201d salts served in square bowls set into a long mahogany tray. Black Olive salt was our favorite followed by Pink pepper salt, Juniper salt and Fines herb salt. We recently discovered a very flavorful smokes salt at the reading terminal market and thought the salt thing at RH was very clever. They have a curio table that all the salt trays are stored in between uses. We saw our cute salt tray come out of that table and go right back in after we used it. We were wondering why the salt did not appear to be thrown away after being served to guests especially since the server directed us to use our fingers to sprinkle the salt on our food. Sort of seemed like reserving a basket of uneaten rolls to the next table. This small concern wouldn\u2019t stop us from enjoying these salts on our next visit. Speaking of rolls they were adorable. Served by a waiter from a silver tray. Each roll was slightly larger than a silver dollar. Onion, baguette, bacon, assiago cheese and other flavors. There were a lot of complicated choices on the menu. All of them sounded wonderful and we opted to try the Tasting Menu: Potato Emulsion with Foie Gras and a truffle Essence Tempura Fried Asparagus with Romescu Sauce Crab Soup with Mascarpone Ice Cream Turbot and Portobello Mushroom Toast with a soft alioli sauce au gratin Veal Tenderloin with apples and fines herb butter Chocolate souffl\u00e9 Coulant in the idea of a black forest The table unanimously thought that there were two high points to the tasking menu. The Potato emulsion was out of this world. Just a taste served in a tall shot glass. It was creamy, garlicky and the earth taste of the truffle was enhanced by the richness of the foie. We all wanted more. The Veal Tenderloin was also incredible. The flavors were paired perfectly. The veal was cooked to perfection. Some of us loved the asparagus tempura and others thought that tempura treatment in the fryer zapped the asparagus of all flavor. The Crab soup was also a split decision. The presentation was lovely with the crab \u201ccake\u201d in the center of the bowl and cool cream soup poured over the top at the table side. I personally loved this dish because of the clear forward taste of fresh sea. Others thought it was strong and didn\u2019t like the cold presentation. Turbot and Portobello mushroom was the least impressive of the courses. It was perfectly cooked, but the fish was set on a very crunchy toast which seemed to clash with the creamy au gratin style fish. This was also served next to a \u201cfish bone sauce\u201d which was rich and pungent not a good combination for those who do not enjoy \u201cfishy\u201d tasting fish. Desert was a yummy chocolate \u201clava\u201d style mini cupcake with a soft warm center. It was served with an ice wine which was the perfect balance for this desert. Breakfast at Las Ventanas (7:00 am \u2013 11:00 am) A classical European style formal breakfast. The restaurant has a cool hush feeling to it. The chairs are covered with a burgundy slip cover. The louvers are dark mahogany and the tables white. The table is set with beautiful white on white floral pattern china. Silver coffee/tea service, tall stemware for water and juices. Pastries and toast (with the crusts removed) are served on a 3 level tea server. The offerings are in the full American breakfast style fare. Fresh tropical fruites, yogurt, musli mix. Omelets, eggs to order, waffles, French toast and eggs Benedict. The breakfast was served at a relaxed pace. We read up on the resorts activities and the New York Times fax. Sipped coffee and fresh squeezed orange juice. We both ordered Eggs Benedict. They ask how well we would like them done, we ordered one soft and one medium and were please that they were served correctly. Eggs were exactly as you would expect. Buttery English muffin, thin ham, eggs topped with a hollandaise and broiled just long enough to crisp and gently brown the tops. Spices Breakfast Buffet (7:00 am \u2013 10:30 am) I had both the best breakfast and worst breakfast of my trip here. Same offerings, different times of day and different cooks. Breakfast at 7:00 shortly after the restaurant opened was splendid. I had fruit with yogurt and then a chorizo omelet with white cheese. It was light fluffy with just the right zip from the chorizo. On another morning breakfast at 9:00 was crowded. The offerings on the buffet were picked over and disorderly and I felt elbowed out of the way by impatient guests. The omelet cook was cooking on high heat and had all 4 burners cranking. He was using too much oil to prevent sticking. Consequently the outside of the omelet was cooked to a crisp brown. Because the heat was too high the inside did not cook before the omelet started to burn. He was pressing the omelet forcefully with a spatula to get the uncooked egg to run out the side the same way a short order cook presses a burger on a grill to get the grease out. The same chorizo omelet with white cheese was a burnt greasy mess that I politely declined. The cook offered to start over, but the glares from impatient guests made me to decide to just skip it. Spices \u2013A\u2019la carte (12:30 pm \u2013 2:30 pm) Lunch at Spices was all the better because of the outstanding service by Raul. Offerings were what you would expect from a stylish Mexican restaurant. Creative salads, soups, Mexican specialties, deserts. I had a mixed seafood ceviche and a bowl of lime shrimp soup with a smoked red pepper flavor. Both were fantastic. Spices Mexican and Caribbean Specialties - (7:00 \u2013 10:30 pm) The house white was a blanc de blanc from the Spanish winery Rene Barbier. Crisp and fruity. Another great wine for under $6 a bottle at home. We sat in the room near the bar and found the blender noise to be distracting. But we choose those seats because they were far from the end where they were varnishing wood beams. The lesser of the 2 evils. Again the menu was complicated. Diners at our table started with Shrimp Salad with mango chili piquin and coconut milk foam. We rated this too neutral to bland and flavorless. The Cold shredded beef salad with pico de gallo vinaigrette was flavorful. The smoked grilled meat was a nice contrast to the crisp romaine lettuce and tangy dressing. Two soups were offered; Cream of Spanish pumpkin with shrimps and spinach served with olive oil gelee and Azteca Soup. We recommend both because of the balance of complexe flavors. The pumpkin was rich and creamy. Fans of pumpkin soup in the Caribbean will appreciate this offering. The Azteca was spicy in a tomato chicken broth. We sampled two appetizers: Crab meat enchilada with a three chili sauce \u2013 eahhhh. Not what most of the table expected. Roasted poblano pepper filled with an almond/beef mix \u2013 a perfect blend of savory and spicy. My entree was a filet minion wrapped in banana leave with macha sauce and diced saut\u00e9ed peppers. It was a very tender cut cooked to perfection. The flavors blended nicely. I would recommend the filet. Other Main courses were; Red snapper with coated chayote and cream of squash blossom. Marinated sea bass with Achiote, pineapple sauce, fried tortilla and chopped cilantro Fresh shrimp in a red pumpkin seed sauce with a bean custard cheese and garlic cilantro oil. Chicken in Mole sauce with rice and Oaxaca Cheese Pork loin with cactus leaves in a tepache sauce, grilled cheese and sweet potato puree. Palazzo Italian Regional Cuisine (6:00 \u2013 10:30 pm) This day we had really wanted to linger at the pool rather than get dressed for a 7:00 pm reservation. We even tried to find a way to get something with out having to sit thru a formal diner. The choices on the room service menu didn\u2019t quite offer what we wanted so we dove in to another 2 \u00bd hour meal. Palazzo is a lovely dining room with marble surfaces, flowers and columns. The glass wear on the table has a lovely etched floral pattern. The food was very good or average. The biggest problem was the lack of servers. It felt like 2 guys were taking care of the entire dining room. Wait between courses was 20-30 minutes. We would have enjoyed this meal more if it had come at a speedier pace. Appetizers We passed on the Beef Carpaccio that had a \u201craw eat at your own risk\u201d warning. Several of us chose the Foie Gras Cr\u00e8me Brule with Arugula salad and a pear puree, marsala wine reduction. This dish was served too cool. We think the flavor would have been more developed at room temperature. The best appetizer was the warm puffed pastry stuffed with Portobello mushroom, mozzarella cheese, caramelized onion and watercress. Crisp puff and filled with creamy yummy filings. Salads The Classic caprese Salad would have been great if it wasn\u2019t for the flavorless hot house tomatoes. Soups One of us had the cream of mushroom soup which was amazing. The bowl was presented with 1 shrimp and the thick earthy mushroom soup was ladled over the top. The goodness of this soup was a pleasant surprise. Pasta Tortelloni stuffed with prawns in a fresh basil tomato sauce might have been served without actually cooking the fresh pasta. Other pasta offerings included; vegetable lasagna with leek b\u00e9chamel sauce, Penne Pasta in four cheese sauce, green fettuccine with a Truffle and Mushroom sauce, spaghetti aioli with shrimp and mushroom, Wild mushroom and cheese risotto. Main Courses I ordered the pork saltimbocca. The flavor was quite tasty. Not exactly the same saltimbocca you get in the Italian neighborhoods of Philadelphia but still good. Other Main Courses were: Fresh Halibut loin with asparagus risotto, eggplant caviar and prosciutto powder, swordfish with olives, capers and anchovies over fennel potato, chicken breast stuffed with mozzarella cheese and spinach in a thyme sauce. POOL CHAIRS, BEACH CHAIRS AND BEACH BEDS (CABANAS): RH has beautiful wooden lounge chairs around the pools. They are topped with thick canvas covered cushions and pillows. When we arrived on Thursday afternoon every chair around the pools was \u201cclaimed\u201d as taken, indicated by a magazine or book placed in the center of the chair. Some guests also claimed ownership of a yellow pool float by rolling it up and placing it under the front of their chair. We were at first amused and then later annoyed by this because most of the claimed chairs and rafts were rarely used by their owners. In fact it appeared that only the lonely book occupied many of the chairs each day. Same held true with the beach beds. They were marked as claimed by a magazine. One bed we watched had no people occupying it all day. We were tired from travel on Thursday and were asleep quite early. I awoke at 5:30 a.m. the next morning and walked to the beach to enjoy the sunrise. To my AMAZEMENT most of the pool chairs and all of the beach beds were claimed by books and magazines. We postulated that guests put the books out just after diner, shortly before going to bed. We are frequent guests at Grand Lido Resorts and Couples Resorts in Jamaica where we have never encountered guests who were so aggressive about chairs and turf. Friday afternoon we were feeling put out by the lack of chairs when low and behold a couple got out of their bed and said they were checking out. We felt like we had hit gold. And I will tell you that the beach bed really was THE best spot to enjoy the sun and breeze. Ours was located next to the snack bar directly facing the ocean. We set up camp, got a drink, laid down to relax and enjoy this luxury. Fred summed it up the best; the steady breeze, crash of the waves, mix of smooth jazz from the speakers, flutter of white curtains and soft canvas futon was like getting hit with a Rhino Dart. We were sound asleep within a half hour and completely enjoyed our afternoon in the cabana. Saturday morning we took the cue from the other resort guests and woke up before dawn to claim 4 pool front chairs with umbrellas. Apparently we made the mistake of sitting in a location where a group of about 15 had been the day before. They nosily clammered around us all day and set up drinks and rafts right in front and in the space in between our chairs. We met some nice folks from Texas who had been to RH on 4 other vacations. They said that the competition for chairs and the aggressive guests were unusual for this resort and that on previous visits there were plenty of chairs by the pool even at 10 in the morning. The beach was full of chairs. And there were usually some open in the 4th or 5th row back from the ocean. They were lined up close together as they would be on a cruise ship. There were shade cabanas, towel service and plastic tables available on the beach.", "Date": "May 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Midland, GA", "Title": "\u201cRoyal Treatment at Royal Hideaway\u201d", "Author": "SuzyQue", "ReviewID": "UR5025076", "Content": "We just returned from a short three night stay at Royal Hideaway.

As most of you know by now it reopened March 27. Everything seemed to be working fine. Pools: There are two main pools an infinity pool and one directly behing it. My wife and I usually woke up around 7 am. At around 715am most of the chairs around the infinity pool were taken but plenty remained around pool #2. Servers will start making rounds around 11am but you can go up to the pool bar much sooner than that. Beach: I think the beach became smaller while we were there. The water is clear. There are a few rocks as you walk into the water. There are plenty of chairs at the beach. My recommendation to the hotel was to put about 50% of the chairs in storage to make the beach look bigger. I would say 25% of the beach chairs were occupied at a time. Plenty of topless women at the beach. My wife asked if she could go topless at the pool. They said she could unless someone complained. She never went topless at the pool. The relaxation pools were fairly secluded and I think you can be more aggressive in your clothing options if you know what I mean. I walked up and down the coast. I think all of the beaches South of RH are very nice. The beach is lost as you go north with the exception of a few resorts. I also walked from Senor frogs to Mamitas Club. Without a doubt The beach around Mamitas is the nicest. When I went there were hundreds of people. Food: I think the food was excellent for a Mexican all-inclusive. We ate at all of them. I can't say one is especially better than another (perhaps Ventanas). However, If any of these restaurants were in my town I don't think I would be rushing back to any of them. Breakfast at Spices was good. On our last day we realized we could eat lunch at Spices. We had been eating from the Snack bar menu all week and it was getting very old. I looked at the lunch menu at spices and was upset about our mistake. Service: No complaints/excellent Children: Yes, there are children. My wife estimated there was about 20 children there at one time. I don't think there were that many, however. So if you have older children you won't be the only ones. Supposedly you have to be 13. I would say a few were younger? Vacationers: My estimate would be 50% were not american. The average age around 50? Low key, no partying type group. The only other place my wife and I have stayed in the area is Maroma. I think my wife liked Maroma better because it is a more romantic atmosphere.

This is the truth. And as of this date Occidental has not reinbusred me for the room change nor the other night in the hotel in Merida. Though Occidental and Liberty Travel both left us to fend for ourselves I want to note Expida and Almo both went above and beyond to help us escape mexico. We arrived Tuesday October 18, 2005 in the afternoon. On Wednesday October 19, 2005 at 12:33pm I went to speak to my concierge about making dinner plans and he informed me that the tropical storm Wilma had turned into a hurricane but not to worry it would just mean Thursday at 3pm we would go in to the theater for shelter over night. Being I had read that the Occidental Royal Hideaway had done this for the last hurricane and it had worked well they had my full trust. Then at 4:00pm when we returned from the beach we were told by our concierge that we had to move to a smaller room on the other side of our building for safety and to pack a small bag to bring to the theater/shelter. Once in our smaller room we noticed that the only reason we were moved from our villa was so that the hotel could use it as storage for the furniture of the rooms they thought would flood. Thursday October 20, 2005 at 9am we went to breakfast and spoke to the front desk. We were told everything was fine and that at 3pm we should be at the theater and it would just be an over night nuisance. We returned to our room to watch the news but all of the television in the entire hotel went out at the same time we believed this to be the storm at first but after talking with friends at the hotel it was believed that this was done on purpose. It turns out the hotel also wouldn\u2019t let anyone call us because both of our parents tried and were told that we weren\u2019t staying at the hotel. While looking out the window at approximately 11am I noticed couples heading toward the front desk with all of their bags. I found this strange and went out to speak to them. The hotel had told them that we were evacuating the hotel. I ran back and my wife and I went to the front desk with our bags. It seems that the hotel had only notified half of its guests of this. Upon arriving at the front desk at approximately 11:30am the hotel management could not or would not answer any of our questions on how we were leaving, where we were going, or where we would stay. The news was now saying that we were in the direct path of a category 5 hurricane. My wife who speaks Spanish over heard the front desk clerk say that they could not find hotels for us and were going to have to put us in shelters. At This point I had enough, so first I called Liberty Travel to ask them for advice I was told by Melissa their was nothing she could do for me to follow the hotels instructions, because Cancun\u2019s airport was closing. So at approximately 12:30pm I left the hotel, had Avis rental car pick me up, bringing me into Playa Del Carmen were I rented a minivan for $384.82 U.S. Dollars . When I returned back at 1:30pm with my rental car, buses had pulled up to evacuate the other guests. I spoke to hotel management who told me we were driving 4 hours to the City of Merida but still would not tell me what hotel we were in. They warned me and told me to follow the buses to Merida. I went to get back in my rental car and a bell boy stopped and told me I had to check out and pay my incidentals or I wasn\u2019t allowed to leave. All guests had to pay their incidentals before they got on the bus. Plus, they were charged $10 U.S. dollars to get on the bus. Some people like us paid almost $1000 a night to stay at the Occidental Royal Hideaway but were still required to pay to evacuate. After a 4hr. drive following the buses we arrived at Merida. We followed the buses into the seediest parts of town from one hotel to another dropping off 6-8 people at each one. Each hotel was worse then the next. First, you had to pay for your room $40 a night which you would be reimbursed by your travel agent at home. One of the hotels had a sign that read \u201cNo Hookers.\u201d Upon confronting one of the Occidental\u2019s staff she told me there was nicer hotels downtown that Occidental was going to pay for the stay either way. We drove to downtown, a much nicer and safer area, and got a room at the Fiesta Americana which cost us about $550.00 for a night. We checked in at approximately 8pm and went to dinner. A phone call was made to Liberty Travel explaining our situation but no one was there to answer the phones. So we decided to get an early start in the morning. At dinner we meet the other hotel guests from the Occidental who had begun to complain of the bug infested conditions there were staying at. We had obviously made the right choice. Friday October 21, 2005 7am a phone call was made to Liberty Travel but there was no answer even though it was 8am there time. So we went to breakfast and then returned to call Liberty Travel again with no answer. We decide to call the Occidental Main number were we talked to a nice man named Henry who tried to save our honeymoon by switching our stay over to Occidental Puerto Vallarta. Henry told us he will credit our room as long as Liberty Travel signs off on it and calls him. Upon hearing this we immediately called Liberty Travel and I talked to Melissa who says she will look into it and call me back. Two hours later, she finally calls back and leaves a message that she can\u2019t find any flights and can\u2019t help us to stay were we are for now. We called Liberty Travel back and a nasty phone receptionist name Carol put me on hold even though I\u2019ve talked to her several times and she knows my situation. So, here I am on hold for five minutes at five American dollars per minute. I finally was put through only to be disconnected. I call back and Carol pretends she can\u2019t hear me and hangs up on me. Losing my patience I handed the phone to my wife to handle. She talks to Carol for a minute and once Carol realizes that it\u2019s us again she pretends that she can no longer hear my wife. My wife screams in to the phone finally losing her temper saying she knows Carol can hear her. Carol finally puts my wife through to Sherry, my wife explains to her that we spoke with an Occidental representative who informed us of their ability to honor us at another hotel, my wife further told her that all they needed to do was get us a flight out of Merida to Mexico City, furthermore it was explained to Sherry that we had a car and were more than willing to drive to another airport, all we wanted was a flight into Mexico City. She then promises to help but says she\u2019ll needs to call us back. Sherry calls us back, she said that Cancun\u2019s airport is closed, my wife told her she is not in Cancun, she is in Merida, and she is well aware that Cancun is closed considering we just fled from that area. She proceeds to tell my wife that Merida\u2019s airport is now closing. We told her that the nearest airport is in Campeche which is only another two hours away. We then gave up on the hope of salvaging this honeymoon and told her that we just want a flight home then, but she tells us she can\u2019t help us to stay where we are. The hotel has now started to board up the windows. Apparently unbeknownst to us, Occidental had dropped all of us of in a Hurricane Warning Zone. This is now 12:30pm 5 \u00bd hours later. Frustrated and feeling we can only count on each other we decided to take matters into our own hands. After searching the INTERNET we find a flight from Campeche to Mexico City something we were told didn\u2019t exist by Liberty Travel. So, we book the flight on Aero Mexico for $490.18. We call American Airlines and get our Flight changed from Cancun to Mexico City, which were willing to accommodate. But, we ran into another problem, it seems Avis our rental car does not pick up cars from Campeche\u2019s airport. So we return Avis\u2019 rental car and rent another car from Alamo at $237.21. We then drive two hours south to the small town of Campeche. Our first stop is the airport and though it\u2019s raining and windy, Aero Mexico says that our flight will leave the next day at 9:15am. We then drive to the Ocean View Hotel and check in for the night at $83.13. The hotel room was clean but not very nice. Saturday October 22, 2005 we arrive at the airport at 6am to meet the Alamo people who pick up the car. Our flight actually takes off and on time. We arrive in Mexico City and wait 6 hours until our Dallas flight leaves and from Dallas we transfer to Newark and we finally at home at 1am.", "Date": "December 4, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cNot a Honeymoon Resort\u201d", "Author": "Mo2091", "ReviewID": "UR4121882", "Content": "If you are seeking a honeymoon resort with nice evening entertainment, look elsewhere.

We didn't do Spices for dinner or lunch. It is mostly mexican so we avoided it. Azia, The Grill were excellent. I can't say a bad thing about anything. They even made me two special meals to accomodate my needs with no problem. My husband fished right off the beach in front of the hotel in the early morning and late afternoon and caught a lot of fish. He also went on a fishing trip out to Ascension Bay. Awesome! The weather was wonderful. The beach and pool area was great. We didn't have anything to complain about. I was concerned about being a little bored at night but we went to the bar and everynight danced til closing. We had some very friendly and interesting people. Karaoke became a group event. We were able to eat at another restuarant and then go sit and see the show if you didn't want to eat at the show. We didn't have a care in the world. Every staff member was friendly and went out of their way to make sure you had everything. Luis and Eddie at the pool, Julio, Tono Alx and Alex at the Activity Center and Roger at the Allegria Bar.

We normally go to the Occidental Aruba, but since it's closed for renovations we decided to try Mexico for our first time. Am I glad we did!! We had an absolutely wonderful vacation. The resort was beautiful, ocean was breath taking, weather was terrific, service was exemplary, food was fantastic, service was exemplary \u2013 oh yea, I said that. The lobby and grounds are beautiful. We were in Villa 27, very close to the pool and beach. I would recommend the 2nd level to have the high ceilings. House keeping comes twice a day. Once for cleaning and once to turn down your bed \u2013 very nice. Big fluffy robes, big roomy bathroom with marble shower stalls and Jacuzzi tubs. Walk in closet with lots of space and shelves. I really can't say enough about the service, it made the whole stay. From check in to check out it was excellent. The pool servers are on the ball and aim to please. The several waiters assigned to your table are all over you to ensure a perfect dining experience. They all greet you by name, bring house appetizers to sample and suggest great after dinner cordials. The food is very very good. We ate dinner at all the restaurants except Spices and had not one complaint. They want you to make reservations to give the waiters enough time to pamper you and attend to your every need. It's not because they expect a big crowd. If you get hungry, just order room service \u2013 it\u2019s a phone call away. Breakfast buffet at Spices was very good but definitely do a la carte at Ventanas \u2013 very nice. Lunch was always quick, good, and easy at the pool caf\u00e9. Order lunch from your pool chair if you want! The beach is beautiful with no erosion problems and plenty of chairs. They don\u2019t allow you to bring the rafts into the water though. If that\u2019s what you like, bring them from home. There are two pools. We hung out at the smaller one most days. Both are crystal clear and like bath water. We stayed in all afternoon just floating around and talking and drinking with folks from all over. On your way to breakfast, throw a magazine or flip flops down to reserve the chairs you want. Everyone does it. In the afternoon, ladies come around with hot towels or misting spray and fresh fruit. There are two relaxation pools with hot tubs for extra privacy if you want. It is for the most part a quite hotel with not much to do at night but if you\u2019re looking for relaxation, this is the place. The Allegro next door was closed for hurricane repairs but if it was open, we could have gone there for a little action if we wanted. Guests at RH can go there but not the other way around. Cigars \u2013 don\u2019t buy from the store as they are way over priced. Each night a lady sits outside Ventanas selling them for much less. Of the seven days we were there, we did loose A/C for a couple hours, we lost cable for a couple hours, and the resort (town) lost power for five hours one afternoon. Had to get ready for dinner by candlelight (bring candles!!). Overall, this did not bother us much \u2013 I would rather have that than bad weather. No vacation is 100% perfect. Let it bother you or not \u2013 it\u2019s your choice. Definitely go into town a couple times, lots of unique shops. There\u2019s also a market place across the street for all your needs. Ten of us went to Xcaret - it was OK, I wouldn't go back. We\u2019ve been to many islands, and this was by far the prettiest Carribean water. We will definitely put Aruba on hold again and go back to the Royal Hideaway. Hey New Jersey!!

We are well traveled around the world and until we visited Royal Hideaway, we never went to the same place twice.

We are going back in Late Oct to mid Nov. 2005 for our \"12th visit\". That should say it all!!!! The staff and management is probably the biggest reason. Many resorts can provide a beach, sun, and the water. Management and staff create the experience.As odd as it may sound, each return visit was better than the previous visit. When we think that they have done all that is possible, they come up with a new experience. We have traveled there as a couple most times, but on a few special occaisons, we brought family and friends that are still talking about it. We will continue to return to RH as long as health and good fourtune prevail, as we have made many good friends there and feel very much at home at RH. Many times we have rented a jeep or boat to head out to explore the area and islands, and could not wait to get back to the RH to hit the Spa, enjoy a fine dinner and bottle{s} of wine, and end the day with a large brandy and cigar on the beach and the stars.

Just about everything at the resort was perfect \u2013 the room, the pools, the grounds, the restaurants and the beach. If we didn\u2019t know Hurricane Emily passed through in July, we would never have been able to tell because the resort was in pristine condition. Also, the beach was fantastic \u2013 no sandbags or drop-offs as previously reported and plenty of beach and chairs for everyone. We hung around the main pool most of the time and had no problem getting chairs near the pool. These were the most comfortable pool chairs we\u2019ve ever been in. The pool itself was crystal clear and fresh water was added every few days to keep the temperature down. In addition, the service at the pool was excellent. Eddie would bring us another drink even before we finished the previous drink to make sure that we always had a cold, fresh beverage. The service all over the resort was fantastic and everyone went out of the way making us feel like we were the only ones there. They always called us by our names, which was a nice touch. The only negative experience was the service at Azia. We ate there twice and both times the service was not up RH standards. The first time, the service was a bit slow and the waiter was not very attentive and the second time was a horrible experience. We first sat for 10 minutes waiting for drinks and a menu, which we only received 1 of since they were running short of menus. The waiter then insisted we ordered right away so they could make our hibachi order together with another order so they didn\u2019t have to do it twice. In addition, they never refilled our drinks and our appetizers came out about the same time the food on the hibachi grill was ready. Despite the unpleasant service at Azia, the food and sushi there was fantastic. The other restaurants had fantastic service and pretty good food. The Grill was by far our favorite \u2013 the ocean view was amazing, our server, Pedro, was the best waiter there and the food was terrific. In addition, we really enjoyed the breakfast buffet at Spices and the A La Carte menu at Ventanas \u2013 the Divorced Eggs were my favorite. Being able to order snacks, desserts and whole meals from the included 24-hour room service menu was also very nice. Palazzo, the Italian restaurant, was just okay, but we are from St. Louis, which has fantastic Italian food, so we are a bit biased. Ventanas and Spices were both delicious. Finally, we walked the beach to take a look at the other resorts and it made us so happy we were at the Royal Hideaway. Not having to wear wristbands and not having screaming kids all over the place (like some other resorts), made things that much more relaxing and romantic. Pro\u2019s \u00b7The Beach and Pool was well kept, spacious and very relaxing \u00b7Drinks and Liquor \u2013 They had everything, including top shelf liquor available at all the restaurants. Gold Margaritas were made with 1800 Repasado Tequila, Grand Marnier and Cointreau. The after dinner cordial selection rivaled any fine restaurant in the states. In addition, Champagne was available at every bar and restaurant and was included and was actually pretty good. They also had around 10 house wines, which were included and were pretty good for house wines. \u00b7Service \u2013 Eddie was fantastic at the pool and Pedro at the Grill and Spices was an excellent server. One couple we met down there asked for a can of Budweiser at the Allegra Bar \u2013 a drink not normally available at the bar. Instead of a sorry too bad response, the waiter went to another area of the resort and managed to come up with a Budweiser can \u2013 AMAZING SERVICE!!! \u00b7Other guests \u2013 Everyone was so nice and plesent to be around. Chip and Dale was entertaining (long story). We had a good time with people from Boston, Pennsylvania, Texas, New York and a number of other places. In case you see it, this is the St. Louis, Mo people writing this review. Cons \u00b7Azia \u2013 the food was fantastic, but the service was lacking both nights. Other guests also commented to us that it seemed the stuck all the newbie\u2019s at Azia. \u00b7We had to leave. The Royal Hideaway was amazing. \u00b7No casual Mexican food. \u00b7Evening Entertainment \u2013 They Allegra Bar got a little repetitive after a few nights.

Let me mention something about the servers at the pools...Terrific! Some were better than others (Eddie, Fernando and Tono) but all were very accomodating with or without tipping. Tipping is not required or needed but as hard as they work, I am sure it is appreciated and we wanted to give a tip to those that consistenly went out of their way to make our stay special. The restaurants were all different and wonderful to dine at. Palazzo and Ventanas were our favorites. Pedro was our waiter at Palazzo and was always there when you needed him to be. Each had live music of either a guitar player or a pianist. Both were gifted muscians that took requests and played them perfectly. Our consierge was Rosalia in Villa 23 who assisted us during our stay. She was very nice to work with in choosing and making dinner and spa appointments. We also had a maid named 'Gilberto' who always kept our room clean and left us with a different towel animal each evening (very nice touch) and soft music playing when we returned for the evening. We went on an excursion called 'The Tulum Xtreme Mayan Adventure'. It was a two part trip leaving the hotel at 8:00am. We first went to a cave about 45 minutes out side of Playacar where we rapelled down through a hole in the ground about 30 feet and then we took a zip line going pretty fast down into the refreshingly cool water where we snorkled through the rooms with our guide 'Dulce' and her counterpart 'David (Rambo). I would reccommend doing this. The second part of the tour took us to Tulum where we saw the remains of a Mayan culture going back 1000 years. We were back at the hotel by3:30pm in time to soak up a few rays at the pool and catch up with our friend 'Mojito'.

Well we need not have worried, the whole of the 2 week honeymoon was perfect and could not have been better! Firstly let me explain what we considered to be excellent: 1. The grounds-Beautiful! 2. The service-Every single member of staff was polite,cheerful and very professional. We could not have been treated with any more respect. By the end of our stay we were genuinely sorry to have to say goodbye to some of the staff who we had become quite attached to. 3. The food- wow! We ate like kings every day. Fillet steaks, fresh salmon, tepenyaki etc. The waiter in Asia insisted we tried everything, which we did! Asia was our favourite, then the grill down by the beach, closely followed by Palazzo and Ventanas. We have eaten all over the world and the food is very good, complemented by excellent service and friendly waiters. 4. Our consierge, Rosalia in Villa 23. Nothing was any trouble for her and she always had a smile! 5. Pool and beach waiter service. Our glasses were never empty. As soon as the drink was nearly finished a waiter would appear and ask what we wanted next. Manuel was a star! Dont believe what people say about tipping. We did not tip every day and the service was excellent at all times! 6. The beach was much better than we had been lead to believe. There were plenty of loungers even when we got there for 10.30am. What could maybe be better; 1.The entertainment was very low key but that suited us, we made our own by meeting and chatting with great people. 2.We didn`t particularly enjoy the buffet at the mexican evening but call us fussy! 3.There were some quite loud and rude American guests shouting across the pool to each other etc disturbing the otherwise peaceful atmosphere but this is not the fault of the hotel! 4. The rooms were good but some had rather poor views of the hotels next door which were not the best. Admittedly the hotel was not at full capacity,about 60% apparently but our 2 week stay was perfect. Make sure you sample the irish coffee at high tea that Haime makes-excellent!

Expect close spacing of beach chairs which can be a problem if smokers are nearby. But check out the beach beds for something different. The atmosphere at RH is laid back. Although they have entertainment at the Allegria club, don't expect a wild night life at RH. For those of us in our 30's and 40's the entertainment is fine, but you'll need to try in town (PDC) for bar hopping and clubbing. The RH does not allow kids, so it is a great place to kick back and relax while being pampered by their staff. Here's hoping their recovery from hurricane Emily is completed quickly.

I have also enjoyed many hotel and all inclusive vacations with my husband. This was our 10th time to visit the Yucatan. We have stayed in Akumal, Cancun and Cozumel. We just enjoyed a week of good food, diversionary beverages and sun at the Hideaway. It is a very - very good place by all inclusive standards. It is however priced nearly $1,000 per week higher than other all inclusive resorts. We did not get turn down service 2 of the 7 nights, no towel art, and very little help from the concierge. And - believe it or not - there were kids the last day of our stay!!! The staff was very friendly. The grounds beautiful. The food good. (Azia was outstanding) In general it was the same quality as a high level hotel like the Marriott or Hyatt. It can be \"buggy\" but it's the season! The bathroom floors are slippery - but an extra towel on the floor solves that problem. Tips are included........but you'd better be ready to tip for excellent service as us American's have created a monster! The best service goes to those who tip. The pool and beach chair problem has also escalated to riduclous proportions! People are now taking the pool floats to their rooms at night instead of first come first serve!!!

It was spotless and well groomed. Leaves were being picked up as they dropped! THE GOOD: 1) The rooms. The rooms were not very big, but well appointed. Unfortunately, ours faced the Allegro and a couple of electrical boxes. Third floor was tough to get to after a long day of relaxing! 2)The Health club. it had a great deal of equipment, but it was small and cramped when multiple pieces were being used at the same time. Water and towels abound 3) The food. I found the only thing that I found of average quality was the sushi. The tuna was thin and not of fine quality. the salmon was not orange, maybe because they sliced it too thin. the rolls were good. OUr best dinner was at the grill by the beach, followed by Palozzo. THE \"COULD BE BETTER\": 1) the pool. I was surprised that the main pool was not cleaner.

Our frame of comparison\u2014a week at the Adventura Spa Palace (a resort a little further south on the Mayan Rivera in Mexico) last November; in addition we have taken numerous cruises of the Caribbean and Mexican Riviera on Princess, Celebrity and Royal Caribbean. The price of the Royal Hideaway is about 40% greater than the Adventura Spa Palace\u2014this is true for when we went and it appears to hold for other times of year that we checked on the internet. At a premium of 40% more than a \u201ccomparable\u201d resort, we expected a good deal more in terms of amenities, service, etc. at the Royal Hideaway\u2014especially since it bills itself to be one of the \u201cleading hotels of the world.\u201d This was not the case\u2014we were disappointed in the rooms, the service, the food and the overall experience. Physically the Royal Hideaway is nice, and the ambiance in the restaurants was very nice, but the rooms were inferior to what we had at the Adventura Spa Palace. The rooms had far smaller Jacuzzis, very few of the rooms had an ocean view, the chairs were not comfortable, and there wasn\u2019t enough countertop space to put the many items that individuals on vacation have with them. The Adventura Spa Palace also provides a stocked liquor dispenser gratis in the rooms; the Royal Hideaway does not. There was a severe lack of sufficient air conditioning in two of the restaurants. We ate at Azia twice\u2014both times it was hot in the restaurant. We ate at Spices a number of times for breakfast and lunch and once for dinner. Invariably it was hot. In both these restaurants the temperature is totally unacceptable for a resort of this supposed quality. The service at the front desk was very uneven; a few times we were ignored in terms of getting help, while at other times the staff was helpful\u2014up to a point. But, in general, the staff did not want to extend themselves to provide consistently outstanding service. The cleaning service in the rooms was, at best, poor. A number of times we had to request that fresh towels or fresh glasses be placed in the room at night, and at one time the porch went three days without being cleaned. This also occurred with some dirt on the floor of the room. The dinning room service was uneven. We found some of the waiters and waitresses were very good, but others were not. While, in general, there appeared to be sufficient help, sometimes things just did not get done properly. Often the waiters and waitresses seemed more concerned about getting the right plates, silverware, etc. on or off the table, or setting up a fresh table after it was vacated, that they forgot to provide service to the guests who were already having a meal. A number of times we had to ask for more water, wine, coffee, etc. The presentation of food in the restaurants was always good, but the quality was uneven. We had a number of meals that were ordinary in terms of taste; a few that were bad; and some that were good. Some examples of poor meals are the following: (1) one night two members of our party had steak or beef at Vantanas\u2014while the taste was fine, the beef was tough; (2) one night one of our party had the veal chops at Palazzos\u2014the meat was tough, there was very little of it, and it had a lot of fat on it. and (3) one of our party had the vegetable quesadillas at Spices three times\u2014the first two times they were fine, but the last time they were uneatable. They tasted like something was wrong with the ingredients and they had spoiled. Finally, they served instant coffee in Spices restaurant at noon! Given the small number of meals being served (relative to the Adventura Spa Palace or a cruise ship) the food was, on average, no better and maybe slightly lower in quality than we have experienced elsewhere. Another issue we had was in terms of understanding many of the staff working at the Royal Hideaway. Our experience has been much better at the Adventura Spa Palace or on cruises\u2014their staffs had, in general, much better command of English than we experienced at the Royal Hideaway. In addition, the quality of the staff training was poor at Royal Hideaway. While some of the staff were well trained and wanted to meet the guests needs, overall we experienced a lower level of service at the Royal Hideaway. We also had difficult experiences with a car rental at the Royal Hideaway and with contacting the tour company to determine when our transportation would be to take us back to the airport. Given the relatively small size of the Royal Hideaway, these experiences should have been better. Overall, when you pay a significant premium, you expect a commensurate higher level of ambiance and service. That was not the case at the Royal Hideaway; hence, our conclusion is the Royal Hideaway is substantially overrated and overpriced. There are far better, and less expensive, alternatives for a quality vacation on the Mayan Riviera than the Royal Hideaway! A final footnote: After returning from the Royal Hideaway we were talking with a travel agent who had recently been to the Royal Hideaway. Her experience mirrored ours in that she was very disappointed with the room, the service and the meals.", "Date": "June 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Augusta, GA", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely Incredible...\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3614409", "Content": "Warning: This review is long, but very informative!!! I searched and searched and searched the web for the best spot to go on my honeymoon. I wanted everything to be perfect. After reviewing several hotels on tripadvisor, the reviews for Royal Hideaway continued to be positive. I spoke with my travel agent, who is a Virtuoso agent, and she immediately said that we would without a doubt enjoy the RH. After our flight had been delayed for ten hours we reached the RH at 2AM. Worn out, tired, and mad at the airline, the bell man immediately took our luggage and we were checked in in less that three min. We found the room to be extremely clean and had a bottle of champagne and fruit waiting on us. What a joy after such a long day of travel! The next day it rained continuosly, so we enjoyed a nice lunch at Spices. The staff was quick to entertain us since the weather was so poor. We had a fabulous time brushing up on our Spanish and enjoying authenic Mexican cuisine! We even sat by the pool in the rain, and the staff quickly set up umbrellas around us so that we would not get soaked. Our private concierges booked all of our dinner reservations and Mayan ruin tour. She was helpful in telling us what we would have time for, the best things at the resort, and she constantly had a smile on her face. Dinners were fabulous! Not at all what you assume since it is an all inclusive. Very elegant dining, excellent wines from the Baja Pennisula, and fabulous desserts. All dinners are al la carte rather than buffet style. Our favorite place was Azia, the Japanese steak house. They offer excellent sushi as well. The best atmosphere was at Palazzo. We also enjoyed the late night activities at the Allegria bar so check out the entertainment each night there. The buffet breakfast at Spices was incredible!!! You eat overlooking the gorgeous blue water and sip on freshly squeezed OJ. While sitting around the pool, free five minute massages were offered from the spa staff. One day, the staff pushed a cart around of fresh fruit for a mid afternoon snack. The staff by the pool was great. We always had a drink or food...whatever we desired. We felt that Royal Hideaway was an excellent choice. If you read reviews that complain about price, they should know better seeing as how you are paying for a resort that has a five star ranking. Obviously you are attending a fine resort so it is more expensive! If there are food complaints, first, it is Mexico, not the USA. There food standards are slightly different. Secondly, order off the al la carte menu responsibly. If they complain about service, they are too picky bc every single need is met that the RH. These complaints about things being stolen...for the record, we never had anything stolen. At the same time, we were careful with our things. We utilized our in-room safe and watched what we left lying around. Be smart people...A) Things are stolen in the USA so they will get stolen in Mexico too B) Dont take three hundred dollars and leave it in a bag by the pool while you swim in the ocean for an hour. If you are interested in night life, there is night life. The Allegria bar has a mini dance club inside and after dinner we would sit, drink, and mingle with others. One night we played trivia on by the entertainment staff! If you got the answers wrong you had to take a tequilla shot. There was plenty of night life for those that chose to participate. Also Playa del Carmen is minutes away and there are countless bars. A cab ride into to town is only five dollars so its def. worth checking out. Please feel free to email me if you need any info or want to see photos of the resort. LizEngler@aol.comI will be happy to assist in any way I can.

For background purposes, we are a married couple, 39 & 40, and travel to Mexico approximately 6 times per year (Cabo and Cancun, mostly). We are no strangers to all-inclusive resorts and prefer high-end properties that do not necessarily accomodate children (although we have one of our own). I was skeptical about the employees remembering us from our first trip, but in fact, we were very much recognized by many staff members (although I'm not sure if that's good or bad). The resort was in great condition - the groundskeepers really work hard to maintain the beautiful gardens and foliage. And yes, the beach had somewhat receded, but there was plenty of sand between the pool & the beach. Interestingly, during our visit last year before Hurrican Ivan, very few people spent time at the beach and most everyone hung out at the pool. This year, however, it seemed as though everyone was at the beach instead of the pool. Sadly, however, we tried, but could no longer walk the entire beach to the town of Playa. We got as far as the Reef Club and had to take a cab ($4). Our Concierge, Gisel, was fabulous and we used her services constantly. I definitely recommend taking the time to get to know your concierge - Gisel had a wealth of information at her disposal and made things happen for us without question. This year I learned that on a rotating basis, one concierge stays until 7:00 p.m. to cover for all 11 buildings, after the other 10 concierges go home at 5:00. The night that Gisel was covering, her phone literally rang every 3 seconds - I saw her hustle and bust gut for every guest, not just the guests in her villa. Most people were calling to change their dinner reservation time or venue. The woman was clearly a professional and after witnessing her incredible multi-tasking capabilities, she earned my unequivocal respect. The Grill was our favorite restaurant, followed by Palazzo. Try the ravioli appetizer at the Grill - I think I ordered it one night as an appetizer and dessert - it was that good. Although the choices at the buffet breakfast are plentiful, I preferred breakfast at Ventanas, complete with mimosas, of course. Lunch at the poolside grill or in our pool/beach loungechairs was a daily event for us - the Mahi plate, Mahi sandwich and Philadelphia cheesesteak are highly recommended (they were served on the best baguette bread, something I've never experienced in Mexico before). The food choices, presentation and ultimately, the quality and taste are superb in all the venues. My husband made his usual spa appointment for a massage and this year, I actually booked a facial w/an extra mini leg treatment, which my aching running legs & feet needed. It was pricey, but well worth it and I highly recommend requesting Herman, who has been at the resort since it originally opened. My husband ended up getting a haircut & beard trim and his stylist did a great job. I recommend going to afternoon tea at least once during your trip. We didn't go once last year, but after meandering up to the lobby area one afternoon headed for the giftshop, we found ourselves at a table for two and quickly learned to enjoy the champagne, finger sandwiches, and strolling sax player. This was a great place to hang out and watch all the new guests arriving (I'm a people watcher). I think we ended up going 3 different days during the week. We hired a private driver for the day ($100), who took us to Tulum and Akamal. We arrived at Tulum just as they opened (3rd in line), which was a good thing because the place filled up with people getting off the tour buses. If you're planning to go, and I recommend you do once, you must pay the entrance fee with pesos (38 pesos each, I think). The beach at Tulum is absolutely stunning and one of the pictures we took now serves as my screensaver - I've honestly never seen a prettier beach in my life. The resort definitely caters to couples - mostly honeymooners and people celebrating anniversaries. I highly recommend this resort over most of the others in the Playa area, but it's not for everyone. If you're looking for a great nightlife, this is definitely not your place. I must say that we've been fortunate to meet some really great people on both our trips to the R/H. Last year, we met Kent & Contessa who were on their honeymoon and we've become great friends. This year, John & Kelly were on their honeymoon and we've recently been in touch with them since our return. Nice place, nice people. Last, but not least, I recommend tipping these hard working individuals. Yes, I know, the price you pay for this resort is more than most and tipping is supposedly included. But there are definitely exceptional people working here and what you and I consider to be pocket change can possibly change the quality of life for someone working here. We tipped consistently, completed simple comment cards at each meal (I think the staff gets kudos if their name is listed on a comment card), and we constantly received excellent service.

We had our honeymoon here from May 30-June 6. After a long 13.5 hour flight delay, we did not actually arrive at the RH until 2:30am, but were still greeted as we stepped off our shuttle and were told they had been waiting for us. Check-in was smooth and we immediately ordered room service, which we felt had a very extensive menu and took no longer than 15 mintues to be delivered every time. The grounds: Impecable! There was one day it was raining and the men were out there raking leaves from the walkways literally as they were falling from the trees and using squeegies to keep the grounds dry. I have never seen such hard workers in my life. Never a piece of trash or out of place leaf in the whole resort. The food: Where to even begin. We eat fairly frequently at a 5-star restaurant in town here and we felt that the presentation and quality of food at the resort matched this. The desserts at all of the restaurants are incredible and beautiful, we ordered 3 sometimes and split all of them. We liked that the restaurants are never crowded so you get wonderful service. It is very difficult to ever find anyone without a smile on their face, and they are so eager to please. Azia was a favorite-we sat at the table where they cook your food in front of you. Palazzo was awesome-we sat outside so we could enjoy the view of the resort and ocean. The Sunday night theater was awesome. We heard the other show during the week was a buffet, but Sunday was a 4-course meal and a good 2.5 hour show. We were impressed. At every restaurant, they give you a house appetizer, so that was always fun to be surprised with some sort of interesting food. We generaly tipped 2-3 dollars at dinner each night-they deserve every bit of that if not more!! Definitely take advantage of tea time that they have every day from 4-6 in the lobby area. And make sure you try the mayan coffee, but be sure to watch them make it-it's quite incredible. The room: We had a 3rd floor room with a vault, so it felt very spacious in there. It seemed like every time we stepped out, it was clean and new towels were given when we came back. The towel creatures were a cute touch every day. The bathroom with dual bowl vanity is a good size with a separate shower and bathtub. They always replenish shampoo, conditioner, and lotion. They also have q-tips and cotton balls for you as well. Fridge was always stocked with plenty of bottled water and a variety of sodas and beer. The beach: I was most scared about this, but I barely even noticed anything was wrong. I would say the chairs are a bit scrunched together, but I don't think there was ever anyone on either side of us though. There was always someone coming around getting our drink order, we didn't even need the flags they give you. We did tip the drink man a dollar or two and never had an empty glass, but honestly, even when we didn't give him anything, the same was true. When you see how hard they work, you will want to give them something too, even though it's not necessary. We were always discreet about giving them tips because we didn't know what their bosses do when they see that. If you want to take a walk the beach, definitely go to the right as you're looking out into the ocean-the left has some serious beach issues and it's hard to maneuver around things. There's so many more great things I could tell you. I found it useful to e-mail my direct questions to people, so please feel free to ask me anything. drakesarah@rockwood.k12.mo.us", "Date": "June 15, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cYou get about what you pay for\u201d", "Author": "jenniferindublin", "ReviewID": "UR3551927", "Content": "We found this hotel to be about average considering what you pay per night. I'll do my best not to repeat the others below. Postives: 1. Food itself is great at restaurants. 2. daytime scene: It can be competitive to find your ideal place by the pool/beach, but there are lots of options. The water is beautiful and warm. The beach is soft and white - even though there is less than there used to be. Lots of beach/pool waiters to bring you delicious margaritas. The activities guys were great, usually something going on if you are up for it. 3. Housekeeping was excellent - didnt disturb us once and did a great job 4. Grounds are well kept. Negative: 1. Like another reviewer, we left a few things by the pool (our fault!) and they never turned up in lost and found. Seems like a pattern here... 2. We are pretty laid back people, and we both found the service average. Lots of empty water glasses and undelivered drinks during our stay. Limited availabilty of beers other than Corona from the tap (which was often warm by the time it got to us) . 3. Room service. The food quality and service seemed much worse than any of the restaurants. Everytime we phoned them, the person that answered spoke very little English, whcih often restulted in mistakes in our order. Although this is Mexico, we expected that room service would be proficient in English as most of the guests speak English. For example, we ordered a salad and were told to wait 25 min. It arrived 45 min later. As soon as the guy left, we realized he didnt leave us utensils. We phoned immediately and tried our best to explain that we needed a fork and he either didnt understand or pretended not to. After believing that he finally understood our request, we waited another 25 min and the fork never arrived. So we called them and told them to cancel the fork and they can come pick up the tray. Still not sure if he understood (no apology), but the tray was gone when we arrived home. Last item on room service, they will stock your fridge with \"anything you'd like\" EXCEPT BEER. We found that strange. They will only bring you glasses of Corona from a tap. Side note: we got a little antsy and did a day trip to Cozumel. You just walk or take a $5 cab ride to the port and its a 30 min ferry ride ($18 each, round trip). I would highly recommend getting off the ferry and renting a car (shop around, lots of scammers!) and exploring the beaches on the opposite side of the island. I HIGHLY recommend an air conditioned car, its $5 more and well worth it. In closing - we really enjoyed ourselves and think it is worth a visit.

I would like to begin by saying that we used TripAdvisor to help select this hotel, and I have had to accept the fact that not everyone shares the same taste. I think there are some for whom this hotel is ideal. For me, it was refreshing and nice, but not the experience of a lifetime. I would recommend ignoring any reviews that give all positive or all negative points about any hotel. It is also my opinion that many of the negative postings result from lack of flexibility that is mandatory when traveling to foreign locations. One should not expect customs or food to be identical to what one would expect in one's home country. Indeed, I have found these small differences to be one of the great aspects of travel. The most outstanding aspect of the stay here is the service. The staff are very friendly, and always make every effort to please the guests. The grounds are well done, and we generally were amazed at how tranquil the grounds were. This was not true of the beach. The beach is somewhat sparse, as noted in other postings, but this is not the main problem in my opinion. The beach is rather crowded for my taste. Some may like it this way. If you are looking for a magical, secluded beach, then I would recommend looking elsewhere. The water, however, is pretty. We were generally pleased with the restaurants. I particularly recommend the Grill for dinner, as it has a beautiful location. I had a mixed grill (Argentinian-style beef and lamb, quite good), while my wife had an excellent grouper. Palazzo was also quite nice. Spices has very tasty fare throughout the day. We only ate at Ventanas for breakfast, which was good. I cannot recommend Azia, even though I am an enormous fan of Eastern food. They served Japanese and Thai style dishes. We opted for the Japanese. Perhaps the Thai may be better, or perhaps we went on an off-evening. The rooms are very comfortable, and the maid service was excellent.

It was hot upon our arrival at the Royal Hideaway 45 minutes later but we were welcomed with moist, pleasant scented towels and a glass of champagne. After check-in we had to wait about 1/2 hour before our room was ready. Although it was hot, we enjoyed a drink at the poolside bar. The grounds are magnificently manacured -the landscapers are always working...trimming the trees, mowing the lawn, painting... We had a villa near the pool and Spices restaurant (#31) which was always clean and our concierge was very helpful. We always had a towel sculpture on our bed after the room was cleaned. They even cleaned my soap dish...how's that for service? Although we only dined at Spices and Azia (our reservations were planned for us by the company we were with), it was said Palazzo and Ventanas was just as good by the people we were vacationing with. Azia was our favorite. Request to have dinner at the habachi grill. The spring rolls, chicken, shrimp, fried rice, banana dessert and chocolate truffles are out of this world. Spices, the restaurant above the poolside grill offers a delicious hot & cold breakfast buffet where Ventanas near the lobby offers an elegant sit down breakfast. Both are very good. You can work off those calories at the workout facilities. There are a few relaxation pools and a hot tub on the grounds. The spa also offers massages for more relaxation, as well as facials, manicures and pedicures. During our last visit there was alot more space on the beach but this beach is fine. In fact, it is situated above the shore where many people walk so we have a little bit more privacy than the other beaches down the way have. There are alot of sandbags but they are hidden. Several topless women walked the shore and sunbathed. There was one lady sunbathing at our pool but it didn't bother anyone. There are several activities by the pool such as BINGO, water volleyball, & volleyball in the sand. At the beach you can snorkle, take scuba lessons & scuba dive, rent a jet ski, go parasailing, etc. Cozumel is just a 45 minute ferry ride away. You can see it from the beach. A few of the people we were with had a 'swim with the dolphins' experience. From the look of their pictures, it looked like a great time. There are also tours to the pyramids, the jungle and you can shop on the popular 5th Avenue where you can find authentic Mexicana. Evenings you can opt to go into town (Senor Frogs is pretty popular-the airport has a Senor Frogs store) or you can enjoy activities at the Allegria Bar like taking Salsa lessons, dancing to the band or playing casino games. \"Love is in the Air\" by John Paul Young is their theme song which some of the staff perform a dance to. Many of the staff we noticed were on staff last time we came. Which brings me to say that they were all very nice and many of them had a good sense of humor.

We chose the RH for our honeymoon and it exceeded our expectations. We were both very excited about the resort based on many positive reviews posted on the web site and were happy we chose this resort instead of another. Starting off; walking into the resort and being handed a glass of champagne and a cool towel (scented with 'Aqua de Naranja' - had to buy some) was enough to relax any seasoned travel. Check-in was a breeze and we were escorted to Spices for lunch since our room would not be ready for another 1.5 hours. Spices ended up being our breakfast spot of coice; not only for the view but for the variety. Incredible weather the entire time we were there. Our villa - #30 was beautiful and Rosalia was of incredible assistance. Make sure to make all of your dinner reservations when you arrive, you can always change then as necessary if plans change. We had dinner at all of the resturants- Palazzo ended up being out favorite. Request a terrace seat at sunset as you can see the entire grounds and ocean; the pasta tasted great too. Champagne in the room upon arrival for the honeymooners was a plus, as was the daily newsletter of the happenings of the resort. The twice daily room cleans/turn down service was a refreshing touch as well. I was a bit nervous of the status of the beach from reading the reviews, but if I had not read them before I arrived, I probably would not have known any different. I have never seen a staff of employees keep such an imaculate beach and grounds all throughout the day and night. As for the service, I could not have asked for more. Everyone knew us by name and exchanged a \"Hola, como esta\" each time passing on the grounds. We were never at a want for anything the entire time there. For the beach activities, Uriel and Gus provided much entertainment for the folks every afternoon and joined in on the fun. Overall, what a great trip. We even biked into town on 2 occassions and can't wait to head back soon!", "Date": "June 1, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nashville", "Title": "\u201cPlaya Del Car: Royal Hideaway, \"Great Experience\"\u201d", "Author": "rocker68", "ReviewID": "UR3516417", "Content": "Okay, let's get this out of the way. The following prevented us from giving the Royal Hideaway 5 stars: 1. Arrival- Upon arrival the bellboy didn't grab all our bags. I had to carry my laptop and my wife carried her shoulder bag. This after lugging all our stuff through customs and Cancun airport. The bellboy put our luggage on his cart and rushed off as we were left to register with laptop and overnight bag still in hand. 2. Check-in- The host at check-in was unpleasant. It was our anniversary. We didn't get a \"Happy Annivesary\" or a friendly welcome. Instead we got a hurried presentation of the services and anmenities. He spoke so fast we hardly understood half of it. He seemed irritated. My wife asked a simple question that was actually referred to me, wondering about what time the spa closes. He snapped \"Please, please, you need to ask the concierge\", instead of providing us a simple answer. His tone just didn't seem friendly. 3. Dress code at spices- Wife and I went to spices for breakfast one morning. Was told there was no dresscode. She was wearing a bikini top and a pair of shorts. When we walked in the host said \"No, no you can't come in here, you have to get a shirt. You can't come in here dressed like that\". His tone was very unfriendly and loud enough to draw attention from other guests. Something that could have easily been handled by simply saying \"I'm sorry we do not allow bikini tops\" or something similar in a more quiet and personable tone instead of creating a mini drama and embarassing my wife. 4. Food to room- One morning my wife had an extreme migrane headache. Since the room service menu just has a continental breakfast option and she wanted pancakes, I had to go to Spices with the intent to fill up a plate of pancakes to bring back to the room for her. I was told by the hostess that the policy is not to allow guests to do this because they didn't want the plates leaving the restaurant. Fair enough. So I went to the concierge and told her about this situation. She apologized and said there was nothing she could do. There was no attempt to assist in the matter. Well I ended up taking the initiative by calling room service and talking to Chris. I told him what my wife wanted from the buffet. He was very friendly and said it would be no problem at all to get this done. They filled up a plate at Spices and the plate was delivered within 15 minutes. 5. Runaway Mouse- We're late nighters and one night went to the business office at 2:00 in the morning. My wife was using their computer and I had our laptop. The resort was like a ghost town with guests sleeping the night away. But we did see a few employees wandering around during the 1.5 hours we were in the biz office. We left at about 3:30am to return to the room. As soon as we got back to the room I realized we left our mouse pad there. My wife immediately left to retrieve it, but it was no longer there. She went upstairs and asked if anyone had seen it. Nope. Gone. So in just approximately 5 minutes after leaving the business office, someone snatched the cheap mousepad up like a vulture. Incredible. This situation is serious and concerns me more than anything else above. Also, previously to this incident I accidentally left my sunglasses in the spa shower room and by the time the massage was over, they were gone. However, there were other guests around at the time who possibly could have snatched them up. I'm responsible for leaving my items around and don't expect any sympathy. The question is, where did they go? 6. Spa Services- The spa setting itself is gorgeous. We ordered the \"Day Of Beauty\" package which consisted of four hours of massages, facials, manicures, and pedicures for both of us. The massages were okay, but way overpriced considering the quality in our opinion. When the massage was over they put us both flat on our back on the massage table so we could receive the facials. With our eyes covered, we never received any warning when something hot or cold was going to be applied to our faces. A little communication would be nice here to help prevent facial shock. Seemed like we laid flat on our back for about 30 minutes. The tables weren't that comfortable to be laying on our backs for such an extended period of time. In fact, our backs got sore from this and we ended up scheduling massages for the next day off the property to fix our backs. No complaints about the manicure or pedicures. 7. Room Service Menu- Okay, I may be nickpicking here but after midnight there are two main courses available on the room service menu which are: Breaded Chicken Scalops with vegetables and french fries, or Grilled Mahi Mahi fillet, with sauted vegetables in olive oil These are probably delicious meals, but who would want to order this for a midnight snack? How about giving us a choice of some chips, dips, pretzels, popcorn, light sandwiches, hamburgers, soups, ice cream, or cakes? However, I do know they provide more than what is listed on the room service menu as one night my wife requested ice cream and got it. By the way, it was delicious. So the negative basically deals with a few customer service issues (which is suppose to be one of Royal Hideaways greatest strengths), possible employee theft of a cheap mousepad, and spa services. As you will see from here on out is that it gets better. Service wasn't bad across the board, it was just inconsistent. That's out of the way. Now the good. A. Food- Yes it's true. As mentioned so many times before, the food for the most part was exceptional. We had no problem with portion sizes as some have mentioned. We thought the portions were perfect. In fact, we often felt overstuffed after dinner. If the portion sizes were too small, simply order more. Nobody should ever leave hungry from their fine restaurants. Just a few of the dinners were \"good\" in our opinion, but I won't hold this against Royal Hideaway. Some meals we were unfamiliar with and ordered anyways to experiment with new dishes. It's not their fault if my taste buds don't particulary care for a certain combo of spices. The meal presentations and service at all restaurants were top notch. A true \"5\" star in this category. Room service was also exceptional. Orders promised to be delivered in 25 minutes, but the norm was more like 10-15 minutes. Drinks throughout were excellent. B. Concierge- Rosalia did a complete 180 degree turn from the situation in #4 above. She went above and beyond what we expected. She helped make our anniversary one we will never forget. I just cannot say enough good things about the job Rosalia did for us during our stay at the Royal Hideaway. C. Grounds- Very well kept. The Royal Hideaway is a very beautiful property. They do a great job of keeping the grounds and property in such immaculate shape. D. Room- Very nice. Glad we opted for the standard suite instead of the \"ocean view\" suite. Not worth the extra cost in our opinion. I could see how come guests could have complaints about the room. Depends on what building you are in. Some buildings patios face the resort properties located next door. We heard some noise a few times coming from these properties while we were walking on the sidewalk in the middle of the Royal Hideaway property. I could just imagine what it would be like for those folks who have rooms so close to those other resorts. E. Housekeeping- Excellent. Always kept the room nice and clean. F. Beach, pool chairs, pools- Previous review comments are accurate from our experience. That about covers it. Don't think we will be returning, not because we didn't have a great time because we did. Had a blast. However, with so many other resorts to visit that we've never been to, Royal Hideway would have to blow us away for us to return, and they just didn't do that. If you've never been to the Royal Hideway we suggest you give it a shot. It really was a great experience and one that we will never forget. There is a lot of good on this beautiful property, and your experience can vary greatly depending on the turn of events that lead you to encounter certain individuals throughout your stay.", "Date": "June 1, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Windsor, New York", "Title": "\u201cWow!\u201d", "Author": "CDubaldi", "ReviewID": "UR3514346", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at the Royal Hideaway for a week, using the Allegro Vacation Club timeshare.

This is our third time to this area- once for our honeymoon, once for our 5th anniversary and we decided to go back for our 10th anniversary. By far this is the best resort in Playa Del Carmen. My husband and I researched for months before choosing this hotel. The reviews on this website were so helpful. This was our first time to this resort and we can't wait to return! Everything was absolutely PERFECT!! We could not figure out how people could have problems at this resort. The only conclusion we could come up with is they are extremely difficult to please! This resort is 5 star without a doubt! It is at the level of any Ritz Carlton or Westin we have stayed at in the United States. We were looking for a relaxing, romantic vacation away from our one and 3 year old. We are sooooooo glad we chose an \"adults only\" resort. It totally changed the atmosphere of the resort. It was very quiet, peaceful, and romantic. Everyone is walking around holding hands and all the tables at dinner are set for two. If you don't have kids or you have kids and you aren't traveling with them this is the resort to stay at! The serice at this hotel is AMAZING!! All of the waiters and staff were so attentive, so friendly and go above and beyond what is expected. We were so glad we brought cash to tip. Even though they say tips are included we wanted to reward people for working so hard to please. These people do not make very much money so please tip them!! Just one or two bucks even. If you tip the guys who find you chairs by the pool or beach they we will be so helpful. Same with the guys who bring you food and drinks by the pool and beach. This grounds and location of the Royal Hideaway are magnificent. We felt like we were in heaven. The pools are so beautiful facing the carribean. We had no problem getting chairs by the beach or pool late in the morning. We never had to go out early and save chairs. Now if you want the padded ones by the pool those seemed difficult to come by but we preferred being on the beach so we didn't care. Speaking of the beach. It was not nearly as bad as we expected. All of the hotels down there have had the same erosion problems, it just is a thing of nature. You can still lay on the beach and the swimming in front of the hotel was awesome. We didn't mind the erosion at all. It just made for a shorter beach. But the sand and water were still just as beautiful. We loved our room. It was very nice and VERY clean. We couldn't believe that housekeeping cleaned it twice a day and we NEVER saw them, not once! Room service was great to have a drink or appetizer on our patio. We were in a very nice location in villa #26. It was very quiet and located in the middle of the resort. Luz was our concierge and she was wonderful! Now for the food! Just so you know, my husband and I are not overweight and we are in good shape. We are not very focused on food in our lives except for nourishment. Let me tell you neither one of us have enjoyed food so much in our lives then when we were at the Royal Hideaway!! Every meal and every restaurant was amazing in the quality and presentation of food. Some people had said on trip advisor that the portions were small. Well, the food is gourmet, this isn't a cruise and this isn't Outback or Claim Jumper!! We were so stuffed after every meal!! Our favorite restaurant was Palazzo's (the italian restaurant). We ate at all the restaurants except the asian one. Yes, you need to make reservations for dinner but we loved that! That way you didn't need to wait. The restaurants are small and intimate adding to the atmosphere of the resort. Also it allows the restaurants to give you better service so they don't have to rush you out. Just a tip - make your first night's dinner reservation by the Royal Hiedaway's website before you go. Make it at Palazzo's, I think they make a very good first impression. Once you get to the hotel schedule the rest of your dinner reservations for the rest of the week. We got all the times we wanted and had no problems. We ate at 7:00 or 7:30 every night for dinner and that was perfect for us. Don't forget about the dress code because they really enforce it. We would watch guys walk into restaurants and they would ask them to go back to their room and change. For guys you need to wear closed toed shoes, slacks (no jeans or shorts), and a collared shirt. Women can wear sandles, nice pants, skirts or dresses. The dress code seemed to be more difficult for the men and not a big deal for the women. This resort far exceeded our expecations and I highly recommend going there!! You will not regret it.

We booked months in advance and put a deposit down and our card was billed for the entire stay 30 days prior to our arrival. You would think that would definitely guarantee it, but we were told just 2 days prior to our reservation that we would have to move to a family resort for the first 2 nights because they had overbooked the Royal Hideaway. Being in the travel industry, I knew they had to accommodate us and it was a first come first serve basis so we showed up at the Royal Hideaway anyway and got a room without any problems. I talked to another guest who also got bumped and showed up at the back up family resort and said the food and service was awful there. The only thing they offered as compensation was 2 nights free on a new reservation that had to be used in a year! Not everyone can plan to come back to vacation that soon and I thought that was a total joke! So you can see my disappointment with the Occidental Hotel Reservations and enough about that. On a positive note, the resort was absolutely beautiful! We have stayed at Sandels resorts, Atlantis and all over the Caribbean and this one definitely ranked at the top. We just got back and stayed from May 20-25 2005. Even though the resort was full, they way it was laid out made it feel like it wasn\u2019t. The pools were always nice and clean. Our favorite was the relaxing pool next to our villa #29. It was either empty or just a few people there. The main pools were more crowded. We never had any trouble getting towels, chairs, or a cabana but did have problems getting rafts. People would get them in the morning and hold onto them all day regardless if they were using them or not. The only complaint I had about the room was the beds were very hard. The balcony was extremely large for all room types. The maid service was excellent. As far as getting out and about, the shopping Playcar was a fun experience. There are areas where they pressure to come into their shop, but it is nothing like Jamaica. We love to snorkel and found the excursion company located at the hotel takes you to a very nice reef. There are several other excursion companies tied up at the same place, but it was still very clear. We had heard Xel Ha was also excellent for snorkeling and I bet it was 5-10 years ago before it turned into an amusement like park! The water was beautiful when you first get there, but when you get into snorkel it is so murky from the amount people in the water with you. It was $35 pp to get in and I definitely didn\u2019t think it was worth it. It is just way too overcrowded. It appeared to us that Xcaret was the same way although we did not go there. It is $65/pp. I had heard such marvelous things about the Play del Carmen area and how it was not commercialized like Cancun, but even our concierge said that in the last 5 years it has completely changed. If you are the type that likes to hang out at the resort and maybe slide in a little shopping then this place is for you, but if you like to venture out and do excursions then this place is really lacking! The restaurants were all amazing. We did not go to the Oriental one, but went to all of the others. Our favorite was the Italian restaurant. You have to order their clam chowder, it is out of this world! Also, try and get a table outside. The patio is amazing and overlooks the entire resort.

Due to the thousands of choices for a honeymoon, I turned to a travel agent for expert advice. Her first recommendation was the Royal Hideaway.

From the start of our stay - with the champagne greeting, aromatherapy towles, the friendly staff, the detailed explaination of the grounds and the rooms - to the end of our stay - courteous bell hops and shuttle back to the air port. There is no one thing that stood out - everything did and everything was perfect. I remember looking at the reviews from others on Trip Advisor and seeing the negative points - I never saw any of that while we were there. The beach was beautiful - we always got a chair and we didn't get out to the beach until 10-11am. The food was the best. The reservations we had made at the get go with our conceriege - be sure to ask about the dinner on the beach (we didn't know about this till the end of our trip). The rooms were great - it was 90 degrees the whole time we were there and our room was always the perfect temp - if not a little colder than we expected. The hotel was booked - but it ALWAYS seemed as if it was empty. Nothing was ever packed and it was always beautifully quiet. With that said - there is no night life - it is only what you make.

When we first arrived like at 11:00am we had to wait for a room, but they storaged our luggage & an employee walked us around the resort, pointing out restaurants, gym, internet room (free) & etc. He took us to the snack bar area found us a table so we could have lunch and a drink............trip starting off well. The whole area is divided into villa's where I would guess you have about 12 rooms (4 on all three floors) all with patio/balancies. The rooms were spacious, very large bathrooms, jet tubs, separate shower, with walk in closet with a safe. Fresh towel & robes await you each day, always a little animal decoration made by housekeeping waiting on our bed.

They have entainment at one of the bars each night, they have a casino night, just a very relaxing & pleasant trip. Each afternoon they have high tea it is neat little time for appetizers/desserts/champagne (like you need to eat more), just a great time!

We had done extensive research and read all the reviews here and were pleased to have found our experience to be so enjoyable and even better than expected in regards to the quality of the beach. Rooms: Initially we had considered upgrading to an oceanview or suite room, but after talking to quite a few people who had gone there they suggested the basic luxury room. I would suggest a top floor room, as those rooms have vaulted ceilings which gives the appearance that the room is larger. We stayed in 2 different villas while we were there as we had initially requested a room close to the beach/pool but they didn't have one until half way through our stay. They were more than willing to accomodate our request and I'm glad we got the opportunity to stay on different parts of the property. The first 3 nights we stayed in Villa 21 in room 2127 which was right next to the main building and the farthest away from the beach. We had a nice top floor room, but it slightly overlooked the Allegro property next door and it was a little noisy at night, but it was tolerable. The last 3 nights of our stay we were in Villa 31 on the 3rd floor. We would definitely stay in this Villa again as it was the closest to the beach/pool. We stayed in room 3133 which slightly overlooked Villa 30 and slightly overlooked the neighboring property...and it was fairly quiet. I think the best would be if you could get in Villa 31 overlooking the interior of the property. Upon looking at the Villas Resort Map, I also think that Villas 30 or 27 would be good for staying near the beach/pool area. Restaurants - we feel that most people will have varying reviews based upon your taste preferences. We ate at each restaurant and the service and presentation was quite good. Our best suggestion is to ask your waiter for their recommendations on the menu for entrees and desserts...they truly gave us great suggestions. Also, we never had any problem getting the reservation times that we requested. Also, we learned that if you prefer to eat earlier...like 6:30-7:00...it appeared that we could just walk into any restaurant. Azia - My personal favorite was Azia for the food, but the thing that I found odd was that the service here was a little stand-offish and not as caring compared to the impeccable service at all of the other RH restaurants. We dined outside on the patio and really enjoyed it. Ventanas - This was my husband's personal favorite because he really enjoyed the food and the atmosphere is truly fine dining. They had live piano music here. Palazzo - This is the Italian restaurant - if you get a chance and the weather is nice, request an outdoor table on the balcony. It has a phenomenal view of the water and the lights of Cozumel. Our opinion was that the food here was average, but they did have a strawberry dessert that we really enjoyed. Supposedly, the have live violinists playing music inside, but we didn't notice since we sat outside. The Grill - This is the steakhouse/seafood grill - appetizers here were good, my steak was very average, but my husband liked his. The atmosphere of dining right near the beach with the cool evening breeze made this restaurant an enjoyable experience overall. They had a flamenco guitarist playing music while we dined. Spices - This is the Mexican restaurant and our food and experience here was good. They had a Mexican band playing music in a room separate from the one we dined in, but we could still hear them. The Beach/Poolside Snack Bar was consistently good - they have quite a variety to choose from on the menu and we were very pleased with everything we had there. We especially like the calamari, chips & guac, chicken club, and all of the fresh seafood choices. We also ordered room service at least once a day...and every time the food was good, the service was quick and friendly. As for the breakfast choices... we alternated every other day between Spices and Ventanas. Spices had a huge variety of choices and would make any eggs and smoothies fresh to order. Since everything at Spices was buffet, it seemed that most guests dined here. We also enjoyed Ventanas as it was definitely more quiet and it was order ala carte off the menu. The service at Ventanas seemed to be much friendlier and it was just a nice quiet place to start the day. We found the nightlife at the Allegria bar to be just right...nice music...nice waitstaff (Anna) and very relaxing. Tea time and champagne time from 4-6pm...you must try this...it was a nice relaxing experience...they also have all sorts of coffee/liquour drinks and finger sandwiches. The only complaint we had in regard to the overall drink service at this hotel is that, as others have said, the house wines (included in package) are really below average...and we are by no means wine snobs. However, the house champagne was awesome and the other drink choices were top shelf. Fitness Center/Spa: My husband and I both enjoy working out and we spent every day but one at the fitness center. It was definitely better than we anticipated, considering that the web doesn't really show much of it. As for the spa, we didn't use it, but we did look at it and it looked really nice. THE BEACH: To us, the beach was just fine and the resort was actively working on the preservation of it while we were there. We were able to get a chair on the beach each day. We observed that you could pretty much get a chair at the beach or pool if you went out by around 9am...but even after that, you could get a pool boy to get creative and find you a good spot. Also, if you get a chance to get one of the beds on the beach...it is definitely an indulgence worth getting up early to reserve! Overall, it was an incredibly relaxing and indulgent trip!!!

I would love to help you out if I can.", "Date": "May 21, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Richmond, Va", "Title": "\u201cCan't wait to go back!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3489307", "Content": "My wife and I just returned from a 5 day trip to RH May 13-May 17 and had such a great experience, I felt I needed to share it! We have been to 6 Caribbean islands and one other Mexican resort, all being 4-5 stars, however nothing has come close to the experience at RH! Althought we like to try new places, I am sure we will be coming back here often! SERVICE: The service at RH was better than any other place we have experienced by far. From the moment we arrived to champagne and a towel to freshen up, the staff went out of their way to accomodate us. In 5 days, we did not see or meet one staff member that wasn't extremely friendly and helpful. However, Anna at the Allegria Bar was our favorite! Entertainment: This is not a place for spring breakers! In fact, we saw very few people in their 20's, with most people being in their 30's-50's. Relaxing jazz, or quiet music was played around the pool, in restarants and throughtout the grounds. A couple nights, they had live bands in the open bar but otherwise, it is a very quiet and peaceful place. FOOD: The food was very very good and for an all inclusive, we have not found anything close to this. We really enjoyed the breakfast buffet and the lunches at the Snack Bar were decent. Our favorite restaurant was Azia but it is not much different than any typcial Japanese steakhouse you could experience in the States. (The sushi was better though) The Palazzio had the best presentation and views (try to sit outside if possible). The Grille is great and is right on the beach. (better to go on a night when it isn't too windy) POOLS: The 7 pools (including the 5 relaxation pools) are almost never crowded. The main pool usually had no more than 5-6 people at any given time and the relaxation pools never had more than 1 or 2 people in them. Unfortunately, many people resort to reserving chairs and the main pool chairs get taken by 9 at the latest. I would go down at 7:30 each morning to read and most chairs were already reserved, even though the people never came until many hours later and were told not to reserve seats. BEACH: The beach is not as bad as I imagined but is one of the more damaged in the area. We were able to find chairs easily on the beach but because most of it has eroded away, the chairs are exteremely close, making privacy almost zero. The beds on the beach are cool but unless you get up extremely early, it's almost impossible to get one. We sat in one in the afternoon once most people had gone and it was very relaxing! SPA: We both used the spa and the fitness facilities and they were some of the best I have seen at a resort. ROOM: Pretty typical room and had all the amenities we wanted. We were on the 3rd floor in Bldg 22. Try to avoid a first floor room as there is not much privacy in those. TIPPING: We were never quite sure what to do here but we typically gave the pool/beach servers $2-5 at the beginning of the day and we were never without a drink for more than 10 minutes. Overall, the relaxing atmosphere, understated elegance, and superb service really made the trip memorable and we are already planning when we can go back!", "Date": "May 20, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NY", "Title": "\u201cLoved it and would go back again\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3483995", "Content": "We just back from the Royal Hideaway, and we loved it. The food was great, although we didn't like the Grill at all. The place was nice, the food was poor. I had filet, and it was Ponderosa style. I had rosemary shrimp kabob for an appetizer and they left the shrimp heads on the shrinp. So when I was cutting my food I had to look at the actual eyes on the shrimp. Who leaves this on?? It didn't even taste good. Azia was our favorite, ask for the private dinning area to eat, it is very romantic. Drink Tokio's, they are so good at Azia. The pools are awesome. My only complaint about the place is after dinner they only thing to do was drink at one place (not sure what it was called) by the main building. They need more entertainment. Like a band everynight. Anything... Shopping was a disappointment, you can walk into town but it is all mexican stuff if your into that. We took the ferry, it was very rough. Please read this: The Royal Hideaway says that tips are included in your price. That is not true! They make $4.50 USD a day. Rent for a month for our waiter is $150 USD a month. You do the math, that isn't enough money to live off of. The employees work so hard and are so good, they don't expect tips from us, most people do give money. We tipped $20 each dinner. You figure the meal would of cost at least $100 anywhere else, and 20% is what you would leave if you were anywhere else.

Overall the resort was wonderful. We especially loved the high level of service, the delicious food and the beautiful grounds. We ate in all of the restaurants except the Grill. I loved Azia, the Asian restaurant. Their sushi was delicious, although limited in variety. Other reviewers have complained that the portions are too small, and I would agree if you were comparing these restaurants to something like TGIF. However compared to other fine dining/gourmet dining, the portions are perfectly sized. The idea is to order from each course and by the time coffee and dessert is served, you'll be full. The presentations are artistic and the dishes are very innovative. The wait staff are attentive without being intrusive and all of the restaurants are well appointed. We actually preferred the Spices restaurant for the breakfast buffet instead of Ventanas. The buffet changed selections daily and had a large option of different things to eat from omlettes made to order, to cereals, fresh fruit, pancakes, various Mexican dishes, Serrano ham and smoked salmon. The orange juice and coffee were delicious. As far as the rooms are concerned, we probably got one of the worst located villas and rooms. We were in villa 22 on the first floor in the back facing the Allegro. We could have requested to change our room, but didn't bother since the room itself was fine and we didn't have any problem falling asleep at night even with the noise. Since we were on the bottom floor the room was a little musty, but with the A/C cranked up that cleared up the humidity just fine. The rooms aren't overly large, but the bathrooms were with a separate jetted tub and shower stall. The closets are nice and big with padded hangers, slippers, robes, extra pillows and umbrella provided. The maid service was great with turn down every night. We loved having the DVD player in the room and brought movies to watch. Room service was great, one night after drinking at the Allegria bar we were hungry for some more food and had quesadillas and pasta delivered in 15 minutes. Our relaxation pool at the villa was wonderful, we spent a full day there on our own hanging out with the iguanas and birds. The beach even with the erosion problem was amazing. The water is this almost unreal color of blue-green and the sand is white and soft. The waves were a little high, but still swimable. The main pools were nice, we floated around in both of them on several days. The pool service was good, it certainly wasn't fast, but we didn't mind. The drink selection was wide with lots of top shelf brands and tasty frozen concoctions. The snack bar food was good, I highly recommend the beef quesadillas for lunch. We never had a problem finding two lounge chairs together even in the late morning. I love that you can get as many towels as you wanted and someone was always available to help us put up the chair shade. Those are the yellow \"hoods\" that you see in the pictures. Those were great for me because I'm so fair skinned I can't stay in the sun too long. They also helped to create a more private area for my husband and I since the chairs are all close together. I know a lot of people have complained about vacationers getting up super early and claiming chairs and then not using them for most of the day. We didn't run into that problem, but what we did notice were lots of chairs abandoned with just a towel on them. It didn't seem like anyone was saving them, just that the people were too lazy to put their used towels in the bin when they were done. The resort had staff picking up the towels every now and then, but not all day long. My husband took one of the free scuba lessons in the pool and liked it so much that he signed up for the beginner dive. He loved it, especially since it was just him and one other guest with the instructor for the dive, at $100 it was a great bargain which included longer instructions, equipment and transportation. We checked out the spa facilities, and although they looked nice, we though the massages were overpriced and skipped on it. The best part of the afternoon was tea time. The first time I went I had champagne and they kept refilling my glass, so I got a little tipsy. The second time I went I had the Mayan Coffee which was so yummy with fresh whipped cream on top and they had delicious cream puffs to snack on. We went into Playa del Carmen and walked down 5th avenue. It was just too touristy for us and we got tired of having people try to get us to buy timeshares or souvenirs, etc. We did go to Tulum on a tour and really liked it, the tour group was small and the guide was really good. The ruins were interesting to explore, unfortunately we didn't find the beach area until it was almost time to go. As far as nightlife, we stayed on the resort and just enjoyed hanging out at the Allegria bar listening to music and watching people and talking. We were on the young end of the age range, but everyone was having a good time with the live music and swing dancing. The dinner show that we went to was just okay, but surprisingly the food was really good for a banquet. If you are looking for more exciting nightlife, you can go into Playa del Carmen or other resorts (Blue Parrot was recommended). We just didn't bother since we wanted to relax and spend couple time together. Since we had the romance package we received chocolate dipped strawberries, a bottle of champagne, the robes and a dinner on the beach. We cancelled our dinner on the beach because of the wind, even though the wait staff was willing to try to serve us there, we gave up and just went to Spices for dinner. I think the concept of dinner on the beach is great, it just doesn't work all that well in practice! We never had a problem with dinner reservations, I did try to get back into Azia one day but by lunch time when I requested the change the only time open was 10pm which was too late for us. Our concierge, Andreas, was helpful and nice and was great in getting us situated and arranging our transportation back to the airport. The check in process was relaxed and prompt with champagne and cool towels. All in all everything the Royal Hideaway did made us feel special and pampered.

This was our third visit and our friends first. This visit was just as incredible as the first! Instead of taking the round trip transfers that was included in the price, we opted for a private van for an extra $85. This was well worth it since it avoided all the extra hotel stops along the way. Service was flawless. Everyone, including the restaurants, bars, pool staff and conceirge, could not have been more accommodating. The restaurants were definitely above average. If you enjoy Japanese food, be sure to try Avia and request the private room. It's very nice.....you remove your shoes and sit on the floor. Our friends and us were celebrating a birthday and an anniversary and the staff surprised us with a bottle of champagne and a birthday desert. It was a lovely evening. Sometimes pool chairs can be difficult to obtain, especially if you arrive after 10. But, don't fret....just ask one of the pool guys and they'll be sure to get you chairs. There were four of us and we never had a problem. Do bring some small bills. Although it is not necessary, it is nice to tip the staff. They work sooooooo hard trying to please everyone that it is nice to reward them in a small way. There are now 4 computers in the business center that are available for guests' use at no charge. This is a great way for communicating with family back home, since telephone calls to the states can be quite expensive. However, before we left, we checked with our cell phone carrier and learned that we were able to call the states for a charge of $.69/min. So, if you decide to do this, check with your phone co. before you leave. Before I end, I must say that the cost of our 7 night stay at RH in a deluxe room including R/T air from Phila. was only $4500. Not bad, since everything was included!

I was also worried that we would not get the reservation times we wanted after reading some of the concerns on this site, but we made the reservations each morning and never had a problem. Some people make a big deal over the beach erosion, although there is still plenty of sand, and you can walk for miles. We still spent a lot of time on the beach and in the ocean; I thought the ocean was great for swimming and playing in the water! I would not let the beach situation stop me from coming back! The pools are great, we were at the main pools some but I also enjoyed the relaxation pools as most of the time we were the only people in them. Also we were lucky to get the beach beds on two days which was nice. Try to claim them if you can! The only negative (and I suppose it's not really a negative, just a remark) that RH is not as private and secluded as I thought it would be.

We were there May 6-13. Let me start off by saying that we've travelled all around the carribean, to lots of different resorts and islands. Our room at the RH was in building 22 on the third floor facing the tennis courts and adjoining resort. My top 2 requests were a king size bed and a third floor room, so I didn't complain. For those who are worried about the noise from the other resorts, it really wasn't bad at all. Yes.. we could hear music coming from the other resort when we sat on our balcony late in the evening. It's just music... and when we went inside and closed the sliding glass door, we couldn't hear a thing! The nice thing about our balcony, it was very private. The rooms facing out into the RH resort, aren't. Our concierge, Andre, was pleasant and helpful but unobtrusive. The beach situation is sad. We are definitely beach people, not pool people. I can sit by a pool anywhere, when I'm in the Carribean, I want to sit at the beach. There is sand and places to sit on the sand at RH, just not much of it. The chairs are placed literally side by side with barely room to walk around. We arrived at the beach at about 9:30 each morning and never had problems finding a chair. I can't comment on the pool chairs but I suspect it was harder to find a prime pool location at that time. The RH has these yellow canvas umbrella-like things for the beach chairs. We couldn't figure out the charm of these.. they blocked the breeze and the view... most days we were the only ones not using them. There are plenty of palm trees on the beach to provide shade. Towels are plentiful and it's nice not to have to limit to one at a time(like at many resorts). Drink service didn't seem to be as attentive on the beach as at the pool but you really were never lacking for something cool to drink. The access to the ocean is provided by a set of stairs. There is room to walk by down by the water but no room for chairs. The water was wonderful with a green flag flying daily. There are also 3 relaxation pools scattered around the property, they were pretty and in general underutilized. We made our first night reservation before we arrived and all subsequent reservations on the day we arrived. We didn't have any problems getting reservations at the times we wanted, where we wanted. Our favorite restaurant was Palazzo. We ate there on our first night and our last. We had a very romantic and memorable last dinner outside on the terrace with the lights of Cozumel in the distance. We also enjoyed the Grill and Azia(good sushi and sashimi, but a limited selection). One night we enjoyed the show featuring a magician and other acts with an average dinner served dinner theatre style. Our least favorite was the main restaurant, Ventanas. My husband had a rubbery grisley steak and I had tasteless pork tenderloins. But the appetizers and dessert there(and every night) were yummy! All in all, we were impressed with the dinners. The restaurants are all beautiful, service is wonderful and in most cases the food was very good. After dinner entertainment was low-key.. usually a small band at the small outside bar. We ate breakfast at the Spices buffet and lunch at the snack bar by the pool daily. Our overall impression of the RH was a good one. The staff is attentive without being in your face constantly. The grounds are beautifully groomed and kept spotlessly clean. The public areas are well laid out, very pretty with comfortable furnishings and nice appointments. There were many people who were there for their 3rd, 4th and even 7th times! We tend to like to try different places so it's hard to say that we'll be going back soon.

We have made two trips to a five diamond hotel in Cancun and one trip to a five diamond resort in Cabo. It was recommended by a close friend of ours. First, the good things about the property were that they handled our arrival well, the architecture and grounds are very nice, and they had consistently gracious service delivered by a high quality waitstaff. They do a good job of elevating 3.0 star food ingredients to 4.0 star meals through innovative dishes and excellent presentation. Also, Playa del Carmen is charming, and we preferred it over other destinations we have visited in Mexico. Despite these good points, we would never return or recommend this resort. The biggest and, in my view, inexcusable problem was that both of us as well as a couple we met at the resort became violently ill from the food at the resort. (We did not consume anything off resort.) This should not happen at a resort of this quality where all of the water is filtered. It really can only happen through poor preparation and quality control. This is a fatal flaw at a resort of this type. There were a number of other problems with the resort that were either related to its location or the indifferent attitude of the management team at the resort. For example, because of building height restrictions in Playa del Carmen very few of the rooms have an ocean view and all rooms except those on the top floors have relatively low ceilings that create a claustrophobic effect in otherwise well appointed rooms. The pool is very ordinary and towel service is not handled well. They gouge you for $25 per day for internet access for your computer in the business center and $50 per day if you want access in your room. Wines (other than house wines) are stored centrally at the resort and not at each restaurant, so you will be finished with your meal before your wine arrives. I realize that some of these points are minor, but they indicate the failure of this resort to really attain 4.5 or 5 star status.

We became close to many of the staff including Gustavo, Julio, Anita, Tono and Uriel, all of whom had a smile on their face even after they worked from 7am in the scorching beach sun to late evening. Also, I want to give a heads up to the mandatory 15% gratuity which can pan out to about $70 gratuity a day to visitors. We thought this was more than enough in tips until we arrived, and it was our understanding that the staff receives a small salary and many rely on tips to supplement their income. The service is outstanding compared to the U.S., which makes tipping a couple dollars here and there much easier. We found out a couple dollars goes a long way with the staff and they deserve it as you will see. I would suggest bringing some ones to hand them out for outstanding service.

We had a blast! Such a nice resort. We like The Grill the best as far as the food goes. All the resteraunts were good, but not great. Compared to other AI's, we think the food was much better but just remember it is an AI. That being said, the presentation was great and we thought the main dishes were always better than the appetizers and deserts. The bellmen were always very friendly as were the concierges, waiters and staff (even the maintenance men). With only 200 rooms, we thought it was pretty quiet. Except when the convention goers got there in the middle of the week. We actually had some meatheads from Michigan wrestling on the beach (I think they were from comdoc...sorry for the bad publicity comdoc but your salesmen are very annoying...maybe that makes for good copy salesmen or something). The staff quickly stopped that and the next day, the resort was much more quite. We think they were taken on an excursion. The beach beds are fantastic! Make sure you get one for at least one day. We also had a couples massage which was also great. The snorkle trip from the resort was fun as well. Now, the beach erosion...dont get me wrong the erosion is bad compared to what it used to look like. BUT, there is still a very, very beautiful beach with some of the prettiest tourquiose water you've ever seen. Parts of the beach were eroded more than others but by no means should you cancel your trip because of the beach erosion. There are two sets of steps that take you down to the water on one side of the resort and in the middle. On the other side, you could walk down the sand to the water. There was still a foot or two of incline but you didn't have to take the steps which had a 5ish foot drop (hence the steps). I labeled them the \"stairways to heaven\". The eternity pool was never too crowded nor was the other pool right by it. All the relaxation pools were usually empty if not with only a few people. They only heat one hot tub but as the summer gets closer, that's really not an issue as you wont want to be in hot water anyway. There were tons of seats by all the pools and you could pretty much move around the resort all day and find great seats. People did get up very early to save seats but we never had a problem finding the seats we wanted. It was quite annoying that by 8:00 lots of seats had towels on them but most folks didn't show up to the beach till 11ish. That being said, you still have many options to place yourself for the day. The grounds are very beautiful...always very well maintained. We took the bikes out one day to PDC and had fun. The bikes are pretty old and cheap but they were totally fine. The little strip-mall across the street was very close if you ever needed anything and PDC was only a 3 minute cab ride away (5 dollars). Fruity drinks, beer, wine, mixed drinks and champagne were all very good. If you tip the beach waiter in the morning a buck, he'll take care of you all day. They were all very nice. The chips and guac were awesome as well. In fact im going through withdrawel right now. We saw plenty of iguanas, birds, and squirel/rabbit type animals all over the resort. Jesus, the flamenco guitarist was amazing and the little bands after dinner were usually pretty good. I think I only saw 2 or 3 teenagers there the whole time but they were more behaved than some of the convention goers. We took a few excurions...the ATV tour, snorkeling in Cozumel. We also took the kayaks out a few times...very nice. All in all, we had a great time. We've been asked by a few folks if we'd go back and here's our answer... After we see some other places on our list, we'd definelty go back. There's just a bunch more place I'd like to visit. But the RH is a great AI resort.

Wonderful!!! -Rooms - Lovely, marble, concierge in each small building (super!), the large suites are extremely impressive, they are going to be refurnnishing all rooms very soon but the furnishings in rooms are still like brand new!, lovely balconies for room service meals or lounging. -Dinner show - Impressive theatre, show was mediocre, would rather spend my time at an impressive restaurant meal. -Pools and beach- Comfy beach/pool chairs, great service and drinks, much of beach has washed since two years ago but don't let that stop you it is still wonderful. -Activities-Quieter nightlife, small indoor/outdoor bar with live music, casino night etc. This is a great couples sanctuary or for those looking for rest and relaxation.

We both came with an attitude to relax, no work for me and no school for her. Relaxing came very easily to us both. We did rent the wave runner which was a blast, parasailed which was also a lot of fun and did leave the grounds once to go shopping. (We are both experts in shopping but really preferred staying at our hotel and being served. What a treat!) We also snorkeled at Excaret one day and enjoyed it but next time would probable just snorkel right from the hotel. Our concierge Monica was a blessing. She gave me all the information that I needed and was always right on the money. In booking the trip I dealt with Danielle from Occidental and she could not have been more helpful. I was nervous at first about my daughter being bored but I went on Danielle's recommendations and my daughter was never bored, she cried yesterday because we were home. The restaurants were so beautiful that I was very, very sorry that my husband sat this trip out. The food was good and I was able to try lots of new dishes. Our room was cleaned to perfection everyday and because I did not like the smell of the tap water our personal house keeper brought me a nice pineapple scented candle which did the trick! Each day he left a new towel creation on our bed which made us smile. The only water that I drank was from a bottle which room service gives you as many as you want. I did wake up at 6 am everyday to watch the sunrise and claim my chair. I took several eating breaks throughout the day but other than that I read and tanned. I would recommend this vacation to everyone. Tea time is a must. The champagne is abundant and delicious.

The pools are great. There are two main pool and several secondary relaxation pools with hot tubs. Sometimes we found our selves to be the only people in the smaller pools. Finally, what sets this resort apart is the service. The resort is divided into villas each with their own concierge to meet your every need. The pool and beach also feature a very helpful wait staff that will bring drinks right to your beach chair. On the negative side, I just have a few. The lunch menu was very limited and after a few day your get tired of eating the same thing. The nightlife at the resort also left something to be desired. After dinner there is just one bar opened and it is kind of quiet and away from the beach. Both of these problems however, can be taken care of by a few trips to town for lunch and a more lively nightlife. Lastly, they are still having major beach problems. They have probably lost 50+ yards since my last visit to the area a year ago. If fact, the beach got significantly smaller just during our one week stay.

You can safely leave the resort and walk the \"new area\" of Playacar and its shops. Don't know if they've done anything to improve it, but if you're a beach person rather than a pool person, the beach was badly eroded when we were there and so you could not sit on the beach itself ... and that goes for all the resorts in Playacar. You had to sit above the beach and walk down. A word of caution: the resort is small and there were two different groups who came in during our stay and while it did not affect our ability to get dinner reservations, or find \"good chairs\" at the pool etc. they did tend to be somewhat loud around the main pool area.

The resort is magnificent and we have never experienced such incredible service and pampering! It was so fabulous in everyway that we only left our resort once to take an afternoon bike ride into Playa Del Carmen. There so much attention given to us that we felt like we were the only ones there, and the resort was nearly full! We stayed in a standard room in one of the eight villas. Each villa has their own concierge who arranges your nightly dining with reservations. You must dress for dinner, which was great since we truly felt like we were out to dinner each night (although no restaurant was more than a 5 minute walk). There were six unique and faboulous restaurants to choose from! We weren't expecting fine dining each night, with gourmet presentations at an all inclusive, but we found that and more for our meals. Breakfast was a choice of a lovely continental spread of cheeses fruit pastries etc. at the table waiting for you before you order, or a fantastic breakfast buffet over looking the water. Room service was also an option 24hrs eachs day. During the afternoon there was high tea with live music, champagne etc. Quite difficult to fit in any meals out after all that, but somehow we managed, and never ate at the same place twice in 7 nights! Pre dinner and post dinner drinks were available at the Allegra Bar as well, along with live entertainment. Our favorite rest. was Azia, Japanese/sushi, until we ate at the Grill, equally our favorite. All the other's were great as well. The Italian rest. overlooks the resort on a rooftop- beautiful. We laid out each day on the beach or at the pool, never in the same exact spot since each spot had different perks. The beds on the beach were fantastic - check often for availibility. We got them twice that week. The pools are lovely, and one backs up to the ocean. There are smaller pools hidden throughout the resort for more privacy- with jacuzzis. The waitress would deliver anything, anytime to your bathing location, and each night we had appetizers and desserts delivered to our room unexectedly, as well as turn down service each night. The Spa was wonderful. We bought a \"massage everyday\" package and split the services. We played tennis, basketball, did water aerobic, and went to the weight/cardio facility each day, and we still gained five pounds each! This was by far the best resort I could imagine for a honeymoon or anniversary celebration. We met four women on a mother's spa weekend who were having the time of their life- so I am sure it's perfect for that as well.

Next we were encouraged to book dinner reservations for the entire week or risk either not getting in to some of the restaurants at all or getting very late seating times (9:30 or 10:00 at night) In fact, when we attempted to change a reservation mid-week, we were told that we could not be accomodated anywhere in the resort before 9:30 pm. In the end, our preferred dining room made some last minute arrangements but only after we were kept hanging all day. We were pleased with Azia but must describe all the other restaurant food as mediocre at best and some food was simply inedible. Given that 3 out of the four travellers in our party were very sick during our stay (as well as some members of every other party we spoke with) we became concerned about the food handling procedures at the resort. Lastly, in order to get a chaise lounge at poolside or even near poolside, we needed to get up each morning at 5:30 in order to stake our claim. Smelly rooms, very unfriendly restaurant booking system, mediocre to unacceptable food, insufficient poolside seating, unexplained but pervasive sickness in a significant number of guests will ensure that we will not be returning.

Throughout our week we were pampered and served by the many employees with courtesy and real \"interest\" in satisying our needs. The new \"wrinkles\" are great, particulary the evening entertainment activities which added a lot to our visit.

The restaurants continue the excellence we had experienced in previous years. One hint: in the past we were able to make reservations on a day to day basis, however with the increase in occupancy, it is wise to make them 3-4 days at a time in order to get the reservations desired. We particularly enjoyed the ways that the staff at the Italian restaurant went out of their way to assist in the celebration of my wife's bithday.

Thank you, Luz, for everything you did to make our stay memorable. It was our 25th wedding anniversary while there and the night of our anniversary, we had a lobster dinner on the beach. I can't recommend this experience enough for the ultimate in romance. Weather was perfect everyday - upper 80's and low 90's. We had a brief thunderstorm one day but that was actually kind of fun! Food: We tried all of the restaurants. Our favorites were Ventanas, The Grill (like the fish/seafood there MUCH better than the beef), Pallazo (the clam chowder soup was absolutely to die for. We also tried Spices and Azia with Azia being our least favorite. So-So sushi and main dishes just ok. The calamari at the snack bar is absolutely amazing. I think I had it 6 days out of 7! Even though we are not dessert people, we tried some of the desserts and they were excellent. Tip--if you tip the beach waiters the first time around, your glass will remain full the entire day. You don't have to even ask for refills, they just bring you another on their way back. Relaxation pools - we really enjoyed these. There was one right out the back of our room in a beautiful garden. Rarely anyone else back there so if you wanted some quiet time, you could go back there to nap/read etc. Great animals around - some kind out Agouti things running around, squirrels, birds and of course, iguanas!

You can have breakfast or a snack there and it is so nice. We had villa 31. It is right next to the pool and our concierge Gisel was the best. She took care of all our concerns and even booked all our water sports. The 2 pools were very nice. You do however have to get up early for beach chairs. Some people save chairs and no one shows up until 10 or 11. The pools have floats and they are very nice. You can see the ocean from the pool and it is very relaxing.

When we arrived, we had private transfers from Cancun( it was $30 per person extra, but worth it). A private car took us on the 45 minute trip from the airport to the resort. When we arrived, the resort is magnificent- marble lobby, fresh flowers everywhere. Request a 2 or 3rd floor room. I usually like the oceanfront rooms, but my travel agent advised me against it, what a great idea! The oceanview rooms are 150 feet from the ocean, and in front of your balcony is the beach, pool and,oh, the vollyball net. Not worth it. But, the regular room is terrific. Beautiful bathroom, tiled shower. Every day, there was turndown service at least once. THere is a private concierge for your \"villa\" of 20 rooms. They couldn't do enough for you. Of course, the beach was eroded. But that wasn't anyone's fault. They're about to repair it. Regardless, the water is beautiful. warm and crystal clear sand. There are 3 beautiful \"beds\" on the beach. Be warned, you need to be out there by 6am to reserve one. You should try it at least once. Otherwise, the other chairs are great too. THe guys do entertainment by the pool Jose, Gus are very funny. Gus had lunch with us and 6 other people we became frlendly with 3 days in a row. About the food. First, the buffet breakfast could almost rival any 4 seasons brunch. The 4 oclock tea/coffee, is also like a ritz tea = they use frette napkins, etc. Each restaurant is good in it's own way. The best is really the Grill, and Azia- the ambiance is a good as the food. Palazzo is ok - the caramel cake is to die for. Ventanas looks very pretty, but the food is ok. Spices is mexican food- pretty good also. They put alot of money and energy into the ambiance of each place. The waiters work so hard. A little tip for all the guys goes a long way. So bring $50-70- they really deserve it. There is free interenet service- which is great to stay in touch. The spa is very nice. We got the romance package with the dinner on the beach. Wow! Just for the experience its worth it. All in all the trip was fantastic. We have never gone back to the same resort twice, but we will definitely go back! Also, watch out for conventions. THere was a convention of Mac truck salesmen. They didn't bother us, but people on their honeymoon, some were dissappointed.

We couldn't get our room until 3, so we walked around the grounds, ate lunch, then went to the beach (we got there at 11am). I felt relaxed immediately. Villa concierge: Marilu was great. It was wonderful having a concierge greet you every time you came in and out (without being obnoxious) and make every request possible with no hassles or hitches. It really was great to not to have to call the front desk or go to the main lobby when you wanted something. Our room was very nice, well-maintained and cleaned promptly everyday. It was my birthday while there and Marilu decorated my room and it was announced in the RH newsletter and they went all out at dinner that night for us. Nice touches all around. Food: By far the best of any all-inclusive I have been visited. Fresh, flavorful, good quality and a good selection. The only downside I noticed here was that water was not brought right away, other than that, service was great. No buffets at all (except the theme nights, twice a week I think). Men must wear long pants (no jeans, no shorts for anyone) so take dress pants. Room service is available and good. You could get food at the pool area all afternoon. Guacamole was very good. Spa: The spa and surrounding area was small (no where to really relax before your treatment), but the treatments were very good. We went twice. Beach: I understand the beach has eroded due to storms, but as soon as they are able to restore it, I am sure it will be just as beautiful. It's unfortunate, but that's nature! The beach beds were fantastic - we had to get up early to get them, but they made our stay wonderful. Tips for your stay: 1) Make your first night dinner reservations before you get there. 2) No jeans and shorts at dinner - no exception. Men must bring long pants. 3) If the walkways in your villa get wet, they will be extremely slippery - exercise caution or you will fall down. We loved this place so much, we will be making this an annual trip with no hesitations. It was so relaxing, but a fun place too. There are so many other places I still want to visit, but when you have as good experience as we had, it's hard to want to go anywhere else.

The weather was beautiful while we were there (Mar 1-6), about 85F, sunny or partly sunny, breezy the whole time we were there. It's a great destination to just stay, relax and be pampered. Although the beach there is pretty well gone, it's kind of neat because you can lay by the main pool, where they bring you drinks, and be right at the ocean too. We did a lot of walking along the beach to the south of the resort where the beach is still very nice. All the restaurants are great, but we enjoyed Spices and Azia probably the most. It's a good idea to book reservations for you first night's dinner by e-mail before you arrive and then make your remaining dinner reservations as soon as you arrive. We went to Tulum and Akumal one day and then decided we were happiest just staying at the resort. Akumal is a highly recommended snorkeling location, but it was murky and polluted, with no fish when we were there. One of us got a skin rash and the other a very bad bronchial infection after snorkeling there. We would suggest that you go elsewhere to snorkel unless they have cleaned this place up.

From our room, to the service, to the food, and the atmosphere, this resort is head and shoulders above anything my fiance and I have ever had the pleasure of staying at. Once our reservation was confirmed, Customer Service Manager Leanne Romanchuck couldn't do enough for us to ensure our stay would be absolutely perfect. She gave us several options for transfers from the airport in Cancun to the hotel and once we specified what we wanted she took care of all the details. We were greeted at the entrance of the Royal Hideaway with champagne! Oscar took care of booking, and while we were filling out our reservations, warm towels arrived so we could wash our hands. We were escorted to our room by Leanne Romanchuck and Guest Services Manager Dulce Gomez. They along with concierge Geisel gave us a full tour of our room to ensure we were familiar with all the room amenties and every service the hotel had to offer. Our room was nothing short of spectacular. It was cleaned to perfection every day, the linens on the bed were perfect, towels were also replaced in our room twice daily. The pool area offers full service, all day. Anything you can possibily imagine from the bar, and full service from the resturant. The waiters were incredibly pleasant and prompt. The service is also extended to the beach area. Really you never have to leave your chair for anything expect to go to the bathroom!!!! Everything is brought to you including fresh towels, along with wet, cool aromatherapy face clothes at the end of the day which are extremely refreshing. The beach speaks for itself. White, powder like sand, crystal blue, warm wather. Nothing short of spectacular!!!! The Royal Hideaway also goes the extra mile with something called Tai Beds...; no other resort in the area has these. Essentially they are teak wood, pillared beds. Fresh, thick matresses along with huge pillows are placed on the beds daily. Now to the resturants. The best Italian and Thai resturants can be found at the Royal Hideaway. Incredible service.. amazing food. The sushi is also incredible!!! Book your seating at the resturants early... you don't want to miss out on all the different resturants. My fiance and I had full intentions of travelling around, perhaps to Cozumel and Cancun. But our accomodations and food at the Royal Hideaway were so amazing, we did not want to leave the resort,.. SO WE DIDN'T!!!! Honestly, we cannot say enough about this place. Leanne Romanchuck and Dolce Gomez offered us the best customer service of any resort we have ever visited. They truely are in a league of their own,, as is the Royal Hideaway. We also had an opportunity to meet the General Manager of the resort Mr. Jean Aggarista. An amazing person, took time out of his busy day to have lunch with us and welcome us to the resort. Now that's what you call customer relations. We met many people from around the world during our ten days there,,, and everyone echoed our praise!!!!!!!!

We were shocked and disappointed at this so called 5 star resort. First and foremost the hotel mislead us w/deceiving photos of the beach. There is NO Beach. Just about 20 feet of sand around the pool before it makes a 15 foot drop to the sea. Steps lead to the sea crashing against the stairs. If you like romantic walks along a sand bagged beach and a string of workers shoveling sand in front of you all day then this is the place for you. I expected PDC to be a quieter and more romantic spot than Cancun. I was very wrong---it is busier and more crowded than Cancun. The drone of jet skis and chain saws working on fixing the beach gave us a headache. The chaise lounges around the pool were one on top of one another. And if you are not out by 6 am to snag your chair you are out of luck! If you like to be so close to your neighbor by the pool that you can hear him snore and fart the day away than this is the place for you. We requested 2 adjoining rooms, upper floor and close to the beach. We got none of the requests. We spent every night running back and forth between our kids room to check on them. After the beach the rooms were the biggest disappointment. They were small and very simple. Nothing luxurious or romantic about them. The bed was the worst I have slept on---like a concrete slab. The bedspread was worn and faded in ours and our kids room. Luxurious linens the web site says--HAH! They were thin white sheets with a cheap acrylic blanket at turn down. We dreaded getting into bed. The night time housekeeper rolled the quilt up and threw it on a chair every night. The room has crappy wood shutters that would never open or close smoothly--often off their track. Behind them faded wrinkled curtains that were hanging off their tracks as well. In the bathrooms there were \"no name\" sample size shampoo and conditioner. The door to the shower was on backwards and you had to squeeze between the sink to get into it. If you opened the door to warm it up it flooded the bathroom. The balcony was tiny w/2 small chairs and a table. What happened to chaise lounges, hamocks, dining tables???? Only if you book the presidental suite do you get any normal furniture on your balcony. There was not one balcony on the property that was private. You were in full view of everyone. Many times we saw people sitting out there in their robes, pjs, etc. I even saw a woman brushing her teeth on her balcony. If you werent facing the cement walls of the neighboring resorts then you faced the interior \"garden\". To travel that far and spend that much money and not have a glimpse of the ocean! The grounds were nice but it felt like I was at a motel in Florida. Nothing special--- I could have been anywhere---no feeling of being in Mexico. The noise at night from the neighboring properties was deafing. DJ's music, screaming etc. Complaints to the management did nothing. On the positive side the wait staff and food were good to very good. Very friendly and great service. The atmosphere at the restaurants was very nice. Wednesdays through Sundays they set up a themed lunch buffet in addition to the a lacarte lunch menu by the pool. Upper management was horrible. Not customer focused and the general manager was a bag of wind when he was trying to deal w/our problems. For my birthday my husband booked the \"romantic dinner\" on the beach. WHAT BEACH? It was a table in the sand around the pool that they charge you $120.00 per person for food that you already paid for. Nothing extra for your money. And they would not confirm his choice of dates until we arrived at the property.!!! The wine list consisted of a Mexican and Chilian white wine. God awful! We found ourselves paying $65.00 for a bottle of cheap California Chardonney just so we didn't have to drink that swill at dinner. Overall mixed drinks were tastless and not much liquor. In the afternoon they blasted a BINGO game around the pool. Felt like I was at my grandfathers senior citizen home. Very tacky! And speaking of tacky every day at 3:30 the staff came down to the pool to do this geeky dance to \"Love is in the Air\". I almost puked! We spent $1600.00 a night for 2 rooms at a very mediocre resort. This place (and most people whose reviews I have read) have no idea what 5 star means. We have stayed at Cap Juluca in Anguilla, One & Only Palmilla in Cabo, Caneel Bay in St John, Four Seasons Punta Mita etc etc. These places know what service is. There rooms are truly luxurious and romantic. Trust me we have traveled the world---this place is spring break for adults---no class whatsoever. My opinion---spend your hard earned money else where or if you must have an allinclusive in PDC stay somewhere else and go out to eat dinner at night in town.

This place is truly a gem. Everything was fabulous, especially the wonderful service. We never wanted for a thing. Everything we asked for was done cheerfully and gracefully. We lost our luggage on the way down (thanks to USAIR and Logan Airport). I asked if there was a place that we could go to buy toothbrushes, toothpaste, etc. Within ten minutes, a bellman had brought up everything we had requested, free of charge. That's just a sampling of the service we received all week. The resort is beautiful. Everything is so well maintained. We loved the green grass and all of the blooming flowers, something we don't see in the Northeast this time of year. The beach has suffered MAJOR EROSION. It was my first trip to the resort, so I don't have a comparison, but now there's only room for 3 rows of lounge chairs, placed very close together. A group of local men spent the week stuffing sandbags and building a retaining wall of sorts in front of the hotel. We were very bummed about the beach on the first day there, but we got used to it. As long as the beach stays as it was this past week, it won't keep us from returning again. The food was good. Breakfasts and lunches were generally excellent. We really enjoyed having breakfast at Ventanas. They had really good eggs benedict and they always had a nice sampling of fresh from the oven pastries. We had lunch at the beach bar 6 out of 7 days and always enjoyed it. The sandwiches were quite good, as was the fried calamari. Dinners were generally just good. We're picky eaters from the snooty Northeast, so it does take a lot to impress us. Our favorite restaurant was the Grille. They had a really good goat cheese salad and beef filet. We also really liked Azia which was a surprise for us, since we thought it was odd eating Japanese food in Mexico. The sushi was just okay, but everything else was excellent. We loved how elegant everything was at every meal. It was formal without being stuffy. Everything was presented so nicely. Soooo . . . the bottom line on the Royal Hideaway?

The staff work VERY hard to please and do a terrific job. It didn't seem that they were doing it as a job, but as if they really enjoyed it. As matter of fact I stated that to them and also heard 3 other guests through out the week asked the same question. The resturants were wonderful we liked AZIA the chinese the best. The Coconut curry chicken satay was to die for so were the spring rolls. The 2nd best was SPICES the chicken was great. Our waiter at SPICES was Candelarijo He was great, very funny and energetic. We even took pictures of him. Thanks Candelarijo you were great! \"undavay-undavay yevaw-yevaw\" The bar staff at ALLEGRIO worked very hard. we met a wonderful couple from Milwaukee Wisconsin and hungout at the bar with them and talked.

So much so that we were going to go somewhere else in the carribean next year that we are weighing heavily on going back. CONS: The Tacos on the menu at spices were the BEST I HAVE EVER HAD. And they need to be on the dinner menu. The beach isn't what it used to be. We seen postcards of what it was before and it's ashame they lost it.

To those of you who may think that this is a little concern, let me put it in perspective. In 2003 when we were there, there was approximatly 100-125 yards of the best white beach we have ever been on. The beach now is gone right up to the palm trees. If you do want to get in the ocean, you must walk over sand bags and then the undercurrent is very bad. I believe that this may be a lot bigger problem than what is being reported. I believe the tide is higher in this area and the waves are breaking alot worse than the last time we were here.

I researched RH and other top resorts in the Riviera Maya extensively. Many thanks to all review writers! I've traveled much in Europe and the States. My first trip to Mexico and I was a little apprehensive. My husband has been to Mexico many times. He put me in charge b/c he knows I love to do research. His advice, pick a place with the highest rating. 4 or 5 stars might be fine in the States but could be a problem here. Not all top resorts are equal here either. Other resort reviews had issues we didn't like: too far from Playa del Carmen, bad food or service, too many buffet meals, long lines to make dinner reservations, food poisoning, busy beach, theft problems or wearing wrist bands. Here's my review, sorry so long. Read the sections of interest to you, hope it helps : ) Beach: There has been beach erosion, however, with only 200 rooms there is plenty of beach for everyone to enjoy. Others had more beach but had a lot more people, were loud and had many kids. No seaweed, rocks or murky water as complained about at other resorts. Water is a beautiful turquoise blue and visible from the main pools, main hot tub and many of the restaurants. The beach/pool drink and food service were great our whole trip. Beach Beds: The five beach beds are cool and make people drool when they go by but some people obsessed over them. Heard a guy went out at 4 am to get one! Some would hold the beds but not use them for hours. It's a cool idea but we didn't go gaga as others did. Didn't want to spend our vacation tied to a bed, albeit with a beautiful view. A sign up system with a time limit, as is used for the also popular hobie cats, might be nice so more can enjoy (e.g. 3 hour limit). Hobie Cats: My husband used to have a sail boat. He was so excited to finally get on the sign-up sheet to use the HC that he didn't notice the many things wrong with it until he was out there. Being experienced, he dealt with it fine and had a great time. Barracuda had 2 HC's but for some reason wouldn't let the other one out. I wonder if they hope a less experienced person will need their help b/c you get charged if they come out to help you. FYI, be careful and don't forget a life jacket. Snorkel/Scuba: My husband and I are experienced at scuba/snorkel. Did a snorkel trip with Scuba Caribe but the spot they took us to was pretty lame. Also, people were rude in the water, butts and fins all over and lots of pushing. Wanted to scuba but after that we were pretty disappointed. Didn't want to spend a lot of money to be taken on a weak dive. Thought we'd try a single tank dive with Barracuda but the water was too rough, no dive boats. I need to research this area more. Food & Drink: Great food! No limit on # of times per week you can eat at the a la carte restaurants as noted at some resorts. Even in the States, eating every meal out for a whole week, you're bound to get at least one bad meal. We did not have a bad meal but the braised beef at Ventanas was slightly tough. Pork ribs at Spices very tender but the barbecue sauce a bit too sweet for my taste but steak fajitas were very good. Favorite restaurants, Palazzo and The Grill. The lamb and pork scallopine at Palazzo were incredible. The Grill had great tuna. Try as many soups as you can, wonderful! Bkfst buffet at Spices fresh, lots of variety. Ventanas has an a la carte bkfst. Wed and Sun are the buffet dinner shows but we ate a la carte. Snack Bar had great spinach and Mediterranean salads, sandwiches, gazpacho, etc. Husband still raves about the chix breast with mixed veggies lunch he had at Spices one day. Remember the dress code for dinner. Sandals and a cover up are fine for other meals. Do not need a cover up/sandals at the tables by the pool. Fruits, veggies and lean chix and fish choices made it possible to eat healthy but the wonderful dinners and desserts make up for that! Top-shelf liquor for drinks. Medelo Light and Bud Light, not sure of other beer choices, tried to watch calories where we could. Champagne was tasty. Coffee is full bodied and not bitter. Bars and lounges available for pre and post dinner drinks as well as a cigar lounge. Many good cigar shops in Playa del Carmen. Afternoons the sax player plays by the pool and a cart of fresh fruit and scented towels come around to refresh you. Had a yummy pool area lunch concoction one day with beef and chix strips, squid, mussels, shrimp, prawns, veggies and rice served with sangria. A pool craft session with chocolate, white chocolate and strawberries was fun. We decorated our plates and strawberries then enjoyed eating them! At tea time, the gentle breeze, champagne with strawberries and sax player made it very romantic and relaxing. Even my husband commented on how nice it was. You don't have to get dressed up for this so go and enjoy. Room: 2928 on 2nd of 3 floors, garden view. Considered switching rooms d/t side nearest loud resort but being tired didn't notice the noise much and it stopped by 11-11:30 pm anyway. Not much noise from the room above either. Enjoyed the privacy of our balcony. The walkway below was used by people coming to our villa. Many rooms in some of the more requested villas had balconies or patios in full view of main walkways so we chose to stay put. We were close to one of the three relaxation pools, very private and had a nice hot tub. Roy, our concierge, was friendly and helpful and kept our mini-fridge stocked. No refill fee if you wanted your fridge stocked more often or with more of a certain beverage as noted at some resorts. We drink so much water, this alone would have cost us a small fortune. No alcohol in the fridge but if we wanted a drink or food, room service was quick and accurate. Rented 2 DVD's and brought our own CD's. Bed was perfect for us but you can get a mattress pad if it's too hard for you. Shower had excellent pressure! Don't obsess before your trip like I did on which room or villa you'll get. If you really dislike your room, see if you can be switched. Otherwise, relax and enjoy you're not in your room much anyway. Spa Area: Had 2 couples massages in the couples' room, very nice! Beach massage area is near the beach beds and didn't seem private or quiet enough to pay the extra $$. If you don't do a spa treatment, go enjoy the serene area, great sauna and steam room with lockers, robes, slippers and showers with toiletries ready to use at no charge. My husband loved the steam room. Spa pool is private and little used. Workout area had 3 treadmills, 2 recumbent bikes and a weight room. The coldest bottled water is in the little fridge in the workout room. Trouble with the treadmills or an error on the screen, flip the power switch by the motor off then on, or ask the girls at the spa desk, they will help you. Shopping: A small shopping plaza is across the street from the resort and to the left. Playa del Carmen is a $4 cab ride one way, 20 minute walk or quick bike ride. Going into PDC, bikes are encouraged to use the sidewalk on the left side of the road and pedestrians the right. Once in PDC, the bike path switches to the right side nearest the road. You'll encounter two-way bike traffic and pedestrians who sometimes walk on the bike path. No bikes allowed in the market area on 5th Ave but RH gives you a lock. Bike racks are on the side roads off the main drag. Barter when a shop is not busy. Obviously, can't barter at the high-end shops or convenience stores. Noticed the women shopkeepers would not barter. Look for the 92.5 stamp on silver pieces. $$ are widely accepted and majority of places give you change in $$ if you ask. Also fun to walk down the street with a to-go beer that sold for as low as $1. Internet: Internet area near spa has 4 computers. Never had to wait long to get on. More convenient way to check on our 2 year-old back home. It was also free so we decided against buying a phone card in Mexico. We left the phone # of the resort in case of an emergency. Don't call direct, collect or use you credit/calling card, $$$. Service: Leanne in Customer Service, very helpful and professional. We made our dinner reservations ahead of time with her through e-mail. Book at least your first few days of dinner reservations ahead of time. Twice daily maid service with turn down was great. Towels plentiful in the room and at the pool. No need to worry about towel rations or being charged for a lost beach towel here. Robes also standard in your room. All service staff are friendly and hardworking. We tipped according to suggestions mentioned on this web site, don't forget your concierge. Apple Vacations: Several BAD stories re: Apple Reps at some resorts not helpful if problems arose and also some questionable Apple resort ratings. Our 6 am flight to Cancun was 4 hours late leaving and 200+ people lost a half day vacation! Our first time using Apple in a long time. More frequent Apple customers had similar complaints from other trips and voiced they will think twice before using Apple again. The in-flight meals, airport transfers, park'n fly voucher and return flight were fine. Luckily, we had no problems at our resort but we hope Apple will work on some of these very important issues as they do offer nice package deals. Side Notes: At the airport, get out those front doors and away from the entrance to find your ride! People tried to trip us up inside the airport by saying 'Apple' to us. Also, we were at RH the same time as 2 business groups and a wedding party. Luckily, we didn't encounter any obnoxious, drunken behavior and the resort never seemed full even though they were booked. Ladies may want to bring a wrap for evenings, it can get cool. Also got a chance to use a little German, French, Polish and, of course, Spanish on this trip. Met some very nice Polish-Americans and talked about our shared heritage. Hello to the Canucks and Long Islanders we met too! Don't like going to the same place twice but this is an exception. No worries choosing this spot, now go and enjoy : ) All the best, Renee and Jim", "Date": "January 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tulsa, OK", "Title": "\u201cA real \"Royal Hideaway\"\u201d", "Author": "sar303", "ReviewID": "UR3090409", "Content": "My husband and I were there for our honeymoon last May.

We have stayed all over the Carribean and were looking for a new vacation resort when our travel agent insisted that we stay at the Royal Hideaway in Riviera Maya, Mexico. Neither my wife or I ever had ambitions of staying in Mexico however decided to give it a try. We stayed in a luxury suite which is standard at the resort in a first floor suite. The room was magnificent compared to the suites at Sandals (our usual resort). The resort was beautiful with lush gardens, small rivers, and little bridges along the walkways. The design of the resort was incredible and absolutely breathtaking. The food was excellent at all of the restuarants. The Grill and the Italian Restuarant are the best! Be sure to e-mail guest services prior to arriving so that you can set up reservations because they book fast. We stayed in building #25 and had Monique as our conciere. Monique is the absolute best conciere I ever had. She was very friendly and always worked extra hours so that you were satisfied. Request building #25 if you can. Monique will make your stay extra special. The staff here is super friendly however, many don't speak english well which can cause a problem at times because they say, \"Si, Si, senor\", to anything whether they understand you or not. We had Olympus transfer us to and from the hotel and airport. They stink. As soon as you arrive at the hotel they badger you to meet them right away, explaining that they need to set up your return transer to yhe airport. When you arrive to meet them they only want to sell you tours around the island. Your conciere can take care of your trip back to the airport. The beach was pretty much washed away over the past month so there really isn't a beach. Big issue with us but plenty of places to lay out right now. The water is still beautiful. We had a big problem at Ventanas Restuarant on the morning of our flight out. We sat for our final meal and waited 30 minutes before our order was taken. People who came in after us we already eating so I waived down Gabriella the hostess who quickly got another waiter. Our orders were taken and we waited another 20 minutes before our food arrives and it was completely wrong. I waived down the hostess Gabriella again and she said she would take care of it. They took the food away and I explained that we had to leave for the airport in 15 minutes. Our food finally arrived five minutes later and it was still wrong. They brought us the same thing out again. We had to leave without eating, sitting in the stupid restuarant for over an hour. I went to the main desk to complain and the girl there whose name was Gabriell didn't want to hear the complaint. She told me to fill out the hotel survey and put my opinion there. I was really pissed off. Who ever heard of this type of guest relations. They wanted nothing to do with a complaint. I asked to see the manager and they refused to get a manager. Unbelievable. This is an excellent resort! But they know very little about problem solving and don't want to hear your complaints. They don't know how to handle problems. So, as long as all goes well, you will have a great time. If you have a problem good luck getting resolution. I was sold as this being my every year choice of vacation untill I had to deal with the breakfast problem and management. I'm sure there is no record of our complaint.", "Date": "January 20, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Champaign, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cRoyal Hideaway, our second visit\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3007214", "Content": "My wife and I made a return visit to Royal Hideaway in December of 2004, having also been there in December 2003. I am pleased to day that we liked it even more on our second visit. Our Travel Agent, Jason Shumaker recommended Royal Hideaway to us in 2003. We live in Champaign, Illinois; where my wife Jenny is a university administrator and I am a part-time pilot and flight instructor. We arrived on a Monday at the Cancun Airport and passed quickly through Mexican customs and immigration. Since we had been to Cancun before, we knew where to proceed for our ground transportation. But, please beware that both inside and outside of the terminal, there are many very aggressive locals who will try to convince you that they are the ones who have been sent to pick you up. Ignore them, as all they are trying to do is sell time shares, and some of them may be in uniform and might suggest that if you do not comply with their demands, you will be in legal trouble. Your travel agent should advise you exactly who you should be looking for, and tell you where they will be stationed. After an hour long van ride, we were dropped off at the Royal Hideaway. Check-in was quick, efficient and friendly, and they served cookies and champagne while we were waiting. Our room this time was 2515, which is in the center of the complex, near the main entrance. Our room was very nice and we had a king size bed. Each unit has its own concierge and ours was Monique, who was very friendly and helpful. Our room had a walk-in shower, double sinks, plush robes and a Jacuzzi tub. We also had a refrigerator, which they keep stocked with soft drinks and water. They also had a cold bottle of champagne waiting for us. The first evening we ate at the Grille and feasted on steak and shrimp kabob. We were up early on Tuesday to eat breakfast and to claim our beach chairs. Even though the signs and literature suggest that chairs cannot be reserved, everybody does it anyway. We did note that the beach was suffering from some erosion since our visit last year, and some of the palm trees had fallen into the surf. Several of the adjacent resorts also had this problem and the Royal Hideaway manager, Jean Agarrista, was very concerned about the erosion. He told us that a new cruise ship dock built at Playa Del Carmen, not yet in use, might have caused some changes in the wave patterns. They are attempting to stop the erosion with sandbags, with little apparent success. We lunched at the beach snack bar and spent the day sunning, resting and reading. Dinner that evening was a buffet at the only show that we attended during the week. We met new friends from Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The buffet was good and the show featured dancers and an amazing rope twirling act. On Wednesday we had breakfast at Ventanas, and Jenny pronounced it her best breakfast ever. We had a reservation to Para-Sail that morning but the water was too rough, so relaxed on the beach and also on the porch of our room all day. At lunch we met new friends who lived in my adopted home town of Lawrence, Kansas. We ate dinner at Ventanas and met more new friends from Canada. On Thursday we walked the beach again and finally took our Para Sail ride, which was very nice. We ferried to the boat via Jet Ski from our beach and our tandem ride lasted about 20 minutes, which was quite adequate. We were at the end of a line about 600 feet long and it was very quiet and peaceful. Your editor, a grizzled old veteran pilot, did not even get airsick! Friday was New Years eve, which we celebrated with an early breakfast at Jenny's now favorite breakfast place, Ventanas, where she enjoyed the Huevos Rancheros. Too windy to sit on the beach, so we relaxed on our porch. Later in the morning we walked to Playa Del Carman, about a 20 minute walk through a very nice residential area. Playa Del Carmen is a typical tourist trap, with lots of vendors selling their authentic Mexican wares, which are made in Hong Kong. We stopped for a drink at our favorite bar, Senor Frogs, and walked back to the Royal Hideaway. We lunched at the Snack Bar and spent a rainy afternoon in our room and on our porch. We had drinks and dinner with our Canadian friends and paid a brief visit to the New Year's Eve show. There were some planned events for the evening, but we crashed early and left the celebrating to the younger and more energetic guests. Saturday was once again a beach day, and as we were setting up our chairs and cabana, we heard a University of Illinois cheer leading call from the restaurant. We looked but could not see who it was, and we heard the call again. Jenny answered the call, and we walked back to the building to meet our fellow Illini sports fans, and it turned out to be the owner of our local bank and his wife, and another bank officer and his wife. They had spotted our Illinois shirts as we walked to the beach, so we had a mini-alumni and fan reunion right on the spot. We relaxed on the beach most of the day and met more new friends from Wales. We joined our Canadian friends at dinner that night in the Asian Resturant Azia, which featured a sunken table and wonderful service and food. On Sunday, which sadly was our last day at Royal Hideaway, we spent the day by the pool, as the beach was once again too windy. Jenny lead the winning water volleyball team and we had lunch at the snack bar. We visited a small shopping center which was across the street from the Royal Hideaway and also the RH gift shop to pick up some items to bring back home. We ate our farewell dinner with our Canadian friends at the Grille. We got up on Monday and packed for our trip home. The van picked us up at 10:45 as promised and we drove to the Cancun airport to catch our flight back to the frozen Midwest. It turned out that our flight was overbooked and we volunteered to be bumped and got to spend another day in Mexico, this time at the Cancun Westin at the expense of American Airlines. All in all we were very pleased with our second visit to the Royal Hideaway. We considered the price to be worth it. My wife loves the idea of not having to carry any cash or receiving a bill that you get at the end of a cruise. Even though tips are included, we took along some $1 bills and tipped a bit for exceptional service. I think the daily wage in that area is about $10, so anything you give is greatly appreciated. $50 in singles will get you thru the whole week. Tip guidlines: breakfast $1-2, lunch $2-3, dinner $3-5. We highly recommend the Royal Hideaway. The food is excellent and the staff is outstanding and we are already planning our next visit in December of 2005.

Even the snackbar food offered at the beach/pool is great. The staff is so friendly. A dollar or 2 tip goes a long way. These people work very hard. We had a good time with a couple of staff members each day that we saw regulary at the pool. These folks are working their job just as we would back home...be friendly in return. I only mention this because I have seen people act so demanding like the staff are just mere servants and below them. Learn a few Spanish words/phrases if you can. You will find that if you attempt to speak their language they will answer you back in English. Ok....some things not to miss and some hints; 1). Make your dinner reservations before you go. We did and was well worth it. got the times we wanted. 2). Definitely go for some kind of spa treatment. It is awesome. 3). Attend afternoon tea/champagne 4-6pm a couple of times. Very nice treat. 4). Went to Dolphin Discovery in Puerto Adventuras. Did the Royal swim. This was so much fun and quite an experience. 5). Dinner dress...Men: Collared shirt, pants, shoes...Women: Sun dresses, capris, nice blouse, dress sandals. I did not see any women wearing shorts. Also, the evening can get a little cool sometimes. You may want to bring some sort of coverup. 6). Weather most days during our stay 12/26 - 1/3: Sunny warm until about 2-3pm...then some clouds...sprinkles or rain...sometime monsoon like...then clear out by 7pm or so and breezy and nice for dinner. The rain did not bother us because by then you had enough sun. We would just move to the hot tub and have drinks there. 7). If you want to reserve a bed on the beach...plan on getting out there by 6:30am 8). Lounge chairs around main pools with the cushions are a favorite as well. Get out there by 8am to get one. 9).

Almost everything written was 100% accurate. I was at RH with my wife and in-laws from 12/11 \u2013 12/18 and had a phenomenal time. It was definitely paradise! The staff went out of their way to make our stay memorable. We were in villa 30- and although the neighboring hotel was a bit loud \u2013 we were so tired from all of the activities during the day that it didn\u2019t bother us. It was about 2/3 of the way between the lobby building (which contained the gym, spa, business center, Palazzo, & Ventanas) and the ocean. A few notes: 1) If you play tennis, bring your racket and make sure you have white-soled shoes. If you don\u2019t you will have to wear the sneakers provided by the hotel. Leo, the tennis pro is a very nice guy. He makes up some fun games for the intermediate tennis class from 8-9am. I would recommend it. 2) Palazzo was our favorite restaurant \u2013 I would recommend it highly. The chowder, mushroom pasta, and stuffed chicken were our favorites. 3) Unless you are really into seeing shows, I would not go to the dinner theatre on Sunday night \u2013 food & show were just OK. 4) I would go to the Wednesday night Mexican dinner show. That was a lot of fun \u2013 especially the rope guy. The food was excellent and plenty of it. 5) Service from the staff was above expectations. Everyone tried to make our vacation extra special. The waiters around the pool and ocean came by constantly to check if you wanted any drinks \u2013 and sometimes just brought you a new drink if yours was half-empty. They almost seemed sad if you said you did not want a drink. 6) Mixed drinks are very strong \u2013 unlike some other AIs which skimp on the alcohol. 7) The hot tubs aren\u2019t super hot, although they say it is 104F. I would recommend jumping in the pool prior to going in the hot tub to make the tub seem hotter. 8) Take the bikes out for a ride around Playa Del Carmen \u2013 it was a lot of fun to see all of the construction going on. 9) Try the white chocolate mousse at Spices for dessert. 10) Try sitting by the pool\u2014 the chairs are VERY comfortable (more than the chairs at the beach) with a wonderful view of the ocean. 11) Quesidillas at the Grill were excellent as was the fried calamari and onion rings. 12) Breakfast was superb \u2013 we went to the buffet everyday and there was so much selection and the quality was super as well. I would highly recommend the french toast and omelets. 13) The ocean quality and temp was awesome \u2013 the most beautiful turquoise color and temp about 78F (In December!) 14) Beach volleyball was a lot of fun and GREAT exercise. The staff played if you need people \u2013 but watch out \u2013 they are very good, especially Luiz. You can\u2019t go wrong going to this place.

My husband and I just got back from celebrating our 50th birthdays there and we both said we couldn't have chosen a better spot. Talk about pampering! The only downside is that I now have 4 pounds to lose and it's Christmastime. It was worth it, though (at least that's my exercise mantra). We arrived there on Sunday evening (December 12) and sat outside at the Allegria bar to have our first drink. When our waiter heard it was our first night there, he said \"Welcome home\", and that's the attitude of every staff member. As everyone else has said, they go out of their way to make sure you are looked after. And, as so many others have also said, you really do want to tip these hard-working people - I'm sure the service would have been every bit as good if we hadn't though. The Grill is absolutely magical in the evenings when it's transformed into an elegant open air dining area. The beef tenderloin was incredible. I wish we could have eaten there more than once but we wanted to try every restaurant as well go to the Mexican night at the Club Royale. I was so impressed with the quality and presentation of the food in each of the restaurants - the soups were fantastic and I think over the course of the week we tried about 8 different ones, from lobster bisque to the wonderful tortilla soup in Spices. I spent part of my birthday just floating on one of the yellow floats in a relaxation pool - no one else there, just the two of us - with champagne and orange juice for me and Corona for my husband. You really feel like you're in paradise as you look around at the architecture and the lush vegetation. The palm trees' trunks are decorated with little white lights for Christmas and they reflect into all of the waterways - the piano bar is decorated with poinsettias which look gorgeous against the soft green of the chairs. I really can't say enough about this place. We've never gone back to the same resort twice since we really like to see new places, but we'll have to make an exception for this one.

We recently returned from a week in Playa in early November for our one-year wedding anniversary. We spent the first three nights at the El Dorado Seaside Suites (formerly the El Dorado Resort and Spa out side of Tulum--not to be confused with the El Dorado ROYALE) and the next four at the Royal Hideaway. Our Champion Air flight from DFW was pleasantly uneventful. We lucked out (which I would venture to guess had something to do with the 2:30 p.m. departure) and there was virtually no line at customs in Mexico. This was our first visit, but other couples informed us this was unheard of in prior trips. We booked our private, A/C van transport through playadelcarmeninfo ----- for $70. It was nice to breeze through all the sales people and tour buses, just looking for the sign with our name on it... Especially given that our first resort was an hour car ride from the airport. The driver was soooo friendly and we were at ease immediately. The last day of our stay at the first hotel was spent on a tour of Tulum ruins and the centoes. We booked this through playadelcarmeninfo ----- and Jeff was awesome. It was so nice to be on a tour with only 8 people total. What a change from the masses on the tour busses we heard about from other hotel guests!! We got to the ruins about 8:45 a.m. and were the first group to arrive that day. It was nice to get photos without scores of people in them. By the time we left a few hours later, it was a zoo! The cenotes and private beach we went to were awesome as well!! On to the Royal Hideaway. Wow. It was breathtaking. The architecture was absolutely beautiful. Service was really good\u2026the food was a welcome respite after our experience at the previous hotel. I am still drooling over the fresh calamari!! Yum\u2026 Where to start\u2026we left the El Dorado Seaside Suites at about 11:30, so we arrived at the Royal Hideaway about 12:30 p.m. Of course, our room wasn\u2019t ready yet (not surprising, given our early arrival), so we went to eat at the Snack Bar. Oh my gosh, my husband got annoyed that I wanted to eat lunch there every day after that\u2026we actually saw quite a few of the same couples at lunch\u2014so I know we weren\u2019t the only ones with that idea (smile). The beach is beautiful (albeit much more crowded than the serene beach at El Dorado Seaside Suites). The beach beds, which look so inviting, have to be reserved at the crack of dawn\u20145:30 a.m. It didn't really bother us, since we had the same at the EDSS, but some of the guests were really irritated by this fact. As far as the main complaint I've read about: The only time I noticed any gasoline smells (from Barracuda) was the afternoon I went out to read by the beach about 4:30 p.m. The only chairs not taken were over by the dive shop, and I could smell gasoline as the jet-skiers came in and they were gassing them up. We were assigned villa 3019. I got two of the three requests I made (king bed and close to the beach). Those were the most important (to us)\u2014top floor being the only request we didn\u2019t get. Now, I would NOT request this particular room if you will be annoyed by a view from your balcony of the wall to neighboring resort (for the record, we never heard any noise at night). However, we had just come from a beach-front room and weren\u2019t planning to spend much time in the room at this resort. Also, we booked our room on travel-center (.com) and based upon about 3-4 months of research, I know we got a much better deal than most of the people there. However, I think we made up for that by tipping ($1-3) every chance we got. The people there work so hard, it seemed so rude to us that some vacationers wouldn\u2019t leave a tip\u2014even after a nice meal (lunch and breakfast included) or drinks brought to your room. Ventanas\u2014the international restaurant\u2014this was my husband\u2019s favorite. We ended changing our reservations (yes, I would recommend making at least the first few days in advance unless you want to eat very early or late) for the last night to eat here again. We had salmon, Cornish game hen, cr\u00e8me brulee and lots of other goodies. Azia was under construction during our stay (sad about that!), but they had a few of the appetizers/entrees from Azia available on a separate menu at Ventanas. You were allowed to mix and match if you desired. F/X, I ate sushi the second night at Ventanas for my appetizer. Palazzo\u2014 We ate here the very first night, were lucky enough to get an outside table\u2026I would highly recommend this, it was great--enjoying the view and the twinkling light of Cozymel in the distance. I don\u2019t remember exactly what we had, but I ordered a pasta dish similar to fisherman\u2019s stew or cioppino. We enjoyed the meal, and even more so a glass of port wine afterwards. Spices\u2014Juan was excellent! Ask for him if you can. This was our least favorite of the restaurants (but that\u2019s like saying Maui is your least favorite Hawaiian island). I don\u2019t think we\u2019re even comparing apples to apples with any other Mexican AI resorts. The tortilla soup was good\u2026 Snack Bar\u2014Unfortunately, the grill was booked every night, so we didn\u2019t get to try it (being from Texas, our \u2018steak\u2019 expectations might\u2019ve been too high anyway). However, as I mentioned previously, I could\u2019ve happily eaten a double-order of calamari for lunch each day. The sandwiches and hamburgers were excellent. I didn\u2019t think the ceviche was as good as it was rumored to be on these sites, but maybe we caught them on an off day. Everything else we ate at the snack bar was PERFECT!! The bars were great, all top-shelf beverages. And the wine list was very reasonable compared to what you\u2019d pay in a restaurant in the States. The service at this resort lived up to its high standards. Now, there was a few occasions where we were left waiting a long time for a drink or course during our meal. But, overall, they really went above and beyond. Adrian at the Snack Bar seemed to remember us from the first day and took care of us every time. Also, one day (the one lunch we DIDN\u2019T eat at the snack bar), I wanted some of that addictive calamari. I called room service to see if they could deliver some. They said no, they didn\u2019t have it, so I just walked on down to the Snack Bar/Bar area (one building over). When I got there, I asked if I could get an order to-go and they told me I could call room service for that. I didn\u2019t want to get anyone in trouble, but mentioned that they\u2019d already told me it wasn't available. The manager happened to be standing there\u2014he was so kind and actually sent a waiter from the SB over to our room within about 10 minutes (he also called to let us know when it was on the way). We tipped both generously. Now that\u2019s customer service. And that kind of service will keep people coming back. Yes, we are ready to go back and already planning a shorter trip with friends for next year. This resort is an excellent value for your dollar. After spending our honeymoon at Cap Juluca in Anguilla, BWI, we would pick Royal Hideaway over the two. The service at the RH was second-to-none and one of the Playa beaches we visited on the snorkeling tour was a dead-wringer for Maundy\u2019s Bay in Anguilla. It wouldn't be worth the long flights/layovers/expense for us to choose Anguilla over Mexico. As clich\u00e9 as it sounds, I would give this place a 10 out of 10. Perfect! If you are on the fence, book it. You won\u2019t be disappointed. Before our trip, I read every review I could find, and I appreciated all of them.

Also the food can be somewhat bland, but still good. If looking for spicey mexican food, make sure you ask your server to have them spice it up. Our one down side this visit was that there was a larger business group there that did become some what annoying. The great thing we loved about the RH was the small resort atmosphere with peace and quiet.

We have traveled quite a bit as a couple, and this was by far the best trip we have ever had. Of course it helps when you have a stunning man like him along for the ride. The RH did not skimp on anything... the service, food, cleanliness were all impecable. As another reviewer mentioned, Jorge was the best at the beach! every day we sat in the same area at the beach and gave him a tip ($5) and he was ALWAYS around... drinks all day- food too if you'd like. The best part of the beach (other than the service) was the \"beach bed\"... it was glorious to spend a day napping comfortably on the beach, feeling like a queen. But get up early, my husband was out there at 6 a.m. to secure a spot! The only complaint I have are the beds-in the room! The bed was as hard as a rock - if you like it firm, you're in luck! If you're a feather bed lover, bring it with you... I'm not kidding. I felt like I was sleeping on a concrete floor. We did talk to our concierge and they arranged housekeeping to add \"padding\" to the bed. This seemed like a pretty frequent request, so don't be afraid to ask for it if your bed is terrible. Also, don't worry about booking an \"ocean view\" as there are no real views of the ocean from the rooms, except the Presidential Suite, and even that building isn't \"on\" the beach. The activities group did a great job keeping us entertained. Each night after our fabulous dinner, we would go to the bar to see what was going on... Karaoke, music trivia, dancing, poker... you name it, we did it. The other guests were also very friendly and having a great time. It was nice to be surrounded by other honeymooners... somehow it made the atmosphere extra special.

They check two couples in and let them go and then came to us and said that our room was still being cleaned and offered us another room that was closer to the beach and the main pool, if we wouldn't mind waiting an hour to finish up cleaning that one, we took it. So we ate lunch by the pool - the fried cheese and guacemole are what we lived on through out the week, it was great!

I couldn't have asked for a better time and a better place! Once we arrived in Cancun we had no problems getting out of the airport and easily found our transportation guide waiting outside for us and weeding through all the time share people. We rode to Playa Del Carmen in a van with 4 other couples. The first couple was dropped off at the Secrets resort, and thanked my lucky stars I didn't stay there. We were the next people dropped off, and the other couples were commenting on how gorgeous the resort looked and seemed to be a little jealous. We were then greeted with a glass of champaigne and checked in which was painless. We stayed on the first floor on Villa 26 with a garden view room which is the second building from the beach. Personally, I didn't think that the ocean view rooms are worth it because there is no building that is right on the beach and the garden view rooms were shielded from the outside noise of the resorts to the right and left of RH. We were extremely happy with our room. Our concierge's name was Luz, and she was extremely nice and helpful to us (One night she sewed a button on my wife's dress that had come off for us). We then made our dinner plans for the week with her. We didn't make them before we came but had no problems getting a decent time for dinner. Basically the entire time we stayed on the beach because we prefer that over the pool regardless of where we are. The beach was less crowded than the pool was but the pool still wasn't that bad. I wasn't used to seeing topless people walking up and down the beach but after a day or two you get used to it (I think you're also required to be old and ugly in order to take your top off). :-) Jorge served us drinks all but one day that we were there and was awesome (If you sit closer to the bar area on the beach you get better service). We rarely ever had to get up and get our own and usually had one or two already there before we had finished the drink in our hand. Also, you tend to get drinks faster when you tip. You don't have to tip much, but a dollar or two every couple of hours helps and they deserve it. I don't think I've ever drank that many days in a row before and we got drunk almost every single day! Also, every speaks decent English there. We only ran into 1 person who couldn't speak English but he was only the beach chair guy so it was ok. The food was ok. Our favorite was the The Grill, which is where we ate the last night we were there. Their breakfast buffet was awesome! We made it a point to eat there every morning. They had a show at Club Royale on Wednesday night that we stayed for a little while but left early.

We canceled dinner reservations on our last night just to stay on them a little longer. (Tip1) this is a no-stress environment, chill. There are some guests who will spend much of their time getting up early to pick out the \"best chairs\" by the pool or the coveted new beds on the beach. I was one of those skulking women in the morning until I realized every chair is a good chair. The open bar is just three steps away...The resort is small. You can still show up at 10 AM and find a great spot...and if you are too lazy to get up, the pool-side service is very good. Slip the staff 5 bucks, or 10, and you will have a friend for life. (Tip2) Book your dinner reservations before you go. If you are not sure, which restaurant to go to...They are all excellent. If the portions are too small for your Outback-sized appetite or you can't decide between two items, order both. We did. They are more than happy to accommodate. The golf is great.

Ventanas was very good-try the vanilla creme brulee...yummy. We also went to Ventanas on most mornings for their a al carte breakfast. Not many people seem to go here but we enjoyed it. Guess everyone does the buffet at Spices for breakfast. Lots of fruit, pastry,eggs, salmon and an omelet chef at Spices. Service at Ventanas for breakfast was excellent and we almost had the place to ourselves. They serve all the usual breakfast items and we tried almost everything-all good. We were disappointed that the Asian restaurant Azia was closed due to renovations. Looks like it might be closed for quite a while. After our dinners we would venture to the Allegria Bar and sit outside under the stars with our drinks. On 2 nights they had a woman musician playing the flute, sax and guitar. She was terrific.On other evenings at Allegria they had Karaoke and Casino Nights. We did go to the Dinner Theater on Sunday night. It's fairly entertaining with mediocre food. Chilly...ladies bring a shawl or wrap. We skipped the Wed. night show. The pool /beach area was nice. Lots of chairs (elbow to elbow). We were taken back by how busy the beach was-non stop people traffic and jet skis etc. Also it was soooo windy not many people could go into the ocean-there were red danger flags posted almost every day. We thought we'd try the pool- it was a little chilly. No wonder so few people were in it!! We did walk the beach each day to check out the other resorts and RH is heads above the rest. Because of the rough surf some of the hotels have lost most of their beach. My husband especially liked walking to the right of RH where many European women were topless. The bar service on the beach was terrific. Pedro ran his butt off with trays of drinks for everyone. We did what all the reviewers suggested and brought $100 in singles and tipped our servers. They work sooo hard trying to make our vacations special! The relaxtion pools are tucked away in beautiful spots and shouldn't be missed. The jacuzzis are NOT heated...you have to ask your Concierge to call Maintenance to turn the heater on for the jacuzzi. Then it warms up to about 88. Nice... when it's dark and the lights are turned on and you're sipping champagne. Calgon, take me away! Had lunch each day by the pool and loved the chips with salsa and guacamole. The burgers are large and pretty good. Onion rings were some of the best we've ever had. Chicken fingers crispy but good. Tried the beef quesadilla-good but not much beef. Everything we tried was decent for lunch. They did have a few out door barbecues on 3 days and on one day they did several kinds of pastas with various sauces. Plenty of variety for everyone. Did see a waiter walking around the pool at about 3 PM with fresh fruit on a cart. Nice touch. We ventured over to Cozumel for a few hours just to say we saw it and were glad to get back to RH. There were 6 cruise ships in port-yikes! Ferry ride over was also rockin' and rollin'. Never did any tours to Xel-Ha or Xcaret. Heard good things about Xel-Ha though. The Royal Hideaway is a feast for the eyes and stomach. We loved the layout of the hotel with its many lagoons, marble, foliage etc. The staff is incredible. They are attentive, friendly and professional. After being there for 4 days the bellman still remembered my husband's name! It was one of the most elegant resorts we've been to so far. The week flew and I'm still reminiscing about each day and how we spent it. Would we return? Honestly not sure...If we want first class service, food and hotel -yes. But if we want to walk a deserted, private beach, and watch the sunset with just the 2 of us...no we wouldn't return. It just depends on which type of vacation we need at the time! We loved Royal Hideaway and we'd recommend it to anyone- just wish we could pick it up and drop it on to a deserted island.", "Date": "November 28, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "canada", "Title": "\u201cWonderful in every way!!\u201d", "Author": "pcchefgirl", "ReviewID": "UR2850438", "Content": "This is hard to write in that basically it all has been said before, so at the risk of being redundantly redundant, this place is the BEST!!

From the seamless ckeck-in to the everyday incredible service, it was truly a vacation to remember. We had SO much fun; the staff is great and makes you feel like you are special from the early morning greetings when you left your villa in the morning ( Thanks Marilu - you are so sweet and your English is great!) to the dining and pool staff, ( Eddie you kept us well hydrated:)!!) and the incredible activities people ( Alex, Emma, Bashur, and Luis in particular!) everything about the RH was first class. My husband really enjoyed the tennis instruction and said that Leo did a first rate job. Because the resort is relatively small in size you actually got to meet other people and connect with them, and this certainly added to our enjoyment - you never felt that you were just an anonymous face in a sea of vacationers. The grounds and beach are incredible, and most so at twilight when the lights are twinkling and you truly feel like you are in a dreamworld. The food is fantastic, (we enjoyed every restaurant but for sheer ambience at night you really couldn't beat The Grill!), so much so that one member of our group, (who truly embraced the AI concept), gained 8 lbs. in one week! We have never been anywhere previously where before we had even left we were all already scheming for ways that we could return, and soon!! If you are looking for a truly relaxing, one of a kind vacation with just the right mix of nothing to do and fun activities should you so choose, look no further.

We spent our honeymoon here the week of 11/7-11/14 and have been bragging about this place every chance we get. All the other reviews do a good job of summing up how fantastic this place is so I'll try and add some new info. Do get to the pool/beach early - people seem to ignore the rule about not saving chairs and they did run out of towels during the busy time of the week (Wed-Sun when the large group showed up). They also have only a few pool floats. We found the beach to be quieter than the pool area (the cabanas are a life saver from the scorching sun!!!) They do activites in the afternoon at the pool that can get noisy, but they are not annoying. The bingo game is quite popular. They even had a saxaphone player walking around the pool one day! (The employee dance at 3:45 is hokey and lame - especially after you've seen it 3 times! That goofy song is still running through my head) I also wish they had a drink menu available at the pool area - I saw one one day, then it disappeared and the staff claimed they didn't have one. So, we probably missed out on a few good drinks - but the dirty monkey was good! I also wished they served drinks to the pool/beach earlier - I don't think they start until 11am. Not that I wanted to drink alcohol at 10am, but ice water would be nice since it is so hot and you've already been at the pool for 2 hours). So remember to bring along your bottled water from your room. The spa was nice - we've been to one of the top spas in the world, so that altered our view a bit. But they do a nice job - we had a deep tissue massage which was good. I also had a manicure - not as great and the language barrier was problematic in explaining what I wanted. But they really try hard to meet all your expectations (as they do throughout the entire resort) so I can't complain. We did take advantage of the steam/sauna rooms (which you can use at any time during spa hours) as well as the fitness center (which had treadmills, life cycles, free weights and nautulis equipment) that can provide you with a well-rounded work out. The Room Service menu (available 24/7) is limited but we ordered breakfast often and they arrive with your food in 10 minutes - that's never happened anywhere I've ever been! It was nice to sit on our patio and have a quiet breakfast together and look out over the beautiful grounds. Our concierge (Miss Monica - Villa 23) was a sweetheart and the housekeeping staff was the best. We came back from dinner one night to have our bath tub filled with rose petals! We didn't have any issues making dinner reservations, which we did upon arrival. We wern't that picky about our times - we were on vacation - who cares - I don't have to go to work the next day!! As others have mentioned, tipping is not required, but we did tip a lot - the staff works so hard (I think they only get 1 day a week off) and they really do appreciate it! If you're going for your honeymoon - enjoy your wedding day and don't worry about your trip here - you made an excellent choice. This hotel is apparently rated the top hotel in Playa del Carmen and now we know why! ENJOY!!!!!!! On a separate note from this resort - avoid the land sharks at the Cancun airport. After you pass through customs and head towards the transportation to the hotel, they approach you as a helpful visitor information center off to your right. Ultimately, you will find them trying to get you to commit to spend a day at this \"new\" resort with promises of free passes for local excursions - it is all a time share hard sell.

We did a lot of research & based our decision to stay here on the amount of positive reviews on this site, & boy, we weren't disapointed!! You're treated royally from the time you arrive. Beginning with Iran, the bellboy, who always had a smile & was very pleasant to talk with. The check in process is very welcoming, even though we knew about the champagne & scented towels, it was still a surprise to actually experience it. The grounds are imacutely kept & the accomodations are very comfortable. We stayed in Villa 23, a pool view (request not to be placed in the back, you'll be looking @ the balcony's for the neighboring resort), which was nice & quiet. I would suggest requesting Villas 23, 25 or 26, these are centrally located & very quiet. Do not get a Villa along the right of the resort, they sit next to the neighboring resort, which is quite loud starting late morning 'til late into the evening. The room ammenities are quite nice, evening turn down service, stocked 'fridge with water & soda's, plush spa robes, in-room safe, lush bath towels, DVD & CD players & private balcony's. Do yourself a favor & hide the scale! Also, if you have a special occasion, be sure to mention it when you make your reservations & when you arrive tell your concergie, they go out of their way to make the day special for you. We made our dinner reservations before arriving & got everything we requested. We decided to make changes after we were there & all but 1 was granted. The food is EXCELLENT! We did not have any bad meals! Everything is presented so artistically. We were pleasantly surprised by the quality we received. Usually when you stay in an \"all inclusive\" the food suffers 'cause you're @ their mercy, however, not in this case. Each meal was a 5 star experience! The service was impecable! The staff calls you by name, they're in tux's & fully attentive. Each restaurant has their own theme & \"signature\" Our favorite restaurant has to be Palazzo - our first thought was who wants Italian in Mexico & we weren't even going to try it, but it was suggested when we checked in & we thought we'd try it, liked it so much we went back another night! What makes this resort so special is the people that work there. The service is top notch! No matter who you encounter, everyone tries very hard. From the beach waiters (who work hard keeping the drinks coming) to every other service person you encounter, you can't beat the attention you receive. Even if you don't tip, you'd still get great service. We did tip, especially @ dinner, & they really appreciate it. We also like the fact it's an \"adult only\" resort. Although children over 12 are allowed, we did not see any children @ all - this is not a \"kid friendly\" resort, they would not like the food in the restaurants nor are there any activities specific to them, honestly, they would be bored. It's perfect for couples that just want to get away. They also don't have the loud pool games that you usually get @ these type of places. Sure, you can hear the endless loud speakers from the neighboring resorts, but thank goodnes, not here!. They do have the bar with a night club, which gets pretty hopping, but overall, this is a great place to relax. The beach was one of the nicest, compared to the neighboring resorts. We like the shade cabanas. The beach beds were kind of nice, but if you wanted one you needed to get there early am to claim it. There are a few hot tubs, & a few \"hidden\" pools that don't get much use, lots of \"nooks & crannies\" that you can escape to to be alone. The resort is in a safe area. If you feel you need to venture off the property, being in an upscale area, you can walk the sidewalks & explore the neighborhood & feel comfortable. There's even a small shopping mall across the street, though you don't get any bargains, best taking a taxi (4.00 each way) into Play Del Carmen. Although English is spoken, next time we'll brush up on our Spanish - they truly appreciate the effort you give to try to speak the language, & have fun trying to help you. If we had to come up with a negative, I guess there's 2 things 1) the butter is too hard (every meal) 2) get your beach towels early, 2 days they ran out by 1pm & it took a while for more to come from the laundry This has become one of our favorite resorts & are looking forward to our next visit!", "Date": "November 21, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "cambridge, ma.", "Title": "\u201csecond time there\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2835861", "Content": "i first went to the rh in november of 02. i just returned from my 2nd trip there. my girlfriends first time there and she loved it. 8 beautiful days there and no problems. the resort was actually cleaner than the first time i stayed there. we stayed in the oceanview this time. very spacious rooms but not a real view of the ocean. we were right behind the pool and hot tub though. food was much better this time too. the fact that i went with someone who appreciated the trip might have made it better too.. we are returning in november again. already booked.the new bar(forgot the name) was great...", "Date": "November 19, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Catalonia", "Title": "\u201cI had a dream\u201d", "Author": "Marybean", "ReviewID": "UR2834528", "Content": "Last june, I had a dream.

Words can't describe how wonderful this resort actually is. We met 3 other couples (2 of which are my sisters) and it was the perfect family gathering place. We did alot of homework and sent in specific requests ahead of time. Thanks goes out to Steve at Berwick Travel for all of his help in planning this vacation. Prior to our arrival, our requests for second floor, non-smoking, king beds, and interior facing rooms were sent via email. In addition, we reserved seating times for the first 5 nights at the various restaurants. Let me add, that the shows in the theatre are on Sunday and Wednesday nights and we thoroughly enjoyed both!! If you don't make reservations prior to your arrival, make them through your concierge as soon as you arrive. Your preferred eating times are easier to get that way. All requests were met perfectly. I'm not going to go into detail on the scented towels and champagne upon arrival since most people mention that in other reviews.....but we did enjoy! (Word of caution, do not over indulge in the margaritas your first day! The tequila is very strong and goes down very easily...that's all I'll say!!!) The landscape and grounds are breathtaking. Many days we just walked around to view the foliage and even saw an iguana and HUGE grasshopper. The birds are quite friendly, especially if you have food around :-) Speaking of food...it is immaculate. I gained 5 lbs in 7 days and I can honestly say it was due to the food as much as the refreshments. The presentation and quality are top notch. I'm leaving the best for last however. If nothing else...this resort excels more then anything on their service. The people there always have smiles on their faces and are overly eager to please you. Although we felt compelled to tip on occasion at night and at the pool when a waiter was constantly bringing drinks and snacks throughout the day...I feel confident that our service would have still remained great even without the extra tips. Let me mention that our concierge Luz in Villa 26 was a doll. She will go out of her way to help you. Jorge and Eddie were great at the Grill during the day and always served with a smile. If I had to mention anything negative (and I say that word lightly because it isn't that big of a deal), the pools were quite chilly. I would think that they could have been a little warmer. As it was....the carribean was by far the warmest water around. Secondly, many of my family members crave coffee in the morning. We looked for coffee bars at the beach and/or pools in the morning; however, you had to either order room service or get it in a restaurant in the morning. And finally, we did experience one of those larger business groups the latter part of our vacation. However, they weren't that much of a problem since we already had our reservations booked ahead of time for the restaurants. The hotel can't really do anything about that. Summing it up....Royal Hideaway was a gem. I was a bit leary at first since I had only visited Sandals Resorts in the past (Jamaica) and had no experience with the all-inclusives in Mexico. I feel confident that RH easily reached that level and even surpassed every vacation that I've had. We may continue to try other resorts; however, I'd return in a minute.

The bad part is that you have to schedule and fight others for them. Here are two examples. When we got here our first day we had to schedule all our dinners for the week, which of course takes out some of the relaxing, just go with the flow type of thing you want from a vacation. As well, since everything was booked, we didn't have a dinner before 8 thirty any night, and most were after 9. We also couldn't get into some places and the dinner show was already booked. Second, there are some very large and LOUD corporate groups here with about 50 to 100 people and they travel in packs and book up everything. They of course are not paying for it, so they feel more inclined to be loud, rude and less respectful of others. They have also taken out the intimate part of the vacation we were looking for. In all, it is very nice, but I strongly urge you to book anything you want well in advance. I was hoping with only 200 rooms at this resort that the small feel would be quiet, romantic and relaxing, but it's not. I would also check if any large groups are going to be here and would get another week. If I had known I would. Oh and by the way our week as well they overbooked the resort with these corporate groups and were asking us - all the honeymooners - to leave our rooms for the corporate people for Friday and Saturday, and then come back with the promise that they would give use free rooms in the future.

Our expectations were met the moment we arrived with the champagne check-in. The staff were all so eager to please and we found all the wait staff to be such gracious people. Suggestions: 1. Ask for villa 22 or 23 and the top floor. Some of the other villas are exposed to the noise from nearby hotels. 2. Stay on the 3rd floor. All the floors are marble and the lower levels are exposed to noise from above. 3. Take $50 in ones. Tips are not expected but these guys work so hard, are so grascious, and eager to please and were so appreciative of any gratuity given them. Once they know what drinks you enjoy, they don't even ask, they just bring it to you when they see yours is almost gone. 4. Make a dinner reservation for the night you arrive BEFORE you get to RH. 5. Make all your dinner reservations with your concierge the day you arrive. 6. Try the dinner shows. They aren't Las Vegas style, but still pretty good for a small resort. 7. Ladies, the hair dryer in the room is great. 8. Get at least one spa treatment; the hot stone massage is glorious, but not cheap. 9. Arrange for private pick-up at the airport. This avoids stopping at every resort along the way which makes the trip to RH painfully long. 10. We took a trip to Tulum and Xel-Ha. We were the first picked up and last dropped off. That made for a very long bus ride. The Tulum ruins were okay. Xel-Ha was okay but it took us away from a day of luxury at RH. If you are looking for a wild time, this place is not for you.

Ventanna's offers ala cart breakfast with terrific smoothies and an international dinner menu. Pallazzo's was our least favorite.

The concierge at the hotel appear to have confliciting information with those booking and selling the tours. They schedule you a tour at one time and when you arrive barracuda tells you it is at a different time.

They have free internet access in their business center, free dvd rentals in case you want to stay in and free roomservice (which I would stay away from). They have ceramics and all sorts of other classes and fun activities that you can easily do. They have free bikes you can borrow to ride around town but make sure you wear bug spray. There is a little shopping center about a block from the hotel where you can pick up little nick-knacks and a little shopping town about a 5 mintute taxi ride or 20 min walk where you can get touristy things. You can also catch the ferry into Cozumel here but make sure you bring dramamine if you get sea sick the ferry tends to be a little rough. If you are looking for a crazy/fun time then this isnt the place for you. This place is great for people who just want to relax and get away with their significant other.", "Date": "October 21, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cAlmost Paradise\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2753600", "Content": "My husband and I spent our honeymoon here from October 3 - 10. I'll try and nail down as much as possible in point form. I used this forum to select our honeymoon destination, so I would like to be as honest as I can for others. 1) Honeymoons, anniversaries and romantic getaway-ers will LOVE this resort. It is perfect to relax and unwind. No children, no noise, and no loud nightlife. That said, if you are looking to dance the night away, or meet singles, don't come here. 2) Rooms are very nice and I wish I knew about CD player. I would have brought some CDs! 3) Food is excellent. Our fave was Ventana's, really nice entrees. This resort does not skimp on food. Even the pool snackbar has some lovely salads and entrees. I do consider myself to be a wine connoiseur, and I did appreciate the Mexican red, grapes from the Baja region make it a nice drinking table wine. 4) Service is wonderful. We tipped our favourite servers. They work VERY hard to please and I believe deserve some reward! We never felt forced to tip only obliged. 5) Our concierge, Luz, was very nice and efficient. We booked our dinners the next morning after our arrival, and had no problems with reserving what we wanted. 6) Beach is nice and water warm and a little wavy. There is the odd vendor and sales rep trying to push you to jet ski or parasail, but if you said that you weren't interested, this was fine. 7) Pools are nice. I think that people don't make enough use of the relaxing pools during the day. Hubby and I had one to ourself for a whole afternoon! Honesty time: 1) Wish they didn't have jet skis on the beach, towards end of afternoon you can really smell gasoline and the hum of the motors are a little irritating, but don't let this deter you, it wasn't a big deal. 2) Our room did smell a little musty, but it did rain once a day(for 10-15 min) when we were there, so this may have contributed. We loved our vacation here. Hubby and I are very picky, and we truly enjoyed ourselves. We are hoping to return in 2006 for our 2nd year anniversary.

The food in all restaurants was top notch, our favorite being Ventannas. Although the breakfast buffet @ spices was not great. just ok. We read that it's necessary to make all your dinner reservations ahead of time? That was not the case for us. some days we didn't make res. until that same afternoon. maybe because we were in a suite?

We were lucky enough to spend a blissful week at this beautiful resort. Everything about the resort was perfect. From the moment you are greeted with a glass of champagne and moist towel, to when you are taken to you room by the friendly bellhop who explains every detail about the resort and its services along way, you quickly realize you have picked the perfect vacation spot. We found the resort to be spotless and the grounds to be very lush. Our room was lovely, with a patio overlooking the gardens. Each day our room was cleaned in the morning and than tidied up again during the turn down service. We stayed in Villa 23 and Monica was our concierge. She was very pleasant and extremely helpful. We ate at each of the restaurants for dinner and found the food to be excellent. The presentation and the service were what you would find in any fine dining restaurant. Ventanas and Palazzo were probably our favourite. But we thought the ambiance at the Grill was amazing. Very romantic! For breakfast we ate at Spices on the patio, which we would highly recommend. There is nothing like having a long lazy breakfast while overlooking the ocean. We spent each day on the beach. The drink service was amazing and we never had to wait for anything. We ate lunch by the pool from the snack bar and often ordered an extra snack in the afternoon. The food was great. There was an assortment of bar and Mexican food, and we were able to try many different things. Another lovely touch the resort offers is tea between 4-6 p.m., which we had a couple of times. The staff at Royal Hideaway work incredibly hard. They are very friendly and will bring you anything you ask for. Their friendliness made our vacation that much more enjoyable. All in all, we both felt that this was an amazing place to spend our honeymoon. It was a trip of a lifetime and we would recommend this resort for anyone looking for a perfect oasis to relax and get away from it all. Throughout the trip, my husband and I kept saying to ourselves that we could not believe that someone would have any complaints about the Royal Hideaway.

If you are looking at alternatives in Cancun\\Playa del Carmen and wondering if the Royal Hideawaay is worth the few hundred dollars premium, I assure you from the bottom of my CPA soul that it is. The service is outstanding. The resort is quiet and immaculate (no kids under 13 and very few teenagers). The food is excellent and the beach is like a Corona ad. Sit in your beach chair, raise a flag, and a beer is brought straight to you. Nothin' better! No dixie cups, no \"rot gut\" booze, no buffets (except 1 for breakfast), no screeming kids, and no hands out for tips! Now, onto the Hints to help your stay go smoothly. #1: E-mail or call BEFORE you arrive to make dinner reservations. All restaurants are great but you can't get what you want by waiting until you arrive. #2: Have 50 bucks or so in ones with you for tipping. Tipping is NOT required and you will not feel harassed but it helps to \"grease the wheels,\" ESPECIALLY by the pool and on the beach. Spend most of your bucks there. #3: E-mail or call and request a room with a garden view on top floor of a villa. You don't want to hear the neighboring resort and you don't want to hear footsteps. #4: For my fellow Winos: It's Mexico! So, the wine list sucks, don't even try. Stick to fruity drinks, cocktails, and beer for the week, my friends. You'll get back to Napa before you know it. #5: Bring CDs and DVDs from home. You have a player in your room and the radio doesn't pick up anything. #6: You have a hair dryer in the room (this is an oddly important point for women.) #7: Enable your cellphone for international use or bring a calling card. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES USE THE 800 NUMBER FOR YOUR RELATIVES TO CALL IT IS A RIPOFF. Best solution if your cell phone is not working is for you to call your party and have them call you back immediately on the hotel line via an international call from the states or wherever(take the direct hotel number with you, it is no where to be found in the room. It is buried on the web page.). Ok, now given a few of the hints, I may have given you pause on this place. You are overreacting. This place is awesome and worth your time.

Words cannot describe how phenomenal our experience was and how pleased we were with everything at the resort but I will attempt to try. From a high level, the #1 benefit of this resort is the service and attention to detail. In a close second is the quality of the restaurants. The third best and again not far behind is the beauty and romantic setting of the resort. I cannot comment on the spa as we did not participate in any of their offerings. The service and attention to detail being the number one benefit of this resort, I\u2019ll list a few of these so that you can understand. You are greeted with champagne and a moist chilled towel on arrival. You check in and are given a brief overview of the hotel, layout, and what you can expect from your vacation at this resort before being escorted to your room through the properties luxurious garden, many relaxation pools, and man-made stream where a bottle of champagne is found chilling and your concierge is found waiting in your cabana. In ours, he was responsible for about 12-16 rooms, which made him completely accessible and extremely helpful. Your bags are immediately delivered and you are a few minutes walk to the beach depending on which building you are staying at. The 24-hour room service was wonderful for those mornings that you wanted to just \u201csleep in\u201d or those nights that you wanted a quiet night having a few drinks on your balcony. The maid staff was also courteous and prompt. The beds were turned down every night with chocolates waiting on our pillows. The grounds remained spotless the entire stay even with a bit of construction that needed to occur and even then, the resort provided us with a letter letting us know what was going on, apologizing for the inconvenience (Which we didn\u2019t even notice) and finally when it would be completed. With regards to the restaurants, we ate at every restaurant for dinner with the exception of \u201cThe Grille\u201d; it was full the last evening when we decided to eat there. The hardest part of our honeymoon was deciding which excellent restaurant to go to as every single one was exceptional. We made dinner into a 5-course meal every night with a chef\u2019s suggested appetizer, salad, soup, entr\u00e9e\u2019 and of course desert. After dinner drinks of premium liquors or coffee were always available. The quality of everything listed above was phenomenal and was literally dwarfed by the attention of the servers who were not \u201cover-bearing\u201d in their attention yet always seemed to be right there when you needed them\u2026magically. (I would love to send American servers to this resort so that they can figure out how to do it right). The quality of the food was superb as well as the variety found at the restaurants. It ranged from Tuna Sashimi to Lamb, Duck, Steaks and of course a wide variety of fish and shrimp. Every meal was prepared AND presented as well as any 5-star restaurant I\u2019ve been to in the U.S. Additionally, two nights they had \u201cdinner\u201d shows in a beautifully decorated theater setting. One night was a magician and Flamenco Dance presentation and one night was a more traditional Mexican Fiesta with full Mariachi band and more dance\u2026well done!!! As mentioned above, the beauty of the resort is apparent from the time you drive through the gate past the fountain. The entry to the resort is decorated by a local artists work (More Picasso-ish but very well done) and beautiful flower decorations, chandeliers, and marble floors finish the d\u00e9cor. The walk through the resort winds along a bubbling stream, lush tropical vegetation, and nestled cabana\u2019s that are hardly noticeable. The only down-side to the resort is that their \u201cbar\u201d is sorely lacking. While we did not go to the resort to go \u201cto the bar\u201d, it is an area that needs improvement simply because all other aspects of the resort exceed your expectations and their bar is more of a room that you can get drinks in. They did offer a variety of activities such as \u201ccasino night\u201d and karaoke there which was nice.

We had a helluva time and would recommend the resort in a heartbeat. The RH is clearly the class of Carmen Del Playa, and we could certainly see patrons from nearby resorts walking by on the beach \u2013 with their goofy little wristbands \u2013 admiring the RH and wishing they were there. Given that five Trip Advisor \u201ccircles\u201d delineate this resort as \u201cExcellent\u201d, we\u2019ll give go ahead and give it five circles, but the place isn\u2019t perfect (as would be required for a AAA Five Diamond rating.) THE POSITIVES: The service is great, and everybody bends over backwards to serve you and make your stay enjoyable. We found the beach service to be particularly superlative. (There is nothing better than smoking a Cohiba on the beach and having a tropical cocktail served to you in the Carribean sun.) Given the high quality of the service, we recommend that you take $100 in $1s and $5s for tips. The service is the best feature of the resort: the staff work their butts off and deserve a little something for their efforts. I drink like a fish, which makes the included availability of top-shelf liquor a particularly nice feature. Whether it\u2019s a nice frozen tequila drink, rum or Jack Daniels on the rocks (with a beer chaser), a dry gin martini, a snifter of cognac, or a glass of champagne, the resort serves all the quality liquor a boozer like myself can absorb. The physical resort itself is immaculately kept, and the overall ambience is understated and thus charming. Marble dominates the decor, including the room, which is very nice. With the room, you get a large bathroom, a walk-in closet, and a separate shower from the jacuzzi tub. The bed is big and comfortable. Plenty of towels and comfortable robes, too. The DVD player is a nice feature as are the movies you can check out from the concierge. Speaking of the restaurants, they have a wonderful ambience to them and are all very romantic \u2013 dimly lit with candles, and the table spacing allows for intimacy. We particularly enjoyed dining al fresco on the balconies (though weather often didn\u2019t permit it.) Dining service, of course, is very attentive. Start your dinner evening with a pre-dinner drink at Allegria or at the restaurant bar; and finish it in the same manner... The relaxation pools are a really, really nice feature of Royal Hideaway. Whether you are escaping during the day or catching a late night swim, they are a very romantic part of the resort of which you and your girl (or guy) should take advantage. Exclusion and privacy are usually not a problem. THE NEGATIVES: I could nitpick about little things \u2013 the exercise facility is thoroughly lacking, our pillows were small with no fluff, the pool is less than impressive, and the lone resort bar is nothing special (and also doubles as a rather cheezy dance club that plays wedding-reception type music) \u2013 but these are all relatively trivial aspects. Our only real knock on the Royal Hideaway is the quality of the cuisine in the restaurants. Oh, it\u2019s fine, and we stuffed ourselves nicely and were never hungry, but the food is nothing really great. At times, it was actually not even very good. The food presentation is very nice and picturesque, and (as mentioned above) the wait staff is excellent, as is the ambience of all five restaurants; but the actual quality of the food itself simply cannot compare to a 3 \u2013 much less 4 \u2013 star restaurant in Washington, DC. It sometimes doesn\u2019t even qualify for 2 stars. We recommend that you stick with selections that are decisively Mexican. As such, Spices was our favorite restaurant \u2013 though we ate there a second time on our last night, and the two entries were not very good at all \u2013 and the Mexican dishes during breakfast and lunch can be quite good. We also, surprisingly, found the food at Azia to be decent. However, overall, the food didn\u2019t taste terribly fresh, particularly the vegetables, which were likely out of a frozen package rather than from the local market. The fish is often overcooked \u2013 or old \u2013 and the meat is not of high quality. (While I wasn\u2019t expecting a dry-aged hunk of beef cooked perfectly medium-rare, the NY Strip I ordered my first night at The Grill was kind of like a steak at Outback Steakhouse.) Again, I aint moaning too much, and I aint no picky eater \u2013 man, I\u2019ll eat anything in front of me. And at Royal Hideaway, I usually wolfed down my food with a lot of enthusiasm. But the simple fact remains that this is not high-class cuisine as many on Trip Advisor lead us to believe. If one actually thinks the cuisine at RH is as good as a decent restaurant in, say, Chicago, then one is smoking -----. But it definitely does the job day in and day out. Just take it for what it is. It's all relative. A few other notes: The resort is indeed rather serene, and it doesn\u2019t host the nightly, obnoxious frat boy parties that you get at other resorts. This was perfect for us. My wife and I wanted a lot of peace and quiet to ourselves, not MTV spring break at Cancun. This doesn't mean the patrons of Royal Hideaway are as old as some have suggested \u2013 at least not in our experience. My wife and I are 28 and 32, respectively; and we found the majority of the couples at the resort to be in the same relative age range. But who the hell really cares? Are you interested in hanging out with your spouse or with the people in the next room? You may want to eat at The Grill your first night there. The reason: it also doubles as the snack bar during the day, and its romance in the evening will seem a little tired after you spend a good deal of your afternoon there barefoot and in your bathing suit throughout your stay. There are cute little iguanas that like to sunbathe around the resort on the rocks. Moreover, there is an interesting, beaver-looking species of rodent (minus the big, flat tail) that run around the grounds. Some patrons freaked out. Don\u2019t. Just chill. They\u2019re harmless. As are the Europeans that like to go topless on the beach... Be sure to bring some of your own CDs for your room\u2019s stereo system, because you can only tune in one local radio station, and that station -----. (Nothing beats a little music and a room-service martini as you get ready for dinner with your lady.) Playa Del Carmen is nothing special. The shopping area features a bunch of shops that sell a lot t-shirts, silver-jewelry, panchos, and other touristy-type ware. A lot of it is crap. The only thing I bought there were a bunch of Cuban cigars. (And make no doubt about it, for that alone, the trip into Playa Del Carmen is well worth it.) If you are a news-junkie like me and need constant access with the real world \u2013 hey, I\u2019m from Washington, DC, and am a die-hard Redskins fan, so I can\u2019t help it \u2013 check out the business center for Internet access in the early morning, late afternoons or late evenings. The place was always crowded at other times, and they only have four computers. Lastly, be prepared to gain weight. Since you\u2019ve paid for all of the food you can eat \u2013 and all of the booze you can drink \u2013 you might as well get your money\u2019s worth and worry about staying right and tight later. My wife and I like to stay in shape, but we decided to go ahead and let ourselves go during the week on the resort. We're paying the price now, but ---- those chicken fingers were tasty on the beach as we washed them down with a pina colada... The bottom line is that we had a wonderful time at Royal Hideaway, and our honeymoon was great. We definitely recommend the joint to others who are looking for a romantic getaway with no worries in the world. However, I doubt that we will return.

Upon our arrival, we weren't happy with our first floor room that faced a less-than-scenic vista so the management gave us a beautiful, second-floor room overlooking the vast courtyard. We weren't much into anything outside of the resort so it was wonderful to have a serene place to hang out when we weren't by the ocean, playing tennis or stuffing our faces during all three meals. The food was great except for the mexican buffet and show, which was a big letdown. The Asian food restaurant, Azia, was our favorite by far even though my in-laws have since kidded me that I ate sushi in Mexico. The grill by the beach was nice, but on the last night there, we were ready to come back to Oklahoma and have anything but gourmet-style food and dessert. Be sure to make your dinner reservations for the whole stay the first day you're there and know that making changes to your reservations isn't easy. We tried to move our 7 p.m. reservation to 7:30 and were told the only openings were at 9 and 9:30. The highlight of the trip was the tennis pro, Leo. He isn't just some dude who can play tennis. He takes his job very seriously, and although he doesn't have much time to work with his students, he makes the most of it. We took his intermediate tennis lessons each morning at 8 a.m. with a nice older couple and another girl and he worked us all over good. I was sopping wet by the end of each day. I was a horrible tennis player before we got there, and now I can manage pretty well on the court. Leo took a particular interest in my wife's game, so much so that he changed her grip, stance and stroke because he knew she could be a great player. We ended up enjoying the lessons so much that we took private lessons in the afternoons, where he challenged both of us to be better players. Along with being a tremendous teacher, he was also a kind, funny gent we were happy to see each day and sad to leave behind. A word of advice about traveling to Mexico, DON'T ARRIVE SATURDAY AFTERNOON! We got there Sunday afternoon and we had to wait about 30 minutes to finally get out of the airport, which really wasn't so bad. When we left Saturday afternoon, we noticed the snaking immigration line probably took at least an hour and a half or longer to get through. Overall, the Royal Hideaway is exceptional. We scoured the Internet, including this site, for tips on where we should honeymoon.

My husband and I absolutley loved this resort, it was so romantic, low key and the service was unlike anything that I've experienced before. This is not the place to find a partying crowd, or bring your teenagers to... it's all about total relaxation.

The restaurants are all incredible; Palazzo (Italian) and The Grill (a breath taking spot!) were our favorites. Here are a few things that helped me before the trip. E-mail and ask for villa 22, 23 or 24, or one of the villas in the middle of the compound. The villas on the right hand side of the resort back on to a very loud hotel where you will hear some noise. We moved from villa 29 to 23 and it was an excellent decision on our part. Also ask for an upper floor room if one is available. Tipping- the staff do not expect tips, and it does not effect service; but you will soon see that these people work so incredibly hard and you will want to give them something in appreciation. We tipped them on the last day we were there. Playa del Carmen- you have to see the town! It's about a $4 cab ride, and is very cool! Strolling down Avenida 5 after dinner was a highlite of our trip. Tulum- we booked a trip to Tulum, through the hotel. It was very impressive, and also incredibly hot. It also took almost 1hr45mins to get there because you pick up guests at, it seems, every hotel there is. We also went snorkelling and scuba diving, with the dive shop on site which were both excellent. My one wish for this resort is that it would be on some secluded beach away from it all... but you can't have it all! This resort is worth every penny, and we both wish that we could go back every year.....!!! Enjoy the cool scented clothes down at the beach, the guacomole, the champagne upon arrival, and the daily dance the staff does! I am very jeolous of those of you who are going!

It was the most wonderful trip I've ever taken. The resort is 45 minutes from the airport in Cancun and our wonderful travel agent arranged a private car for us. I recommend this! We put all the AC vents on us and enjoyed a quiet ride with no stops. When we arrived at the resort, we were greeted by a bellman who called us by our surname. We were escorted into the lobby and received champage and cool wet towels scented with jasmine. My husband and I are both 30, but we kind of felt like kids. It was very, very nice. And the music in the lobby is so cool. We were escorted to our room and someone brought our luggage a few minutes later. The resort is beautiful. The villas are spread out upon beautiful landscaping with a gazebo, small ponds and bubbling fountains. Our room did not disappoint. We had a luxury room with a garden view. It was actually overlooking a relaxation pool, which was very tranquil. I emailed the resort ahead of time and asked for a foam pad for the mattress and it was already on the bed. We also had plenty of pillows - the bed had two bed pillows but there were three more in the closet. There was also a bottle of champagne and a little arrangement of fruit on the table. Our first night we ate at Palazzo for dinner. This was extraordinary. I'm a smoker so we sat outside under the moon. I had the green fettucine with truffle oil and cream. This was absolutely delicious. My husband had the special - roasted chicken with mushrooms and asparagus. We were both very satisfied. Additionally, a violinist serenaded our table! It was beautiful. I really enjoyed Palazzo, Spices, and The Grill. All of the restaurants are delicious, though. We sampled them all. I also loved the Snack Bar at the pool. We ate lunch there every day except one. I could recommend so many things: the calamari is excellent and as big as onion rings. I loved the spinach salad with bacon, egg and tomato. And if you're really craving some roughage, the green salad with Ranch dressing is very good. My husband liked everything he tried with the exception of the pizza. It comes with green olives and what looks like cheddar cheese. We sat in the sun by the pool everyday and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. We were so lucky to have Miguel as our waiter everyday at the pool. He is fabulous! We tipped him each day and he was so very gracious. The beach is gorgeous as is the water. There are also two very nice 4-poster beds on the beach with a giant canvas mattress and four pillows. Towels are plentiful, so one afternoon my husband and I spread a couple towels out and snoozed on the bed. There is also full-service out on the beach so we were totally spoiled. The pools - beautiful and clean and as warm as bath water! We never had a problem finding a float or finding chairs. It was no problem at all. I had a few spa treatments while there and they were excellent! The staff is so professional and the spa itself is immaculate. I had an aromatherapy relaxation bath which was heaven. It is also only about $45 US dollars which is a steal for the treatment you receive. After the bath I had a steamy shower and then a mini-massage from my head to my toes. I smelled like a floral bouquet when I left! Lastly, the resort's bar is SO FUN. My husband and I like to drink and hang out and this was perfect. Several nights a week the bar has themes. We participated in Trivia Night and Casino Night. Trivia Night was fun - if you got the answer wrong you had to take a big shot of tequila. My husband had about four of them! Casino Night was also very much fun - each person got a certain number of chips and we played blackjack and roulette for an hour or two. The person with the most chips at the end won a prize (we didn't win, so I don't know what it was). Two nights we were there they had live music, which was terrific.

Marble floors big tub, complimentary minifridge with non achoholic bev. The view was awful it was construction work so I requested a room change so we were moved to the bldg closest to the beach facing more construction oh well. The 24 hour room service was amazing fresh, quick, and very good. The food was out of this world that is the one thing that will bring us back for sure. The meals are just amazing. hotel staff was mostly great, our personal concierge was rather unavailable our room was only cleaned once in 4 days and turn down service was only once. That was the only hitch everything else was flawless. My husband forgot his long pants so we bought some dockers in the hotel shop for $30.00. The restaurant Azia was outstanding and we also tried spices also great. I reccomend bringing 25-50 one dollar bills for random tipping it really pays everyone calls you by your name. The english tea from 4-6 is a great thing as well. If you decide to stay here I think things go smoother for some reason if you stay at least 5 days. we also paid $365 a night which was great, we dont' reccomend the funjet type vacations if you book your airfair seperatly the whole trip is much cheaper.

It was our second time to visit RH as we stayed there in 2001 also. Both visits were equally amazing. For this review I will focus on this visit (08/13 - 08/16). To begin, we decided to pay a little more ($62USD vs. $38USD) and take a private van from the airport instead of being packed in a van with 8 other people for the 45 minute drive to Playa. It is worth the extra $25 not to have to listen to everyone else's conversations - just you, your spouse, and a very quiet driver. You will also avoid having to make several stops at other resorts to drop people off. Believe me, if you want to start your RH vacation off right, get the private van. Upon arrival at the RH, we were immediately welcomed by the bellman welcomed us with a short \"hola\" but then went straight into English. (I wish I would have learned more than 5 words in Spanish, but everyone from the arrival bellman to the departure bellman spoke English so it was not an issue. I just think it would be more respectful I would have been able to make an effort at communicating in Spanish.) Anyway, the bellman took our luggage out of the van for us, then escorted us into the beautiful lobby and over to the registration desk. This first impression (bellman, registration host, beautiful lobby, relaxing music playing) set the stage for what to expect during your stay - class, elegance, superior service. Now here is where it gets good: We arrived at RH around 1:15, but \"check in\" was not until 3:00. This would be a problem at most resorts but not at RH. They let us go ahead and check in, then suggested we eat lunch while they get the room ready early. We loved this solution because we were hungry. The bellman walked us through the property describing where everything is (including our room) and led us to the grill for lunch. After lunch we went to the room and it was ready. Then a few minutes later, the bellman arrived with our luggage. It is this attention to service that was the common theme during our stay. I should mention that our room was cold when we opened the door. We loved that. Many properties try to save money by not running the A/C prior to the guests arrival. Plus, the room was non-smoking and it did not smell of any cigarette smoke. These details may seem minor, until you have experienced a hot or smoky room. The decor in the room is very nice - Marble floors throughout. We especially liked the big bathroom with separate tub and shower. Also, you will have two sinks, a walk-in closet with nice wooden hangers (with normal hooks, not those theft-deterrent hangers that even the nicest hotels in the US provide), full-size ironing board and iron, and a secure safe. Our concierge, Luz, kept our refrigerator stocked with our favorite soft drinks. Fresh towels seemed to mysteriously appear every time we returned to the room during the day. Sand that we tracked in from the beach all over the marble floors would mysteriously be gone if we left the room for even 30 minutes. Much thanks to Luz and the housekeeping staff at our villa. They did a wonderful job. I do not have to tell you that the restaurants were nice. They have mastered the art of fine dining. From the hostess to the waiter, even a guy who looked like a manager, were attentive to our every need at every meal. The only suggestion I have for them is to upgrade the quality of the desserts, as a great dessert can cap off a wonderful meal or even salvage a not-so-tasty one. Besides, the dessert is my favorite part of the meal :-) Now for the ONLY real complaint that I have: We loved the beach at RH, but the motor boats totally ruin an otherwise relaxing time at the beach. The base for the waverunners is RIGHT NEXT TO the RH beach so there is constant buzzing all day long from them. Also RIGHT ON THE RH BEACH is the scuba diving boat (Barrakuda Scuba) which comes and goes several times a day. When they start the boat engines the exhaust fumes and smoke blew on everyone for about 10 minutes each time until they pulled away from shore. Not very romantic or relaxing. Then you have the sales people for waverunner company and a parasail company walking around asking everyone if they want to go waverunnering or parasailing. LEAVE ME ALONE! We selected RH to have a romantic and relaxing vacation, including the beach. I don't know how much influence they have over the companies that operate the motorsports, but they should relocate them up the beach next to the abandon resort (about 1/4 mile north of RH). We walked up and down the beach several times. We saw what other resorts were doing on the beach and at least RH does not have the crazy beach games with some obnoxious MC shouting over loudspeakers to a crowd of people with plastic wristbands. So it could be worse. The concierge or the bellman can arrange a taxi for your trip back to the airport. The taxi was waiting for us when we walked to the lobby to check out. The taxi was a late-model Dodge Stratus - nice and clean. You will see many other taxis that are \"junkers\" with the passengers squeezed into the back seat. I credit our bellman for getting us the good taxi. The taxi back to the airport was $50USD. Once back at the airport, you will know that you stayed at a nicer resort than anyone else and you WANT them to ask \"so, where did you stay?\" so you can brag and make them jealous (haa haa haa). Overall I rate our vacation great but as you can tell, it was not perfect. The RH is beautiful (lots of tropical landscaping and classy building architecture) and the staff is very professional. I highly recommend RH, especially if they get rid of the motor boats on the RH beach. This is an upscale, luxury resort for couples of all ages looking for an elegant, romantic getaway.", "Date": "August 17, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWonderful experience\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2446894", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Royal Hideaway for one week from july 11-19 for our honeymoon.

Needless to say, we were NOT disappointed. We ate so much on this trip, I was amazed. All of the food was wonderful, and our favorites were Azia (the thai restaurant) and Palazzo. There was no need to make reservations for dinner via email before we arrived, we did them all on the day that we got there and everything was fine.

First of all, you can't go wrong by staying here. We are in our mid-30's and worried that the clientel might be a bit stuffy, however there were all ages, from young honeymooners to older couples and most everyone, (with the exception of a few) were friendly. This is not the place to go to if you want to party all night. Things quiet down quite early which was fine with us. Food is wonderful. I am still dreaming of the guacomole...yum!!! Ventanas was our favourite. That seemed to be the consensus among others we talked to too, however, all of the restaurants were great. I think it is just personal preference as to what type of food you enjoy. It's all good. We especially enjoyed the Mexican Fiesta Show, for which they transformed the entire pool area and had a traditional Mexican feast. It was a beautiful night, and one of the highlights of our trip. The beach is sooo blue. However after the first two days of our stay, it got very choppy and was not as nice to swim in. Just one of those things...nobody's fault. The relaxation pools are fabulous...you feel as if it is your own private pool. At the most there would be maybe one or two other couples at them. Very relaxing. No waiter service though, so you have to plan ahead and bring some drinks with you. The rooms are lovely. Maybe not as luxurious as their website claims, but ours was kept very clean. Loved the turn-down service with the soft music playing, although strangely 2 nights they missed doing our room. We asked for only one kind of soda in our mini-fridge at the beginning of the week, and it was always well stocked after that. There are a few things that did disappoint us though. First, although we did enjoy the champagne and towel upon arrival, Hector, who checked us in, seemed distracted and indifferent to our arrival. It was not the warm and friendly welcome we were anticipating. We did not get the king bed room on the top floor as we had requested and were given a ground floor with two double beds. After kindly pressing the issue, he suddenly had a ground floor king bed for us. If you can get a top floor room, I highly recommend it, as the floors are marble, and the lady above us would return in the middle of the night, and walk around (and around) in her high heeled shoes. This clunking was extremely disturbing to our sleep (and thoughtless on her part). RH claims to be adults only, however, they allow anyone over the age of 13. This proved to be a problem in our villa, as a group of unsupervised teenagers completely took over and decided to throw a party, complete with loud music, in the middle of the night. We phoned the concierge desk and they said they would take care of it. Although the music was turned off, they still continued to run up and down the stairs shouting and laughing, and nothing was done to stop them. They had invited several friends from a neighbouring resort and we continued to see them all week, drinking and eating, and nobody did anything about it. When we did see them with their parents, they seemed to be oblivious to their little darlings. Adults only should mean just that - 18 and up, no teens. Also, our conceirge was not particularly friendly or helpful. He did what he had too, but that was it. He messed up our dinner reservations one night and when we mentioned it to him the next day, he just looked through us with a blank stare and changed the subject. Strangely, he was replaced half way through the week with somebody else who turned out to be wonderful!! Request a garden view room, as the rooms facing the outside of the resort are looking right at the adjacent resorts, and they are very noisy up until 12:00a.m. Loud music and obnoxious D.J.s Most of the staff are very warm and friendly, and love it when you talk to them about where they are from, etc. Being Canadian, we know very little Spanish, and they were always pleased to be able to teach us key phrases, which was fun. There was a hostess in Spices, that was very rude to us on our first evening, but other than that all the restaurant staff were great. We brought 50 $1 bills for tipping maids and bar servers, etc. and several $5 and $10 for tipping at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. While we could not discern any difference in our treatment because of this, we felt good doing it and we felt they deserved it. The location of this hotel couldn't be more perfect. Beautiful beach, handy to everything. The plaza across the street in Playacar was great. Anything we needed we just ran across and picked it up. Nice quality shops too. Went into PDC twice and enjoyed that also. Went to Xcaret one day - awesome, and Coba/mayan village another - also enjoyable. But we were always glad to step back into the gates of RH, it is just so pleasant. All in all, this was a wonderful, relaxing, clean and beautiful resort.

It\u2019s not the type of place people go for spring break while in college. It is the place you go for a special occasion, such as a honeymoon or anniversary.", "Date": "August 7, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orange County, CA", "Title": "\u201c\"Royal Hideaway is not like Vegas, but Wonderful\"\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2329887", "Content": "My husband and I just returned from a week stay at RH for our one year anniversary and we had a great time.... (July 18 - July 23, 2004) I had done a lot of research and read many reviews on Trip Advisor, the good and the bad, and after booking the trip, was still hesitant. We were looking for pure relaxation and secluded white sand beaches with a little privacy. I have friends who have been to Playacar and loved it. RH was the best resort by far in Playacar/Playa del Carmen. All the cab drivers said that RH was the best resort in the resort area. The truth is that after viewing the pictures on the website, I was expecting more. The rooms are nice, but not to Las Vegas standards, where I have stayed at some of the best hotels - Bellagio and Mandalay Bay, etc. Granted the Vegas hotels are new, I was expecting that level of quality, and was disappointed when the room was not what I had envisioned. Mind you, I believe that Vegas has set the standard for luxury for hotels world wide. After I realized that I could not expect the same level of luxury, I settled in and was very pleased and comfortable with my room. The bed is a bit hard, but you do get used to it, the linens are a bit worn, but clean. The bathroom and closets are spacious, with travertine throughout. It's like staying at Bally's in Vegas, it's nice, but not the best... The service at RH varied. Depending on who waited on you, they either remembered your favorite drinks and filled them up when empty, or you'd have to flag them down or go to the bar yourself for drinks. Either way, service is fast at the bar and at the restaurants. I have no complaints. We ate at each of the restaurants during our stay, and loved all of them. Azia, The Grill (is the snack bar at night - it is beautiful), Spices (view of ocean from terrace), Pallazo, Ventana's, and the Club theater are all excellent and have very different. I recommend that you try all of them to get a different flavor every night, since breakfast and lunch is limited to Spices - buffet, Ventana's a la carte or the snack bar. Oh and there's room service. Email the hotel and make reservations ahead of time, it's easy to change them once you get there. And the dress code is enforced for dinner. They are much more lenient on women then men. Oh and for breakfast and lunch, women must be covered up, i.e. not in their swim suit top/bottom. You can get away with a wrap, so long as your belly is covered up, so it seems... There is also a tea time between 4 - 6 pm every day in the lobby area. I highly recommend this. Do it at least once, it's very relaxing and there's live music, coffee, tea, champagne, and appetizers as well as sweets. Allegria is the one late night bar they have in the resort. We only went once. It was not that lively, but a good place to have an after dinner night cap. The club theater is a dinner show. We went on Sunday - International night per recommendations on this sight. It is like a mini talent show, a little cheesy. There is a magician, then a dancing show and followed by a few games w/ guest participants - that was the best part of the show. We left the hotel to go to Tulum (Chichen Itza is too far) and snorkeling along the coast (we rented a car). Go to Tulum to see a ruin if you haven't. There is a beach there, but it is very crowded and we left to do our own thing. We also went to Xel-Ha, one of the water parks there, it was fun and worth the $33/person. There's snorkeling, scuba/snorkeling hybrid, swim with dolphins, lazy river, cliffs to jump off, etc. Shopping - unless you can bear the heat this time of year, make an early dinner reservation (6 pm is the earliest) and then head to Playa Carmen for shopping on 5th Ave. THe shops close b/w 10:30 and 11 pm. That worked for us. We walked once and then took a cab the next 2 times. It's just too hot to walk about 15 -20 minutes...then do more walking as you shop. The beach is beautiful - white sand beaches and clear blue water. They are a bit crowded, but RH's beach was the least crowded compared to other resorts. The beach is empty at night and so are the pools. THe pool side chairs are always pretty full, but we always managed to find at least one empty one, no matter what time of day we arrived. Some do \"save the chairs\" but you can always find one. Nudity: the resort is filled with Europeans and we saw only one lady who went topless. There is also a dive shop that you have access to for free rental of snorkeling equip, boogie boards, kayaking and a Katamaran.... We borrowed everything, but brought our own snorkeling gear. Kayaking is fun, and although we did not know how to use the Katamaran, we borrowed it anyway (you have to put a credit card for deposit - but it's free for an hour) and my husband just winged it, it seemed easy enough to use. I would recommend borrowing it once, it's very cool to go sailing. LEssons for use of the Katamaran is $40, so read up on it before you come and just tell them you know how to use it if you want to try...don't forget the life vest! All in all - RH is very nice, and set the bar as far as all inclusive goes. Also -there is 24 hour access to the pools - you'll need hotel room towels at night. And guests at RH don't have to worry about wearing wrist bands. The concierge we had at villa 24 - Laura is a great resource and help. There is nothing they won't do or try to do for you. I would recommend the RH, just know what you are getting into.

Admittedly, I had envisioned a more culturally immersive experience and was quite skeptical about staying at an \u201call-inclusive resort\u201d which would offer a watered down and commercialized view of the local culture. I thought, \u201cwhy not just go to Las Vegas?\u201d Well, I reached a compromise with my wife and we split our vacation into two parts, the second of which was four nights at the Royal Hideaway. Nevertheless, I was extremely skeptical for the reasons above. I was right about this all-inclusive resort experience. It was not mexico. The food and was drastically catered toward American tastes. Everyone spoke beautiful English. The grounds, rooms, d\u00e9cor, towels, etc., could easily have been found in Las Vegas or Orlando. However, I had a fantastic time. I enjoyed rolling out of bed, sitting on the beach all day, having waiters constantly around to bring unimaginative (but incredibly refreshing) drinks or snacks, and having no worries about the water or contracting turista. The resort is beautiful and I believe it sets the standard for the all-inclusive resorts in the Riviera Maya. The best thing the RH has done is to invest in a huge number of excellent people \u2013 they are almost overstaffed if that were possible. Our meals were easy and enjoyable if not particularly adventurous and the restaurants were clean and each had a different feel. Of interest was their mostly Mexican wine list \u2013 wines produced largely in Baja California. If you give them a chance, a few of these are charming. Oh, and order your margaritas on the rocks rather than blended. Could we have had the same experience at Bellagio in Las Vegas? No doubt. But it WAS fun. The beaches in Riviera Maya had excellent sand and the famously beautiful turquoise waters of the Caribbean. The water was nearly as calm as a lake and great for swimming. The beaches tend to be more of the crowded type than the remote type but I would imagine that there are more remote locations than the Royal Hideaway which is about 5 minutes south of the city. Also, the Yucutan is about much more than resorts and chain restaurants. The indigenous Mayan culture is still thriving and offers a fascinating link to what the americas were like before the ships set sail from spain and portugal. See some of the Mayan ruins, especially Chichen Itza or Coba. The low jungle is beautiful - filled with spider monkeys and other interesting animals - and well worth a guided exploration. The much heralded cenotes are beautiful as well. If you are planning your honeymoon and are deeply in love with your wife (or husband), relax. You cannot go wrong.

There are so many wonderful things about it, as many of the other reviews covered. I think for the most part our expectations were exceeded. Some examples of this were being able to receive the New York Times in your room each morning, the turn down service with chocolates and music playing, the atmosphere in the beautiful restaurants, etc. I really could go on and on. The staff work so hard! They are incredibly warm and ready to help in any way. They seem eager and willing to do whatever it takes to make you happy. There were a few things we were slightly disappointed in. We knew the beach would be small(although it's beautiful), but you can't walk down the beach and get away at all. Unfortunately, there were quite a few people sun bathing topless, which was not what we wanted to look at. And if they aren't laying there right beside you, they are walking on the beach from other resorts. We ended up at the relaxation pools for most of the trip, so we could get some time alone and away from the nudity. Normally it seemed fairly easy to find atleast one of the pools unoccupied. One day we brought some of the floats from the main pool area, and that was sooooo nice! The food is fabulous, but very rich! By the end of our stay we were very glad to have some Tex-Mex and pizza back home. It had been mentioned in past reviews that the resort consisted mainly of older people. This did not seem to be the case at all. There were all ages, but the bulk of the people seemed to be in there late 20's or early 30's. We are in our late 20's, and we were glad to see lots of others our age too. We had a wonderful, relaxing, and romantic vacation at Royal Hideaway, but we probably will not return. Being on a beach where you can get away just as a couple is very important to us, and you just can't do that there (during the day). If anyone has similar feelings, the El Dorado Royale has a stretch of beach that is miles long and wonderful for that. We have gone there a couple of times, but we thought we would try something different.

If you have read any other reviews on this hotel then you already know that it is a great place. But I can undoubtedly tell you that it is even better than what you can imagine from these reviews. Like a lot of other reviewers we were glued to this website reading reviews on our various options. We were of course nearly neurotic in analyzing negative comments. However, I can\u2019t understand how anyone could have something negative to say about this resort. Anywhere you go you might order a meal you don\u2019t care for or make a bad decision on what day trips to take, etc. But no one can fault RH for a bad time. This place as close to perfect as you can get. You just can not go wrong coming here. That is of course unless you are looking for wild parties and a hook-up type of atmosphere. This resort is certainly geared for couples. I think 75% of the guests when were there were honeymooners. But so were we, so it was fine. I won\u2019t rehash some of the same information about restaurants, room accommodations, etc as other reviews here cover that pretty well. Some information that I don\u2019t think I have read is what I will try and put here. Transportation-You will undoubtedly have some service take you from the airport to the hotel. The best part will be when you arrive at RH and everyone else in the van oohs and ahhs about where you are staying. You\u2019ll be reassured about having made the right choice. I learned you do not need to sit in on the hour long presentations they suggest are necessary for booking your return transportation to the airport. Your villa concierge can confirm your return the day before you leave. Also, don\u2019t bother with the other presentations you could be offered by neighboring resorts with the promise of free tequila or blankets. These are just a huge waste of your time and not necessary to endure for any reason. Also, we spoke with other folks who had gone on day trips and they suggested that we had been smart on staying at our resort. Sure these trips might be OK, but they are long days in the hot sun and who knows what you are at the mercy of. You are paying a lot for this great resort, why waste a single day? Sports- Here is a little tip if you are interested in playing tennis, the \u201cprofessor\u201d (as he is called) that runs the courts is a bit of a Nazi when it comes to protecting it from scuffs. If you don\u2019t have true (all white, no dark soles) tennis shoes he won\u2019t let you play. Your typical cross-trainers will not be good enough. Servers- Most of your servers seem to have been trained somewhere on food presentation, etiquette, etc., and it shows. Just really blew us away. Jose Ole was our FAVORTIE server. Just will bend over backwards to get you what you want. Plus, he always had a smile on his face. I can\u2019t say enough about him. Look for him and you\u2019ll be particularly pleased with his service. We tried and tip him and every other server we had a buck or two each time they brought us something on the beach or after our meals. It means so much to them and though not necessary, I would highly recommend doing. You can almost feel guilty about the royal treatment you receive with the knowledge that these folks make $5-$15 USD a day. Beach-The beach is very nice. Not huge, but certainly big enough. Occasionally and particularly the closer to the water you sit, you will be asked by passing water sport representatives or merchants if you are interested in buying their wares. It is not super frequent and not a big deal to ignore them or say no. You are never harassed or pestered like you would be in some countries. Restaurants-briefly I do have to say that Ventanas is by far the best food. Erick was one of our favorite servers there. Look for him. He made it somewhat personal. Heck of a nice guy. Shopping- There are some real convenient shops just outside the resort gates and to your left that have everything you might need. Some of the stores include: a drugstore, liquor store, tobacco store, souvenirs, a bank, etc. No need to venture too far away. Entertainment- There are strolling saxophone players, violinists, etc. while you are sitting by the pool or enjoying your dinner. That is the type of place this is. This contributes to the very nice ambiance everywhere through the resort. The dinner shows are worth attending and are certainly entertaining. The International one is particularly good. I highly recommend going. It is not hokey, and will definitely surpass your expectations. In a nutshell, this place makes you feel like royalty or a celebrity. They have nearly a one to one guest to staff ratio and they couldn't do much better when it comes to meeting your every need. It is great! It will be hard for you to go back home and feel content for a while. You can\u2019t go wrong here. If you have any questions feel free to email me: efdawson @ att.net.

When we arrived, I requested extra bottled water and after that, Luz made sure that we were fully stocked for the rest of the trip. She is as wonderful as everyone says!We spent several days just lounging on the beach and by the pool--the umbrellas provide a great break from the sun.

Tulum and Xel-ha which was okay (I thought Xel-ha provided great swimming but was way too crowded for my taste) and 2. Alltournative trip to Coba/ChiMuch. I highly recommend Alltournative for the adventurous spirit and those who want to see a little-known bit of Mexico. I was skeptical of the \"all inclusive\" hotel in general prior to our trip.

We even spent some time in the cigar bar at Ventanas (we brought our own--they are kind of expensive on-site). Each morning we ate at Spices for the buffet and loved the variety. Jose Ole works mornings there and days at the pool and he is very funny and sweet! Our room was always cool and clean and I am a sucker for turn-down service and loads of towels.

It was the type of honeymoon that you see in the movies.... The entire resort was so beautiful, and the staff was so attentive, that we felt like we were famous! The ground are laid out beautifully, and we never felt crowded- sometimes were were the only couple in the pool in the middle of the day! The relaxation pools were scattered throughout, and there was rarely anyone else there. The staff makes extra efforts to make your stay enjoyable. A few examples: halfway through our stay, our concierge (Rosalia) had a HUGE arrangement of tropical flowers sent to our room. Also, after noticing that my husband liked to read the paper in the morning, she began picking up a copy on her way to her desk so that he would have a paper before breakfast. During dinner every night (enough has been said about the food on this site- it was amazing) someone turns down the bed, puts chocolate on your pillow, dims the lights, and leaves classical music playing... no detail is ignored. A few quick additonal comments: 1) this has been said before, and we thought we were being slick, but were caught, none-the-less. On the way out of the Cancun airport, do not stop for ANYONE, even the official looking people behind desks on the right side of the hallway. The seem like tourism officials, are wearing uniform shirts, and even give you a map... but their whole purpose is to get you to deposit $40 for a \"free\" trip for two later in the week... just keep walking outside and through the crowd. 2) Gratuities were included in the honeymoon package, but we still brought about $50 in ones. We didn't use it all, but felt more comfortable when we handed a few over after getting room service, at dinner, etc. We generally didn't tip at breakfast, lunch, or for poolside service. 3) If you don't want to eat very early or very late (we liked to eat at 8 or 8:30) make at least the first few nights of reservations before you go. This can be done via email, and they will send you a confirmation. 4) inward facing rooms seem to be better, since neighboring resorts can be louder. 5) This seemed to be the perfect resort for me and my husband (we are in our early 30's) and there were tons of honeymooning couples and anniversary couples. But it probably isn't the best place for people who are looking for lots of entertainment, parties, etc. After dinner time tended to be very mellow (althogh there is a bar that is open late) with most people heading back to their rooms, having a night cap alone, or (like us) spending a few minutes in the hot tub! 6) you really do have to dress for dinner! we met one or two people who did not come prepared. A few postings on this site have mentioned that they did not like this, but we loved it. It made the whole week seem full of the types of fancy, expensive dinners we don't usually indulge in! Also, after spending 10 hours in a bathing suit, it was nice to be \"forced\" to clean up at some point during the day. We are definitely planning to return to the Royal Hideaway... as soon as we can! We recommend it completely.

Many other resorts would have been less expensive, but this one had the best reviews and I really wanted our trip to be something special. I've read some reviews lately about the food being poor, but I can assure you that this is not the case at all. I've travelled many places including New York City and parts of Europe, and the food I had at Royal Hideaway surpassed my expectations. Azia was outstanding and we even cancelled reservations at the Grill to be able to eat at Azia for a second time. The sushi at Azia was the best I've had. The resort is beautiful, the beach is gorgeous. If I had to think of one thing I was disappointed with, it would be the room. Some parts of the room just felt 'worn', but I also noticed that rooms were being updated while we were there, so that's probably being taken care of. The relaxation pools were heavenly. My husband and I ended up in the pool near our villa every afternoon and had the entire pool to ourselves every day for hours. It was fabulous. We did take a tour to Chichen Itza one day to see the ruins and that was really interesting. We also went to Cozumel on our own one day for some shopping and that was a neat experience too. My husband and I loved our stay at Royal Hideaway and can't wait to go back.", "Date": "June 21, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham, AL", "Title": "\u201cExceeded High Expectations for a WONDERFUL Honeymoon!!!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2208516", "Content": "We took a very long time in deciding where to spend our Honeymoon and this site was VERY helpful - however, I figured that most of the time when someone would seek a venue such as this to submit a review about their stay that they would normally be speaking negatively. That is why the Royal Hideaway seemed to stand out from the rest of the \"beach resorts\" - hardly anyone says anything negative about it. This created very high expectations for our stay, plus I am VERY picky about food and have almost unachievable standards for service. However, the staff at Royal Hideaway met and exceeded those expectations and we echo the praises that you have been reading so much about on this site - in a word our stay was WONDERFUL!!! - The location and resort are beautiful - The food is a delicious - And the service is not to be surpassed I cannot stress the service factor enough - if there is something that can be done to make your stay more enjoyable the staff could not be more accommodating! If you want something - if there is a way to do it ... it is done!!! Here are a few tips to help you in your stay: - Make your reservations early (before you arrive) for the different restaurants - our overall favorite was Ventanas. However, the Mahi at Azia was outstanding!!! At times the food can be in smaller portions depending on the restaurant and the presentation, but they do not bat an eye when you order two appetizers - a second entree - or three desserts ... so enjoy!!! - If the bed is too hard ask your concierge for a pad to be put on top of it to make it softer - like I said they aim to please. - If you have a favorite drink - ask them to stock the mini fridge with it and it will be done ... and they will keep it full! - To make a reasonably priced phone call you will have to walk across the street to the Plaza Playacar - buy a phone card - and then use one of the corresponding phones in the Plaza ... other wise you will be charged a $3.00 connect fee and $5.00 a minute!!! This would be one of the few complaints I had with our trip, but we talked with some other folks in the Plaza that were from different resorts and they faced the same problem - so that must not be a Royal Hideaway thing, but a Mexico thing. - The Plaza Playacar is a tourist TRAP! Not really because of the prices, but because they will not give you dollars back when you spend dollars and they won't take travels checks (the ONLY place that wouldn't!)... the exchange rate is poor there too... and the bank there is UN-helpful! I tried to cash my travels checks for U.S. cash there and they said NO, only pesos! However, Royal Hideaway saved the day again and not only cashed my travelers checks for U.S. dollars, but gave me small denominations - which I would highly suggest for shopping in the Plaza - small bills only! - In the city of Playa Del Carmen itself the shopping mostly consists of 5th Avenue- start your shopping at the far end of the street (not the end with the mall and Senor Frogs) there are NICER shops at the farthest end away from the resorts. There are really only two suggestions I would give the Royal Hideaway itself (other than lowering their OUTRAGEOUS phone charges to something more reasonable): 1. Make towels available at the pool until 7 to 8pm or so - many times I would get back from being out on a hot excursion/shopping trip into town and have an hour or so before dinner and would go to the pool while my wife started getting ready for dinner and there were no towels to be had. 2. I would either create a new restaurant or lighten up the dress code for one of the existing ones - NOT having to get dressed up (just wearing shorts and sneakers) for dinner at one of the restaurants would be nice. If you want to spoil yourself this is the place - the food is fantastic - the grounds are immaculate - and the service is astounding! Truly a JOY!

I read a ton of glowing reviews of the Royal Hideaway before we went so it would be fair to say I had pretty high expectations. I wouldn't say that I was disappointed b/c it was a beautiful and very service-oriented resort, but I didn't find things quite as wonderful as others had posted about. The main thing I noticed was that the higher-up staff (in the lobby, etc.) were not as accommodating as I'd heard and was hoping they would be. And we didn't really have unreasonable, crazy demands. Check-in was fine, but we'd asked for a room on an upper-level and facing the inside of the resort. They weren't rude about our requests, but didn't seem that interested in helping us out. By the way, we ended up in Villa 22 (room 2232 - 3rd floor) which was facing another resort. It worked out okay, though, b/c we didn't hear any noise from the neighboring resort and there were trees and foliage right outside our balcony so it was very private. Also, it didn't seem like we got very much information about the resort at check-in. They showed us on a map where the restaurants were, but that was about it. They didn't go into detail about services they offered or how to book tours, etc. I can't really put my finger on it - it just seemed to be lacking a little bit. Several days later my husband and I got massages in their spa. It was raining when we got out and I asked one of the staff in the lobby if they had an extra umbrella for the trip back to our room. His response was, \"Don't you have an umbrella in your room?\" I said, \"Yes, but it's in the room.\" Needless to say, after the attitude I just left without the umbrella. Everything else was pretty good. Drink service at the pools was sub-par. From the way everyone had raved saying their glasses were never empty, that's pretty much what I expected. I would say most days a waiter only came by once or twice for the whole day - some days not at all (we were usually by the smaller of the two main pools, and no one else was getting service either). Not that big of a deal to walk up to the bar, but not the great service I'd heard about. Drinks were good, but very strong (which some may prefer) - I'm not a big drinker. Food for the most part was good, but I was still anxious to get home and have the food in the States again, even though the food there was very Americanized. Food was also not as good as I'd heard and hoped. There were a couple of nights at dinner where I couldn't even eat the main course I was so unhappy with it - and I'm a pretty easy eater. That's about it. Overall a great stay - just a little less perfect than I'd hoped. The beautiful water and resort made up for the above issues. The room was also great.

The food choices are varied, though all served with a local flavor and the portions are not excessive. My only real complaints are two (because it upset my friend): first, that while she had apparently made dinner reservations on the beach for my birthday, we were informed only when we arrived at the restaurant that we hadn't purchased the \"special package\". Unfortunately, this put somewhat of a damper on our meal since instead of eating on the beach outdoors, we ate in the quite oppressive \"Grill\" where an opaque plastic curtain was placed to obscure any view of the ocean. Secondly, our villa Concierge was of minimal help which is also somewhat discouraging considering that her responsibilities are to only a single villa. She was unaware of any of our dinner reservations until she checked the restaurant registers at our request. This would be understandible since the reservation requests had been made beforehand, but with all of the other calls to see if everything was OK, one would think that she would query as to why we hadn't made dinner reservations where seatings are fairly tight.

The hotel is beautiful, the service is impeccable. The dinners, however, were awful. Completely void of flavor. I recommend the pool bar for food, just make sure you fill up by 6pm when they close. The breakfast buffet was good as well. We tried every restaurant at the resort for dinner. The only good dinners we had were when we went into town and bought food. The grounds crew does a phenomenal job and our room was always clean. Again, the service is outstanding at the resort (except for the wedding coordinator). I would not recommend the wedding service at the hotel. We got married during our stay (planned months in advance). We wanted a REALLY simple ceremony. We paid the full price for the wedding package, even though we weren't using hardly any of the included things (we didn't want a band, red carpet, chairs, arches, etc.). I had prepaid for the entire package including pictures and a dvd of the ceremony. During the ceremony I was wondering where the filmer was. There was none. The wedding planner didn't bother to mention that there was not going to be anyone filming. When I finally reached her by phone (the next day) to ask what happened, she said she hadn't wanted to bother me with it on my wedding day. My sister had a video camera with her, I would have had her film it if I'd know the hotel screwed up. She said they would make something special for me and refund the money for the dvd. I had to get the concierge to credit me the dvd cost 2 days later. I gave my address to her as she said they would send me a photo cd to help make up for it. I'm still waiting for it 5 months later - not a word. Luckily, the pictures came out. I'm not sure if we just fell through the cracks with them because we wanted such a simple ceremony or if they just aren't good at coordinating weddings. Also, don't let them take your blood at the resort (required by law to get married in Mexico) as the nurse at the resort missed our veins 4 times (both my husband and myself had our arms swell up). Ask them to take you to a nearby clinic for this if possible.

Much of the resort has been detailed here already in other posts, but some of the highlights included the check in, where you receive champagne and a cool towel; the friendliness and professionalism of the staff, most of whom speak english very well (better than my spanish) and always seem ready to make your day that much better; the relaxing pools, where you can sit and sip a drink and . . . relax; the food, which I found, for the most part, excellent, the helpful concierge (Veronica was ours and she was wonderful); and the 24/7 room service. Our activities included snorkelling (recommended); deep sea fishing (only if you're a real fisherman. OUr boat was pretty small and 2 of 6 people were seasick); and, well, that was about it. It was just so darn easy to lie by the pool and have them bring you Mexican Lemonades or Miami Vices. Everything can be set up simply and easily by the concierge. They are really helpful and always have the answers you need. Our room was lovely inside, although our building was right up against the next resort and our balcony overlooked its the laundry facilities next door. We just closed the blinds and forgot about it. We walked into Playa one day -- about a 20 minute walk -- and stopped at Carlos and Charlies for a few beers. There are some high end shops at one end of the street as well as some smaller, less formal stores where you can barter for just about everything. If you are looking to make a phone call home, I'd suggest you go out of the resort, across the street and down a block to your left. There's a plaza there with phones on which you can use calling cards. I used the phone from the hotel once and it was a little expensive. That plaza also has a few stores where you can pick up necessities cheaper than at the resort (i.e. sunscreen, magazines, snacks). If you're lost for news from home, inside the resort is a 24 business centre where they have four computers hooked up to the internet. For some reason, I had trouble getting some of the top Canadian webs sites to pop up like Globeandmail.com or tsn.ca, but hotmail was always accessible. Also, right outside the business centre in the main building is a small lounge area and if you look around, you can usually find a copy of the Miami Herald, Cancun edition. The restaurants were all great. In order, we preferred: Palazzo (Italian), Ventana's (International), Azia (Japanese/Thai), The Grill (seafood) and Spices (Mexican). We didn't have any trouble getting into any, although we liked to eat late, no earlier than 8:30 p.m. The only complaint about the meals was that the red wine was actually too warm, almost hot. It needed to be brought down to about 60 degrees instead of the 80 or so it was at. The food surpassed expectations. The ambiance was excellent (try to sit outside at Palazzo) Also breakfast at Spices was great! We never even needed lunch. The only night I would say the food was average was during the Show. There are two per week; Wednesday and Sunday. We only went to the Wednesday show which was a traditional Mexican dance ensemble -- kind of Mexico's version of Riverdance. The food was a Mexican buffet and it was only average. The evening entertainment was minimal, which was fine for us. We went to the Bar Allegria, had a few cocktails. On different nights they had live music and a DJ and a small dance floor. There was also a casino one night and a Karaoke. But if you're looking to whoop it up till 4 a.m., this probably isn't the place. We also took in the spa, getting a couples massage. Highly recommended! We didn't tip too much on a daily basis, but at the end of the week, rewarded some of the people who really helped us, such as a couple of waters, the guys at the activity centre (who are fabulous -- just watch out you don't have to do a Chicken Taco!) and our concierge.

The trip was a much needed break from law firm life in a big NYC firm. The trip could not have been more perfect. The check-in was swift and relaxing. After a relaxing, direct flight from Newark, and the drive to the resort from Cancun, we were greeted with champagne and cool towels. We purchased our trip through continental vacations so our airport transfer was included. I do think that the hotel has an in house carrier or a company that they recommend if you require an airport transfer. We were assigned villa 26, room 2624 on the second floor. They have third floor rooms as well and no elevators but we did not have a need for an elevator. Ladies, that means you can bring as much as you like without worrying about how to get it up and down the stairs. LOL The room was fabulous and spacious enough for two woemn and all of our clothes & shoes for a 10 day trip. LOL LOL The bathroom was beautiful - marble everywhere. Our luggage was delivered a short time later and we went to make dinner reservations and tour the grounds - which are impeccable. I cannot recall the name of our concierge, but it was over 2 years ago so I'm sure she would forgive me. However, she helped us make dinner reservations for the entire trip and suggested tours. We were always made to feel special. The beach was beautiful, and we had no problem finding beach chairs and cabanas. The drink service was great - and the waiters come to your beach chair to take your order. Even at the pool, a waiter comes around frequently with fresh cut fruit. I do not know his name but I do have a photo of him :-) The staff at Royal Hideaway were all awesome. In fact, everything at Royal Hideaway was wonderful (although the internet connection was a bit sluggish). During our stay, we had dinner at Las Ventanas, Azia, Spices and Palazzo. The food was excellent. Even the breakfast buffet at Spices was fabulous. It was a real treat to have the luxury of a 2 hour dinner. That just does not happen in NYC.....even at the finer restaurants in Manhattan. We never felt rushed. I loved Ventanas for breakfast and am torn between Azia and Palazzo as my favorite of the restaurants for dinner. Although, the steak dinner at Ventanas was also excellent. I do not think we tried the Grill since we went on several tours during the day - including Xel-Ha/Tulum and the ATV tour. We were picked up for tours just across the street from the hotel in the shopping center. Jorge \"George\" was a great guide on the Xel Ha/Tulum trip. I cannot swim but I did go snorkeling at Xel Ha. A total stranger was kind enough to take me out to see the fish as I gripped onto her shoulders. LOL After that tour, my good friend left her CD player on the tour bus and Jorge made a special trip to our hotel to drop it off. The ATV tour is really fun too. Although I ran my ATV into a tree and my friend hit me in the back right after that (some of the turns are a little scary) we still had a great time. If you take the ATV tour, remember to take tons of sun screen. Although you are in the woods and covered by trees for much of the time the sun can be torture once you hit the open areas. Also there is a beach pit stop during the ATV tour where drinks are available for purchase. Be sure to bring a few dollars. My friend and I took bike rides (bike rental is included at RH) to town and we walked to town at least once. One of my pedals came off during the ride but a RH employee who happened to be close by (off campus) fixed it for me. The bike trip to town was fairly short and we felt totally safe for two women traveling together. The one complaint about going to town is the prices. Tourist are given the run around and the prices change from day to day. Mexico is known for its silver so be sure to pick up at least once piece. However, be sure to shop around for the best price. I looked at a silverware set (nothing fancy at all and not even an attractive pattern) that was like $1,000 one day and $2,500 the next. Needless to say, I did not purchase it. My friend and I joked that the price changed because on day one we were alone and on day two (the $2500 switch) we had brought along a man from our hotel to help him pick out a birthday gift for his wife. We did meet wonderful shop owners who were up front about the prices and I even got a deal on some silver jewelry I purchased - likely because the shop owner had lived in Queens, NY for a while. New Yorkers are everywhere! We also watched Gigi - a movie I had never seen but my friend loves. It took us a few days to finish watching it since we were so beat at the end of each night. However, movies rentals are included in the package. The selection is pretty good too although we only watched Gigi. Oh, I must not forget my gorgeous vase and ceramic frog. There is a young girl (if she is still there) who brings in ceramic goods to be painted near the pool. You purchase and paint your item and the next day it is brought back to the resort after she \"fixes\" your paint job, glazes and fires the item. My vase turned out so well that my girlfriend painted one too. We both purchased and painted two items during our trip. I still can't believe I painted it. I have my vase on my desk at work right now! It is brightly colored and covered with tropical birds and flowers. I do have to say that my friend was not at all pleased with her pedicure at the spa. She came back to the pool with no color since she had the nail technician take the polish off because it looked so horrible. I did not see anything except the resulting leftover fringe of red color on her toes so I cannot comment more than that about the pedicure. I was at the beach during that time.

The trip was our honeymoon, and things could not have been more perfect. The check-in was swift and relaxing. After the long flight, I was really looking forward to the champagne and cool towels I had read about in these reviews. We arrived after our regular concierge had left for the day, so Veronica, the concierge in the main lobby, helped us make dinner reservations for the first three days. We like to eat late, and had no problems getting reservations. We stayed in room 2626 - a wonderful 2nd floor room with high, high ceilings, a quiet garden view and a tree near the balcony that made it seem extra private. The room did seem a little musty at first, but it wasn't bad, especially considering the humid climate. Once my husband and I found a setting we liked for the air-conditioning and ceiling fan, the room was completely comfortable for the rest of our stay. Other reviews on this site sing the praises of Luz, the concierge for Villa 26, and we are no different. Luz is wonderful, informative, and always helpful. She always had things to take care of during the day, but she made time for each and every guest, and she never made you feel rushed or unimportant. When we asked for mattress pads to alleviate the aggressive firmness of the mattress, they were on the bed when we returned to the room. Likewise, one request for an extra stock of bottled water in our minifridge ensured that we were never without water for the rest of our stay. The beach was beautiful, and we had no problem finding beach chairs, even when we arrived at mid or late afternoon. There is a clearly posted policy against reserving beach chairs, so other reviews on this site which claim you need to get to the beach early to get a chair are no longer true. The drink service was great, Genaro, one of the waiters in the pool area recommended a Blue Lagoon when I asked for a drink that was the color of the ocean, and that's what I had for most of our time on the beach. In addition to drinks, they also serve food from the snack bar on the beach. The only reason I can see for people to complain about the snack bar food is that it suffers by comparison to the exquisite dinners and delicious breakfasts. The snack bar food is excellent beach food, and who could complain about having ice-cream brought out to them while they lounge on the beach? The beach did have wave runners, parasail boats and the accompanying fumes, but it also had sun, surf and sand. The noise wasn't that bad, though one day when the parasail concern was trying to fix a broken wave-runner, the fumes did get pretty bad. My only real complaint about our stay is the parasail people. The staff at Royal Hideaway were all awesome, and nice, and we never felt pressured to tip (though we did, of course, because they deserve it). The parasail people were smarmy, and tried to get us to go to a time-share presentation. Then, after we had gone parasailing, the boat operator outright asked us for a tip, which was rude considering we would really have no choice but to give them one since we were still out in the ocean and they were our ride to shore. The parasail company is apparently not run by Royal Hideaway, so hopefully this situation might change in the future. Aside form the parasail company, everything else at Royal Hideaway was wonderful. We were a little leery of the reservation system at dinner, especially when we got to Azia our first night and found that, as many other reviews have noted, there were many empty tables. After we had gone through our appetizer, soup and salad courses, we realized that the empty tables were deliberate, and allow Royal Hideaway guests a luxury few Americans ever get to experience: the luxury of the lengthy dinner. My husband and I always spent at least two hours over dinner, eating our courses, savoring our wine or drinks and talking, and we never felt rushed or pressured to \"hurry up\". This sort of treatment is hard to find at even the best restaurants here in the States, which, it often seems, try to herd as many people through their doors as possible as if to prove by the sheer number of guests served that their fare must be good. My husband liked Azia the best, but I am torn between Azia and Palazzo as my favorite of the restaurants. The Grill was also very good. A note on portion sizes: a few other reviews on this site (which I read obsessively before the trip) complain about the portion size at the restaurants. We never had a problem with the portion sizes, and my husband is 6'5\" and eats more than most people. It was wonderful to have our food in courses, rather than just piled together on a giant plate. It made dinner into a leisurely, luxurious experience, and we never left the table wanting more, it was always just the right amount. During our stay, we also spent some time in the spa. My husband ordered the \"Plan of the Groom\" package and I had the \"Day of Beauty\". The facilities in the spa are rather limited, but as with all other aspects of the Royal Hideaway, the staff are the ones who really make the experience special. My massage, manicure, pedicure and facial were all great. I forgot to take off my wedding ring before the manicure, and as a result, I ended up putting it in the pocket of my robe. I left the spa feeling relaxed and glowing, and didn't realize until I was dressing for dinner at 9 that night that I had left my ring in the pocket of my robe. I was frantic. I was so worried, I felt like all kinds of a bad wife for having lost my ring less than a week after the wedding. I called the main concierge and told them what had happened, and he said they would look for it. When I called again, just before we went to dinner at Spices, the concierge told me that they had eight people going though the laundry and every robe in the spa for it. He told me to go to dinner and that they would bring it to me the instant they found it. Of course, I continued to worry, and I was almost in tears by the time we ordered dinner at Spices when suddenly, the concierge and the restaurant hostess showed up and presented me with my ring. As I've said before, the Royal Hideaway staff are wonderful. They are the ones who make the resort experience truly enjoyable. I can't say enough good things about our stay there, and I've said a lot already.

From the moment you pull up to the grand marble atrium, you know that you made the right decision by choosing RH. Our room was immaculate, spacious, and ready for us as soon as we arrived. Our concierge, Laura, was pleasant, knowledgable, and eager to answer our many questions, as I, like many of you, checked this website daily in the months leading up to our vacation. We made our dinner reservations for the week; the process was as painless as it was quick, and then headed to the beach. There was activity on the beach, and it was to be expected; we did not find this activity distracting or intrusive in any way. A recent trip advisor post mentions the seclusion the various relaxion pools located throught the property provides and I completely agree. We spent half of our time on the beach enjoying the beauty of the waves (and the breeze, which was a pleasant surprise), and the other half at the relaxation pools enjoying the privacy by napping in the sun and reading; two simple luxuries that are hard to come by in our normal, busy lives. The food was of the highest quality, topped only by the presentation and professional service accompanying it. My girlfriend and I both have careers in NYC that often have us dining at fine restaurants throughout the city, and all of the restaurants at RH (including the afternoon \"Snack Bar\") were of the same high caliber in our opinion. Another recent post mentioned the restaurants not being at full capacity at any given time; we enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere and extra attention that we were given to us as a result of this. (note about the Snack Bar: the \"Snack Bar\" is anything but the standard, typical food bar one would think of when hearing this name. This restaurant provides a full menu and full service, much like any other restaurant does, and the quality is not compromised at all. The only difference here is you enjoy oceanside dining) We left the RH with all of our goals having been accomplished - we were completely relaxed, fully rested, and eager to tell our friends and family that we picked the perfect vacation. The piece of mind we enjoyed knowing our money was well spent was priceless. We expected a lot from RH, we expected that the cost would be met by quality; our very high expectations were met and exceeded, and for that we will be returning as soon as we can. Please feel free to email me with any specific questions you might have about our wonderful stay at RH, and I would be happy to provide you with much further detail about our vacation.

Having travelled throughout the Caribbean, we are always searching for that incredible holiday where you are left feeling pampered, relaxed and satisfied. The Royal Hideaway not only made us feel welcomed but quite frankly, royally special. From our arrival to our departure, we were amazed at the level of service this \"all inclusive\" resort is able to provide for its guests. Let me begin with the grounds. They are lush, tropical like and well laid out. Yes, a crew keeps those grounds looking so great and in my opinion are rarely seen throughout the day. The beach is gorgeous and there is always a quiet spot under a swaying palm tree you can find for shade or an afternoon nap. If you are looking for a more social environment, head to the pool area where you can meet new friends, enjoy a pool side barbecue and have a swim. If you don't like that, head to one of the resort's relaxation pools where you will be hard pressed to see anyone for the day. If none of these options seem suitable then a resort on an island such as Anguilla, Barbuda or Martinique will give you the isolation you are looking for. RH offers you the best of both worlds. Our room was quite good 2626; close to the beach, spacious, facing the inside of the resort. You always have the option of upgrading to one of their two level duplexes but quite frankly, unless you plan on spending your days in the room, it is not worth the upgrade. The food and drinks separate the RH from any other resort both AI and non AI we have visited. There are no buffets, except for breakfast and even then you have a choice of visiting an a la carte. The food is tasty, well prepared and presented in a fashion that rivals that of many world class restaurants. Yes, there is fried food at the pool side restaurant but there is also fresh grilled fish, a variety of soups and salads. The selection and variety are never ending. One evening, my husband could not decide between lamb or steak. To make his decision less taxing, they brought him a sampling of both. The drinks are absolutely incredible. The bartenders will make you whatever you wish with whatever top shelf liquor you prefer. Yes, you will see people enjoying an afternoon frozen drink. There is no pressure to indulge but rather an effort to ensure that you are delivered the drink of your choice and that you are having a great day. Our discussions with other couples at the resort from both Canada and the US led us to all agree that our hospitality industry has a lot to learn about service. The service at the RH is \"over the top\". Waiters running across the sand are constantly delivering drinks and meals to guests scattered across the beach. If you tip them appropriately, you will never have to raise the complimentary flag which the hotel provides. From the waiters, bar staff, concierge and hotel managment, everybody just wants to make your holiday memorable and pleasing. The staff are fluent in English but are incredibly appreciative when an attempt to communicate in Spanish is made. I have only one piece of advice: Yes, I realize that the Royal Hideaway is expensive but please note that the maids, waiters and bartenders are not the direct benefactors of that money. Do not be afraid to tip and reward exceptional service. It is by no means expected but oh so appreciated. It lets these people know that they have exceeded your expectations. It is a mutually beneficial act that they do not forget throughout your stay. I am already counting down the days to our return to the Royal Hideaway.

Expensive..yes, but what would it cost @a hotel where your tacking on 20% tip plus everything you order. We figured meals and drinks + Tips would run us $400.00- $500.00 per day....In our opinion its a bargin. Our room was immaculate... No odor to speak of. We work hard and travel around the world, so when its time to chill out laying on a beach all day, THIS is what we came here for...Mabey we are jaded knowing that everyday we have access to NYC where activity is not lacking.

I was not planning on writing a review as most everyone before me thought this was a great resort and I felt that it was just more of the same. I noticed a very negative review and thought I would just add a few words as to why I thought Royal Hideaway was a great place to go. There are so many great things here and yes there are few things that could be improved. I really try to focus on the positives and not dwell on the negatives while I am on vacation. I know that this is an expensive resort and maybe when you are in this price range everything should be perfect, but it is not perfect, just wonderful and charming and a very enjoyable time. We do a lot of traveling and have stayed in Cancun many times but this is the first time at Playa del Carmen. The last two times we stayed at the JW Marriott in Cancun and found this hotel to be perfect, but just a typical well run hotel with very little charm. The rooms at Royal are very nice and very clean, we were in villa 31 which is very close to the pools and beach and made it very convenient. I thought the beach was just beautiful, yes there are many chairs there but that just made it very easy to find a chair. They put up sun shades instead of umbrellas as the sun can be too much all day. There is activity on the beach, people walking on the shore line during the day, this is in no way bothersome, trust me we took many naps on the beach. We ate lunch at the pool area, yes there was music, they had a sax player which really sounded wonderful, any other music played was very mellow and quite nice. There are 5 restaurants on site, we ate in 4 of them and had good meals and service in each of the restaurants. They usually have live music in each of the restaurants, such as a piano player, guitar, and a violin player. We ate breakfast every day at Spices and sat outside overlooking the beach each morning. There was a noise problem at night, we could hear the music from the hotel next door, it really was not an issue for us, we heard it but it did not keep us awake.

There were more young teenagers than we would have expected at those prices and according to the other reviews. People were double-fisted with their frozen drinks and fried food. The beach had wall to wall beach chairs and there were jet-skis, parasails, boogie boards, small planes not to mention vendors trying to sell you trips and trinkets. It was sandwiched between other crowded and frankly cheap looking resorts. We had an inedible lunch at the snack bar and then were admitted to our room. The room was nice but we decided that there was no way we were going to spend our honeymoon on a tacky, stressful beach.

Although I think we were the only couple there who wasn't married, our travel agent told them it was our anniversary so we received a couple extra perks. The staff goes above and beyond anything I would have expected at a comparable resort and they do everything with a smile. The food is just as good, if not better, than any of the nicer restaurants downtown...from the appetizer to the cleansing of the palet to the after-dinner drink. And if the portions are two small for you, you can order another entree - no questions asked. The Royal Hideaway does get really quiet at night (which was a little disappointing at first for a 20-something couple) but the downtown area is only a short walk/cab ride and is alot of fun. However, after a couple nights of drinking a tad too much tequila, it was refreshing to just sit back at a little outside table and have the wonderful waiter bring me a glass of champagne. We had massages our last two days there and were grateful that we didn't have them earlier b/c we would have spent the whole week in the spa. We also spent a day snorkeling and planned to do another day trip, but after just chilling on the beach, going anywhere else seemed like work... it's just too relaxing there. I can't even count how many hours I spent on this website before and after we booked our trip. Looking back at some of the negative things other people wrote, it's amazing that they found anything to complain about at all. If you're a pool person though, the only thing that I advise is to get up early and get a beach chair because they seem to be a hot commodity in limited supply. Other than that, the Royal Hideaway is absolute paradise. We plan on returning soon because if we go anywhere else we know we'll just keep comparing it to the RH (and it definitely won't be any better).

My husband and I went there on our honeymoon from 3/15-3/19. I have to say that it was even better than we expected. The rooms are very nice (we got a luxury room), the beds were somewhat hard but that was ok since we slept like babies every night. The food was magnificent: our favorites were Ventanas and the italian restaurant. I loved the breakfast buffet at Spice, although the a la carte breakfast at Ventanas was also nice. The only major annoyance was we had booked our reservations for restaurants online, and also confirmed it with our concierge, but when we got to the restaurants there would be no record of it. We would just wait in the bar a little while they set a table for us. Other than that, service was great and the spa was very luxurious as well. I would highly recommend this resort if you ar looking to relax and spend time at the beach and pool. It is not a party place and that was exactly what we were looking for on our honeymoon.

While you are checking in, a waiter brings you champagne (or any beverage of your choice) and a cool towel. The rooms are spacious, and your villa has its own private concierge to help you with reservations anywhere on the resort, as well as anywhere in Playa del Carmen. Your room is cleaned twice daily, and the grounds are immaculate. The food at any of the restaurants is first-class, although the portions can be small. It is wise to order two entrees, that way, you can sample more of the food. Our package included a private dinner on the beach, and it was an awesome experience. We had our own private waiter, and the maitre 'd went above and beyond to make sure that everything went smoothly. The crowd is anywhere from late 20's to 70's (and up, it seemed), so it was very quiet. The bar closes at 1 AM, so it's not a big party place.

The property is beautifully kept and the staff is wonderful. I was impressed with the staff's talents and the quality of the food. Almost every staff member speaks atleast two languages and there are wonderful musicians playing at the restaurants during the evening. We went to Ventanas every night just to listen to the pianist! We found the majority of guests to be in their 30s-50s (Although we did meet a lovely couple from the UK in their 70s). Many guests were there with conventions or on their honeymoon, but we found everyone to be very friendly and pleasant. Probably our only complaint is the reservation system for securing dinner reservations. It is very difficult to get into The Grill, but this problem can be solved by making your dinner reservations prior to your trip. Luckily for us we were able to try all of the restaurants and our favorite, Ventanas, always has seating available. TIPS: Make atleast some of your dinner reservations ahead of time. Anticipate a wonderfully relaxing time. The breakfast buffet at Spices is wonderful. I highly recommend the morning tennis lessons. If you don't speak Spanish, try to learn a few phrases. Not because we will need it, but because the staff is bilingual and it is a wonderful way to practice. The Mayan ruins are wonderful but I would only recommend traveling to the ruins if you like ancient ruins and if you have atleast one day were you don't mind being off the property.", "Date": "March 24, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cSecond honeymoon\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1737079", "Content": "The first week of March my husband and I spent 6 of the most wonderful days of our 20 years together.

Aside from the first rate breakfast buffet, the food was so pretentious and lacking quality ingredients....how can \"Italian\" food be good in Mexico? And the Mexican food in Spices was a disappointing attempt at nouvelle fusion-mexican rather than cultural soul food that I love from old Mexico. The wines available on the all inclusive were very mediocre. Maybe we had bad timing but we had construction noise constantly outside our room! They were resurfacing the bridges! For $600 a night, (what we paid) this was unacceptable. The rooms were lovely, great amenities absolutely, helpful staff always, but tons of noise, the place was topiaried to death and the lawn mowers and weed wackers were always going. I saw little evidence of the natural world except for one lizzard. Music around the pool all day and then bingo on the loudspeakers! If you want quiet, this is not it. The \"country club\" like crowd is \"slightly older\" ie mostly 50's and 60's and not really engaging with others. It appeared that people come there in their own groups with conventions, or as honeymooners and keep within their groups.

Thank you, to all of you who took the time to make my travel plans enjoyalble.Never having been to Mexico before, I researched quite extensively before settling on even the region we would travel to. Several properites looked quite lovely, but Royal Hideaway consistently had super reviews. I was very reluctant to stay at an All-Inclusive property...part of travel for me is steeping myself into the culture as much as I can, but, having never been to Mexico, an AI felt like the safer choice. Many of the AI's had poor to mediocore reviews on the food...and great food is important to us. RH consistently had great food reports...the web sight is absolutely lovely...and they have won serveral awards. We went from Jan. 25-March 3, and were absolutely blown away by the beauty and grandeur of the property, superb cuisine, lovely grounds, awe-inspiring beach, and, most importantly, a staff that went above and beyond to make us feel pampered and welcomed.We booked through a travel quide, who was extremely patient with my ever-changing ideas...we went through FunJet...another first...we typically make arrangements ourselves and avoid the package deals. We were impressed by FunJet's level of service...everying was ontime...our plane looked new and was very clean. The airport in Cancun is much more modernized than I expected, very clean, with many shops...2$ (American) for a soda!! They have our number!!! :)Customs was quite quick, and I must say, a much friendlier experience than our return trip to Milwaukee, WI. I'm not sure about other US airports, but Milwaukee makes a rather surly impression on those visiting from forgein countries.Travel agents are correct about the experience at the airport...twenty or so people hailed us noisely from behind counters...offering free rides to our hotel...smile kindly and keep walking. Right before the exit, two airport workers were asking travelers of their destination, and directed us outside...where our FunJet rep was waiting. It's a bit raccous and colorful, and we definitly felt as though we were the foreigners...a good experience, in my opinion, for any American.. Our rep was friendly and kind, and spoke wonderful English.We were soon off on our way. According to a gentelman in our van, the road has improved significantly in the past few years...it's a four lane with a median in the middle. We passed some properites, lots of gorgeous landscape, and a few very ramshackle what may have been homes. It makes me hope very much that the prosperity of the resorts directly helps the people there.Our ride took approx. 40 minutes...and someone...not sure who...had ice-cold Coronas they shared with donations...not too shabby! :) It was exciting chatting with fellow vacation-goers and discovering where they were going...we heard several \"aahhs\" of self-professed envy when our travel-mates discovered our destination.The check in is everything you read about. Cool, essential-oil infused washclothes...crisp, icy champange...plump, gorgeously-upholstered seating...and an absolutely stunning lobby to enjoy while we waited to check in. We met our first friends while wating...and had subsequent conversations and dinner together throughout the week. I would suggest, if you're so inclined, to not feel shy about making introductions and making dates to meet for a drink or dinner. We met some terrific people, and have been corresponding and exchanging digital pictures ever since.We arrived in the am...and our room wasn't ready, so a personal escort walked us through the property, showed us where our villa was to be, and seated us at the Snack Bar...Snack Bar is a funny name for it, as it's lovely and casually elegant...open to the marvelous beach. My husband and I exchanged excited looks. Here was the beach...with water as impossibly blue as the pictures hinted at...lovely pools, swaying palm trees...white, white, silky-soft sand, and milling about with giggly and stress-free vacationers. Our waiter was gracious and seemed genuinely excited for our vacation to begin. They served simple foods...sandwiches, fresh grilled fish....warm, crispy tortillas with awesome salsa and gucamole (which, I'm afraid to say, contributed to the extra few pounds that boarded the plane with me! :)) Service was impeccable...good china, cloth napkins. The food was very, very good, and this was a simple snack bar!Soon it was time to check into our Villa...#24, which I had requested...Our conceirge, Veronica, was waiting, and greeted us by name. We sat down to get an overview of the property, and she made our dinner reservations for the week. You can make those online if you wish, two weeks before you leave. We had no problem getting into all of the restaurants; however, if you would like to eat at a certain time, it may be advisable to make them beforehand. I would suggest 7-7:30...simply because...you may be so replete after eating those wonderful meals...you may find yourself toddeling back to your room and going to bed by 9:00...just a thought! I won't go over all the restarants...they were all excellent with gorgeous decor..but I'll relate some of our personal favorites. Ventanas...international...was just superb! There was a waiter there named Raul who was adorable, and seemed like an exceptional young man.Azia...oriental...had amazing food. This is one I would recommned making yourself some friends so you can experience it together...and order lots of food to sample so you don't look like hogs! To me..it seemed to most laid back...just my impresssion.Palazzo...elegant! So very pretty...we ate outside until a warm rain threatened...but experience this if you can...it is on the topmost floor of the main building and overlooked the property. I had a mushroom rissoto that my husband is threatening to paste my mouth shut with if I don't stop raving about it already!! Am kidding, of course, but it was that good.The Grill, their newest, is actually in the snack bar...the transformation they make is very romantic...white candles, white on white table decor...and the beach and sound of the waves riight there. So beautiful. A word about the steaks...in my opinion...though they were good, the texture of the meat is different than what I was accustomed to...I almost always order steak when dining out, but found myself happily choosing alternative entrees...just my opinion.We went to Spices every morning for breakfast...super food...lot's of variety...but so very good! They had a chicken in beer breakfast stir fry that was excellent. Eat outside if it's not to windy. Beware of the sun in your eyes in their sunny dining room...so bring sunglasses! Great cappuchino. Something I wish they offered is the opportunity to just grab coffee in the morning before getting ready for breakfast...they do have coffee makers in the room, but its not as special as a fresh cup.Our room was very nice...with a large marble bathroom. It was on the first floor, with a view facing the property next to us...and it was a bit dark. I asked Veronica if it would be possible to move to a location with a room on the top floor and facing the inner courtyard of the property. She was gracious and accomodating, and the on the third night, she arranged to have all of our belonings moved to villa 23....The top floor is so nice as there is opportunity to have light streaming into the room...and the view facing their internal courtyards is so pretty. The closet in this room was a walk in...a bit larger than our other..thougth, if we had had to stay at our first room, we would have continued to have a terrific stay. It's worth asking for in the beginning, however, and don't be shy if you would like to be moved. They were incredibly nice about it. Our new concierge, Monica, was waiting for me with a smile and welcome and an \"Hola, Mrs. Warner!\", the second I walked up the pathway.Sorry for the book...this is part of my personal trip report as well...I printed pages of RH reviews before we left, and carried them wherever I went to remind myself of our upcoming trip, so I'd like to be likewise through.A few more tips: Bring many dollar bills. We tipped servers...not all the time...but when it felt right...we didn't do it because we felt we would get better service...I find that a bit demeaning...and wonder at some of the others in the reviews that claimed it...whether we tipped or not...we were always treated with extreme hospitality and kindness. We tipped because the staff was so incredibly good-natured and hard-working. I left five dollars for the two concierges at the two villiages we stayed at in an envelope with a nice note...a dollar each day for housekeeping with a nice note...and two/three/or five dollars for servers. Don't stress about it...if it feels right to leave a little something...simply press the money into their hands with a short word of thanks. Staff members were very pleased when we did...and did not seem at all embarrassed. Bring the small bills WITH you, however, because we had a tough time finding a place that could make smaller change for us.Bring more sunscreen than you think you'll need, and if your husband has a strange macho-complex about wearing it...and is convinced that a good burn is the base for a deep dark tan...slather it on him anyway...and smugly point out the once pale, now fire-engine red males gingerly moving about and meekly wrapped in towels hidden under their cabanas..while there wives shake their head and fight the urge to say \"I told you so.\" :) They only have one choice of sunlotion at the gift shop...and I didnt' care for the smell.Ladies...bring several swim suits and warm-weather beach coverups...or...some woolite to wash your suit. Also...a fun sunhat...even if to just look sassy and take festive pictures...mine came in handy...that sun is wicked bright!Bring enought evening wear...for men, lightweight trousers and collared shirts...no suits that I saw...for which my husband was most grateful! Ladies...it's so fun to lounge by the beach all day in a suit...then return to your room for a leisurely shower and to dress for dinner. I would suggest comfortable sleeveless dresses...no tight waistbands....even thougth you might have shed some pre-vacation pounds...all that awsome food adds up! Also, have a wrap...it never got cold at night..but the wind picked up quite a bit. Several ladies had pashmina wraps and looked quite smart! Must get for next trip!Write down name of staff members you were impressed with immediately...they give you a survey to fill out if you wish to at checkout...and there is a spot to recognize outstanding personnel.Small exercise room and weight room...but we walked that gorgeous beach every day. Very nice steam room you can use at any time. I had a massage, and it was very good.Take more pictures! We never take enough, and I wish we had taken more in the main lobby and restaurants...they are stunning.We went into town one day...was bustling and worth it. I wouldn't say I found any great bargains...though I wasn't really shopping. Be prepared for every store member to invite you into there store...it's a little overwhelming...but everyone is still so friendly. Dont' be fooled by the cutie-pie young man with his igaunas...he waved us over to show us...and soon had three crawling on me..suggested gaily to my husband to take a picture...than, unabashedly, pronounced we owed him 5US dollars! We gave it to him without complaint...had to hand it to him...and we got a lesson on being a niave foreigner. He even generously offered to give us a second picture, free, with our own camera! :) They are building a very American-like mall at the end of one street...I wonder how the existing merchants feel about it. It's very posh...with high-end merchandise. There is a large, very nice, all marble public bathroom in this square...there are signs for it...check for toilet paper first. Some stunning life size sculptures of men and women by a local artist as well...Pack your carry on bag with bottled water to have for the return trip. Speaking of water...the hotel has filtered water...we drank the bottled they stock your fridge with in your room...but don't hesitate to brush your teeth, drink the water at the restaurants, etc. We never experienced a hint of illness.I think it would be fun, if you make some friends, to spend a night in the town of Playa. I've heard the restaurant, yaxche, is very good, and they have many intruiging-looking bars and nightclubs...I personnally would feel more comfortable with a group...I could be wrong...but in a unfamiliar place...that always seems like a good idea. The taxi ride should cost 4$ to and from RH...and the bellhops, of course, will arrange to get you one there. Politely establish the price before you get in...we had no trouble.To conclude...an absolutely lovely, lovely resort. I did almost fanatical research...we looked into many carribean locations, and both my husband and I couldn't be happier with our choice.We travel quite a bit...think it's one of lifes greatest pleasures...and I have high standards. (though...we have fun regardless...life is too short to ruin a vacation complaining if it does't turn out the way you'd expected!) I'm 35 and my husband is 40...and it seemed that most were of the same age..ranging from 25-beyond. Not once did we feel out of place, surrounded by snobs (as one suggested on these reviews). If you are looking to party and meet single men or women...raccaus nightclubs and tikki bars and such...you might not feel comfortable here...not that you'd feel out of place...but you may find the pace a little sedate. As for my husband and myself, it was just the little slice of paradise we needed to get us through the remainder of WI winter!

I cannot say one negative thing about the hotel. The facility is magnificent - every last detail is perfect: the decor, the landscaping, etc. Everything is understated and classy. We were treated like royalty from from the moment we walked through the door. The rooms are contained in several free-standing villas. Each villa has its own concierge who will make your dinner reservations, book tours for you and help in any way possible. Our room was well appointed, fairly large and spotless. We had an ocean view room (However, the garden view rooms are exactly the same - only instead of the ocean, you look at the perfectly landscaped beautiful grounds). The bathroom was huge and also very clean. The room service was very good. They cleaned every day and always provided lots of fresh, clean towels. Each restaurant was better than the next. We ate at each one and did not have one bad meal. Even the room service, though limited, was good. The staff was amazing. We found that most spoke English proficiently. Everyone was eager to help at all times. Some people tipped the staff, some people did not. However, I never noticed a difference in the service one way or the other. The pools are all beautiful. There are two nearby the beach and several \"relaxation pools\" scattered throughout the property, which are perfect for lounging. The beach is very nice as well. There is drink service on the beach, and the waiters are very accommodating. Nothing is ever too crowded because the hotel only has about 300 rooms. There are ample beach chairs and towels. The only thing I will offer as far as discouraging someone from going to Royal Hideaway, is that if you are looking for a lot of nightlife, this is not the place to go. The town of Playa Del Carmen is close by, but it's not the same kind of crazy party atmosphere you might expect in Cancun.

The room had a musty smell which we got used to quickly and didn't really bother us. Other than that, it was very nice. Noise was not a problem. The service in the restaurants was amazing--over the top. Our favorite was Spices. The next was Palazzo, dining outside. Our least favorite was Azia, but even that was good. Definately make reservations for all the nights you are there by email before you leave home. The Mexican Fiesta was cheesy, but fun. We followed another reviewers excellent advice and had dinner at 6pm at one of the other restaurants instead of the buffet at the show. Then we went over and watched the show afterwards. The pools were pretty good, but not fantastic. The water was a comfortable temperature. I found the service at the pools and beach to be spotty. But there is a pool bar only steps away, so it's no big deal. To get a lounge with an umbrella by the pool you definately need to get there early. There is no problem getting chairs on the beach. The ocean was too rough for swimming for our first few days. Then it was as calm and wonderful as can be for the end of our trip. Beautiful turquoise water, no seaweed. It felt like you could walk out a mile and still not have the water over your head. It was a lovely temperature. We rented a waverunner on one of the calm days--$50 for half and hour and tons of fun! We got it from Barrakuda, which is the company right on the beach that runs the watersports operation for RH and the neighboring resorts. My husband went on a 2 hour snorkeling trip with them for $33. He thought is was really lame and recommended snorkeling elsewhere instead. I had one spa treatment--a deep tissue massage. It was not bad--more relaxation massage than deep tissue, though. Overall, we had a wonderful time. The criticisms/problems felt minor compared to the lovely service and great relaxation. I think if I had one complaint it would be that the experience didn't feel so authentically Mexican. It kind of felt like we could have been in Florida. I would have preferred more Mexican food instead of their attempts at being international. I think they were trying too hard to make it feel like food at home for the American guests. There were even Buffallo wings at the snack bar for lunch.", "Date": "March 1, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Quebec", "Title": "\u201cExcellent, but.....\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1684110", "Content": "We stayed at the Royal Hideaway from Feb 21-28, 2004. We have travelled extensively in Europe, North America, Caribbean, Middle East, South Pacific. This is by far the best all inclusive resort we have stayed at. Great points The hotel is beautiful. The grounds superbly manicured. The rooms clean, comfortably elegant, located in small 16-24 room villas. The food is excellent for an all-inclusive. You book your restaurants ahead of time, so that there is no lining up to get a spot at a popular restaurant. The variety is excellent and beautifully presented. The service is incredible probably the feature that distinguishes this place form many others. Friendly, eager to please, and very available. (Reminds me of the service on a Windstar Cruise.) Each villa has its own concierge, so you never have go to the front desk for anything except check-in or check-out. At the beach or poolside, there is a constant stream of waiters offering to bring you any food or drinks from the snack bar or bringing a fresh towel because yours is wet! The food and service are noticably better than any Paradisus or Secrets we have stayed at. Negatives I preface these negatives by saying that for many this will not be an issue, but for others it will be the difference between a very good and great vacation. The two main pools are relatively small in size for this caliber of resort. The lounge chairs are gone by 8:00 and they are closely spaced. Likewise the beach at Playacar has lovely sand and nice but not incredible water. Immediately next door are two very busy resorts. There is lots of activity on the beach (parasailing, sea-doos,etc..) which make for a busy and somewhat noisy experience. This is NOT a quiet beach, like one will find at the better resorts on Antigua or Barbados. Next door it is wall to wall humanity. You can find virgin beach about a 15 minute walk south, but I prefer to find that right in front of the resort. No snorkelling right off the beach as you can swim only in small marked off areas, otherwise you risk being run overr by watercraft. The guests tend to cluster in 2 groups, honeymooners and a significantly older (60+) group. Not much in between. Activities while available are sparcely attended. Except the daily bingo game at 14:30. Yup I said bingo!!! Some days it was hard to get a beach volleyball game going. If you are looking to dance all night, look elsewhere, but for a quiet, romantic getaway this is fantastic. Overall An excellent relaxing time. Great food. Amazing service. Worth every penny spent.

Honestly, for the cost of the Hideaway we both concurred that the RIU Palace is a MUCH better deal for your money. Perks of the Hideaway: no kids, and only Hideaway guests are allowed on the grounds, thus privacy is guaranteed, and it gives the grounds a peaceful effect. Our room was great (but nothing special) -- we followed the recommendations and requested a room with a courtyard view on the second floor -- no disappointments there as it was quiet and dry. The staff is incredibly professional probably the highlight of the entire experience -- and the food presentation is amazing. However, the food itself (especially any red meat) proved to be continuously disappointing, meal after meal. For example, I ordered a New York Strip medium at Ventanas and literally could not get my steak knife through it, it was that overcooked. Thus, we went back to our room and ordered room service that night, which was decent (though that menu is limited). Additionally, we are in our late 20s and found the resort catered to a much older and more lax crowd. There were times when we felt we were the kids hanging with our parent's friends... The culmination of our rather unfulfilling rendezvous was our last day there a company outing of 200 obnoxious Americans invaded the resort. Suddenly the once peaceful grounds were abundant with the world's stereotype of Americans: disruptive, loud and annoying. We were certainly glad to be departing as that particular group settled in. Would we frequent the Hideaway ever again? A clear and definite no. But if you are seeking a high-end, clean, but over-priced locale where you can bake peacefully in the sun, this is the resort for you.", "Date": "February 4, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cAmazing service...Please tip the staff!!!!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1620249", "Content": "We have travelled extensively, and found this to be an incredible hotel.

One word of caution about the rooms; the exterior rooms facing west and into the Riu Playacar or the Wyndam are noisy at night. The DJ and crowd noise starts at about 9:15 and goes until about midnight. Therefore, if you can get a room facing the interior courtyard of the Royal Hideaway then go for it. The service at the hotel was exceptional. The staff are always friendly no matter if you tip them a few bucks or not. The only staff that I would recommend tipping are the beach front waiters, the bell boys and your concierge at the conclusion of your tip. The violinist and sax. performers may be worthy as well. The crowd varies from a few honeymooners to repeat guests. The resort is normally quiet, except for a few late night partiers. Also, the guests are mostly americans then canadians and a small amount of spanish speaking tourists, probably from mexico or central america. The food quality is quite good, though the food temperature is not always piping hot. Also, the food can arrive quickly but you may wish to tell your very friendly waiter as to the pacing of your meal and he'll gladly oblige. Many other reviewers have rated the restaurants and also chosen their favourites. The restaurants are all excellent in mexican standards and I would say above average in a big city north american rating. I would highly recommend the spanish soup in Spices (the name escapes me), the mahi-mahi wherever it is served (the beach grill also serves it as a great sandwich) and the cesar salad in Ventanas. Overall, I was very pleased with the Azia restaurant as my wife and I found the food tempertaure consistently hot, the quality excellent and the interior very intimate than the faux Italian luxe at Palazzo. When you arrive for dinner at any of the restaurants, the host/hostess finds your reservation and then pulls out your pre-printed name tag that it placed on your table. The waiter then does his professionally polite introduction and calls you by Mr. or Mrs. In fact, most of the staff are trained to address the guests as Mr. or Mrs. but it is sometimes amusing if you and your significant other do not share the same surname. Tip for golfers: The golf course at Playacar is a 2-3 minute walk away. It costs $160 U.S. and it is well worth the price. Be forewarned, the course is difficult, the wind can blow in the afternoon and I found that I needed one extra club on many approach shots as well as the tee shots into the par threes. I normally shoot in the low to mids 80s from any back tees but here I was in the low 90s. The beverage cart is frequent and well stocked with the usual potatoe chips, sandwiches, water, gatorade and beer. At cashier's desk inside the golf course there is a representative from Moon Palace and their golf course. Ignore her despite the \"promotion\" for free round trip transportation and 1/2 price green fees as they want you to attend a 90 minute presentation. The rep. wants you to stay at Moon Palace the next time you visit the Mayan area. For runners who want shed some of their dessert and beer, there is an oval loop around Playacar that it about 3.75 miles long. It is quite popular in the early morning hours and gives you a good idea of the expanding area of playacar. The spa at Royal Hideaway is good. The staff here are very professional and attentive. My masseur was often asking me if the pressure was sufficient while humming away to the music of Enya in the background. In short, my wife and I would be pleased to go back to the Royal Hideaway. We know that everything is well above average for a resort of this type in Mexico.

After I booked the trip, I looked at the RH website daily and wistfully anticipated days of tropical bliss. All this to say that my expectations of the place were extremely high. Even after all my reading, research and fretting, the Royal Hideaway exceeded my expectations. If relaxation and pampering is what you are looking for, then this is the place. The grounds and the architecture are first class and really add to the ambiance. We never felt rushed or hurried or crowded. The food is excellent for an all-inclusive. I've defintely had better, but the presentation and the friendliness of the waiters almost make it taste better! Our 3rd floor room was a tad musty but we got used to the smell. It was also facing another resort, but again, that was no big deal. We stayed mostly at the resort, but did take a couple of excursions. We highly reccommed the Cenote Nohoch tour through alltournative expeditions. Snorkeling in a Cenote is one thing you have to do while on the Yucatan. We also went to the RH's sister Allegro resort on Cozumel for a day. Wow, what a waste! The food was horrible , the grounds smelled like sulfur , and there was just a hectic hustle and bustle that was absent from the RH. The best way to appreciate the RH is to go to some of the resorts next door. You'll quickly realize how good you have it at the Royal Hideaway. Little things like having no kids around, grounds that are constantly manicured, relaxation pools everywhere, wait service at that beach and pool with unlimited towels , ala carte dinners, and friendly staff really do make a big difference!

We could not have created a more ideal honeymoon. Our 10-day stay at the resort was incredible. We loved each of the dinner choices, our favorites being Ventanas, The Grill, and Palazzo. Additionally breakfast was excellent as well. We most often visited Ventanas for breakfast (I had the huevos rancheros and a fresh fruit smoothie almost every time we went to Ventanas for breakfast) I would also recommend spending a morning or two on your balcony using the room service option. The final breakfast option is spices, and the best thing about the spices option is that it is quick & easy, and the buffet offers a wide variety of options for breakfast. For lunch each day we were completely satisfied with the more relaxed low-key choices offered at the poolside tables.When we initially planned our visit to Royal Hideaway, we talked about visiting Cozumel for a day, taking one of the excursions and taking a day trip to see the ruins. When we got to the resort however, we had no desire to leave the luxury of Royal Hideaway for any of these adventures. We did trek into Playa Del Carmen on a couple of occasions using the resort bicycles. We enjoyed walking the length of 5th street on one afternoon, and we took a ride to the local supermarket on another occasion to pick up some of the more local flavor of the area.A few recommendations I would offer to those traveling to the resort: Get to know your activity guys, they are wonderful fun people (tell Leon and Rodrigo I said hi). My wife s favorite newfound drink was a concoction they called a Clemantine. We did request an upper floor room, and would recommend that you do the same.

This would be a wonderful honeymoom spot but I would definitely not recommend it for a group vacation. They were not able to seat all of us for dinner together and there is basically NO nightlife at the resort. The most fun was karioke night but the dance floor is so small we were knocking into people at tables. The food was also very good, the best was breakfast at the restaurant over the pool and dinner at the Italian rest. they even had a violinist playing that night! He was great - could play anything.

Just keep walking until you get outside and meet your transportation representative. The resort is about a 40 minute drive from the airport, and it is a lovely oasis. I thought the town of Playa Del Carmen was nothing special, but the RH resort was divine. The grounds are well-manicured, and the service is excellent. Be sure to ask for a room on an upper floor - the first half of our vacation, we were in a first level room and it smelled musty and our clothes were damp, and it was really unpleasant. Finally they moved us to the third floor and it was a totally different - and pleasant - experience. The food is very good. We enjoyed spices and ventanas for breakfast. Try to eat on the balcony at Palazzo. We didn't enjoy the food at Azia, but the ambiance was nice. There wasn't much nightlife, but it is very relaxing. We took the ferry to Cozumel for the day which was very fun.

The service was top-notch, the food was excellent, (with only a few minor exceptions) the resort was beautiful, and the beach was the best I've seen in a long time. My wife and I dined at all of the restaurants, and had lunch on the beach most days. The service on the beach was good, particularly if you tipped the waiter - which was well deserved. The service in all of the restaurants was exceptional. Azia's was my favorite place to eat, but the rest of the restaurants were equally as good. Champagne and orange juice with breakfast was a real treat. As many fresh towels as you wanted during the day by the pool or on the beach, just help yourself. There was an attendant on the beach full-time that would set-up a cabana for you if you wanted. As for the smell of gas on the beach, yes, the waverunners are in use, but it's no big deal - sometimes you have to just order another drink and ignore some of the so-called annoyances. I do agree with the previous poster that porn advertisements kept popping up on the computers in the Business Centre, but when you have as many people using the computers on a daily basis as they did, you're bound to get some of the unwanted stuff - you can't really fault the resort for that. We had a third floor room, and there wasn't any musty smell, but we did hear that if you were on the main floor your room could smell musty (one minor complaint is that the beds are hard). So, relax, you're on vacation, and if you can't get into Palazzo's at 8:00, go at 8:30 - it's no big deal... Anyhow, we will definately go back, and likely at least once a year from now on.

I had purchased our stay using a discount online travel site and had received QUITE a good deal so I was a bit nervous that perhaps the place was not as advertised. This site alleviated most of my fears beforehand but I was still afraid our room would turn out to be a dive or we would get less than superior service...thankfully, my fears were completely unfounded! We stayed in Villa 31 closest to Spices/Pool area etc., ground floor unit w/king bed...very nice and just as described here and on the RH official site. I emailed ahead of time to confirm our stay, made dinner reservations, and made spa reservations. Everything went just as planned and I really appreciated the reminder notice slid under our door each late afternoon, reminding us of time and location of our dinner plans (made them so far in advance I was prone to forget details!) I won't drone on here about the great details, as many other reviews have covered it all. Major highlights for us were the beautiful flower arrangement and balloon/banners that the concierge Luz placed in my room on my birthday and the great poolside service. I have to take exception to a couple of things I've read here: we thought Palazzo Restaurant was AWFUL - great atmosphere but food was terrible, we were greatly disappointed. However, all the other food and restaurants were so wonderful that I feel bad even citing one sour note. Also, the music at poolside was annoying and repetitious, would have appreciated a break from that while relaxing in the sun. Really our only catastrophic event occurred on our last day - the awful rain storm Sunday night/Monday morning (Nov 9/10) - completely flooded all the ground floor units in our villa, including ours...woke up to 2 inches of water in the room, and our suitcases (which were packed as we were leaving that day) were wet, as were the contents! The staff seemed a little overwhelmed on how to deal with the flooding; no American ingenuity going on, just a lot of primitive mopping. But our concierge offered to dry our stuff out and offer any other help...we took it all in stride - after all, it was a good day to leave!! Had the weather been sunny that last day, it would have been difficult to break away! Oh, spa services were heavenly too although expensive. We did NOT enjoy going to the town of Playa Del Carmen - the constant hustle and cat calling by the locals ruined our stroll thru town and I didn't see anything but the same junk, over and over, in all the stores. First time EVER I went on a trip and bought next to nothing - guess that could be a good thing! We did go to Tulum for 1/2 day excursion which we enjoyed although it became sweltering hot toward the end and we couldn't wait to get back to the relaxing Royal Hideaway. Final note: that crap at the Cancun airport when you first arrive is just unreal - my boyfriend (who had never been to Mexico before) almost got sucked in by several of the hustlers just outside the immigration area; I kept telling him \"keep walking and don't make eye contact!!) So BEWARE of that - thank goodness I had made transportation arrangements ahead of time with Maritur and I was finally able to identify their driver once we got past all the b.s. Would strongly suggest to others to do the same!! I know that's Mexico for you (I've been to Cabo and border towns a few times) but it is not a pleasant experience, no matter how many times you've encountered it. But all was forgotten at the Royal Hideaway - a near perfect resort in our eyes!", "Date": "November 29, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "McLean, Va", "Title": "\u201cGreat service, beautiful property but too noisy\u201d", "Author": "chrisd", "ReviewID": "UR1500358", "Content": "I returned from a week at the Royal Hideaway (RH) on 11/22/03. I had read reviews on this site which were very helpful. I often go to Leading Hotels of the World (LHW) properties and use that publication as a guide. I have very ambivalent feelings about the Royal Hideaway. First let me say that the service in the hotel is among the best I have experienced anywhere. I found most of the staff to be professional, polite and very welcoming. The property itself is beautiful and and very well kept considering the amount of guests at the property. Also, the food really did surpass my expectations especially considering that it is an all inclusive. There was a wide choice of food options available, food was tasty and presentation was good.The complaints I have about the Royal Hideway largely cannot be controlled by the staff at the hotel and this is why I am not sure if I would return. In a word, my major complaint was NOISE and lots of it at times, from the other guests and surrounding properties. (I am in my mid 40's).If you want to 1) sleep until 9:00 am, 2) take a nap during the middle of the day in your room 3) nap on the beach or if you are looking for peace and quiet, this is probably not the place for you.First, the design of the villas makes a restful sleep difficult. The villas are either 2 or 3 stories, somewhat octagonal in shape and have a circular opening (about 20 - 30 feet in diameter) in the roof of each villa (i.e. there is hole in the roof). There is a large circular drainage area in the ground floor that collects rainwater. There are 8 rooms on each floor (except for the suites) and all of the hotel doors face the toward the inside of the building. If another guest is being loud after coming in from a night of partying, the sound transmits throughout the whole villa. The hotel should consider using those compressed air stoppers on their doors as everyone seems to feel the need to SLAM their door when a gentle latching would do.Also, the resorts on the other sides have bands, cheering and rowdiness almost every night and sometimes it doesn't end until almost midnight. If you are standing at the ocean and facing the RH (your back toward the ocean) the villas on the left hand side are probably the loudest because the property on the left side next door is very loud at night.Other noise problems...the \"relaxation\" pools. One evening there were 10 - 12 guests in the relaxation pool at 11:30 pm and you would have thought that you were at a Spring Break party with the laughter and screams coming from this group.These are just some of the problems...I could go on and on. Most of the guests are well mannered and respectful. A small percentage of the guests are unruly, loud, drunk, rude and just plain inconsiderate. Unfortulately, the loud and rude ones are usually Americans and they give us all bad name. I know that many other guests felt the way I did about the noise factor. I decided that the real troublemakers are probably those that are coming with corporate trips (there seem to be alot ), not paying for the vacation themselves, and probably not accustomed to how one should behave at such a fine property. I think that the all inclusive format is probably attractive to larger groups.FOOD: If you go, make sure to try the huevos rancheros with frijoles at the Spices breakfast buffet and the Huevos Divorciados at Ventanas (formal breakfast service). I liked Palazzo, but have had a wide range of Italian food in the states and I have had better Italian food elsewhere. The service in all of the restaurants can't be beat.Food out of the resort: La Cabana - authentic mexican food near Gran Porto Real but bring pesos. The food was excellent ...the tortilla soup is a must try. Also, Da Bruno Ristorante on 5th for italian was quite good (it is noisy and crowded but you realize this long before you sit down). Accepts credit cards. Ravoili was very good.One other note: the property was overbooked when I arrived. I had asked for a quiet room and specified what kind of bed I wanted. They did not have either when I arrived and I ended up moving the nexy day. This was a minor inconvenience. The front desk check in was somewhat upsetting though because they were somewhat non-committal as to if I would be able to move the next day. If you can avoid checking in on a Saturday, that is probably your best bet.So, for me this property was a real heartbreaker as it was almost perfect in every other respect. I was just somewhat surprised because the caliber of guest at LHW properties is usually fairly consistent. I expected a much quieter more subdued group of guests.", "Date": "November 28, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "NY, NY", "Title": "\u201cBreathtaking!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1490912", "Content": "We went during the very beginning of November.

Our experience at the Royal Hideaway almost completely met all of our high expectations. Upon arrival we were met by a bellman named Alvaro. He greeted us with a smile, guided us to the grand foyer, provided us with cool scented towels to refresh ourselves, served us champagne and guided us to two overstuffed wingchairs to rest for a few moments before our seemless check-in. His friendly yet professional service our made an indelible impression he made on us. Throughout the week we would see him doing his job and he always greeted us by name. Our room was 3018, a floor level king near a relaxation pool. I had requested this type of room in advance and we were not disappointed. The room was comfortable and well appointed. It was very humid during our stay and the A/C was solid. The only knock on our room was that the toilet and right sink had drainage issues. Room service was great. Always 25 minutes and friendly. The local concierge was over rated. She managed to tell us many things we already knew. She woke me up one day to ask if we needed dinner reservations, when we already had them. While on the subject of slightly irritating things. Mexico seems to thrive on people needing your time for the old \"bait and switch\" routine. We managed to avoid this at the airport, (no small accomplishment), but I was a bit put off by our Funjet rep calling repeatedly to meet. I don't want to get on a rant here, but all I needed from him was departure time for airport pickup. When I finally met him, he began writing down air info that I had in print. I simply said \"look, I already have all that. My wife and I are going to do nothing but lay at the pool and beach and brown our skin in advance of a western Canadian winter, so I don't mean to be rude but please just give me a time pal\". He finally got the message and we got back to our vacation. Sorry, back to the RH. The beach seemed small. In this part of Playacar, several resorts are side by side and the properties are long rectangular in shape. This makes for a nice long walkway from main building to beach, but for those expecting low people density on the beach, you will be disappointed. This was not our expectation, but the beach was much more dense with people than I expected. The pools were great. Poolside service was spotty, but I was fine going to the poolside bar myself. The bartenders were friendly and fast. If you want great poolside service, tip a dollar or two and you will see the power of the dollar at work. Occasionally, activity staff would come around and announce water aerobics or dance lessons, with very few taking them up on it. The restaraunts, as noted by many here, are the prize of the RH. Palazzo was our favorite. We dined there twice, once on the veranda and once inside. For those needing a beef fix, the filet was excellent! Azia was second favorite. Mahi Mahi with chili sauce was top notch! Spices was good as well. We only had breakfast at Ventanas, as many there were not impressed with it for dinner. Make reservations in advance and you will not be disappointed. All service was flawless. For cigar enthusiasts, the cuban girl (Lauren?) rolled great smokes just outside the entrance to Ventanas. All bars served call drinks and nice wines. Negatives. Not many but worth noting. 1. A $70USD call to Tulsa, OK for 10 min. DO NOT USE LONG DISTANCE! 2. No water purification system. 3. Wakaki beach was less dense with people. In summary, many elements are 5-star. The crowded beach and lack of a water purification system keep my rating a tad lower. I can't give a 5-star to a resort where I have to look for a bottle of water to brush my teeth, so I will say this is a 4+ star resort.", "Date": "November 12, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Worcester, MA", "Title": "\u201cbest all-inclusive\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1447419", "Content": "We stayed at Royal Hideaway Oct.22-29,2003.

We liked Palazzo (Italian, romantic, great view, violins) and Spices (upscale Mexican/Carribean) the best. We booked through Apple so that we would have some corporate back-up in case of problems. This was not in the least bit necessary. Next time, I will book directly as Apple was not needed and mediocre compared to the excellent staff at the Hideaway.

We also found this site to be a very useful resource. We have travelled to many of the islands, but this was our first trip to Mexico. The resort is beautiful, but it is truly the service that sets the RH apart. From the moment you arrive, the staff cannot do enough for you. We arrived on a Sunday at 11am, having been up all night travelling directly from our wedding reception. Our first hint at what was ahead came from our tour operator's van driver...after dropping off a few other couples at each of their respective resorts, we were the only ones left in the van and he turned to us to say that we were going to \"the best resort in the Mayan Riviera!\" The gates are guarded, unlike most of the other resorts, and guests must be identified on arrival; on subsequent entries and exits you must provide your room number. There are many uniformed bellboys to aid you in hailing a taxi or to help with your bags. They will not let you carry your own! On arrival, we were escorted into the grand lobby, seated on a sofa, and served champagne along with a cool, scented towel. While we waited, the manager checked us in. Because we were too early to get our room, they escorted us to a hospitality suite (the same as a luxury room, just not as nice a view) where we were able to shower and change for lunch. Our bags arrived closely behind us, and were then taken to our suite, which was ready by the time we finished lunch. If you like, email the resort directly before your arrival to request a king bed, rather than 2 fulls. Our room was beautiful...2823 on the 2nd floor had 20 foot ceilings and was close to the main building which houses Ventanas and Palazzos, and overlooked the gardens (facing in). It is true that the resorts on either side can be a bit loud, only on occassion during the day (you sometimes notice at the beach if they are using a microphone/megaphone for an activity), and for an hour or so at night...if you face in, you don't generally notice unless your patio door is open. The rooms have a small fridge, replenished twice daily with pop (soda for you Americans!) and bottled water. If you prefer alcoholic drinks, you can always order from room service, 24/7 (by the glass only...wine or champagne by the bottle will cost extra). The marble bathrooms have double sinks, a large, separate shower, and a whirlpool bath (ours had a window, too). Large walk-in closet with a safe inside. Room service takes approximately 20 to 25 minutes...light menu consists of a continental breakfast, a penne pasta dish, a traditional caesar salad, cheesecake, and a few other things. We found that you could also make requests (such as ice cream!) that they always try to accomodate. The breakfast buffet at Spices by the beach is great...lots of selection. Be sure and take advantage of all the choices of fresh made-while-you-wait smoothies and shakes. You can actually get these at any bar. Always fresh fruit, and alcoholic drinks always had premium brands. The breakfast at Ventanas was nice...table service and a decent selection on the menu. The restaurant was always quiet in the morning...great, attentive service, and we found the food a little better because it wasn't sitting in the buffet warmers (although these were oft replenished). Dinner was always anticipated. Have your concierge make reservations in advance...we always did a few days before for best time selections. If you wait until the day of, you can usually still get in where you want, but may have to go at 6pm or 9:30pm instead of 7:30pm. Palazzos seemed to book up the quickest, and was our favourite (Italian menu). All of the restaurants were great, however. We often eat in 5 star restaurants at home, and found the food and presentation to be comparable. Again, the service was fabulous. The Mexican people are so friendly, and the resort staff in particular always have a smile. Each of the restaurants have live music at dinner...a pianist in Ventanas, a violinist at Palazzos, a string trio at Spices (which is also open for the breakfast buffet, and again for lunch menu service...more choices and better service than the Snack Bar -or Grill- at lunch). At Azia, which is next to the Piano Bar, you can hear the pianist. If you are unskilled with chopsticks, incidentally, do not be afraid to ask for silverware, as we saw many do. The beach was beautiful...soft sand and the water is a gorgeous aquamarine blue. It is public, but mainly tourists from other resorts are walking it, with only the occasional vender carrying his wares; even they are fairly non-obtrusive. There are Sunfish, Catamarans, boogie boards (great on rougher days) and sea kayaks available. These activities are included...extra if you need a lesson. Beware if you do not know how to sail...if you go out without a lesson and can't make it back, they will charge you $25 US. When we were waiting for our Catamaran, we couldn't figure out why the couple before us, who were stuck at a standstill and couldn't catch the wind to bring them in, weren't asking for help; that explained it! There are also Waverunners available for rent (kind of annoying jetting about....made the air smell like gas), and there are a couple of parasailing boats and also snorkelling or SCUBA diving excursions available right from the beach. For the latter two options, I'd recommend going elsewhere. Akumal beach is about half an hour drive south, is far more secluded and private and has a gorgeous coral reef just offshore. This is a beach mainly frequented by locals, or tourist and divers who prefer to go off the beaten path. We brought our own snorkelling equipment, and took a \"Collectivo\" (white 12 passenger vans that run up and down the main highway...for a couple bucks you can go anywhere...they just honk at you if on the side of the highway, and you flag them if you want a ride...mostly locals and hotel employees use them, but they are great) to Akumel and had a great time. We also went to Tulum (entrance fee $3 US/pp), but did not do one of the \"official tours\". If you prefer that route, the concierge can make the arrangements for you, but it's much cheaper and you have more freedom to either take a bus from Playa Del Carmen (the bus station is next to the McDonalds; $2-$4 US, the buses that said \"Mayab\" on the side seemed to be cheaper) or walk out to the highway and take a Collectivo. Tulum is about 45 minutes (?) south...it is the ruins of a Mayan city on the coast. Very pretty. Could not believe that up until recently you could walk on and in the ruins!! Many tourists...people everywhere. We checked it out...joined up with a tour to learn about some of the sites, but were glad not to be on an organized tour. It was very hot, and we were able to jump in the ocean to cool off rather than being herded around! Besides that and a bit of shopping in Playa del Carmen, we mainly stayed at the resort and enjoyed the beach. 40% - 50% is a pretty good guideline for what to pay for goods in town; they expect you to bargain, so don't be afraid! Negotiate cab far to town before you get in...prices can vary...about $4-$5 US. We generally walked into town, a brisk 15 minute walk. Playacar is very pretty...lots of nice homes and cobblestone streets. The shops in Playcar do have fixed prices and are certainly more expensive...pretty much exclusively for the tourists. Playa del Carmen is the real town; this is also where you can catch the ferry to Cozumel, which we did not bother with. At the beach, the green flags for service on the beach are beside the pool near the snack bar. Service can be a little slow, but better if you tip. You can order a full meal on the beach, and even ice cream! The \"hidden pools\" are also nice...very secluded. There were only two pairs of sun loungers at each. We were in the spa, and it was hot. (?) All of the pools are well kept. The disappearing edge pool (closest to the ocean) is on the beach on two sides, which was nice. Regardless of the time we got there, we never had a problem getting chairs. The chairs around the pools were certainly busier than those on the beach, though. We also went to the Mexican dinner show, where dinner was served buffet style, and consisted of many traditional Mexican dishes. We found the buffet dinner to be not quite as good as in the other restaurants, and had heard mixed reviews about the show itself. The show consisted of many traditional dances, etc., from various regions of Mexico. We thought it was interesting, though maybe a bit cheesy; it was still better than most of the resort productions we had ever seen, and the dancers had obviously put a lot of time and effort into the production. I believe the show runs twice a week, and arrangements can be made to attend through your concierge. Incidentally, for those in attendance last week, we were the Canadians that \"volunteered\" for the little game at the completion of the show...involving a balloon popping race... :-) Well, I've gone on at length, and hope I've returned the favour to all site users. I used this site to select the location for our perfect honeymoon, and the Royal Hideaway definitely exceeded our expectations. The clientele is certainly different than at most other all-inclusives... You can't really categorize the guests as \"older\" as there is quite a range, but all are couples, and most are celebrating honeymoons or anniversaries of sorts. Certainly not a late-night party place...the small Piano Bar wasn't very busy in the evening. We are in our late twenties, and did not feel out of place at all, but it is true that the number one recreational activity was relaxing in the sun, rather than drinking. (I think I only saw one gentleman at the pool who had obviously \"overindulged\".) In any case, we'll be back!", "Date": "November 5, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Raleigh, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cBelieve What You Read\u201d", "Author": "Csalt", "ReviewID": "UR1434454", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at the Hideaway October 26-30. We found it to be just what we were looking for. I had done the researching (no personal recommendations) and the information I found on this website was very helpful. I am passing along my experiences to help future travelers in vacation planning. This was our first trip to Mexico. We have been to many Caribbean islands (St. Lucia, Nevis, Tortola, St. John, Aruba) and find that all have pros and cons. We found that the scenery at RH was not as breathtaking as the Virgin Island region however the RH service was far superior. We went to a Sandals in St. Lucia and had experienced the all-inclusive format. That resort was full of a younger clientel that seemed more active and party/drink oriented. At RH the clientel felt mature. It was by no means an old crowd (there were a number of 20-30ish honeymooners. It seemed that the goal was more to relax and work on a tan versus playing volleyball and having drinking contests. As for the beverage selections: Liquor was all top shelf and made to order. There were no slushy machines with pre-made mixes. The beer selection was minimal. Corona and Negril was on tap (I haven't done tap since college). That left Medello Especial, Bud Light and Heneiken by bottle. However, at the pool snack bar they only had Bud Light. We enjoyed the food. If you have a time in mind for dinner do make the reservations. Otherwise you can get into any restaurant. I enjoyed the exceptional service at Azia and Ventanas. We didn't eat dinner at Spices or Palazzo. The food was good at The Grill (Snack Bar during the day) however I found the service to be less attentive than the other restaurants. Also, they don't offer the Modello Especial at night. For breakfast we tried both Spices (buffett) and Ventanas. We enjoyed both. I liked that they offered a large variety of milkshakes. We attended the Mexican dinner show. It was a nice break in the routine. They had a buffett that offered many traditional dishes. The service was typical for a dinner show. The rooms were just as expected. Much nicer than your average business travel hotel. The concierge concept per villa was nice. Made for quick service. Seemed that the speed of room cleaning was hit or miss. Usually our room wasn't cleaned until late afternoon. They did have the nightly turn down service. The resort is roughly 2-3 football fields wide and stretches from the ocean back to the main road. They did a great job in landscaping to make it feel tropical. On either side are 2 other resorts. The other resorts are both more Sandals types with loud group activities throught the day and night. Our room was next to the Allegro resort and they had a nightly musical outdoors from 9:30 - 10:30. We were only in our room one night at that time and only heard it when going on the patio. We arrived on Sunday and had I had interest in seeng a few sporting events. This was a challenge. The TV channel options are not US oriented. The majority are spanish. They offered ABC, NBC, CBS, ESPN and a few others in english. No Fox. None of the bars have TVs (which was nice). Apparently the Allegro resort has a sports bar nightly from 7pm - Midnight. The nightlife is what you make of it. The Bar Allegro has a different theme nightly (kareoke, disco, name that tune, casino). The service was exceptional. Most people retired early. If you need to check email, they have 2 PCs with internet access available all day. The gym offers treadmills, sitting bikes and a good weight facility. We didn't use the spa however we heard the service was better than expected. The hot tub next to the main pool is the only one that uses hot water. The rest are cold tubs. I would have enjoyed to use one in the smaller pools. The beach is public so people come by from neighboring resorts. I didn't see any locals. On either side of the resort edge are the water sports. The employees would stop walkers to get them to do an activity. That was annoying. The waiter service seemed to begin in the afternoon. In the morning it seemed that you had to get a beverage on your own. They did have the flag system. You had to stumble across it. The flags are by the pool. We went into town to shop. You could walk on the beach or take a taxi for $4. The resort os closest to the side of 5th Avenue that is more run down (or in the process of being rennovated). To find the more modern stores you will need to venture north. Most prices could be negotieted (40-50% off). There is a shopping area across from the hotel (though they don't tell you about it at RH). These stores are all upscale compared to 5th Avenue and the priced are set. We liked the selection here better. I hope this inforamtion is usefull. Believe what you read.

We had a wonderful time, and the service at this resort was impeccable. I read quite a few reviews of this place on this website, and was pretty much at ease about going here. Our room was a basic room, but plenty big for a honeymooning couple. The bathroom was huge and we had a nice sized balcony overlooking one of the relaxing pools. If you go, I don't think I would recommend an oceanview room. As far as I could tell, none of the rooms had true oceanviews. We were in Villa 25 which is the most centrally located one, which was wonderful. Our concierge, Roy, was wonderful. Many people encouraged us to tip while we were there. We did, but we didn't notice any greater service. The great service continued all the time. I would give this resort an \"Excellent\" rating except for a few minor things. The hot tubs were not hot. My wife and I wanted to relax in them and ease the stress from our wedding. The jets are powerful, but the water is the same temp as the pool. Not a terrible criticism. Also, the food wasn't excellent. I loved Azia (Asian cuisine) and Palazzo (Italian cuisine), but Spices (for dinner) and Ventanas weren't the best. Unfortunately, we didn't get to eat at The Grill for dinner, and I had heard this was one of the best. Spices breakfast buffet was wonderful. The snack bar had decent food and decent selections, but it can get old eating lunch here everyday. Please...no more guacamole. The room service food is good, but the selection is very limited. I'm glad we chose this resort. The beach was beautiful and I never thought it was too crowded. This is a topless beach, so be prepared. The wave runners and the parasail boats gave off quite a lot of exhaust, but we dealt with it OK. All of the pools are wonderful, and the staff on the beach was wonderful. Beware that this is Mexico and the sun is very hot. You will get burned if you don't wear sunscreen. Overall, this resort is great. The scenery is beautiful and we had a wonderful time. Manuel, a server at Azia, was fun and he was a great server. Ask for Raul at Palazzo. I had a few criticisms, but we overlooked most of this stuff and allowed ourselves to have a beautiful time.

We started out the vacation at Riu Palace, but it wasn't a great place to be in a wheelchair, no coffee pot in the room, no room service, no independence...too big...too much ground to cover, pool and beach were too far away. It was beautiful, but the room had a terrible musty odor, the air conditioning wasn't effective due to such a small air duct for such a large space. The Hideaway was more expensive, but had room service and a coffee pot and it was way easier to get around. The Hideaway actually has handicap rooms! Nice feature.

I liked the option of having anything I wanted for breakfast, and the food was the same as Ventana's but you could pick from a number of different dishes instead of ordering just one thing. Martin at Spices was an awesome waiter too, we had breakfast with him almost every morning, he was very nice and sweet. I can't get over how everyone was so nice...the grounds keepers said hello every morning and the maid staff was very concious of thier jobs.

Overall, the resort exceeded many of our expectations and provided excellent service. We were very pleased with our choice. I used tripadvisor extensively to research destinations, so I will try to help out others by providing as much detail as possible. First, the grounds are beautiful and very well maintained. RH employees are constantly sweeping, dusting, cleaning, etc. The room was very clean as well. The maid service was good. There was no problem getting plenty of bottled water to stock the fridge, etc. My only complaint in this regard is that they will not stock the fridge with beer, wine, liquor, etc. You have to order individual glasses from room service. This is not a big problem since you can always go to one of the bars or restaurants, but it can be a slight inconvenience. Before we arrived, I e-mailed the resort to let them know it was our honeymoon and to request a king bed in a room that does not face the resorts on either side of RH, and they accomodated my request. They also had a complimentary bottle of champagne in the room with a bowl of fruit. Also, on the second day, the concierge surprised us with a fresh arrangement of flowers for the room, which was very nice. We stayed in building 31 and had a room facing the interior of the resort, very close to the pool and beach. This is important, if you do not want to be disturbed by the music and noice from the neighbor resorts, make sure you request a room that faces the interior of the RH, because around 10 p.m. or so you will hear the disco music, etc. from the other resorts. We had room 3128 and had no problem with noise from other resorts, since we faced one of the courtyards. The atmosphere at RH is very relaxed and peaceful. It is not the place to go if you want to party. Most of the guests were honeymooners or couples celebrating special events. The resort did not feel crowded when we were there, although we did notice a little more activity over the weekend and had to make dinner reservations earlier. Speaking of dinner, the food was very good and the service was even better. Our favorite restaurants were Palazo and Spices. They had the best food and the best views of the ocean. Ventanas was also good, but it had more traditional steak and chicken dishes, which were very well prepared, but nothing that you couldn't also get in the U.S. So we wanted to enjoy something a little different. We did not try Azia because neither of us very big into Asian food. The fish dishes at Palazo and Spices were very fresh, especially the grouper. For breakfast you can go to the buffet in Spices or a la carte in Ventanas. We went to the breakfast buffet for the first few days because it was close to our room and the beach. It was o.k., but not exceptional like the rest of the meals. By the third day, however, we finally went to Ventanas for breakfast and it was outstanding. We went back for all our subsequent breakfasts. The Eggs Benedict and Huevos Rancheros were excellent, along with the fresh pastry. Lunch at the beach grill was very good as well. It is not your typical grill. They have a good variety of food. I enjoyed the fresh Mahi Mahi sandwiches the most. Also, on some nights they will dress-up the grill area and serve dinner there. I was not as impressed with the grill for dinner. The other restaurants do a much better job for dinner. The main bar at the resort has great service as well. We never had an empty glass in front of us. The bar has a fairly subdued atmosphere, and is not too big, but a great place for drinks before or after dinner. Every where you go around the main building at the resort you will see chilled bottles of champagne and glasses. This was very nice. I think we both drank more champage on this trip than we ever had before. Even by the door to enter the fitness center they had chilled bottles of champagne, water and fruit. The fitness center was also well maintained with good machines, treadmills, weights, etc. The beach area is beautiful. The water is magnificent. They provide nice beach chairs and folding shade covers for you on the beach. There was no problem getting chairs on the beach. The pool area is beautiful as well. One large activity pool and one large infinity edge pool. However, you do need to get to the pool by 10 or 11 if you want to get a chair with an umbrella. There are plenty of pool chairs overall, but after a couple days in the sun in Playa, you'll be looking for chairs with umbrellas. Another nice surprise was the saxophone player who strolls around the pool area two or three time a day in the afternoon playing music. There are also two smaller \"hidden\" pools on the grounds and one large pool by the fitness center....more pools than we ever had time to use. We tried most of the water sport they had to offer. We used the sea kayaks (which are free) and the jet skis (which cost $50 per half hour to rent). Had a good time on both. We also took out a Hobie Cat. The Hobie Cats are free to take out, however, you have to pay to take a twenty minute lesson before they let you take them out. That lession is $45. We paid for the lesson and then took one out. Had a good time, but one of the brackets broke while we were out in the ocean. We were able to rig the mast to get back to shore, but it was difficult (suggest you do a quick inspection of the mechanical parts of the boats before you take one out). We also got a day pass to visit the RH sister resort in Cozumel and took the ferry over. We were not very impressed at all with Cozumel or the sister resort. We stayed less than 3 hours in Cozumel before heading back (and only stayed that long because we had to wait for the next ferry). If we had it to do over, we would not have wasted our time going to Cozumel. We also went on the snorkeling trip offered at the RH. A boat takes you out for about a 45 minute trip to a small shallow reef area and you snorkel for about an hour or so. If you've never snorkeled before, it's not a bad beginner trip, but I was not overally impressed. If snorkeling is your thing, you might enjoy a day trip to Cozumel, just don't waste your time gong to the sister resort. It's at least a twenty minute cab ride from the ferry and there are plenty of beaches to snorkel at in Cozumel that are closer and prettier. The snorkeling trip from the RH costs about $40 per person. The resort also offers a dinner show a couple nights a week. We went on Wednesday night. This was about the only thing at the RH I was not impressed with. We left the show early and the food they offer is the buffet style and not at all the same quality as in their restaurants. The next day I actually began to experience some stomach problems which persisted for the rest of the trip (but for that one issue I would have rated the RH a five star). Overall though we had a great honeymoon at the RH and if we had it to do over we would definitely go back. The only thing I would change is that I wouldn't go to the sister Allegro resort in Cozumel and I wouldn't go to the dinner theater. Everything else was beautiful and I cannot stress enough how good the service was. One other thing to point out, although tips are included, we still tipped some of our servers, not always, but especially the first couple nights. I think this helped get better service at times when a particular restaurant or the pool waiters were very busy. We didn't get bad service when we didn't tip for a particular service, but it certainly helped get some extra-special attention at times when things were busy. We booked our vacation through Continental Airlines (on their website), which was the best deal I could find, and had no problems with reservations, transfers, flight, etc. I think that's about it and I hope this helps anyone trying to decide whether this resort is right for them.", "Date": "September 10, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Peoria, IL", "Title": "\u201cAMAZING RESORT!!!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1274495", "Content": "My husband and I researched for months about where to go on our honeymoon.

Live music was a nice treat in all of the restaurants as well. The Allegria Bar is a perfect spot for pre dinner drinks and it is worth taking advantage of the high tea that is served every day between 4:00pm - 6:00pm outside of the main dinning room (tasty sandwiches). The rooms are well appointed with large bathrooms and marble floors. The maid service comes by twice a day with fresh towels. The balconies are generous in size. The property is quite an oasis. I always felt very relaxed when I came back to the hotel from a day out on an excersion. The property had a feeling as though you were in your own little paradise with running water streams, small pools throughout the property and swaying palm trees. The staff are obviously well trained. I found everyone (although I think the front desk staff could be improved) polite, helpful and friendly.

The beach food and drink service was great .. always a waiter or two making rounds, asking you if you need anything. Never a wait for chairs at pool or beach, or a cabana/tent that a beach staff member sets up for you if you need some shade on the beach. Lovely architecture ... impeccably maintained grounds. Loved the private relaxation pools and jacuzzis scattered around the resort... Truly an outstanding, beautiful resort. One note ... our ground floor room did seem a little damp to me - (not shocking, given the tropical, humid climate the resort is located in) .. I asked for a dehumidifier for my room, it was supplied immediately - problem solved. We will definitely go back.

Each villa (with 10-15 rooms) has its own concierge who can arrange just about anything you want. The staff is very friendly (and I think there's more staff than guests at the hotel). The food is excellent for an all-inclusive. No, it's not 5 star gourmet stuff, but it's better than a lot of restaurants I've visited over the years. Each dinner is off a menu--no buffets. The grounds are spacious, but not so big that it takes you 30 minutes to get to the beach. The rooms are great (the bathroom alone is worth the extra cash).Some review said you'd be treated badly if you were under 35. Absolutely not true.

Each room had a nice semi private balcony and a very large bathroom with shower stall, a jacuzzi, and a walk-in closet. Room service was prompt and included. The grounds are manicured gardens with rivers and small water falls traversing the walk ways and bridges. The many secluded relaxing pools seemed to be hidden through out the property and were fun to jump into on your way up from the beach. The actual beach was picturesque with the fine white sand and the turquoise waters providing the ultimate back drop for the days activities. Each day we'd find a palm tree, position chairs under its shade, and simply relax. You'd be occasionally visited by staff checking if you'd like anything. We enjoyed both drinks and food whenever we wanted. The service on the beach was great. And with the bartender a few steps away, you could get anything very quickly since lines never seemed to form.

We got 2 queens instead and not quite sure if they were queens and not doubles. That was a little disappointing. Second, we were in villa 30 and that is directly by the neighboring resort. These resorts are very close to RH and they played loud music until at least midnight. That got a little old. It is not as secluded as they make you think.

We went to the snack bar located at the beach/pool area and had a drink,then went to our room. Our Concierge was Veronica and she greeted us and showed us our suite. WHAT A BEAUTIFUL SUITE!!! Marble floors,king size bed,large bath with separate shower/tub. The meals at this place were all excellent with the presentation and service definitely a 5 star rating. We felt that we gained weight from the food that we ate!!! Beach area was clean and we never had any trouble getting a bench at either the pool or beach areas. Be sure an get your dinner reservations early so you can get in the restaurants to enjoy the meals. You do not need to bring any beach towels as there are supplied to you as often as you need them. We took a taxi ride one afternoon to Playa Del carmen, $5.00 US currency. Spent time on 5th ave. shopping and jewing with the merchants, was fun to people weatch as we saw all kinds of characters. We recommend to anyone thinking about the RH to go for it, sure it is a little more exspensive than some of the other all inclusives, but we enjoyed every minute of our stay at the RH. Went parasailing,rode waverunners on the ocean and went snorkeling fro the Barrakuda dive shop which is located at the RH beach, those cost extra and are not included in the package. I was somewaht dissapointed in the snorkeling trip as I was comparing it to the trip I had taken to Cozumel on another trip, no comparsion, if you want to go snorkeling,book a trip to Cozumel or the cenotes (caves), will be well wort the time.

One, book your dinner reservations for the hotel restaurants early. We had dinner at 10pm each night because taht was the earliest time available and one place we couldn't get into at all. The Italian is the best food by the way, but all the food is actually good. Also, the beach is very very busy and loud surrounded by other big mega resorts. So although Royal Hideaway is small, you would think you were at some giant hotel becuaes of all the noise and commotion.

In a nutshell, this was the best resort I've ever visited and here's why: The sophisticated atmosphere at the RH is accented by first the service, then the food, then the location and pure class of the actual property. Every attention to detail has been given. I think the thing that I'll always remember most is being treated truly as someone special. To avoid redundancy, let me just address a few things that other reviewers didn't; It is so peaceful and quiet on the property. Most of the other guests obviously know how to act in a nice place, so if there were any red necks, they stayed hidden. I was truly sad to leave at the end of our wonderful honeymoon week. There is nothing that I can think of that I would be critical of. A few word of advice for those going to the area. I toured the El Dorado Royale, the Aventura Spa Palace, the Occidental Allegro Cozumel and the OAPalacar while there. I also looked at the other resorts along the Zona Hotelera. None even closely compare to the RH. I am so happy that I spent the extra money and chose it over the others. They are all about the same in one way or another. For day trips, I recommend renting a car and seeing the area on your own. We had such fun touring the Riviera Maya. Take snorkeling equipment and dip into a cenote or lagoon on your own, hop back in and take in some more of the wonderful people and sights. Mexico is a wholly different animal than the sexier Carribean islands, but I truly love it. The people are wonderful and genuine, hard-working folks. There is no resentment toward Americans there. I am an avid runner and I still gained eight pounds in seven days there. That has never happened to me. Finally, to give an example of how one is treated at the RH, I asked my concierge if she could help me locate an out-of-print book on the Mex.Revolution. She went to five bookstores in Cancun on her day off to find it for me. I tipped her well for it, but she insisted that I not, truly sincere that it was her pleasure.

We have already decided we are going back!! We had such an amazing time. The website does not do any justice for the beauty of this place.

And yes, we were give the champagne and hot towels. We were shown to our room after this quick process and our luggage arrived 10 minutes after. Our room was beautiful. All marble, king size cherry wood bed. The bathrooms are huge, with the jacuzzi tub and seperate shower. My husband and I immediately got into our suits and hit the beach. We had no problem getting chaises at the beach. Each day we took turns either laying by the pool or beach (my preferance). We did have trouble finding a spot by the pool if we did not get there early enough. The best part about being by the beach was that if you wanted a drink or food, all you had to do was put your green flag in the sand!! The service at the RH was impeccable!! We felt like pure royalty at this place. Anything you wanted, you got. Since RH is all-inclusive, tipping was included. My husband and I tipped every night at dinner b/c the service was so amazing. The restaurants were all great as well. I do not eat red meat or fish so The Grill was not my favorite but my husband loved the steak. It is hard for me to say which was my favorite because they were all great. The ambiance as well as the actual meal were amazing at all 5 restaurants. At night, there really was not too much going on at the hotel. We didn't really care too much but by the end of the trip, we made friends with a group of 20-somethings like us, so we had a ball at the Allegria Bar. We went into downtown Playa del Carmen two nights, which was a lot of fun. We also each received massages which were excellent!! I just recommend getting them at the end of the trip. We got them our 3rd day and were both sunburned so it was a bit painful. I cannot say enough about this resort. The staff was just incredible. The resort is so meticulous, everyday we saw someone painting, or trimming something. It is so clean.

Meals: The Breakfast buffet at 'Spices' overlooking the Sea/Pool was the most looked forward to meal of the day. Lunch at the pool was a second to breakfast. Other than that, the dinners were good but not the 'best' as others have claimed. What is good about RH is that if you do not like your meal, send it back and order something else.

I just wanted to read quietly)Guests: Most were great, but there are always a few. There were 4 couples in our Villa from Colorado who decided to throw a 'party' each night before dinner and felt it necessary to broadcast this fact via loud music and yelling. Security always seemed to miss them. The same people felt is necessary to play frisbee with the room-service plate covers at 1am -they never seemed actually catch one of them. Then there was that couple from NJ who I (and anyone else within a mile of them) could tell you their life story. God forbid they shut up for a minute.

The bed was a little firmer than I care for. I loved that they brought us fresh towels twice a day.The beach and ocean were beautiful. I was just in Miami last month and was struck by how much cleaner the beach and water were in Playa. I don't usually spend much time in the ocean when I go to the beach, but we spent a lot of time just hanging out in the water as it was so clear and cool. We usually got our own drinks at the bar, but the server came around regularly to see if we needed anything, and often brought me a refill without my asking for it. I appreciated that! Plenty of beach towels provided, so don't bother taking your own. We also never had a problem getting chairs on the beach. Although, by the pool was harder as many people \"claim\" chairs by putting their stuff on the chair and then leaving it all day whether they are actually using it or not. Annoying, but hard to prevent.The restaurants were all nice. Azia and Palazzo were my favorites. Although, if I could have the perfect meal, it might be the sushi from Azia, the crab and shrimp soup at Palazzo, the ravioli at the The Grill, the Tenderloin at Ventana's and the Strawberry Carpaccio at Palazzo. We did get tired of dressing up for dinner every night and having a specific reservation time, and we would like to have seen a wider selection from the room service menu. Other than that, the food was excellent. One caution on the drinks -- they are very strong!Items ineam!!!) , so make sure you don't forget anything or run out.

The beach was great and you could walk forever; however you did walk through other resorts. The resort beachfront was only a few hundred feet wide. There was free internet access and a daily newsheet. Our concierge was helpful and made our dining reservations. The restaurants were lovely and the service and food were excellent, especially the Asian. The beach bar service was slow. The theatre (Mexican night) show was excellent, as was the Mexican buffet that night. We walked into Playa del Carmen one morning for shopping. And there is also shopping across the street in the residential area. All in all, it was a lovely week -- for less money and more ambiance, I would probably go back to the Aventura Palace.", "Date": "April 11, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottsville, PA", "Title": "\u201cRoyal Experience\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR927748", "Content": "We visited the Royal Hideaway March 15 through March 22, 2003. From the moment we arrived we knew we were into something special. The resort is beautiful and tranquil. You feel relaxed the moment you check-in. The resort offers a relaxed, romantic atmosphere and maintains a nice level of elegance and etiquette with their well trained staff. The food at the 4 restuarants was delicious with quick 24-hour room service also available. Royal Hideaway treats their quests with five-star service. The only negative comments are that the hotel could not provide us a room with a king size bed when we had our travel agent e-mail the hotel a number of times with our request. We made the request again upon check-in and then was taken to a room with two beds. I would recommend having rooms with more King size beds since this place is geared more for adults/couples. We did see a few kids around the age of 13 (the hotel does claim to be adults only). Not a bother, however, do wonder if enough families with 13 through 16 year olds were staying at the resort how the atmosphere might change resort is wonderful. It's a great \"get away from it all\" type of place. We hope to return someday. We will recommend it to all of our friends and customers.", "Date": "April 1, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat, Relaxing Vacation\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR924524", "Content": "The facility is beautiful, the food was very good. We especially loved Spices for our morning breakfast by the ocean and it was our favorite for a la carte dinner also. The ocean was stunning and we especially liked the fact that at the Hideaway there are plenty of beach chairs and it was not croweded or loud. We got better service on the beach if you ordered alcoholic drinks or food. For some reason they didn't seem to remember delivery if you wanted pop or water. Other guests said the same. If you are looking for a wild party place this is not it. Very romantic and the perfect place for an elegant, quiet getaway. Due to break we had our older children with us and they also loved it. Rained one a.m. but the resort has lots of quiet spaces, games, videos, library, spa etc to take advantage of. Dinners are long but we liked the variety and the food was good. Service was slow at a few places but the drinks were good and we were not in a hurry. Each had a nice bar to gather at. Rooms were spacious and bathroom was nice. Room service was fast. Checkin and out was very smooth and we used Olympus Tours for transport and they were very good. One day we rented a car and we would not recommend it. Takes to long to get and return. Take a taxi or a tour. Tours can be arranged at the hotels tour office or Olympus has a spot on the lower level. Good idea to check out both before booking. Hotel only refers you to their office on the checkin level.This was our first Mexico vacation so we can't compare to other places but from all we know the Hideaway lived up to expectations and we can recommend it to friends.", "Date": "March 26, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "chicago", "Title": "\u201cPros and Cons...\u201d", "Author": "gailpearc", "ReviewID": "UR915055", "Content": "We just returned from our first trip to Mexico and our first endeavor into the world of all-inclusive resorts, as guests at the Royal Hideawway for a week. Pros: We found the resort to be lovely and elegant. Though the property is new, it boasted more character and architectural integrity than anticipated. We had no complaints about service whatsoever: we found the staff to be charming and exceptionally well trained; the spa professionals, in particular, exceeded our expectations. Staff to guest ratio is good; always present, often anticipating our needs in advance, and always happy to accomodate. We sometimes had cash on hand to tip, sometimes not, and didn't sense any difference in service or attitude regardless. We were looking for a week of relaxation, and lucked into a period wherein the resort was full of couples rather than groups. We are \"foodies,\" and chose this property partially based on the ala carte (rather than buffet) concept. We were delighted by the inventive menus, quality of ingredients, skillful execution and artful presentation. (Azia was our favorite restaurant of the bunch.) If I could leave it at that, I'd give it an unqualified thumbs-up. However....Big Con: Montezuma is a savage! We are not naive as to precautions when traveling to Mexico, but fell victim nonetheless. We have good stomachs, do not over-drink, and did not consume ANYTHING off premises, so something on premises had to be amiss. Though we consciously drank only bottled water, on the first night, out of habit we brushed our teeth with tap water (though the resort boasts a purification system, it's quite possible it's not up to snuff). At any rate, we quickly realized what we'd done and hoped for the best. However, two days later, our stomachs were touchy and cramped, and by that point, we knew not whether it was from the tap water two days prior, or from something we had eaten since. By the fourth day, we were spending almost of all of our time in the bathroom, where I ended up doubled over, completely incapacitated. My husband was equally ill on the fifth day. Both of us required medical attention, which was arranged for promptly by our conscierge, was quite competent, and did the trick as to the immediate severe discomfort of the bacterial infection. (I required an iv, he required a shot, and both of us spent the rest of our week on antibiotics). However, we continued to suffer mild to moderate lower g.i. issues for the rest of our stay, alongisde some basic paranoia over what in the world we should consume and what to avoid, particularly when all other guests seemed happy and healthy. Would we return? Since all other factors were so exceptional, I'd love to think we could give it another try without incident. But regrettably, that would be difficult, given what we went through.", "Date": "March 13, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Des Moines, IA", "Title": "\u201cCannot please everyone\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR860405", "Content": "You cannot please everyone. This resort is absolutely wonderful, spectacular in service and food. However, if it's a beach you are looking for, I suggest Barcelo Maya. The beach is very small, but highly swimmable, if there is such a word. As another review stated, the resort got crammed in with other resorts, a shame.. The food was outstanding, the service friendly, thorough, everyone spoke English, not that you should expect that. The pizzas were.. blah, but why would you go to Mexico and expect Italian?!?! This resort is highly recommended to those that want pampering.. however, to those who want an ocean, or not to see/hear people from neighboring resorts.. I reccomend staying elsewhere. For the differences in price, we're going to look elsewhere in that area.. No wristband is necessary, the grounds are great.. what a nice place... a shame they could not have bought more land for privacy and that \"exclusive\" feel.", "Date": "February 23, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lake City, South Carolina", "Title": "\u201cWonderful\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR856835", "Content": "Was the most wonderful trip I have ever taken..
