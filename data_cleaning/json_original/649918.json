The many positive reviews about the hotel here on TripAdvisor convinced me to book it for my vacation to Istanbul. Reserving the room prior to arrival was easy, with all of my e-mails answered promptly by the hotel staff. Upon arrival, the hotel was only a 5 minute walk from the Sultanahmet tram stop. Breakfast every morning consisted of sliced meats and cheeses, sliced tomatoes and cucumbers, dry cereals, dry and fresh fruit, hard-boiled eggs, breads and pastries, GREAT coffee, tea, juice, olives, fresh yogurt, and several jams and spreads. The small but cozy room featured cold air-conditioning, great water pressure in the shower with ample hot water, good sheets on the bed and towels in the bathroom, and Turkish and English (CNN, BBC) channels on the television. The hotel, open since 2005, is overall very clean throughout. Upon check-out, I received a 15% discount on the 60 Euro a night rate for being a follower of Rick Steves and showing his Istanbul guidebook during the check-in process. I am very satisfied that I stayed in this hotel for nine nights, and would readily recommend this hotel to anyone looking to travel to Istanbul. However, this hotel may not be suitable for persons with mobility issues, as the hotel only has stairs and does not have an elevator. Also, anyone with insomnia may not want to choose this hotel, as the last call to prayer at the Blue Mosque next door is around 9:30 pm at night, with the first call to prayer around 5:30 am in the morning. Finally, there are some dilapidated buildings in the immediate vicinity of the hotel, but it is my understanding that these will soon be upgraded. However, the hotel's location still felt and was very safe. TripAdvisor currently rates this hotel around #100 of around 700 hotels in Istanbul. There is no doubt in my mind that if the wonderful staff of Hotel Sultan Hill continues to perform at the level that I experienced during my stay, this hotel will soon be a Top 25 hotel in Istanbul.", "Date": "April 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Island of Malta, Malta", "Title": "\u201cGood value and great location\u201d", "Author": "Maltaswede", "ReviewID": "UR127785132", "Content": "This hotel has an amazing location - you are within close walking distance of the Blue Mosque, Haya Sofia, Grand Bazaar, Topkapi Palace.

I had a nice clean room with plenty of space for my needs, it felt very much like a step back in time to the Ottoman era with the furnishings and woodwork. The street where it is located also feels historic. The carpet shop folks never gave me the hard sell, just a hello as I walked by--after many trips to Turkey I know how to turn off the sales pitch with a smile and determined walk and look. Do take in a shop or two though, I buy something special each trip and have it shipped home--it always arrives quickly and I have made some great friends who work in the shops. Get beyond the sales game and you often find some very good people, remember they are just trying to make a living to support their families. The breakfast is basic, but included free.

I didn't care that I could hear plates and such during breakfast time, it was very slight, and never woke me. The AC was quiet and worked great! The bathroom huge and tons of water pressure, consistent temperature, plenty of towels and such. Excellent. Very comfy bed, nice and firm, I got lots of good rest. Staff: brilliant, Tarek, and Gokhan (Ghek-Han) were fabulous. Setting up shuttle and such to/from airport and recommending good places to eat, laundry etc... Location: right next to Sofia and Blue Mosque, a short walk to everything interesting. Then take the Tram or taxi to Taksim which is amazzzzzzing at night. Taxi to Taksim, by the way from the hotel should be 10 to 12 TL. Anything more is a big red flag, careful! Laundry: the place I went to was upstairs in what looked like a private home, the clothes came back ... kind of clean ? The smelled like smoke, actually because after being washed... they sat in a smoky room. Brilliant. Anyway, they were actually washed and had hints of 'clean' smell mixed with fresh smoke :-) I wouldn't recommend that one (it says \"laundry\", up a small dark staircase. The hotel correctly no longer sends out laundry, too many missing or dirty items ... WiFi: great anywhere, they have multiple hotspots, just pick the right one. So nice to have reliable wifi after Paris :-) Airport Transfers: hotel charges 60 EUR for a private ride from SAW (not IST, that's much cheaper) but you can always get a shuttle for much less (10EUR from SAW), it'll take you longer. Call the hotel and get their shuttle recommendation. The one I used sometimes doesn't show up, fyi. Taxi: SCAM ALERT !!!! Some (very few) taxi's will steal your money running a scam I embarrassingly fell for. You give him a 50 TL bill which looks just like a 5, he slaps his hand starts yelling at you and turns around with a 5, you get nervous and doubt yourself, all the other taxi guys were great right? (he's big with a big voice, you're in the middle of traffic with cars honking, cigarette smoke in the car, you want to get out ASAP), and hand him another bill, he does the same thing... anyway, YES I feel like an idiot for getting pressured and not hearing my intuition, ... lost 100 TL for a ride that should have cost 12 TL. Ugh, what a loser... fate will find him, I'm sure. Ice Cream mini-scam: some of the flamboyant turkish-icecream vendors (they wear a red cap and use a big metal stick to mix their ice cream for some reason) will charge you 20 TL for two cones... that's $14 US dollars... for two cones. That's $7 a cone. Have you ever paid $7 for a scoop of ice cream, anywhere ? Careful, confirm price first or just let it go. Some local turkish coffee was crap, by the way (sour, probably because tourists can't tell the difference), I'd recommend trying several places, and heading out of the Sultanahmet area (only tourists go there, no turks eat or drink there). The nearby restaurant (tamara something?) was very very good, fyi. Also try Sultanahmet Koeftacici (something like that) across the street from the tram rails, at the east end of the hypodrome park, amazing koefta (kafta), crowded, fast service.

First off, let me say that I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think that you can find a better location in Istanbul. You are right in the heart of the Sultanahmet area. The hotel is right behind the Blue Mosque and around the corner from the Hippodrome.

It is all part of the charm of being in Istanbul and I found it to be not nearly as much of a concern as I had anticipated it might be. If this concerns you, a set of earplugs will take care of it. From the hotel you are in easy walking distance to the Blue Mosque, Aya Sofia, Topkapi Palace, Grand Bazaar, Spice Bazaar, Galata Bridge and many other sites. You are also a very short walk to the tram stop. What a great location! My room was very nice and very clean. While small by American standards, I thought is a decent size compared to other rooms I have had throughout Europe. The bathroom was clean and modern and the shower and water pressure worked perfectly. The two young men who worked at the reception desk were both very nice and helpful. The hotel manager, Sedat, was also very personable, kind and helpful. All of them spoke very good English. The hotel has a great rooftop terrace which to my surprise did not get utilized by guests as much as it should. In any event, I spent some time up there every day. It provides a terrific view of the Blue Mosque, which is right next to the hotel, the Bosphorus and the Sea of Marmara. In the distance you have a good view of the Princess Islands. I got some great photos from the terrace. Breakfast is served downstairs in the breakfast room. It is a simple buffet, nothing fancy, but certainly adequate to start the day. There were hard boiled eggs, breads, toast, cold cuts, cheese, olives, cakes, yogurt, cereal, as well as coffee and tea. The two women who manage the breakfast room were both very nice.
