The stairs is covered by a carpet that is worn through so you can see the underlying staircase. Everything is dirty and smelly. Breakfast is included in the price, I skipped that one voluntarily, considering the standard of everything else in the hotel I definitely do not want to eat something there. I never saw any other guests there, my guess is that the people that book this hotel either immediately leave the hotel and go somewhere else (and hence have to pay for 2 hotels since you have to pay in advance for your room when you book it on the phone), or they do what I did: Pack all valuables in the knapsack and immediately leave the hotel and try to stay out as long as possible since you definitely want to spend as little time as possible in this hotel. It is obvious that the hotel room has been broken into several times, and the hotel owners have tried to prevent that it would happen again by attaching a metal frame. The metal frame is severely bent from the front side of the doors and it looks like there have been attempts to break in after the metal frame was there. The shower in the room was totally rotten and stinks, I never used it. The toilet is not in the room, its down the hallway, with a door that leaves a 8 cm gap if you try to close it and it STINKS from urine. I used the toilets at Burger King during daytime, rather than going into the hotel's disgusting toilet. This pillow was probably white once upon a time, I do not want to know where all the spots comes from, nor how many unidentified kinds of animals that lives in the pillow. The rest of the bed sheets were full of holes, but looked at least clean. The blankets and pillows were disgusting.

The tub/shower in our bathroom had no curtain to keep the water in nor a drain on the floor.... so if anyone took a shower, you walked in stagnant deeply pooled water on the floor to use the bathroom or used your bath towels to dry and wring it.

No elevator and very steep narrow flights of stairs... no bellboys so you carry your own luggage yourself.

It was gone when we got to breakfast althogh it was well within the posted breakfast hours! The manager insisted on prepayment and cash only- no credit cards, and kept wanting to raise the prices.

Amsterdam is one of our favourite places in the world. We like to travel on a budget but don't put up with crap just to get the cheapest price. We stayed at the Hotel Impala for the 4th night of our 4 night stay. We're not generally fussy but this was the 4th different room in 3 different Hotels. The first was disgustingly dirty with 'surprises' under the bed, the second was ok but after one night they moved us to a room with a waterbed which was deflated and didn't help with a nights sleep despite an extra dose of Super Silver Haze to get us off ? Then we came accross the Hotel Impala. The first thing that struck us was the friendliness of the staff, yes I know all the Dutch seem to be friendly but these were particularly nice. The Hotel was clean enough and, after we had climbed the 2 flights of narrow stairs to our 4 bedded room (it was all they had available for the two of us), we were pleasantly surprised. The carpets on the way up and in some of the other rooms left a lot to be desired but they seemed clean. Our room, however, had a laminate flloor, a reasonably comfortable bed, a very nice clean bathroom and a stunning view. The walls could do with a coat of paint, there is a balcony with 2 big opening doors that you can't walk out of because it's not safe, an old fireplace which could be lovely, nowhere to hang your clothes or make a cup of tea but a window that fully opens up to leave what must be one of the best Canal views in Amsterdam. After a hard days exploring it was lovely to get back to the room, open up the windows and sit having a drink and a smoke whilst watching the world go by. Then, when we got in after a night out we'd open up the windows and enjoy the serenity. If you're travelling on a budget, you don't expect luxury and can put up without being able to hang your clothes up then this could be the place for you. Even the American Hotel, 100m down the road hasn't got a view like this one which is Worth the stay on it's own.
