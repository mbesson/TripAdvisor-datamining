The truth is simple, you get excellent value for money. It's 50 meters from the termini station, which makes it very easy to reach from any airport. It's in the centre of Rome, even if you don't rent a scooter, like we did, you can easily reach a lot of places by foot, and the others by metro or bus, both of which are at termini station. Our room was small but clean. The bathroom is not luxurious but it had a decent shower. The breakfast is Italian style, simple but more than enough with perfect coffee. In short, you get excellent value for money!", "Date": "June 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sao Paulo, SP", "Title": "\u201cYou get what you paid for\u201d", "Author": "Carolina-SP-Brazil", "ReviewID": "UR108998930", "Content": "The hotel shares a building with other hostels and is located only one block away from the Termini station, where you can take the subway or buses to the city attractions or a train to other locations in Italy. Staying close to the train station has its downsides, so we didn't feel very safe on the streets at night. The room was very simple and the mattresses were old, quite uncomfortable. Our room was in the first floor, so we could hear everything from the reception all night long. The shower is European style and, although they had the metal bar on the wall, it wouldn't stay fixed. Cleanness of the room could be improved, there was a leaf on the floor when we arrived, and it was there when we left 3 days later. They wouldn't change the towels, even when we complained that they hadn't dried from the previous day. Breakfast is included in the rate, but if you go late there will be almost nothing left. The rates that we got were very cheap compared to other budget hotels in Rome, so I can say that it delivered what we paid for.", "Date": "May 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cgreat location for accessing Rome\u201d", "Author": "Kay004", "ReviewID": "UR51499221", "Content": "We stayed for 2 weeks.
