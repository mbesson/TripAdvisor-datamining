I was certainly not disappointed with the hotel itself - the decor is very modern, the staff were friendly and the hotel was clean. The only drawback was that on arrival we were told that to access our room (which was on the second floor) we couldn't use the main lifts - so we had to go through the bar, up a flight of stairs (we had to lift our heavy cases) and along a corridor to find another (very small) lift that we could use. But the room itself was nice and has all the usual facilities. As for the location.......... Well, the hotel is in a very industrial part of the town and although it is only a couple of streets back from the beach you have to walk past multiple car dealerships, garages, warehouses, etc. which was fine during the day but not so nice late at night (we got the train back from barcelona pretty late and felt at bit uneasy walking back from the station, which is next to the beach - there were a few shady characters hanging around) It was easy enough to get to Barcelona (about half an hour on the train) but due to a problem with the trains (system failure at the station, nobody knew what train was going where, no staff in station, everybody jumping on a train to god-knows-where at the last minute and hoping for the best!) we were lucky to get back that night. If you need to stay in a mataro then I would definitely recommend this hotel, but if you are wanting to spend time in Barcelona I'd suggest you find somewhere a bit closer", "Date": "August 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel and value for money\u201d", "Author": "jp007", "ReviewID": "UR4472974", "Content": "We came upon this hotel by chance and how lucky we were.
