The forecast was calling for rain so we needed something that would provide a lot of indoor fun. The package deal at the Grand Country Inn offered the perfect solution! It was a great value paying only $318 for two nights, two shows, free pizza, indoor mini golf and a game card. The package also included the indoor water park, which we did not visit because our 12 year old doesn't like to swim. But even without taking advantage of the water park, we still got a great value for our money. We found the pet show and comedy show both very entertaining. The deal came with vouchers for two large pizzas which our family of three used to cover lunch the two days we were there. I enjoyed the convenience of staying somewhere that provided entertainment and shopping and food all in one location where we didn't have to get in the car and fight traffic going from one place to the next. And while the hotel room wasn't anything fancy, it was clean and we didn't have any complaints. Check in and check out were both very quick and the staff seemed very friendly. We will definitely keep this place in mind for future vacations especially when the weather is cold or wet.

We did not stay at the hotel, but paid for the water park twice in one week. I went with my five year old, and somehow we were kept busy for about four hours each time. Our red hair keeps us inside during the prime summer hours, so this was a great find for us. We spent lots of time going down the two tube slides; we also liked the lazy river and pool with three basketball hoops and many balls. There were three rope/ cargo nets to climb- I'd recommend water shoes, since the ropes kind of hurt. Watch out for surprise water dumpings from kids playing above you. Every 5 - 10 minutes, the big bucket of water dumps out, and that is fun to watch. I could sit in one of the two hot tubs and watch my daughter when I tired of playing with her. We played outside a little bit; for some reason my daughter loved the frog slide. They provide dry towels inside, and there's a concession stand and area for people just to watch. There were lots of elementary age kids, and a handful of teens, but I'd say this attraction is best suited to younger kids and 'tweens. I saw many younger kids who were disappointed that they weren't tall enough for the slides. The outside area and lazy river were still options for them.

We took advantage of the all inclusive food by eating all our meals at the resort except for Dixie Stampede. All the employees were very nice and after the first day knew us by name. Grand Buffet wasnt Vegas great but was good. Kids 10 and 15 loved the idea that they could go to the pizza joint or hamburger stand and order what they wanted anytime they wanted. Loved the shows. New South the headliner is a very good quartet. The fiddle player in the band played the 2nd best fiddle I have ever heard second to Charlie Daniels. Kids loved the pet show and the comedy show was decent as well. Our seats for every show were either center front or center 2nd row. Great seats. Also the seat for Dixie Stampede were priority seats which was awesome. Room was ready at 300pm just as they said it would be. My youngest daughter loved the waterpark. She spent alot of time in the inside one course she was there to sneak burgers too. Only two complaints were that the carpent was wet under the air conditioner. Im sure caused by the door being open during made service. Was dried up and had no other problems. Second complaint is that if your gonna have all inclusive then dont limit the entertainment to mini golf only. Laser tag and bumper cars would have been nice for the kids.

The rooms were clean a little out dated style wise but everyone worked and felt great. We spent 2 days enjoying the indoor & outdoor waterpark as well as the individual pools for our building. The only downside that I found was the lack of follow through on some of the rules. As an example, in the Indoor waterpark there are 2 hot tubs. One is slightly cooler than the other. The very first thing that the rules say is children are only allowed with an adult in the lower hot tub but while I was in the lower hottub with my daughter there were at least 8 unsupervised children in the upper hot tub. I know it said no lifeguard on duty back there but someone in management should have done something to keep them out. Fun We played mini-golf one night at the 3-D Black Light mini golf course. It was a lot of fun. Definitely remember to bring your guest card for that game discount. We didn't get to play the laser tag or the bumper cars but we did enjoy all the arcade games at the Fun Stop.

The bathroom was spotless and the water pressure awesome! The rooms were clean, the sheets soft and it smelled wonderful. We asked for a non-smoking room and there was NO smoke residue in our room. The waterpark was clean and fun. My kids were five and eleven and they both loved it. The deepest water in either waterpark was about 3 feet so I felt confident that both kids were fine, although I was with the youngest the entire time. Even I rode the waterslide, to the kid's amazement. They have towels at the pool area and a locker room to change clothes. The kids loved the lazy river and the giant dumping bucket the most. We saw the Amazing Animal show and the Jubilee show. Both were very family friendly and the kids absolutely loved the animal show. We rode the bumper cars, and although the rink was very small, it was perfect for my five year old. We played glow in the dark mini golf and they just loved it and my 11 year old played laser tag; the first game he loved the second game he was competing with kids a lot older than him and didn't enjoy it so much. We ate dinner at the buffet the first night and it was okay. Similar to Golden Corral. I imagine it would be perfect for breakfast but we did not eat there again. The two pizzas that came with our package were delicious. We attended the kid's party at the Fun Spot in the evening and the kids really enjoyed it. They had cake and popcorn and played in the ballilator. They both won a prize in the balloon drop. It made for a late night but hey, we were on vacation. The only negative about the balloon drop is for the over five section there were some very agressive adults, I felt it should have been regulated to kids 16 and under because the grown ups didn't play well with others. This isn't a luxary resort, it is all about the kids really. Which was exactly what I was looking for and I was not disappointed.

One issue was that it took a while to figure out how to use the air conditioner, which had it's control panel partially removed. After some confusion and a call to the front desk, we realized the window AC was controlled by a nearby the wall thermostat. The included water park was fun, very similar to a Great Wolf Lodge minus the bigger slides. My only complaint was that the baby pool was segregated off in a corner, making it harder to keep track of multiple kids wanting to do different stuff. On the plus side, we did appreciate the kid safe \"hot tub\". I suggest avoiding the Grand Country Buffet, which is discounted, but not included with the room.

I finally decided to write the good and bad of this hotel because I was a little hesitant after reading everyone else's mixed reviews. We had the spring break package, which included 1 room for 2 nights, round of 18 hole mini-golf, $10 at the arcade, 2 shows, free coffee/tea/pop and 2 pizza coupons. When we pulled up I was a little turned off. While the property is large and seemingly inviting, I was disappointed to find that the rooms were drive-up motel style. The reason this caught my eye was for safety purposes and safety purposes alone. Hotel does not do anything special for visiting on a special occasion (my husbad and I were celebrating an anniversary) and that was a little disheartening. Glad the hotel had my reservation correct because the hotel does not send confirmation emails. They just give you the confirmation on the phone. Building--We were told we were in Building 3, which was on the other side of the property. There was minimal signage and when we got to our building it said Building A. It was difficult to figure out where our room was because one side of the builing was evens and the other was odds, but it didn't make sense and our room was down a corridor that we couldn't see from the road. It would have been VERY helpful to have a map of the property and also of the building layout given to us at check-in. We had to explore each building ourselves and had a long walk to the water park. Our King non-smoking room was very spacious and the bathroom was the biggest I've seen. The lock system is a little outdated as they use actual hard keys and not key cards. The blinds in the room could use improvement as there is only one set of blinds and no sheers, meaning that you had to be extremely careful to close them all the way shut or passerbys would be able to stare into your room. The ice machine and pop machines were not well identified and we had to guess where they were. Arcade and other fun things on the property--The arcade was a tad small, but would have been better for little kids. Some seemingly unwinnable games and not too many adult games. They could expand the arcade area, or simply increase the number of games to fully utilize their space. The black-light mini-golf was fun, but short-lived. They had bumper cars on the 2nd level of the arcade, but it was small and difficult to manuever if every car is taken. The mirror maze wasn't utilized much and we never got a chance to play laser tag, as we think we would have been the only ones in there. The pizza was great and I loved that they had an ice-cream parlor on property also. We went exploring and found (on our own) that there was another indoor mini-golf course, but we were not made aware of this. The country store was nice. We never went to any of the shows although we had paid for them because they were not of interest to us. The waterpark was very far away from our building and we felt out of place as the only 2 adults without kids. Definitely geared towards families, but would've been better if they had an adult only pool/lazy river. There are no extras, like payper view movies or room service. Didn't see a fitness center on site. No easy way to checkout (no quick dropbox) and you have to go over to the front desk to hand over your keys. To sum up my long and dragged out review, the room/bathroom were spacious, the rooms/key system were a little outdated, the arcade was small and the pizza was good. You can't beat the price we paid for as many extras as we had. Would definitely recommend this hotel for families with kids.", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Van Buren AR", "Title": "\u201cMarginal\u201d", "Author": "Cecil B", "ReviewID": "UR127957858", "Content": "Water park was OK, staff was courteous and attentive.

The Grand Country Inn offers a mini vacation by itself. LOCATION is key! You can walk to other eating places; gas station & Tanger Mall is around the corner (my hubby and I would take turns shopping at the mall while the other watched the kids in the waterpark). BUFFET at the Country Inn has so many choices; even for picky eaters ($4 for kids & $8 for Adult lunch or $12 for dinner (ribs). A healthy meal once a day is key! ENTERTAINMENT at the Inn is extensive. The Pet show is one of the best to take young kids although the 10am show may seem too early if you've spent way too much time at the pool the night before. Although we are not big Country Fans, the Grand Jubliee Show offers a lot for the price. The 2 hr show even has a 15 min bathroom break & a chance to get photos with the stars! Small theatre so you can actually see the show! The new Fun Spot has all the arcade games; jumpy gym for tots and a pizza buffet that was inexpensive & tasty. Ask & they will make any type of pizza for you. (OR Order a pizza to go & take back to your room.) Beware of large groups & the arcade is a bit noisy & dark (keep an eye on your kids!) Teens and adults couldn't get enough from the games! You can't beat the prices if you have tots or kids under 10 that love to swim & play; then this is the place for you! The Indoors Waterpark is a great way to relax in the lazy pool while your kids climb up the tower & try to dump the water bucket. Sure, the pool can be cleaner & some parents need to be reminded of SWIM diapers but overall if you want to chill out with your family, bring a cooler & enjoy the Inn. From teens to tots, this place offers everything for a family. Even if you don't go to the local shows (a bit pricy & mostly for adults), you can still shop at the Tanger Outlet Mall, Zipline down the street or walk around. If the weather is bad you still have enough to do at this place without driving around town and sitting in your room watching tv. ***County Inn is huge & offers many choices for rooms. Pay more $$ if you want to be next to the waterpark (usually first floor rooms next to pool. Worth it if you have small kids or don't want to walk that far). Mostly families with tots & babies reserve these rooms so don't expect peaceful sleep. If you want quiet- ask to stay on the other side of the parking lot usually reserved for tour buses. A bit of a walk for pool, meals or shows but worth the peace & quiet (no babies:-)Reserve a mini frig or microwave; pack your cooler or go to walmart up the street to stock up on snacks. You can bring drinks to the pool but in plastic containers. Always ask for extra towels & coffe packs when checking in. Bring your own amenities--do you Really use the hotels shampoo or soap? No matter where we stay (now that kids are older, trying to experience different hotels) we always end up at this place for the Buffet, Waterpark, Fun Spot or shows. It's not a 4 or 5 star resort but a family fun place to relax & enjoy a cocktail (BYO), hang out with the kids at the pool, enjoy a healthly meal & Relax! You're on VACATION so Enjoy... Oh!

I chose to stay at the Grand Country Inn because of the indoor swimming park and the special package they offered for that week. The positives: Because it rained the entire time (4 days) we were there, it was a blessing to have so many indoor activities to do in one spot. The kids enjoyed several hours of the indoor park the first night after a 2 1/2 hour drive getting there. And, even though it was Spring Break, it was not as crowded as I was prepared for. The Lazy River was small, but the kids seemed to enjoy that part the most. I even got in once and jogged behind the 5 year old for a little exercise and then took a dip in one of the two hot tubs to warm up. The Fun Spot (arcade center) was also a hit with the kids that first night. You purchase a swipe card that the kids can use in all of the arcade games and bumper cars. They then can win tickets which you then in turn put into a counting machine which puts points back onto your card for prizes (cheapy prizes like you would win at the county fair). There is also a section for smaller kids like a rumpus ball zone which my 5 year old stayed in the entire two hours we were there. Between 10pm and 11:30pm, they offer free deserts and drinks and then at the end they drop balloons from the ceiling for \"prizes\". Tons of people and none of us found a balloon with a prize. However, I spent a lot of cash between 10:30 and 11:30 for free treats and a balloon drop (LOL). The kids did have fun and it was a time killer in bad weather. Also included in the package I purchased was two large one topping pizzas at the Fun Spot which we took advantage of on the second night. The 16 year old claimed it was the best pizza she had ever had. I took advantage of the salad bar which was also good. We also received a card which entitled us to free tea or coffee throughout our stay at the Buffett or Fun Spot. One of our dinners was at the Grand Country Buffet. I have to say it is one of the best buffets I've had. There was a large salad bar, many meats and vegetables to choose from and the best Honey Bisquits EVER - Yumm. Prices I believe were around $10 for adults $8 for children then about $2 for sodas (I forgot about the tea card that night). It ended up an expensive dinner for us but it was good. We also ate there our last morning for a big breakfast buffett before one of the shows we were going to see (in the same building). The breakfast was excellent! It held us through the show, lunch time and the long drive home. The shows were a little hokey but again, fun for the kids and it was something to do and not be in the rain and the tickets were included as part of the package. We saw the Amazing Pets show and The Comedy Jamboree. Be sure to get your tickets ahead of time as they do sell out. I reserved our tickets at least two weeks ahead of time but ended up changing days/times later to accommodate a trip to Silver Dollar City on the one nice day of our trip. Therefore, our seats ended up towards the back of the seating area and it was a little hard for the kids to see without standing up. (They do have booster seats at the front by the doors - grab one for the smaller kids as you are ushered to your seat). Now the Negative: While the room seemed very clean, I woke up to find about 4 ants crawling on the counter top in the bathroom area. I'm from the country and recognize that all the rain will bring them out of the ground especially in the Spring so it really wasn't a big deal to me. I called the front desk so they could address it while we were shopping on our first morning there. We came back to a spotless room and I never saw another ant the rest of the stay. We were put in Bldg #3 which is at the very back and down a small hill. It is a little walk to all the activities and other bldgs and probably would not have been an issue during warmer weather as I do like to walk but.....it was rainy and cool so we had to get in and out of the van and drive anytime we wanted to do something. That said, the first night back, there was no parking spot available since we stayed at the Fun Spot until midnight so I had to park at the edge of the parking lot. Still not a problem just a little worrisome that somebody might back into my vehicle. And last but not least, while it seemed inconvenient that we were stuck at the back, the regular swimming pool bldg was right beside us and the kids took advantage of it the last two nights and chose to swim instead of going to the water park. I could actually step out of the room and look into the windows of the swimming pool bldg and keep an eye on the older ones. While there is nice warm clean towels provided at the water park, we found out the hard way that there are none provided at the swimming pool. Cold, wet walk back to the room. Because they do allow the kids to have such late night activities, they do tend to come back to their rooms hooping and hollering down the exterior walkway. I have taught my kids to be respectful of the time and that others might be sleeping and I think they now know why since they were also woke up twice the first night by kids who were not being kept under control by their parents. I would NOT stay here if you are adults on a trip for peace and quiet!

We purchased the Spring Deal listed on their web site. For the past 6 years we have spent spring break at the Great Wolf Lodge either in Kansas City, KS or in Mason, OH. We decided to try something different this year when we priced 2 night stays at Great Wolf ($500+). My wife hated the thought of going to Branson, because she thought the town portrayed people from Missouri & Arkansas as all being hillbillies. She was amazed at the variety of attractions, shops and dining options. Check-in at Grand Country was fast and efficient. We were lucky to be placed in a room on the first floor in building #1 which is the closest building to the indoor water park. (Buildings 2 and 3 are a decent walk across the parking lots). Our motel room was clean and moderately sized. Keep in mind that this place was built back in the 60s or 70s, if not earlier, so the rooms are not be huge. My wife, 8 year old son, and I had plenty of room walking and lounging in the room. It was nice being able to park our car right outside the door. The place was quiet and we did not hear any noise from our neighbors on either side of us or above us. The waterpark was nice, but definitely smaller than Great Wolf. Our son loved the water park. The place is densely laid out with a lot of activities in a smaller area. It was nice being able to sit in one spot and be able to watch him at each of the areas, instead of having to shadow him through out Great Wolf. The water was warm and clear. There was not a strong chlorine smell. Our skin and eyes did not burn after being in the water (like the Great Wolf in KCKS). The place was clean and maintained better than most modern municipal water parks. We went to the water park for about 2 hours at a time and then would leave to do another activity. Our package included 2 one toppping pizzas at the pizza parlor within the complex. The pizzas were about 14 inches. One pizza was enough for all 3 of us to eat for a meal. We ate a dinner and a lunch at the pizza parlor, so this was a great value. The package also included a $10 card to the arcade within the complex. The arcade is smaller than a Chuck E Cheese, but had a fair amount of games. Our son had fun using the arcade card. There are 2 different indoor miniature golf courses within the Grand Country complex. We used our miniature golf voucher to play the regular course. There is a black light course in the video arcade area. We had fun playing indoor miniature golf. We saw 2 shows as part of the purchased package. The first show we watched was the Comedy Jamboree. This is a great show for the family. It is more of a variety show than just a bunch of comedians standing up on stage telling jokes. There is a lot of audience participation. The 2 hosts are funny. The vocalists, band and dancers are very talented. The jokes are clean and appropriate for everyone. I would see this show again. The second show that we watched was the Amazing Pets show. Our son, who loves animals, liked the show. I thought that the talent was B grade. My wife and I felt we were watching auditions for Americas Got Talent. The host/comedian was not that great of a magician. His jokes did not get big laughs. The animal talent was pretty good, but we have seen better animal shows at other places. We did not feel that it would be worth the $70 admission if we had purchased tickets. Overall, I would recommend this place to family and friends. If you require a place similar to a Hilton or Hyatt, then do not book a trip here. This place is less than half the cost of going to Great Wolf Lodge and the package included a lot of activities. Keep in mind that this is Branson and so the buildings are going to be older. The Grand Country Inn complex is large and well maintained. We had fun at the water park, playing miniature golf, hanging out in the game room, and watching the Comedy Jamboree show.

I would definitely not stay at this hotel again. Check in was good, very quick and the staff was courteous. However, I'm not sure why we were given a room on the second floor when there were plenty of rooms on the first floor. There were no elevators and with small children stairs can be a challenge. This hotel is set up more like the older hotels and you enter straight from outside and there is a large window, so of course you hear every little sound from the outside. Many times during the night I hear other guest coming up the stairs and walking to their rooms. When we first walked in the room we were immediately greeted by the stench of chlorine and an old foot locker. The bathtub was very slow to drain, so while showering you have to stand in 3 inches of water. The beds were firm so if you like that they would be fine, however they hurt my back. The room is also advertised as a room for up to five people, however there are only 2 queen beds and if you want a roll away you have to rent it for $10 a night. We just had our 3 little ones sleep in one of the beds. The water park, if you want to call it that, is very small. The water seemed pretty cold, however I'm sure kids don't seem to mind. Kids were jumping in the \"adult only\" hot tub. My husband went to get a staff member and they were very helpful and told the kids to stop and get out of the hot tub (not sure where their parents were). Actually our kids preferred the indoor pool that is in a separate building and closer to the building we were staying in, which we preferred as well. The indoor pool was nice and the water was warm and not a lot of people were ever in there. We ate at the Country Buffet and kids really like it. It was a normal buffet so you can't expect really good food, but it was okay. Our server was very friendly and attentive. I wish I could remember her name. She told the kids to call Mamaw. We walked around they offered indoor mini golf, but our children are really too young to play so we passed on it. They also have a large arcade area but again we didn't participate in it. All the staff we encountered at the hotel were very friendly, however it doesn't counter the nasty rooms and I also don't think the water park is worth it.

It didn't start until 10pm so it was a late night, but we got to do the laser tag and it was so much fun. The next day we went back and did the bumper cars, arcade, mini bowling and ball pit. Kept the kids busy for hours! We ate at the pizza buffet, and it was awesome, they made our favorite pizza to order and also had soup and salad that was fresh and delicious. We also ate at the Breakfast Buffet in the morning and it was delicious. Fresh with lots of choices. My husband said his made to order omelet was the best he ever had. We saw the Amazing Pets show. It was geared for kids, but the comedian/magician kept it interesting and amusing for everyone. The waterpark was better than I expected, although the lazy river was freezing. The kids were there for a total of 8 hours and didn't want to leave. The rooms were average hotel rooms, but the beds were quite comfy.

They asked to go back the next day. We played the black light 3D putt putt and had a good time! We enjoyed their decor and themes. We played bumper cars, and for $5 each I wish they would have lasted a little longer, but it was very fun. The room was suitable, as we were rarely in it. Their pillows are the best I have ever had in a hotel, and beats mine at home! The location was prime. The food was superior. I advise you not be on a diet while there, though they have plenty of low fat and low carb alternatives. But the temptation to dig into all their offerings was strong! Everyone else had tried their pizza, though not the buffet. They all enjoyed the pizza and said it ranked as one of the highest! They have a party on Friday and Saturday nights, and though we stopped by we left early as we were so exhausted, and anxious to get to sleep for the fun the next day would hold.

I seriously cannot remember the last time I used an actual key to get into our room. The only noise that we heard were from people walking by our room. We did not hear any noise from the rooms surrounding us. Buffet- holy cow!!! I am NOT a buffet person- but they had the best breakfast buffet I've ever had! We did not eat lunch or dinner there. The pizza buffet was not good. Fun Spot- aka money pit. This is an indoor arcade/laser tag/bumper car fun house. The laser tag was $8 per person and it lasted about 10 minutes. Our kids loved it. At 10:00 every Friday and Saturday they have free popcorn and cake. The cake was not good. It tasted like it had been in the freezer or too long. But the kids loved it and it's free. Waterpark- the waterpark was fun. Mainly for kids. Not many things that adults can do. We frequently go to GWL- and this was about 1/8 the size of GWL. There were 2 slides, a small pool, hot tubs, bucket of water that dumps on the kids, a playhouse. It was not connected to the waterpark and ha horrible parking. The temperature was very warm inside (we went during February) but a chilly walk to the car. Shows- we watched Amazing Pets. It was very long- 2 hours with an Intermission. Olga is very cute and the animals were 'amazing'. I don't know if I'd pay to see it again. Location- its right on the strip. Outlet malls right up the street. McDonalds, Taco Bell, and a burger place are close by. Overall- I would not return to the hotel. But I would go back for the buffet and fun spot. Hope this helps!

Unfortunately it was freezing inside the waterpark, if people just watching the 'swimmers' are in hoodies, you know it's cold. I know it's January, but the indoor waterpark should be too hot for people in hoodies and jeans, even some lifeguards were in sweats and winter beanies! So getting my kids to run through the water was not easy, they were shivering. There were only 2 waterslides. Supervision of the hot tubs was non-existant, an even though it said no children in the upper hot tub (the one that is actually hot) people kept letting their little kids get in, which was not relaxing, and just gross whenone got overheated and threw up. They over chlorinated all the water, the hot tub had froth, like a bubble bath, kids were putting it on their faces pretending to be santa. The over chlorinating of the water led my 6 year old to be in tears after just 3 hours in the place. We had to get eye drops from an employee to flush out her eyes (apparently it's a common problem). We left after just 3 hours, my kids can usually spend all day in other waterparks, indoor or outdoor. And I haven't even mentioned the 'changing rooms', which are just bathroom stalls. There is 1 handicapped stall which has a baby changing station,and of course everyone wants to change in that one because it's the only place you can actually turn around in, which means you can forget about diaper changes, or getting dressed without standing in line forever.

We where across from it luckily, but it still because a lot of work in Jan when you have a young one. We didn't venture the shows, or the Buffett, so I can not talk about them. The fun spot... Only fun if you like everything to cost money, even as a guest. Ballpit, money; bumper cars, money; laser tag, putt putt, ...money! The only time we had fun here is we ventured on the chance of fun spot featuring a party on a Saturday night from 9:30 to 10:30pm. All was free but the video games, including refreshments, cake, popcorn etc... For anyone that walks in. We kept our toddler up for the very end for just the balloon drop. She loves balloons, but did not know what to make of all the balloons popping. Very few balloons held prizes. Afterwards we finished with some custard, which was good. As for the water park... Water was cold, multiple level with steps; so be careful with little ones. Our toddler only made it 15 or 20 minutes both visits before she was shaking because she was cold. They did have a warm gaccuzzi next to the hot one for us to warm up our toddler every now and then. Kids around the age of 6 and up appeared not to be effected by the water temperature. On a last note, we rented a fridge which was worthless. Froze everything we put in it. Even at 3 and half full, everything would freeze. Our money was refunded without hassle. Just be warned. When you rent one, change the temp maybe to 2 or 1 and see how cold your items are. After a few hours. Ours arrived at 5. I would suggest a good cooler. Hope this was helpful. It is a fair review in my opinion. No punches because the experience was not perfect or anything. Staff was not rude. As with most places I have stayed, the cleaning staff hardly knew English.

We're those parents who can never pull the trigger on a weekend vacation, so we just did it. We had a good time and learned alot. What we learned about Grand Country Inn: 1) There are no DEALS. Any \"package\" you buy actually could be reproduced via 'coupon' books located all over town. A package just simply applies the coupons deals for you for events [show, activities, buffet, etc.] at the hotel property itself. 2) The buffet at Grand Country IS likely one of the best for the money, but remember...it will make you ill. IT is a TON of food being rolled out...it ain't clean...but enough sugar, salt, and fat that it is wonderful...and you will be sick later. Families, I recommend paying the $10 [one time] for a room fridge and keeping fruit, bread, milk, cereal...and making the buffet a 'once a day' at most thing. 3) Water park...is small and has VERY LITTLE SEATING...so moms/dads if it is crowded at all it is very tough to get comfortable. Many seats are within \"squirting distance\" of water guns. Don't get me wrong....it is fun for kids ages 1-12'ish, but it is a cramped environment. Tons of chlorine in water. Prepare. 4) Free coffee and tea! Ok, you must find the silver linings. My wife thought this was the 'bomb', even though I reminded her we did PAY for that. Also, I noticed most didn't ask for proof we were staying at the hotel, so I'm guessing the coffee and tea is something they can afford to give away. sub 4a: ROOMS - decent. Bugs here and there, but service is great. Front desk VERY responsive. TAKE A SMALL FAN [any hotel] for noise...makes sleep so much better. 5) The Amazing Pets show was great. Again, we got it \"free\" in our package, but did the math later and realized coupons would have given us the same thing if we'd just stayed at the hotel at regular rate. When they say \"$100 savings\", they use the non-coupon rates. 6) Butterfly Museum - It was really cool....but really not worth the feel. The movie is not a kids movie [they lie] and you'll be bored in about 20 minutes at the museum. Very small and \"over-advertised\" as more. Staff was really rude and uncaring in general...except for the lady in the \"Science Museum\" [which actually is a VERY small room with about 20 cages/aquariums. 7) Go carts are expensive but fun. We should have riden the DUCKS. 8) DOWNTOWN - Get there! We discovered it the last day and wish we hadn't. Great area to look at stores, maybe even stay. Cool OLD shops and NEW shops and the \"BRANSON CAFE\" is the place to eat. Free trolly and cool \"splash\" launching area for the DUCK boats.

The waterpark was more than adequate and no complaints. The room was a disaster. All of the complaints you read on here are true about beds, outdated fixtures, everything. Even the 9 year old complained about how scratchy the towels are, and he doesn't even think about towels. And when we arrived, I heard one desk clerk say there was 44% occupancy. And they tried to put us in a building that was at least 5 city blocks away from the swimming pool. I complained to the manager and got that fixed. I could understand if the hotel had been full. But it was a ghost town, so why not treat guests as if their return business mattered to you? My biggest complaint is this. We stayed in this 2 star at best hotel solely for the water park. Only after we arrived did we learn that the water park does not open until 2:00 in the afternoon. Checkout time is 11:00 am. I think you'll find that particular fact does not exist on the website. So with a one night stay, and two rooms, I paid a couple of hundred dollars for two hours at the pool. I told the desk clerk (the snippy one, not the nice one) to tell the manager to enjoy my $200.

So, we chose to stay at Grand Country Inn for the first time with my nephew and niece (ages 10 and 8) We love the shows at Grand Country Music Hall, and even when it's just my husband and I going to Branson, it is just mandatory that he take me to the Fun Spot, also on the premises. The package included two nights stay at the hotel, free water park passes, tickets to one of their shows, 2 large pizzas and a round of black light mini golf. I was wondering how the hotel rooms would be, honestly I assumed they were cheap, since they had so many, and I've heard lots of things about the hotel and water park area, so I had my questions. We arrived and checked in without a problem. Stayed in a building farther away from the water park (which was not a big deal!) and got settled into our room. It was super clean!! I was shocked.. I called my parents (also in Branson at another hotel) to tell him how clean our room was! We headed to the water park soon after, and the temperature was just right! I was expecting a humid miserable time, but I had a blast! Oh, and the children did also. One problem, actually the only problem that I had, was at the water park in the lazy river. I guess some people do not know why it is called the Lazy River because there was pushing and shoving and running by a bunch of teenagers. Finally I got tired of it and got out, as well as some other people, so the lifeguard asked the troublemakers to leave the area. The small water park area outside was nice, more for younger children. There were several pools and hot tubs on the premises, which we all wanted to try out, and did! The show was excellent, as always, and I can't wait to go back again. The pizza's were so great! We had never ate there before, but, we will be back! Of course the black light mini golf was a blast, as well as the fun spot. Our main problem.. we didn't have enough time to do everything we wanted to do as much as we wanted to do it!!

I got on the web site and they had a deal going on til Aug 14 for 2 night and 3 days for 268. plus tax. That got you the splash country, a free show at their facility, 2 free pizzas, free game of black light mini golf. The water park was pretty good. The chlorine at the the inside waterpark was very strong, I got a head cold after we had been there a little while and it didn't really get better until the day we were leaving. The pizza wasn't bad. The arcade was way too expensive. They had like jungle gym areas for kids to play in but you had to pay for 3 dollars per kid on top of money for every game. We really enjoyed the black light mini golf the kids really enjoyed it but we didn't have to pay for it. We called to the desk for a couple more pillows and after 20 of 30 minutes my husband called again and asked if we needed to go get them and they brought them up after 15 minutes or so. Each bed had 2 fairly flat pillows. I didn't notice it being dirty but it wasn't anything very impressive. I guess the water park is suppose to make up for the 120. you pay a night. We decided to stay a third night and they wouldn't give us any kind of deal. So we went to the Ramada and payed 70.00 and it was a much nicer room it had a hida couch and 4 full pillows on each bed. It had a very nice shower, a luggage carrier with wheels and an elevator. It had 2 pools, and an outside jungle gym area. It wasn't perfect but it was deffinately better. We went to the Amazing Pets show at the Grand Country which we got for free and it was really good. I bought the DVD of it during intermission for 15.00 and tried to play it today and it won't work, not very happy about that. Overall I would say they Grand Country is over rated.

I strongly believe that this is a hotel on the decline. To be fair, the deal we purchased was totally fulfilled by the Inn and the staff was friendly. When we called for more towels during the evening, they came in just a few minutes. However, hygiene and concern for customers was lacking. Much to my dismay, I realized that the bottom sheets on the two beds in our room were not fitted sheets. And, I found this by having my feet rubbing the cover on the mattress. The same cover that every other customer rubs their dirty feet on. The sheets were about 12 inches shy of meeting the end of the bed. When I asked the Front Desk about it, they asked the cleaning staff to check it out - and they reported that I was wrong and that all was well. So, I took pictures. I took the pictures back up to the front where the Head of the cleaning staff said she was sorry about that but they don't have any fitted sheets and this is the way they make the beds. And, she said that there is nothing they can do about it. I hadn't asked for anything but had hoped for some level of concern. The other big issue that came up was that the rest of the rooms on our hall were up late into the night and felt that the hallway was their shouting area. While this is not the fault of the Inn, after four separate calls to them, they never got the other guests to hold it down. This lasted until about 2:45 in the morning and while the Front Desk apologized in the morning about it and initially said they would compensate us by giving us some discounts on the buffet that they have. They later said that the Owner decided against this and there was nothing that they could do about it. Now, lets talk about the Water Park. While the park was fine, nobody checked people coming in or leaving the park and inside the building were a couple open doors which kids could easily leave (voluntarily or not). The sad thing is that there was a booth that had obviously been maintained at one point but clearly had not in a long time. Sadly, once the experience goes bad, you start noticing more issues - like how the shower head screamed when water was on and how the hair dryer overheated.

The holes are really simple, and the repetative music and speaking coming out of the loud speakers gets really old, really fast.

The lady who was the supervisor said only the owner could make that decision, and said she would call us on our cell phone in a few hours. We got a call from her later that day saying the owner would take $30 off the bill. My wife, who has her degree in hotel and restaurant management, and is the executive director of a large retirement community, told them that that was not acceptable.

I was happy that most of the negative reviews are full of hot air. Not sure what happened during spring break of this year (most of the bad reviews are from March, when a lot of MO is on spring break) but we had a great stay. The hotel was not busy, the nights were quiet even with the music hall packed out for shows. We got in building 1 without having to pay for it. Rooms: Room was clean and ready when we arrived. Room was cleaned every day by early afternoon. Plenty of hot water. Coffee maker, ironing board, and hairdryer are only amenities. Fridge can be rented. Hangers provided as well as plenty of dresser drawer space. Entertainment: We saw the Amazing Pets show and it was cute. I wouldn't say it was great, but it had it's fun moments for kids and adults. My kids absolutely loved the Fun Spot and pizza buffet. In fact, they both wanted to make it back to the hotel in time to play games each night at the fun spot. The arcade is not expensive. You preload money onto a card and the games range from .25 to $2 depending on how easy it is to win. Games give lots of tickets. We won 250 tickets from one game and both kids won well over 1000 tickets total. You can keep your tickets on your card and just keep reloading until you leave and then pick prizes. There are two indoor golf areas. Mine liked the blacklight course. Food: The pizza was okay. They have 6.99 coupons but that's the regular price anyway so not sure what the coupon's for. We ate twice at the Grand Buffet for breakfast and they have plenty of selection. We actually hit the breakfast late one day and got to sample lunch, but I'd say stick with the breakfast buffet for the best food. Didn't care for the fudge from the candy shop. Waterpark: Considering this is a hotel, this can absolutely be called a waterpark. There is a lazy river, two hot tubs, two slides, a big spill bucket, plus plenty to climb and play on and a basketball pool. Even with the toddler area closed for the season, my kids had a blast at the indoor park. There is also an indoor pool and hot tub in building 2 along with an outdoor pool next to the waterpark. The park was clean, fresh towels, not too crowded. The chlorine is a little strong, but it's like that anywhere in an inside swim environment. Cons: Hot tubs should be called lukewarm tubs.

This is the first year I stayed at Grand Country. I traveled with a 2 yr old, 6 yr old, & a 11 year old. The rooms were not great, but okay. We did the Spring Break package. The waterpark---how can you really call this a waterpark??? The toddler area was okay--2 slides a little rocking frog and a turtle that they can climb on (whic is extremly dangerous) My two yr old enjoyed it for 2o minutes than got bored. The lazy river was okay if the kids in it weren't acting crazy! & the slides were okay the first go around. Went to the Grand Country Inn for breakfast (where they overcharged me-two year old was supposed to be free & they charged me for a child) NOTHING was good except maybe a piece of bacon. Went to the Amazing Pets show--the only person that enjoyed it was the 11 year old who is a major cat lover. (the people who are on the brochure are not even in the show anymore--which makes me wonder if someone else took it over??? Frankie the monkey was not even present) Pizza from the pizza place was pretty good, not great like dominoes or pizza hut sorta like a good frozen pizza. We ended up eating there twice. walked around the arcade game area while we waited on the pizza it wasn't worth coming back to we didn't even play the black light golf which was with our package deal because it looked boring even to the kids. Overall I would say this is an okay place to stay, but definatly not worth the price. In my opionion it would be better to stay at a cheaper hotel with an indoor pool, & have extra money to do other things.

If you have kids between 5 and 12 they will have a blast. The buffet. For the price, it's really not that bad. Props to the pastry chef. The indoor golf is convenient and fun. Shows - the pet one was funny - again if your kid is between 5 and 12. The Bad: The waterpark rarely had any clean towels and the water was somewhat cold. There is enough chlorine in the hot tub to make your eyes burn while you just sit near it. Wear water shoes because you won't want to get near the bathrooms without them. The arcade is overpriced but that is to be expected. THE UGLY: Couldn't check in until 4:30 because they were \"short staff\" (seems to be everyday) Room reeked of smoke. And I mean REEKED. After complaining we were told we were in the \"non-smoking wing\" (Bldg1). Must have gone to non-smoking the day we checked in. Your room won't be cleaned until 4 or 5 PM - if at all. Since you pay up front, they are only interested in cleaning rooms for the new arrivals. Stayovers are ignored. You have to pester to get someone to clean your room. The one day they did clean the room, they folded the towels we had on the floor and put them back up (I know this because I cut myself shaving and clearly the towel I had used was back up on the rack.....) Rooms are pretty dirty with all the people coming and going from the wet waterpark and dirty parking lot. Lord knows the last time the carpet saw some shampoo. We had the kids quarantined to the beds so they wouldn't touch the floor. Hot water would be gone if you weren't up before 8:30.

We did complain at the desk regarding the noise level they said they would address the noise...but there is not much they can do about the real problem There was a problem with the water heater and we had to take a very luke warm showers a couple of times. The water park is great fun for the kids even though it is located outside the hotel, but was overcrowded. It is not just for hotel patrons. Locals can come and use the park for $5.00 (i overheard this price quoted) 2 different days we were there 2 bus loads of kids not staying at the hotel using the water park. Parking is a huge issue if you are staying near the waterpark. People from whereever, used the parking spaces in front of our rooms forcing us to park on the other side of the hotel. The food at the resturant on the property was gross and over priced!.When we addressed the issues with the management at the front desk we were told they could do nothing for us, that the Owners would have to call us after our stay. We will see..All our issues could have been easily resolved with management, but apparently no one on duty has any authority to hanldle issues of concern.

Indoors was too hot just to sit there, ok if you were wet outdoors was for the little kids, mine didn't like the outdoor because it was just too small for them but it looked better and was cooler! Fun spot: kids loved it, spent too much money in there but it was fun, new and kids loved the games. Theatre: the comedy show was ok, not that funny. My kids didn't get most of the jokes although my husband and I did but they were lame. The Amazing pets was much better.

We were told when we made our reservation that check-in was at 3 pm. We checked in at 6pm and were told our room wasn't ready yet, we could check back in about an hour.

The \"dressing rooms\" were no more than a bathroom with a couple of hotel blow-dryers on the wall, and a bench RIGHT BY THE DOOR where you walk in. They were not very clean. The waterpark was very crowded and noisy and not nearly as exciting as it looks from the outside (most of what you see through the windows driving by is actually ductwork that has been painted, not water slides).

The indoor pool was small but okay, and we returned to the waterpark later in the evening. Another complaint about the waterpark is from a safety standpoint. There was not a good spot to sit where I could keep an eye on my child.

My sister and I were going to be going with her one child and my two. We initially figured we would have to book seperate rooms because of our number of guests. When we called, the lady who helped us book was very informative and helpful. She even suggested we save money by staying in the same room and just requesting a cot for my oldest son. So, that saved us both a lot of money that we could put towards other activities for the kids. We arrived to the hotel around 4pm Friday evening. We went in and paid for our room and were given our keys and wristbands for the indoor waterpark. We were both nervous about the room based on some of the reviews we had read here. We were pleasantly surprised to find our room adequate and CLEAN. The cot was not in our room when we first got there, so we called the front desk and one was sent up immediately. The gentleman that brought it up was more than pleasant.He asked us if we needed assistance setting it up or if we needed anything else! I thought he went above and beyond what most hotel staff members do. After we got settled in our room, we decided to go find some dinner. We chose the Grand Country Buffet, because it was close. It was awesome!!! I have never seen such attentiveness and hospitality at a BUFFET before. We had the sweetest waitress (her name was Rose). She was so kind and helpful! The other staff was very on top of things, some were even checking the temperatures of the food! They were constantly cleaning and making sure everything was perfect. Later that evening, took the kids to the water park. It was just \"ok\". I'm not going to sugarcoat things..it's nothing special to be quite honest! With it still being cold outside, it seemed like a lot of people were utilitzing it at the same time. The hot tubs were over-ran with small children who probably weren't even old enough to be in it. My kids did like the bucket & the play area...as an adult however, it left much to be desired! The next night, we decided to try the indoor pool. It was worse than the indoor water park! I would urge anyone to be aware....if this is your main reason for staying here-you just might be dissapointed. The rooms and staff @ the hotel are awesome!

The walls are thin and you can hear everything outside. We were right by stairs and could hear people going up and down. 2. Worst thing was on our last morning, we were trying to sleep in as we don't get to at home. At 8 am someone tried to come in our room. If I had not had our safety lock on our door locked they would have came in the room. I looked outside and it was one of the housekeepers. I mentioned this to the clerk on checking out and nothing was done. All they said was sorry! 3. Water park was ok but small and crowded. They did not have a big enough pool for kids just to swim in. Therefore all the kids were swimming in the hot tubs. Can't say that was relaxing. However, the hot tubs were not hot anyways! My son loved the water fort place and running around there. I was glad the price was part of the hotel as I don't think I would want to pay extra to go there. We were able to get a room in the building right by the waterpark. I should say for $10 more we were able to. I am glad to have that though as it was very cold out and the other buildings were far from the waterpark. My son did like the indoor golf. It was to expensive though. It was $12 for my son and I for 18 holes. They are not hard to do and so it only took about 30 minutes to get through the course. Good for young kids like my son as it was pretty easy to get it in the hole. Also, this hotel is very good for back road access. I was able to go back roads and avoid 76 and the traffic.

There is barely enough room for a rollaway, but it will fit if you move the table and chairs over close to the bathroom area.

We also used the pool next to the building we stayed in and it was nice. Good size, not too crowded. Overall, I was very pleased with our stay. I would recommend this place if you have children. If I go to Branson without kids though, I won't stay here. It's more family oriented. The price, I thought, was reasonable. Oh, and they give you a discount card for several amenities at the hotel.", "Date": "July 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Illinois", "Title": "\u201cGreat vacation!\u201d", "Author": "Coachwf", "ReviewID": "UR17056566", "Content": "Just returned from a 4 night stay at the Grand Country Inn.

Room is an average hotel room, as I expected for the price, but it was very clean. Had 2 queen beds, small bathroom with the sink outside the bathroom. Plenty of room for our family. No refrigerator or microwave, but for $11 you can get a small refrigerator for the length of your stay. Service was very friendly. Indoor and outdoor water parks were great for the kids. Water was clean. Also had 2 outdoor pools and one indoor pool that was open until midnight. Lifeguards on duty all over the water parks. Most were teens from outside the US. Girl at the front desk was Russian so language is a slight barrier, but they were friendly when spoken to. Note that you do have to walk outside to get to all of the pools and water parks, but it only takes a couple minutes. Worked out great for us. Locations is great! Right in the heart of 76.

We stayed in building two, and all night long, both nights, teenagers were hanging around outside making noise, we didn't get much sleep. On top of that, our room was located right next to the stairs so we heard everyone staying on the 2nd floor going up and down the stairs all night. Now as for the water park lifeguards and water park management. They are without a doubt the rudest individuals I have ever come across. Everytime you turn around they are blowing their whistles at the kids. My daughter got the whistle blown at her while trying to get into the innertube in the Lazy River, the lifeguard Nathan, said she was holding up others. The only others in the river at the time were my other daughter, my son and myself. This 16 year old kid, thinks he is \"IMPORTANT\" because he RULES over the lazy river. His manager is no better. Maybe 20 years old and the RUDEST person I have ever met in my life! When I complained to him he said \" so what, she was breaking the rules\", when I told him that the Great Wolf Lodge had twice the amount of activities and the lifeguards were more professional, his response was \" well, they are also about $200 a night more expensive then we are\". he then said ? we'll see ya later\". He then turned around and started talking to his \" friends\" about what they were going to do that weekend. I will be writing a strongly worded letter to the Hotel Management over this sorry excuse of a manager and his staff. I would NEVER stay at this hotel again. It was TERRIBLE. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT book a room here, stay at one of the other smaller hotels that treat their guests LIKE GUESTS. There is enough to do in Branson that paying the extra money for a room here isn't worth it, you can always find something to do in Branson without paying to have your kids yelled at.

We paid extra for a room in the building next to the water park and were glad we did as it was so cold during our trip. Love the buffet restaurant and my kids love the game room.

They are so busy (and have been during every stay) that the rooms are not cleaned until late in the day, and that's a huge pet peeve of mine. We ended up checking out the next morning and moving to a less expensive hotel where we could get 2 rooms.

I wanted to take my grandkids, (8 of them rangeing from 3yrs.to 16yrs.), on a mini vacation that wouldn't cost me a small fortune.

I've been to Branson many times and have stayed in many of the motels there and none of the staff have been nicer than this place. If we needed anything all we had to do was call front desk and they brought it to us very quickly. Now I only had two suggestions: to furnish more towels when they know there's alot of people in the room, to offer a discount when staying more than a couple of days. The food at their resturant was wonderful. The kids just loved the indoor water park and the outdoor water park and pools. Our visit to this motel furnished everything I was wanting for this trip and saved me alot of money. It would have cost me a whole lot more if we had stayed somewherelse and then visited a waterpark everyday we were there. In my opinion, this is a perfect place to stay w/ children. Now don't get me wrong, if I was going to Branson w/out children I wouldn't stay here but w/kids it's perfect. We are planning a return visit this year. I asked my grandchildren, well where would you like to go this year for a vacation? They all said, Branson!!! So we will be going back this year. I just smiled and thought to myself....Oh Thank God!

The hotel was very clean and simple, and the staff was very helpful. Upon checking in, I recieved a card that gives guests free coffee and tea at any of the restaurants on site, plus $8 off any of their shows on site. The hotel is three separate buildings but rather close proximity to each other, however, being the average temp. while I was there was 40 degrees we did have to drive to each building, one for the pizza buffet which was very tasty, the grand country buffet, which had a good selection but very average in taste, a little pricey ($13 an adult for dinner), and the waterpark which was fun. We had a nice time at the hotel. The room is simple, two beds(very comfy and warm), bathroom(clean), tv. . . I could've used a microwave since we had breakfast in the room but I was able to rent a small fridge for a one time fee of $11 for my entire stay which was helpful. Every evening we came back to the room it was very clean. NO Complaints. The restaurants we went to were the Pizza buffet and the Grand Country buffet. The Pizza parlor was a fast and easy fare. The pizza was tasty and always plentiful. The staff seemed a bit worn or they must have been apprehensive about the 5 separate parties that were all booked at the same time and showed up very promptly(they just didn't look happy which makes you not want to bother them about requesting a type of pizza or tell them the soda machine needs changing). I recommend showing up early for pizza on the weekend. The country buffet we caught an hour before closing. The service was very good. The food on the other hand, though there was a great selection in foods and appearance seemed tasty, it was hardly anything to talk about. I guess our eyes were hungrier than our tummies because we were fooled. Basically it was bland. Every item was bland. The only thing I really liked was the bread pudding with vanilla cream sauce. I mean it was a nice last minute choice and it was close to our room so it was convenient, and right after we played mini golf which made it worthwhile. The activities they have at the hotel are the variety shows(which I didn't see), mini-golf which has a very neat atmosphere and was enjoyable(also a good alternative to the waterpark in cold weather), an arcade(not much to talk about), a swimming pool, and the waterpark. I didn't see any shows because I didn't think my two young children would sit through it. The mini-golf was cool for my kids, they learned how to play, it was fun, however we did the 36 hole and it may have been too long for a 4 & 6 year old. We played a couple of games. The swimming pool & hot tub was a nice alternative. And the waterpark, it was fun! Because of the time of year, it just felt chilly everywhere. It was warm in the building and the lazy river was warm(we spent most of out time in the lazy river), but the rest of the park was cool. My kids really enjoyed it, and didn't want to leave even though we were coming back the next day and the next. The \"Fort\" was cool, the big bucket fun, the waterslides were not so boring for my 6 yr.old but also not too scary for my 4 yr. old. My husband and I really enjoyed it. If it was a little warmer we would have enjoyed a lot more. The staff was helpful too. Overall, we would definitely come back and stay here. I think because we came in the off season we had a little more attention from the staff as far as friendliness, which was nice. And our stay ran into the beginning of the week so there was hardly anybody there. We had the waterpark all to ourselves on two of the days. It's busiest on Friday and saturday in the off season. The hotel is right on the strip, plenty of restaurants withing walking distance otherwise an easy drive to many places. And because we went in the off season and called for our reservations, if you go to their website they advertise $20 off the nightly rate with two night stay minimum, I paid only $59 on Saturday nite, and $39 for the next two nites. Very reasonable. The only thing I wish I could have changed was the weather. It was beautiful but cold. Our family is planning for another trip during warmer weather.
