As a woman traveling alone, I was very concerned about security, and I always felt safe here. The hotel is on a side street with not much traffic (which is nice because the neighborhood is not too noisy), but right across the street is a pass-through to a main boulevard with shops, restaurants, and banks, and I never felt uncomfortable walking around by myself (though I was usually back at the hotel by 10PM). I had a single room which had not yet been redecorated like the pictures shown on the website. It was, however, very clean. It was pretty compact, but not uncomfortably small, and contained a desk, bed, and armoire (no closet) plus an ensuite bathroom. The bathroom unfortunately did not contain a bathtub (as was listed on the hotel's reservation website), but did have a toilet and small shower. There was a small refrigerator (no freezer compartment) tucked into the desk, but I did not see a safe in my room as has been mentioned in other reviews. There was no alarm clock supplied, so bring your own if you like being able to glance at the clock during the night. It was of course, possible to schedule a wake-up call, so the alarm clock was not completely necessary. There was a newer flat panel TV that got several channels in French, 2 channels in English (CNN and a sports channel), and, I think, a couple of channels in other languages. The size of the room did not matter much as I spent most of the day out in the city. The hotel is very close to the Marais, which was good as I was there on a Sunday and unlike much of the rest of the city, shops in the Marais were open that day. The hotel is also extremely close to the Chemin Vert station, and just a bit farther from the Breguet Sabin and Bastille stations. From these three stations, it is easy to go to almost anyplace you'd want to go in Paris. The hotel is within walking distance of Notre Dame, Centre Pompidou, Place des Vosges, and I even walked to the Louvre (a long walk, but I enjoy going on foot rather than by metro as I get to explore the various neighborhoods). There were lots of nice restaurants nearby, as well as some cheaper chain places. There are a couple of Franprix minimarts close by as well if you want to stock up on groceries. I did not try the breakfast at the hotel. It was extremely easy to access the hotel from Charles de Gaulle - I took the RER to Gare Nord and then Metro line 5 (towards Place d'Italie) and got off at Breguet Sabin. From there the hotel is just a few blocks walk. Getting connected to the free wifi using my Ipod Touch could be a bit flaky (the login screen would disappear while I was trying to enter my userid, etc.) but once I got on, the connection was pretty good.

The front desk staff were also very helpful and friendly and spoke good english. The location was also perfect for us, on the edge of the Marais district (5 min walk) with very interesting shops. It took about 30 minutes to walk to the Notre Dame so we did many things by foot or took the metro. Also very good restaurants nearby such as the Bar a huitres de Bastille (5 min walk) and the famous brasserie Bofinger (10 min walk) Make a reservation for both places because they were loaded with people at the weekends. So all in all we had a very nice stay in the hotel.", "Date": "December 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pretoria, South Africa", "Title": "\u201ctrendy, clean and great location\u201d", "Author": "AJIR_10", "ReviewID": "UR80493726", "Content": "I was so pleasantly surprised!

That wasn't something I wanted to see or wake up to. Oh well.

The hotel is good and was perfect for a three night stay, compact yet very clean rooms with good aircon. The staff were very friendly at all times. I feel I should comment on the review below as I also made a error with my booking - mistakenly booked a single room which I only checked the night before arrival and two of us were travelling! This was fixed very quickly with a phone call to the hotel and the payment of a small supplement at check out. No hassle at all. Didn't have the breakfast so cannot comment on that. No coffee making facility which would have made the room perfect for three nights - as coffee goes for 5 euro + a cup in Paris!!

Breakfast is on he expensive side - I would recommend going to nearby restaurants instead. I think the best thing about this small 36 room hotel is that it is very close to a Paris district called \"Le Marais\" which is one of the trendiest portions of this ever charming city, yet not only offering sites such as Place Des Voges, but also real neighbourrghood life unlike some of the more tourist like areas...

I was ready to pay for an extra bed, but the hotel staff didn't say anything when my husband checked-in a day later. I thought that's no big deal, since they didn't mention, my husband and I could just share the bed and save some money. A night passed by, we went out the next morning, greeted the staff as a couple - still nobody say anything. We had a last night on the 2nd day, we went back to the hotel passed midnight. You wouldn't believe what the staff at the reception told me. He said that it was my fault that I booked a single room for 2 people and according to the hotel policy, they can't let two people stay in a single room. (mind you, the attitude was POOR, he kept blaming on me and other staff for not telling me earlier! I asked him to prepare for an extra bed and I'd pay for it, he said NO. I said I'd pay for the difference of a double room, he said NO. He said, \"The only solution is that my husband has to leave the hotel IMMEDIATELY.\" (we're talking about 1am at night) I asked him, \"Is this how the French interpret 'hospitality'?\" Then he gave me the first \"YES\" of the night. Incredible isn't it? To keep the story short. We finally got the police invovled. (at around 2am, I needed to explain the situation to the police with my terrible French.) And the whole thing was so-call settled. To be fair, it is a nice and clean hotel and the staff I met other times were wonderful.
