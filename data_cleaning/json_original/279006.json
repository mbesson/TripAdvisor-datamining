There is a small fridge and microwave in the room, as well as a dining table for 4, but no plates or cutlery provided which is a bit odd. Very nice outdoor pool where towels are provided. We did not eat in the hotel but the restaurant looked good and offered outside dining. Although the hotel is not in the city centre, it is a 10 min walk to the underground station and you can get to be in Madrid within 40 minutes. Few things to note: Drinks are very expensive, gin & tonics from \u20ac20-\u20ac26 each and breakfast for 2 was around \u20ac56 If you use the spa you must have a swimming hat which costs \u20ac3.50 We upgraded our room so that spa and outside pool were included in the price, I used the outside pool everyday and nobody ever checked if this was included in my room rate. I only used the spa once in 4 days so would have been better off paying the charge on that day only. There isnt a huge selection of dining in the surrounding area. The hotel recommended 2 tapas restaurants nearby, we asked them to book a table for us, but they said they couldnt as the phones were busy. At about 9pm we took a taxi to the first restaurant which was closed so we continued to the next restaurant that they recommened and this was also closed. There didnt appear to be much else around and so we asked the taxi driver to take us back to the hotel. This trip cost us \u20ac15 and when we asked the hotel to reimburse us they were not willing to do this. They should know what is happening locally and the opening times of places they recommend to guests. They did offer us a free trip in the hotel shuttle to a different restaurant instead but this didnt make up for the wasted \u20ac15 so we refused and walked less that 5 mins to the tapas bar on the corner which the hotel didnt mention to us when we asked for restaurants in the area!

Was very happy with the prompt shuttle service following a long day of international travel. The front desk was kind enough to check us in extremely early which allowed us to regulate to the time zone easily. The hotel itself is quite nice, not five-star but a solid four-star. It recently became a Sheraton and the decor looks like it's been updated a bit, especially in the lobby. Real Madrid stays here the nights before their home matches so you figure it's pretty solid. The pool area is comfortable, centered by a large round pool that is not heated and doesn't have a lot of shallow areas but is really pretty (wish there was an outdoor jacuzzi, however). There's a little bar below by the pool and many more cabanas and another bar up top by the hotel-pool entrance. The room itself was long, fitting a king bed at one end, a desk and sitting area in the middle, and a full kitchenette (microwave, refrigerator) with four-seat dining room table at the other end. The bathroom was also long and had separate shower and tub areas, two sinks, and plenty of cabinet and counter space (two separate entryways to the bathroom). Bathroom amenities were standard Sheraton fare, nothing special. We were able to fit a rollaway bed in the room quite easily. It was quiet with regards to outside noise. The reason why the room is quiet is the hotel is located in a residential suburb, very far north of Madrid's city center. It's about a 400m walk to the Herrera Oria stop (Metro line 9), so it takes a while to get into town by subway and usually requires a transfer or two. There's a small market along the way to pick up food and drink for the room. I'd say the setup is really convenient for a small family, especially access to the kitchenette for breakfasts (we did not eat in the hotel; the breakfast spread looked good but not great so we preferred to eat something quick and get moving). Good value relative to having to get two rooms or an apartment, and wanting something nice (plus, within the Starwood family).", "Date": "August 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reading, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cDream hotel in Madrid\u201d", "Author": "ogallego", "ReviewID": "UR137521226", "Content": "This is without any doubt one of the top 5 stars hotels I have visited in all my trips.

However, upon arrival there was no shuttle bus so I called the hotel.....there was no answer from 4/5 attempts so I had no choice but to jump in a taxi. The hotel, once informed of my predicament, did upgrade me to a club room and explained, following enquiries, that their telephone lines had in fact been down for some time!! Bizarrely, they had not been informed earlier. This is why I cannot give this hotel 5 stars at this time. This did not seem to bode well for a relaxing stay, however, the staff had done everthing they could to ensure that the rest of my stay had been relaxing by offering a very late check out the next day and a complimentary visit to the fantastic spa! There were issues trying to find loungers outside by the pool but this was a Sunday so hence maybe the pool area was more crowded than normal. The hotel has only been part of the Sheraton group for some 4-5 weeks and the general ambience of the hotel is truly 5 star. The staff could not be more helpful - I just guess I was unlucky!

We liked the extra movie services and more English speaking channels. It seems there are many small improvements to the hotel to make it more enjoyable ~ a more consistent service. They opened the outside pool early which was very welcome as it was 33c for most of our stay. This is where this hotel really stands apart, and it should really do more to advertise the fact that this is the only 5* hotel in Madrid with a large outdoor swimming pool. It is a wonderful area, beautifully tended gardens full of jasmine and lavender. Where you can relax on over sized daybeds - scattered with cushions and throws (which are changed a few times a day and kept spotlessly clean). Absolute bliss after a busy day in Madrid. It lends itself to true relaxation which works very well for a city break. There are one or two other hotels in Madrid with tiny pools or hotels that have swimming pools but are not as luxurious. This hotel combines both perfectly. It is much more peaceful than other city centre hotels ~ where we have stayed before and not had more than three hours sleep because of the horrendous traffic noise. Again this hotel works well if you are looking to sleep and relax as well enjoy city life. We loved the pool, the pool bar area with a very nice chap there who looked after us. We liked the fact we could be there all day relaxing and swimming, there are plenty of sun beds and places to relax and subtle ambient music. It is a great choice for families, couples, friends etc. Although the hotel does have a core of business clientele. The combination worked for everyone. The cocktail bar is a great area outside with super seating on little wooden platforms on water (not at all deep or dangerous in any way) great design actually, serving great cocktails and champagne. The restaurant was good too, although we would prefer an earlier start to dinner. The rooms are extremely spacious and have everything you need. Clean, comfortable and modern. I would prefer to see more of a feminine touch, some soft cushions and throws and some paintings on the walls would make the hotel look and feel much more luxurious. It is a small investment but definitely one I would make. Given that this is a business hotel I guess they have kept the decor low key. However the rooms could definitely benefit from a splash of colour! The kitchens are kept spotlessly clean. The one tip I have for you is to definitely book a mountain view! It is quite extraordinary the difference between the two sides of the hotel. We stayed in both, and one is full of light with amazing views of the mountains and countryside and the other is a view of apartment blocks and the swimming pool. I would recommend the mountain view without hesitation. It is also quieter without the noise from the bar or pool. A few suggestions for areas of improvement. The service in the spa needs improving ~ they need to provide treatments with proper essential oils and the treatment menu should be upgraded and more carefully considered. The products in the room at the moment are Sheraton's own brand, I would like to see Penthaligons, Molton Brown, Bulgari or something similar. Most five star hotels do in fact stock better toiletries and this would certainly be an improvement. The Sheraton brand is okay it does the job, but it is not special in any way. A few touches here or there would make this very good hotel excellent in my view. We hope you will keep the outside pool open for most of the year, it can be warm even in March and warmer still into the autumn. Personally I would keep it all year round, there are great health benefits to swimming outside in the winter. It is a great asset to the hotel. The staff are wonderful, spanish hospitality is always good, but we did find everyone to be kind and genuinely helpful. We especially liked the gardener who took the trouble to find out the names of the flowers for me and left a note in our room. What a lovely touch ~ overall we were very happy with most things, and would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a relaxing city break in a quiet part of town.", "Date": "June 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay at Mirasierra\u201d", "Author": "GlobalTrekka", "ReviewID": "UR130972676", "Content": "Great suite hotel (equipped with microwave, sink, coffee maker), great for business and families. 5 min walk from Herrera Oria station that takes you downtown Madrid.
