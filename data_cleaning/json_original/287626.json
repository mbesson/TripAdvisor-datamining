I'm here until Friday, I better go ask if they can move me. 2nd try with the reception desk, a woman tells me she has something at a higher floor and it's a king bed. Awesome. I waited for 45 minutes to 1 hour. It's 5:20PM now. I go back to the front desk and Jillian is there. She checks on it and tells me that house keeping is not responding. Instead of keeping all of this a mystery, she takes the initiative and tells me she is going to go check out the room personally and find out what is going on. Jillian cares! About 10 minutes later, she is back and tells me the room has a crack piece of glass and that engineering is there working on it. At about 6PM, I'm thinking, I need to check in... this process has taken too long. Jillian Beeman says, \"thank you so much for your patience. I'm going to upgrade you immediately.

It only took me 30 minutes to get from La Guardia, has great cobblestone streets nearby and some good restaurants. Granted, I didn't get out much to explore since I was working, but I could see the location being a reason why someone vacationing would stay here. Generally, my impression of the hotel is that it caters to a younger, vacationing, socializing crowd. The roof top pool and DJ in the lobby really benefit this type of crowd.

Upon check-in, I was greeted by a friendly bellman and front desk clerk, and soon shown to a room of the category we had booked (deluxe king). The room looked fine, with a decent view, but unfortunately smelled of smoke. I called the front desk, and was fortunate to reach Jacquelin (not sure of her title, but she was a complete professional in every respect), who apologized profusely, and promptly had a bellman come with a set of keys to a new room (which happened to be on a higher floor and farther from the elevator). No more smoke smell -- but as I am very sensitive to smells, this room unfortunately smelled more of air freshener than anything else. I was prepared to live with it, not wanting to make a fuss, when I received a call (from Jacquelin) asking whether the new room was satisfactory (impressive follow-up!). I confessed my sensitivity to the smell, and she said that she was just going to upgrade us to a suite, which should make us happy. Within minutes, she personally came to the room with the new keys (higher floor still...), escorted us to a gorgeous 1 br suite, complete with a bottle of proseco waiting for us in the ice bucket. she couldn't have been more apologetic for the inconvenience, and I could not have been more grateful for how it all worked out. She then gave us a brunch recommendation for the next day (great local place called Monument Lane) proceeded to make reservations for us, and we thought that would be that. But when we returned from dinner that night, we were personally and warmly greeted by Jacquelin, who escorted us to the rooftop bar and gave us two free drink tickets (what had we done to deserve all this?) We checked out the next day, leaving our luggage at the hotel when we went for brunch. While I was waiting in the lobby for our car, Jacquelin again greeted us, and wanted to be sure we enjoyed the restaurant she had suggested. All in all, we felt like her personal house guest. I've never had service such personal experience like that before, especially in a big city, relatively large downtown hotel. It's professionals like Jacquelin who help build brand loyalty. (For the record, we had spent 5 nights during the recent black out at the Gansevoort on Park Ave, and were ready to move in -- so much so that I just booked 3 nights with my daughter in Miami at the Gansevoort there!)

I stayed 1 night for a company meeting/party. Arrived on Tuesday 12/20 in the afternoon and valet parked my car and was greeted very warmly. Upon checking I informed the girl at the front desk it was my first time staying at the Gansevort and was looking forward to my stay there. Went up to my room and it was clean with a nice king size bed. I had to rush out for a company party and did not arrive back until well after midnight. The room was at 85 degrees despite set for 68. Ended up sleeping with the window open all night because I did not feel like switching at 0100 in the morning. The room was very clean but the sheets were ripped in my bed. WTF??? Woke up the next morning to watch the news and the TV remote was broken. Upon checking out I informed the Front desk clerk of the issues. He apologized and said that they will be taken care of. While waiting for my car to be brought around from the parking garage the night manager approached me and apologized again I told him it was no big deal despite it being my first visit at the Gansevort. He than apologized again that the Hotel was slow and I should have been given a nicer room than the handicap accessible room I was put it. I informed him that my colleague was upgraded and he apologized again. He handed me his card and said to call him and he will \"make it up to me next time\" . I was really pissed and upset that I was discriminated in this manner by the desk agent. I may be older but I am not handicapped. The icing on the cake occurred two days after checking out when I was alerted on my Credit card activity that showed an additional $41 dollar charge ( parking I assume) which was already included on my hotel bill. I will not be staying at the Gansevort when we have our Monthly meeting in NYC in January and I have already have told my colleagues not to book there but stay at the Standard which is close by. It is not worth the aggravation to stay at this Hotel. Why would I risk another 400-500 night for this kind of discriminatory treatment when there are so many choices in NYC.

Our room on the 8th floor was quite spacious by NYC standards, very clean, and not to close to the elevator (as I had requested when booking the room). A word of caution, there were waterbottles and energy drinks set out on the bedstand, and at first I thought they were complimentary, but I checked the mini-fridge price list, and they were listed on there at an outrageous price. (check before you open, or plan on REEEALLY savoring that $8 bottle of water lol. Our room was spotless, carpets, windows inside and out, linens, furniture, tv etc etc, not a speck of dust, or a single smudge on anything. The bathroom as well was quite spacious for NYC, and again was spotlessly clean. Now the best part of the hotel IMO: The concierge service. I booked this hotel several weeks ago while I was out of the country for work, and dealt almost exclusively with the head concierge Keoni Boyer. He secured us the best seats in the house(F109 and F110) to Wicked (which was sold out) at the Gershwyn Theatre on Broadway. Got us table reservations on Friday night to Chef Mario Batali's Babbo's Restaurant. Got us pre-theatre reservations at Eric Ruperts 3 Michelin star flagship restaurant Le Bernadin (see seperate review of the restaurants), and was able to recommend to us some lounges and bars that we'd never been too, that were absolutely perfect for us. As for value, I could never give any Hotel in NYC a 5/5 because they all charge so much, so 4/5 is my top rating, as the service and size of the room was superb! Sleep Quality was given a 4/5 only because we had an issue figuring out our in-room thermostat. It was broken, we just turned it off, so the room got a little warm during the night. This hotel is probably not ideal for families or people traveling on business, due to the nightclub on the roof (which was a blast!) but for a leisure trip into the city it's GREAT! Some of the other reviews mentioned the music from the lobby. Was not a factor for us at all on the 8th floor. Others mentioned waiting for elevators... I'm sure you have to wait for elevators in every building?! On most nights when there is a line outside to get in and up to the rooftop club, we were treated almost like royalty when we showed our roomkey.

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not so much what they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re doing, because service has always been spotty, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more about what they did. And that was build a hotel with very spacious rooms, by NYC standards, in the heart of an amazingly fun part of town. Those two things are the real draw here. I come back here time and time again because of the rooms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 size. The beds are quite comfortable and a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153king\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is actually close to a real king size bed. Funny how in hotels the standards for bed sizes completely go out the window. The pillows, however, are far too smushy for me. I need to pile three of them up to get one firm pillow feel out of them. The closets are a very nice size and so are the bathrooms. The one problem with the bathrooms is the scalding hot bursts of water that always plague me no matter what room I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m in. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like they do not have scald-guard technology in their showers. Anytime someone in the hotel flushes a toilet, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to feel a scalding hot blast out of your shower. This is a universal problem, and it happens A LOT. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never stayed here and not had the issue. It really sucks. On the bright side, the water pressure here is very good. Toilets have these awesome ergonomic seats that I wish I had at home. Sinks and vanities are huge. Vanities have large drawers, and lots of them, to put your stuff in, which is good, because there aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too many places to put your folded clothes (stuff you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hang in the closet) in the room. The rooms are starting to show some age, however, and I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time for a renovation. The flat screen TV is one of the most embarrassing things this \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hip\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hotel. My laptop screen is bigger than these TVs. And the reception on them is just awful. I know the hotel is in the midst of changing out the little TVs to much larger, wall-mounted LG flat screens, but they sure are taking their time. I was here in the Summer and had a room with one of the new TVs. It was awesome. But here I am, 4 months later, and the room I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m in still doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have one of the new TVs. There are no DVD players either (except in the suite or by request) and I think that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really weak. The carpeting is showing quite a bit of wear and tear too at this point. The mini bars are okay. The dry stuff is kind of boring. They need to update what they offer and knock it off with the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mile high\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd kit kind of stuff and focus on tasty items that will tempt me. The fridges don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really keep stuff too cold and they are pretty tiny and overly packed with items. The beer selection is weak. Either Corona or Heineken, both in a can. I think they might have Amstel Light bottles too. I hate all of those choices though. Especially when they are warm. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no such concern about choice when it comes to water. The hotel offers like 4 or 5 different bottled waters in your room, along with some stupid \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dream water\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and an energy shot. The clock radios are old and outdated but do have a docking station for your iPod. The heat/AC controls are nearly useless. This is a very disturbing trend in NYC hotels. I have no idea why, but no matter what temperature you want your room at, you cannot count on the thermostat in your room to get it there. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re pretty much at the mercy of the hotel. This is one of my biggest pet peeves in NYC hotels. As for the service in the hotel, it is getting better, but is still not great. Like I said, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed here so many times in the past 5 years. I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a regular, but I certainly would expect that they would have my personal information on file, yet they ask me for it every-single-time. Its maddening. And they never ever welcome me back when I check in. On top of that, I know my travel agent gives them my preferences when making a reservation yet time after time I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get the type of room (bed size or location) that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve requested. Invariably, I have to go through this dance where I check-in, go to my room, and then call down to change. This was a huge problem for a while when they kept putting me on the smoking floor. Oh they will never admit it, but the 6th floor is definitely the smoking floor and if your on floors 5 or 7, you will get smoky smelling air coming through your vents. You can request an ionizer but that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really do much. Housekeeping is excellent and they do a great job of keeping your room spotless if you tip them every day. Well, you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to tip them, but they deserve it, so don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget them. One of the most annoying parts of the hotel is the club up on the roof. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not loud so that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good, but the elevators, especially at night, are often loaded to the gills with trashy (and trashed), overly cologne and perfumed club goers. On most nights, there are bouncers at the front door and elevator who treat you, a paying guest, no different \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or actually worse- than the club goers. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really disheartening. Almost forgot the pool. In the summer this is a nice option in NYC, if you can find a place to sit. Unfortunately, the seating around the pool is severely limited and people like to pull the lame move of putting a shoe or hat on a lounge early in the morning and then come up to the pool around noon, having \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reserved\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd their chaise. The lifeguard looks the other way at this practice and it really sucks. Overall, the Gansevoort is a great place to stay either for business or pleasure. The rooms are spacious and clean and have cool automated window shades that open and close with the push of a button by your bed (too bad they do not block out sunlight at all though). Service, like I said is slowly getting better. I think the front desk gets less and less indifferent I come largely due to the hotel losing guests to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hot\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd new hotels in the area (The Standard, and the Dream Downtown which sucks, by the way). Give the Gansevoort a chance, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m fairly certain you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll like it, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much better than the newer hotels in the area.", "Date": "November 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cawesome experience at this hotel!\u201d", "Author": "uris r", "ReviewID": "UR120177011", "Content": "my friends and i stayed at this hotel for 2 nights and we were more than satisfied with just about everything. our rooms were modern and spacious, and had this fantastic view of the hudson river, really spectacular at night!! service was amazing, the night manager, JP, was most helpful and attended to our questions and needs right away. location is the most convenient to just abt good restaurants, shopping, sightseeing, etc. we definitely recommend this to those that are wanting to experience an extraordinary hotel stay!", "Date": "November 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Linwood, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful, modern and convenient, albeit expensive.\u201d", "Author": "CEBB", "ReviewID": "UR120108198", "Content": "Booked a one night getaway with our 9 year old twins.

The bedroom also had a large closet, desk, Bose docking station and a bench at the foot of the bed. There was a half-bath was in hallway/entryway, living room with pull-out couch, table plus a couple ottomans and chair and a stepout balcony. Boys enjoyed the heated rooftop pool while we enjoyed watching them along with the gorgeous view of the city and the Hudson River. At one point, the bartender from the adjacent lounge (you can see into it from the pool area) came over and asked if we would like a beverage (it was early evening, no patrons)- loved the service here! Chelsea Market (great shopping and The Food Network) is right down the street, there was a convenience store and couple restaurants within the block. At turndown, received cupcakes and candy from local candy shop.

The rooms are fresh, bright, big and modern. The art on the walls give off a rather erotic vibe which is only enforced by the huge mirrors next to the bed and the giant windows. It's a sexy place :) Everytime I went in the lobby I saw fashionistas, jet setters, Europeans, and a generally high end, good looking, young or young at heart kinda crowd. Let me put it this way: if you are 42 and celebrating your 15 year wedding anniversary, this is NOT FOR YOU. Refer instead to my review of Trump Soho. There is a definitive party-trendy ambience and if that's not what you are looking for, you will be disappointed. They do their best to accommodate but it's gonna be loud at midnight.

Check in went mostly smoothly, although I've never been a guest at a hotel where there was a third-party payer. There was a bit of confusion at the front desk and the host called the travel arranger and all was straightened out. The room was on the front side of the hotel, just across the street from Pastis, a really great place to eat. We had a room with 2 queens which is what I had requested since we were two friends traveling together. The hotel's \"signature\" color is purple, so there was a lot of that. I found the reading lights by the bed to be rather inefficient, but then again, I have middle-aged eyes and this is a funky place. The bed was comfy with lots of pillows. There was an in-room safe. The closet was spacious, with plenty of hangers for 2 women's clothes. They provided complimentary slippers. We got turn-down service only one night (out of three), so I don't know what's up with that. The room seemed clean and well cared-for. The bathroom was perfect for 2 women. We had LOTS of stuff - products, hair supplies, etc etc. A large vanity area held a lot, and there were 2 spacious drawers for the electrical equipment (dryers, curlers, etc). The water pressure in the shower was great. I always travel with a small power strip, and I'm glad I had it, because there weren't nearly enough outlets, nor were they conveniently placed. The only mirror in the room was a full sized one on the wall, right next to a bed. There was no way to see a full length reflection and there was no place other than the bathroom to have a mirror to put on make up, not convenient when you have 2 women trying to get ready at the same time. The concierge was very helpful in procuring some show tickets and restaurant reservations (and cancelling one for us). There is a VERY popular rooftop bar which we only visited one afternoon, and we didn't even get a drink. When we came back to the hotel at night, there was always a line up of people to get in the hotel to go up to the bar. We were able to go to a separate door and get right in by showing a key. I wish there had been a separate elevator for the bar, as once you're on the elevator, you can stop at any floor, which is a little concerning, safety-wise. That said, there was always a big guy by the elevators, and it was nice that only guests are allowed to hang out in the smallish lobby bar area.

When I went to the room and saw there was construction right outside, I called down to frontdesk and they apologized saying it had just started yesterday and weren't sure which rooms were affected and moved me to another room on the other side of the hotel right away. Most of all, the location is amazing. Great shopping, restaurants, and nightlife in the area. We also had fun at the rooftop pool and club. Sure there were some greasy people there, but it was a good mix of different people and certainly a fun crowd. I also liked that they were really strict about only letting hotel guests by the pool, so it wasn't hard for guests to find a seat. I would definitely go back again and recommend to anyone looking for a fun time in NYC.", "Date": "July 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, TX", "Title": "\u201cGreat location but a little pricey\u201d", "Author": "Spankytoes", "ReviewID": "UR115256500", "Content": "The hotel itself was clean.

One incident really marred our enjoyment - and it was totally avoidable and wouldn't have happened at the other hotels we've stayed in in New York. In our room there were several items with price tags on. We normally leave the minibar alone and buy snacks from a local store. There was no pricelist sheet in the room. We drank some bottled water which had no sticker on it, having assumed that it was complimentary, which has been our experience in other hotels in NYC, certainly in this price bracket. Later when we got a pricelist sheet we discovered that the water cost almost $10. We wouldn't have paid for it if we'd known. We went to the front desk to politely explain that we'd consumed it mistakenly and we didn't think we should pay for it. The context is that we spent thousands of dollars on our stay, and happily paid premium prices for dry cleaning via the hotel as we appreciated the convenience. We do not begrudge paying for goods and services. But we made a genuine mistake about the water, and we were surprised that there was no complimentary water in the room. The man at the front desk wasn't able to deal with our issue and said that someone would get back to us. We then got a message on our phone and rang down to have someone read out a statement from the hotel explaining that they would not refund us the bottle of water. This struck my partner and I as incredibly petty and upset us both. When we checked out no-one asked us if we'd enjoyed our stay and whether we were totally satisfied. Service on the front desk was efficient but brisk, and nowhere near as friendly as other hotels we've visited in NYC. Often the staff seemed in a hurry or distracted by something else going on.

Myself and my partner had 6 bags between us and none of the bellboys bothered helping us, maybe they were busy but whatever, we struggled in ourselves. I don't usually need them, but the one time I thought I could do with some help, I couldn't get arrested! Not very good so far for a 5 star property I thought. Anyway, check in was swift and friendly and we were escorted to our room, with help!! Yay! I'd reserved a grand deluxe room with the family package which included cupcakes from a nearby bakery called Billy's at turndown and a lunch box full of treats from Dylans. This was cheaper per night than booking the room alone so check before you book. We did only received one cupcake throughout the whole 3 day stay. Had to beggar room service to be given another. Now I can imagine a family would have a problem sharing 1 cupcake between 3 or 4! So we gave up the idea that we would get a nice treat on the last day at turndown! The lunch box seemed to just contain pretty bog standard items from the minibar, that were never replaced daily. It was a nice touch to have some snacks without having to pay minibar prices but there are stores just across the road. The rooms at the Gansevoort are the hotel's best feature. I was on the 9th floor and had a great Hudson river view, slight spoiled by the building of The Standard hotel but don't let it put you off! Colourwise, they're a neutral grey with olive, deep red and mustard accessories. Dark wooden furniture and comfy chairs in darker neutrals complete the look. The bathrooms are cool in marble and stainless steel, not too huge but large enough. The beds are LARGE and VERY comfortable. The rooms are well appointed with quality amenities and brands you'd recognise, unlike other hotels. We had a comfortable stay. I'm sure the smaller rooms are just as comfortable, if you keep yourself tidy! The Meatpacking District is a noisy neighbourhood but it wasn't a particular problem. However, I didn't stay on a Friday or Saturday night. The rooftop pool is a great addition and it was lovely to be able to get into the pool in the New York heat. It was busy on an afternoon. The pool at Soho House across the road, that can be seen from The Gansevoort was very busy too so its probably a plus point that at The Gansevoort, only hotel guests can use the pool, whereas at Soho House, hotel guests and members are able to use their pool. The rooftop bar, Plunge, however is looking a little tired and definitely in need of a refurb. There was a queue in the street every night of people wanting a taste of The Gansevoort without having to pay to stay. There is a great view of the Empire State Building, however, there are certainly many better looking bars in NYC. The basement has a spa. The hydrotherapy pools are free for hotel guests to use and are a lovely way to end the day before getting ready for a night in NYC! Its definitely worth a stay at The Gansevoort to explore the Meatpacking District. There are plenty of bars, restaurants, the newly opened High Line park and also surrounding areas with plenty of stuff to do before you've even headed further downtown or uptown! With regards to the other local hotel options, its Meatpacking, its all expensive, its not good value, but The Gansevoort is definitely good for the lovely comfortable rooms, the location and the pool, just hit and miss on the service.", "Date": "June 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, but looking a bit worn\u201d", "Author": "ChiTravelgirl42", "ReviewID": "UR66992848", "Content": "I love the location of the Gansevoort in the meatpacking district, near great shopping, restaurants and nightlife.

I booked two hotel rooms 3 months ago. One of the friends that I would be traveling with called the hotel about a month ago to inquire about spa packages to be booked in conjunction with our rooms. She found that only one room was booked under my name. I called the hotel and inquired and indeed, only one room was booked. We straightened out the problem and a very helpful woman gave me new confirmation numbers and a 10% discount. That was where the great service ended. We arrived at the hotel on Saturday, one hour after check-in. We were told that our rooms were not ready, but for us to wait in the lobby and they would be ready shortly. We (and by we, I mean 7 women with all of our luggage) waited in the lobby for over a half an hour, and were then given ONE of our two room's keys. We were told that the other room would be ready shortly, as well, and that we could wait in the room that was ready. ONE HOUR passed and we called the front desk to inquire. They said they would send somebody up with our keys. They never did. We went down to the front desk to retrieve them. By the time we had both rooms, it was 530 pm. That is two and a half hours later than check-in. We had 730 dinner reservations. We began to get ready and found that our TOILET BOWL was not working properly. Because we now only had less than two hours for 7 women to get ready for dinner, we didnt call the front desk to let them know about the toilet. Not only were we not offered anything for out trouble and waiting, but the staff was RUDE. When we entered the building after the rooftop lounge was open, we were interrogated aggressively by security to see our hotel keys to make sure we were guests of the hotel. The day we checked out, housekeeping knocked on our doors twice before 11 am to ask if they could clean the room. Check-out was at noon. It was not necessary to be badgered while we slept (in dirty sheets, mind you-- one of the beds had blood stains on the sheets). Lastly, in addition to all of our trouble, I now found two unauthorized charges of $75 dollars on my credit card from the hotel. I called them, was connected to the billing department, there was no answer, and was told to \"leave a message at the tone\".

The rooftop pool was one of the major attractions when I booked for the summer trip. I just did not realise I would be sharing it with the whole of Manhattan. As a guest it is very clear that you are an inconvenience to the staff, everything is too much trouble. At the weekends there is a line around the block of people queuing to get into the nightclub, hotel guests are supposed to be able to get around this. In practice on several occasions I had to wait while the security staff were busy chatting to girls trying to talk their way around the line.

The Hotel is located in the meat packing district. Very chic, trendy, upscale area of New York. Upon my arrival I was greeted by the Valet who was very curt in assisting me with my vehicle. Not a very warm reception. When I entered the Hotel I was directed to the Front Desk. They were very nice and professional. Although my room was not ready I did have to wait for housekeeping to get my room in order. When I did get to my room I have to say I was not overly impressed with the cleanliness of the room. They have a glass covering on the TV Stand and underneath it was loaded with crumbs and other debris. That aside the room was very nice and for NY somewhat spacious. The bathroom was very nice. I wanted to get to the Gym right away and get a quick run in before Dinner. This was the BIGGEST DISSAPOINTMENT. First off, I had to wait at the Gyms Front Desk while the young girl was on the phone having a personal conversation, after she was finished she then took up a conversation with one of her coworkers. I was standing there for at least 5 minutes. Looking back I obviously should have interrupted to her but I was curious to see how long this charade would go on. Once checked in I went into the Fitness Center, which was very small. The cardio machines they have DO NOT have TV's on them. They had these old square screen TV's behind a glass partition which makes absolutely no sense. Most hotels now have the TV's incorporated into the equipment. You couldnt even plug your headset into the treadmill to hear what was on TV. Once I finished my run I then headed into what they call a \"Spa\". This is anything but. I used one of the 3 plunging pools they have and while I was in there employees were walking around, having loud conversations, one girl was mopping, etc. Once again, not clean either. Nothing like seeing a band aid in the plunge pool you are in. Water bucket for plants in corner, heaped on a pile of garbage. The Locker room is a joke. One toilet, one shower, one sink. A Spa is supposed to be tranquil, quiet and relaxing. By far the WORST Spa I have ever been to. I have stayed at Four Seasons, Ritz Carltons, etc. These places know how to run a Spa. The folks who were working this place, Im sure are very nice but have NO IDEA how to put people at ease and create that tranquility that you would expect from a 5 Star Hotel. I have to agree with another review. The Hotel was obnoxiously loud at night. I stayed on the 7th floor and at 1am the music was still blasting. $600 plus a night and not being able to sleep because of loud music is unacceptable. I like to have a good time but the Hotel must realize that the people STAYING at the Hotel are the ones spending the most money, not the twenty somethings who come in for a few drinks and shuffle along. Overall, the Hotel was just okay. I would NOT go back nor would I recommend this Hotel. When you spend upwards of $600+ per evening and a Hotel sets the expectations of being 5 Star you expect them to meet that standard. I stayed at the Four Seasons in NYC 3 weeks ago and The Four Seasons BLOWs this Hotel away. I would seek accomadations elsewhere. Sorry for the bad review.

From when I first walked into the room I was excited about my stay. The room was beautiful and spacious (admittedly a relative term in NYC, but still the room was plenty large enough for two people and very comfortable), and the bathroom was huge. In addition to the king bed and the desk area (free wifi!), there was a very inviting sitting area at the window. I also greatly appreciated that I could set the thermostat in the room to either heat or cool, and it did either one equally well. And I loved that the artwork was vibrant photos of things in the neighborhood, full of character, and not generic hotel art. The neighborhood is great, with lots to offer all different kinds of visitors. There is of course the meatpacking district with tons of hip clubs and restaurants, and the Chelsea Market is nearby, as well as the High Line within a couple blocks' walk. I also walked west to the Greenway, and took a stroll along the water all the way down to Battery Park. If you like walking, you can walk from the hotel across 14th to Union Square, or down Greenwich Avenue to West 4th and Bleecker Street. And of course you're close to several subway lines or cabs to get you anywhere you want to go. The private minibar was impressively well stocked, and room service options were great. I'm not much of a partier, but I did briefly check out the roof top bar, and it definitely looked inviting and like a great place to have a drink and check out the crowd. As others have commented, the beds are very comfortable. I also enjoyed sitting on the couch in the window and looking out on the activity of the neighborhood below. You can do quite a bit of people watching (even better with a glass of wine) from that vantage point. That said, 9th Avenue, which my room overlooked, is a busier thoroughfare than I would have suspected, and there is some street noise.

It was one of the worst hotel stays I've ever experienced. The front desk agents didn't wear nametags - very indicative of the Gansevoort's attitude towards customer service: anonymous, impersonal, and apathetic. Nobody is accountable for anything. The TV wasn't working when we got in the room, so the bellhop promised he would send somebody to fix it. Nobody came. A couple of hours later, we had to call the operator to ask them to send somebody. Later on that afternoon, we decided to go up to the roof to check out the view from the much-hyped rooftop pool. As we exited the elevator, a couple of security bouncers stopped us and told us we were not allowed to go into what looked like a lounge area because it was reserved for a private party. We asked if we could go into the pool area and a woman -- not the security people who just talked to us -- interjected and told us the pool is only for hotel guests. I could not believe the impudence of this woman assuming we weren't hotel guests! (By the way, the Gansevoort rented out this lounge area every night of our four-night stay so don't expect to be able to hang out there.) The rooftop parties were pretty loud. The hotel has 14 floors, and despite being six stories down on the 8th floor, I could hear the music anyway. Very annoying at midnight when you're trying to get some sleep. The hotel is also not environmentally friendly (they changed the sheets after the first day). I had to write a note daily to the housekeeper asking them not to change the sheets. On two of the days, I was there when Housekeeping came in, and even with the note I had written, both days the housekeeper started removing the sheets from the bed and I had to stop her, saying it wasn't necessary. While most hotels provide cards in-room asking you to place the card on your bed as a sign to let Housekeeping know not to change your sheets, it's disappointing and irresponsible that the Gansevoort provides no such water- and energy-saving option to its guests. Because there is a nightclub at the hotel, there is a velvet rope at the hotel's front door in the evenings. After a long day, I found it annoying and inconvenient getting stopped at the door and having to produce my room key before being allowed entrance. On the second day of my stay, I called my company's travel department and complained about the terrible service. They spoke with someone in Sales (first name Kristen - can't remember the last name) and Kristen assured our travel department that she would contact me to find out what they can do to alleviate the problems I had been having. On the third day of my stay, I called my company's travel department again to let them know Kristen never contacted me and they left a message for her, but I never heard from Kristen (or anyone from Sales). I thought it was dishonest and in bad form to promise to do something and then not do it. DO NOT TO STAY AT THIS HOTEL. It's not worth your money and the staff won't care about you. There are plenty of other places to stay at in New York (check the reviews of the top-rated hotels here on Tripadvisor.com -- you'll see the PR/sales managers replying to bad reviews asking past guests to contact them about the problems they had.

The concierge told me that I would never get a reservation there because it was new. I'm not sure he called because I did and got one myself! Otherwise the rooms were nice.

I phoned the hotel in advance to confirm the details of our reservation, which had been booked through Orbitz, and am glad I did. The only problem was that we had paid extra for a Deluxe room, but the hotel had us listed as having reserved a Superior room. Once the hotel clerk double-checked the reservation, she immediately corrected it from a Superior room to a Deluxe room, which is actually superior to a \"Superior\" room. Everything was in order when we arrived. The room was just as nice as depicted on the website. The staff was extremely friendly and solicitous. Every request was punctually met and the room was as quiet as any street-side room can be. I downloaded a \"white noise\" app onto my iPhone and we used the docking station in the room to use the phone app to help screen street noise. It worked. The beds are indeed extremely comfortable; the bathroom was spacious, with lots of storage and counter space, and the shower had good water pressure and consistent and plentiful hot water. The towels are big and fluffy. Appreciated extras: umbrellas stored in the closet, and complimentary wine and chocolates waiting upon arrival. We had to ask, though, if they were complimentary - we didn't want to be charged an exhorbitant amount for indulging. A note to that effect would have been appreciated. My only complaint is that the hotel doesn't have ice and vending machines. Although they will deliver ice to your room, it involves a little bit of a wait and the usual tip to the delivery person. I'd prefer walking down the hall to get my own ice whenever I want it, morning or evening. Although we liked having a refrigerator in the room, it was crammed full of expensive stuff that we didn't want to indulge in. We moved some of it out of the fridge and stored sodas from the deli on 14th Street for our own use. Some free room in the refrigerator would have been appreciated - or more reasonably priced goods stocked inside of it would have been more convenient. The hotel is nicely located, near the High Line trail, within walking distance of Greenwich Village, two subway lines and surrounded by great restaurants and is close to a few small convenience stores. The Pastis restaurant across the street has great food, but a reservation is recommended or you'll have to wait a while for a tiny little table and eat elbow-to-elbow with strangers. We didn't care about the night club on the hotel roof, but the traffic to and fro didn't impact our visit in any way.

For those not familiar with NYC, Hotel Gansevoort is located in the trendy Meatpacking District which in some cases allows area restaurants and businesses on occaision to be snooty and egotistic because \"everyone is just dying to eat, live, work\" there. I have worked in the area and frequented many of the restaurants with clients etc and the Hotel Gansevoort staff has ALWAYS been nothing but gracious and helpful. 1. Service: I have never had anything less the the utmost attention on any given stay with this hotel. On my most recent stay, we rented a suite and conjoining room for a Bachelorette Party. It was the best room with a great view and my friends and I (9 of us total) slept comfortably and cozy at the end of each evening. ANYTIME we called the front desk or concierge (even just for buckets of ice) our requests were responded to in no more than 10minutes! You seriously cannot get service like this anywhere else. 2. Amenitites: The rooftop pool is just a dream and an added treat if you are staying there! You cannot access the pool without being a guest of the hotel and guests of guests are limited as well. You MUST have a hotel key to enter into the hotel and to avoid the queue. Another user scoffed at the idea of having to show her key, but i congratulate them on regulating the users of their facilities and trying to keep unwanted users out. The pool is not humongous by any means, but again we are talking NYC people!!! The rooms at the W, Westin, Tribeca/Soho Grand are SMALLER and if i do say, less luxurious in my opinion! I look at having pool access on a rooftop no less, as just a blessing! Just get there early and you wont have to worry about not having a lovely lounge chair =) 3. Food: The room service menu in my opinion has never been anything less than delightful! And always within the time frame stated. It is a bit pricey, as most hotels usually are, but worth it if you just dont want to leave their cozy, pillow-like beds!! They have all the basics and a smaller more cost friendly kids menu that has pretty much adult size portions! However, I think if you do have time to get out....who wants to wait and order room service! Go out and see and try all the area restaurants including the hotel's ONO! My personal favorite in the area is Spice Market which is right across the street and has delicious middle-eastern cuisine. If you like spice, thats the place for you! But there are plenty of other options all within a few feet of the lovely hotel. Overall, I consistently reccommend this hotel in NYC and Miami to friends, clients and family and have NEVER in my 4 years of staying with them have EVER had a bad experience at all!!!

But there are a couple of positives (location and cleanliness) to be fair to them. First of all, the randoms: the hotel is constantly full of randoms going up to the Gansevoort's various rooftop pool parties and these randoms were on the whole, completely skanky and always drunk. Also, you always have to show your hotel key at the entrance to the hotel as they have lots of party-goers trying to get into the rooftop queuing outside - at first fine, but after a few days, seriously frustrating. Second, the concierge service: it was our wedding anniversary on the 2nd night there so before going to NY, we asked the concierge to book us a good restaurant.....he confirmed the booking to us and we were both very excited.....and wait for it....when we got to the restaurant, it was closed! I couldn't believe it. Third, the rooftop pool & bar: on the 3rd morning, breakfast was moved up to the rooftop as their restaurant Ono (or \"Oh No!\" as we like to call it) was being refurbished and it literally smelt of stale booze....an awful way to start the morning...I looked in on the pool area and it was so small - the photo on the website was completely unrepresentative of the space... 4. The room: The room was supposed to be big in sq ft terms but in fact, the layout of the suite was so poor that it was really cooped up...also, it was supposed to be a non-smoking room, but once upon a time, someone definitely smoked in there as it still smelt of stake smoke. 5. Room service: it was appalling....I ordered a club sandwich and I got cheap processed turkey slices rammed into some bread....and one day I ordered breakfast (after the bad rooftop breakfast experience) and they didn't even bring 90% of what I ordered.... 6. The fitness centre was terrible...even thinking about it makes me laugh. It was almost as small as my under-stair cupboard...okay, that's unfair. It was precisly, 4x the size of my under-stair cupboard. 7. Housekeeping: This was done very well. The room was cleaned twice a day and the lady who looked after our room was really nice and polite. 8.

On the last day of our trip, my friend and I checked out of the hotel and left our luggage with the bell desk for storage. When we returned that afternoon to pick up our belongings and depart for the train station, the hotel had a lost a piece of our luggage. My friend and I sat in the lobby for over 90 minutes as they searched. This caused us to miss our train, for which the hotel would not offer reimbursement or rebooking assistance. During this time, we were not offered any more hospitality than one would receive in a hospital waiting room. The hotel ultimately located the luggage--they had sent it home with another guest. That guest then checked the luggage on a flight overseas. It has now been 1 month, and we have still not received the lost suitcase. The hotel is refusing to reimburse for the missing items and is claiming that the bag will take at least another week to recover. Furthermore, the hotel staff has been very difficult to deal with, not returning phone calls and emails, and not offering more than a small compensation for the inconvenience. Although this hotel has a great location, stylish decor, and fun bars, I would not ever choose to stay there again, and I would not recommend it to anyone who enjoys hospitable, competent service.", "Date": "June 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kent, UK", "Title": "\u201cParty Hotel\u201d", "Author": "TravellerKent_UK", "ReviewID": "UR31475429", "Content": "Firstly this hotel is in a fab location, we were impressed with all the cool bars and restaurants in the area.

The location of the hotel is fantastic - Beyonce was dining over the street in Pastis and there are enough restaurants, shops and nightclubs to keep you happy for a lifetime. The rooms are stylish and comfortable, with window seats looking out over the Hudson and a bed that would make anyone sleep like a baby. Unfortunately this is where the praise grinds to a horrible halt. Our business trip involved meeting lots of media from the travel press. Our plan was to have meetings in the hotel, hosting lunches in the Ono restaurant (or 'Oh No' as I now call it) and drinks in the bar on the roof. On our first night we went up to the bar, but were told we couldn't sit down because all the tables were reserved for people spending at least $1,000 on bottle service - no credit crunch here! We pointed out that our colleague was 7 months pregnant and that at a rate of $400 a night for 6 nights (for three people) we expect a seat in the bar. Sadly not, the bar seemed only interested in dressing its staff in outfits you'd expect to see in a low class strip club and having them work the tips from the $1,000 Cristal sipping tables. We put this experience aside and went up on the roof again for lunch the next day. My pregnant colleague went to the bar and asked the barman for the snack menu, he responded to this request by telling her he had the right to refuse her alcohol! A bit out of order given she just wanted an orange juice and the club sarnie. The next day in the Ono restaurant we wanted the lunch with the journalists to go perfectly, so we pre warned the manager. We were therefore dismayed when the food was late, the waiter wasn't able to explain the menu and the wrong order was brought to the table - even although they were hardly rushed as the place was totally empty. We also asked for a selection of vegetarian sushi for our pregnant colleague - only to get three rounds of the same avocado rolls. To avoid further embarrassment we decided to take our cue from our mate Beyonce and head to Pastis for our other meetings. The final straw was when my colleague, yep the pregnant one again (they really had her number) was locked out of her room because she had gone $20 over the company wire payment. No doubt she'd been racking up the bill by knocking back the Vodka and avocado rolls in her room! We spoke to the Manager's assistant, complained at the front desk and called the PR company for the hotel - but no-one from the Management team bothered to acknowledge our complaint. Whilst telling every journalist we met of our experience in the hotel we heard an amusing story back. When the hotel opened they had a really bad rat problem (no longer the case) but they refused to acknowledge it - even although there were rats running across the lobby. \"No problem here\", said the Manager!

As someone who appreciates lighting, I was thrilled to have so many options in the room for setting ambiance such as illuminating just the artwork, dimming the bedroom lights, only using the sconces, etc. I could have easily moved in, especially if it meant daily use of the fabulous rooftop bar and pool. The front desk staff was friendly and efficient, especially Mike who checked me in. I do have to say I found the bed a little uncomfortable, the traffic quite audible and the shower had issues such as a showerhead that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t move and sprayed the opposite wall when not blocked by my body and a shower curtain that barely reached the tub and splashed water on the floor, but seriously who cares?

Easy to grab a cab to midtown museums, theatres and Central Park. We've stayed as a family at more traditional midtown hotels and all determined we prefer this hotel's downtown neighborhood location. We had a deluxe standard for 4 nights and the room was actually more spacious than anticipated--2 adults and 2 teenagers and we felt like we had enough room (unlike previous stays at the Plaza and the Waldorf). Also loved the fact that this room type provided us with great balcony and open window--I think this added to the more spacious feel of the room. Extra plus: had noted on reservation to hotel that we were celebrating a 50th birthday. Much to our suprise upon returning to room in late afternoon of first day, we found a bottle of Veuve Clicquot champagne, a (yummy) personalized birthday cake and birthday card! Very nice touch. Downside: as mentioned by other reviewers the noise at night is defintely something to consider. We were on the 6th floor facing the front entrance and there is a lot of nightime noise in general in the neighborhood, but especially because of the hotel's rooftop club. While this wasn't an issue most nights in terms of entering and getting to our room (staff let hotel guests go to front of line and in sep. elevator) it is loud until wee hours of morning.

The front door staff insisted on seeing our room keys before letting us in which after having stayed at other NY hotels with similar setups (gramercy park) that remembered its guests was just not acceptable. The morning staff were great which was a sharp contrast to the nightclub attitude of the evening with a few exceptions the Giant chap at the elevators was very pleasant and once you got into the lobby you became a guest again.

Despite this, we had an experience here I just had to share. Appreciate it may seem a little Simon Cowell. Stayed in a suite here for five nights in early April. We liked the location. The meat packing really is a fantastic location and Gansevoort is right in the heart room and view. We had a suite overlooking the Hudson on the 11th floor. At $800 per night it was expensive but for New York about the cheapest suite with two separate rooms we could find Restaurant. Food was good for the price. Not a 3 star michelin, but for the money very tasty and thoughtful dishes We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t The overall product is just not special enough. This hotel is positioned in some guidebooks along side the Mercer, 50 Thompson and even the Four Seasons. My expectations (particularly in the meatpacking) was an uber cool/unique offering. It really isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. It just doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel special enough and it was a bit of a disappointment. There are some really exciting hotels out there and I thought this would be one. The decor, service, food, concept, design/architecture, rooms are all fine. But just don't stand out. I caveat this view with the fact the our expectations we high given the positioning in some of the guide books and press. Plenty of frustrations to compound the above. (i) Service was variable - we asked for a cot for our daughter before arriving as we new after flying in we would all be tired and want to go bed. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in the room on arrival and we had to ask twice more. Three hours later it arrived. Asked twice for a DVD payer which turned up two days later (bearing in mind the rooms are advertised with a DVD payer!). A couple of times the door staff watched us struggled with our stroller getting out of the front doors without offering to help. At least twice we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get anyone to answer the room service line and had to go downstairs. All in all, a million miles away from the Four Seasons (ii) The pool - looks amazing on the photos. The entire area was undercover when we stayed there and it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t due to be taken down until the end on April despite the temperature being over 20C. It completely changed the space into a claustrophobic, chlorine smelling, stuffy space, where you are served drinks out of plastic cups by \u00e2\u20ac\u0153girls who look like prostitutes wearing skimpy, mis-fitting, cheap, dresses who wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what service looked like....\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd(as my wife put in one evening). If you go and the cover is down I bet its great. (iii) Overcharging on our bill - charged $60 for a mini bar binge that never happened. Brought the wrong bottle of wine one evening which resulted in an additional $20 going on our bill. We were told by one staff member that we wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to pay for a simple glass of milk for our baby. They advised us just to call down and get it on a morning. We were charged 2 lots of $13 for two glasses of milk despite this! We politely made our point to the front desk and they were less than apologetic - they removed the overcharges but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even say sorry. This annoyed me more than the over charging itself. (iv) The noise! - we were on the 11th floor and if you want an undisturbed nights sleep forget it (especially on a friday and Saturday night). The only night it was reasonable was Sunday. I can not imagine what this would have been like if we were down on say the third floor!!!?!!! (v) The breakfast buffet really was average. I asked for an expresso one morning and it was clearly all very hard and difficult. Usual fruit, yogurt, bland filter coffee, cereal, bacon, eggs. Go to Pastis (of sex in the city fame) across the street. We did have a fantastic vacation and we have re-calibrated the review given the relative expense New York.

Last year, whether on a Tuesday or Friday night, there was a line out the door to get into the rooftop bar, and the lobby was constantly crowded with trendy looking people. This year, the hotel wasn't nearly as crowded and the crowd seemed to be a lot older and more professional. Despite the change in crowd, the hotel was just as great as I remembered it. My mom and I shared a suite, which was a glorified standard room with a parlor. We each had our own bathroom, and I slept on a fold out bed. Although we probably didn't need all the space, we got what we paid for. The maid service was excellent-- they cleaned up all my messes for me. We also recieved the NY Post each morning, which is a real step up from the typical Wall Street Journal I usually get at hotels. All rooms are equipped with robes, slippers, and umbrellas, which can come in handy with NYC's unpredictable weather. The Gansevoort's employees are all friendly, pleasant and eager to help, qualities that you don't encounter often in the city. The Gansevoort's location is unbeatable. With restaurants like Pastis, STK and the Spice Market within walking distance, and shops like Jeffrey and Scoop right down the street, you can avoid a few taxi rides. At night, the Meatpacking District is THE place to be, and if you are up for the city's fun nightlife, the Gansevoort is the perfect place to stumble home to--just don't expect the party to continue like it used to.", "Date": "March 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amsterdam", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Stay in a terrific neighbourhood\u201d", "Author": "sitbackandrelax", "ReviewID": "UR14297332", "Content": "During our first visit in NYC, after a one night stay in a other hotel which was horrible, we decided to change hotels a go for hotel gansevoort.

I had high expectations because of the trendy decor of the hotel as well as the good experiences I've had at the rooftop bar in the past. For $500 per night, you also tend to raise your expectations a little bit. However, upon arriving to the hotel, the woman behind the desk was less than accomodating to help us get a room with a view of the Hudson River, which I had requested when I booked the room 3 months in advance. And then when we got to our room, the bathroom lights were burned out and it took them almost 24 hours to get someone in there to replace the lightbulbs for us. We also noticed that there was not a clock in our room. When we called the front desk to ask about it, they told us that not all guest rooms are equipped with a clock. Sorry, but for the average price of this hotel, we found that very odd. I think they could afford to put analog clocks in the rooms, even if they aren't fancy! We were also a bit irritated to find that we would get locked out of our room everyday, as our key cards would not work whenever we left the room and we had to go back to the lobby to them reactivated each time. It was annoying things like this that added up and made the stay not worth the price we were paying for the room. Aside from these frustrations, it is an ideal location if you want to be on the west side of Manhattan near some of the best restaurants and night life.

For each visit, we generally stay in a different neighborhood to better get to know The City. This trip (Dec. 8-10) was intended to be all about the Meatpacking District, so we selected the Hotel Gansevoort based on the hotel's website and the mostly-positive reviews here on TripAdvisor. Unfortunately, our visit wasn't nearly as special as others have experienced. In fact, in my response to the guest comment survey from the hotel, I indicated, well, as follows... (\"While nice, the hotel was not particularly special in appearance. The front desk staff and concierge met only the most basic expectations of completing the simple process of checking us in/out, and making a dinner reservation. For the rate paid (over $1,000/night incl. taxes), I expect excellence, and received only the mediocrity I would have expected from a routine business-class hotel such as a Hampton Inn or similar type property. For these reasons, we will not be returning to the Gansevoort.\") All due apologies to Hampton Inns all over the country, as they continue to be consistent, comfortable and cost-effective for my business travel. Back to the Gansevoort... We were staying in a Junior Suite (#912), which admittedly provided a decent view of the just-opened Apple Store at 9th Ave and 14th Street (see my photo). I'm an Apple fan, so that was a nice treat. :-) The room was nicely sized, especially for Manhattan, though corner rooms often are. We arrived at the hotel at about 11:15 AM, knowing fully that check-in was 3:00 PM. We dropped our bags with the bellman (Orlando), and headed out on a nice Saturday to enjoy the area. We ate at Pastis (right across the street from the hotel) and enjoyed a wonderful brunch. At 2:28 PM, just as we were settling our check at Pastis, the front desk called to let us know a room was available, so we headed across the street to get settled in. Orlando was again gracious in bringing our bags to the suite, and in giving some local tips for dining (Buddakan instead of Buddha Bar, for example; both are very close walks from the hotel). One odd touch: there was a small stuffed duck/goose on the bed, which we learned was complimentary and is supposedly the icon for the hotel even though I didn't see this anywhere else during our stay. Contrary to comments from some reviewers, we weren't bothered by the street noise. Maybe we were too tired from a long day of wandering the streets, seeing a show (Spamalot on Saturday, Wicked on Sunday; both were terrific). When we returned to the hotel, there was quite a line of 20-somethings waiting to get into the G Lounge (the spa in the basement converts to a lounge at night). As hotel suite guests, we were \"on the guest list\" and able to bypass the waiting line, so we went directly downstairs to check it out. The lounge was very small, okay music, not lit as seductively as it could be (more candles and less halogen-type lights would help). The crowd was typical, what my wife and I call \"New York attractive\" (young, thin, darkly dressed). I think we stayed about 10 minutes before deciding it just wasn't for us. BTW, we visit trendy clubs regularly, and don't mind loud music. We're 30-40-somethings :-) and feel quite comfortable in the midst of younger crowds, so that wasn't the situation here. The G Lounge simply lacked something that we couldn't identify, but knew immediately was missing. Sunday evening, when we walked to Buddakan (about 2 1/2 blocks north on 9th (at 16th), it was raining, and the hotel provided umbrellas for guest use. The food at Buddakan was terrific (the steak in particular, but also the lobster/shrimp/noodle concoction), and the service was impeccable. Our check-out process Monday was simple at the front desk... again, nothing special at all. No \"thank you for staying with us\", \"come back soon\", or the typical and expected salutations. In summary, if you want a decent location in the meatpacking district, and don't care if the hotel staff pays any real attention to you or not, the Gansevoort is not a bad choice.

The bellman then rung up the elevator for me and showed my around the room once I got there. Very cool. The complimentary breakfast was okay, nothing to get too excited over. There was a lot of fresh fruit around. There was even an omelete station (with a sign that mentioned an extra charge for an omelete) The room was spacious and the beds were turned down every evening. I want to note that room service will only conduct turndown service when it is convenient for you. The bathrooms were big and stylish, and most of all clean. In fact, the whole suite was pretty well organized and felt in place. The staff was friendly and attentive in both Ono and the lobby lounge. The food is quite expensive, but it's offset by restuarants in walking distance (like across the street). I found myself going to Pop Burger about a five minute walk north of the hotel. All in all, the hotel is in a great location and the staff was friendly (despite what other reviews have stated). I'm definitely checking in again.

If they had called and advised or told us at check in, it would have been no problem to stay somewhere else. Add to all that, we asked the conceirge for dinner recommendations and he made them.

After arriving at the hotel at 1:45pm for a 3pm check in, we found that the room was not yet ready, (which was not a problem, we understand that early check ins are not always feasible). However we were greeted coldly and shortly and when we asked if it was possible to sit at the pool until the room was ready, we were coldly ignored and so we opted to shop for a bit around town until trying again to check in. We arrived back at 3pm to find that the room was still not ready, only this time we insisted that we be able to sit at the pool until the room was ready. We were told that we would be phoned on my cell phone as soon as the room was available. We had to ask an actual hotel guest how to get to the pool and if there was an area to change in upstairs into our suits as the front desk attendents still proceeded to be of no help. Once changing in the public locker room which consisted of two, dirty bathroom stalls, we were told that the pool was completely booked and that we would have to sit on the deck on the other side of the hotel. We then sat on the deck, nowhere near the pool and with no beverage or towel service. We repeatedly had to get up off of the deck to find a server for drinks and appetizers, when one finally came she proved to be even ruder and more uninformed than the front desk attendents, when we asked what kind of white wine by the glass the bar offered she exclaimed that she had no idea and did not offer to inquire for us. Our drinks took on average 25 minutes to arrive to us once we had ordered. After not being phoned yet to check in, at 4:30pm we finally went back down to the lobby to inquire if the room was ready and it was, however noone had bothered to phone my cell phone to inform me so that we could put our bags into our rooms.

We had to ring multiple times to get soemone to check out the problem but it was never fixed. Concierge were really rude when we asked for nightclub and bar reccomendations. We had to wait for ages and I had never seen somebody in the services industry be so rude to a paying customer. The hotel is in a great location and some of the communal areas are cool - the lobby and restaurant - but i thought the bar on the roof was shabby and totally overrated.

The service, as noted by others, is lacking. I was looking at the Hudson and this Hotel for a three day stay in New York over New Years.

The district is entirely commercial during the day, and only at night does the area come alive. Most of the people coming into the area are coming for the local clubs. But if you plan on seeing the rest of the city, the location puts you a further cab ride away. I reserved the grand deluxe room. The room was small, but clean and had a modern design. The bathrooms were nice for NY standards. The view was of the meat packing district and the river. However, the heater in the room would not turn off (call one to the front desk). Then the mini bar key was locked with no key (call two). Then the remote control did not work (call three). Not exactly what I expected for nearly $700 a night. The lobby is small and the rooftop bar is equally small, especially when tented during the winter. The NY party was packed with very little seating and completely indoors (also ran $175 per person just for drinks and a few appetizers). For my last day I decided to try the W Tuscany on Park Avenue. It had a small lobby...but the rooms were just as nice as the Gansevoort and MUCH bigger for $319 a night. Although a more business location...the hotel was much closer to most of NYC's attractions.

As monthly visitors to NYC, we have stayed in many hotels including The Peninsula, the W Hotels, The Westin, The Pierre and the Mandarin to name a few. My first experience of the hotel was not a pleasant one as due to a 5 hour flight delay, I spent 9 phone calls and hours trying to contact the Concierge to arrange a Limo to collect us from JFK. All I ever got was an answering service and after having to leave a message, I received no confirmation that a limo was sent and we were forced to arrange our own transport. In fact, whilst the concierge was most pleasant when he was at his desk, he was not to be seen on many occasions. The hotel itself is lovely but does not compare to the Sanderson in London which it beat into 2nd spot. In fact, I would have to say that the Westin on Times Square or the W on Times Square gives it a good run for its money. The Gansevoort\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rooms are extremely small (we booked a deluxe room) but pleasant. The beds are also very small by hotel standards and are not the normal Californian king beds you find in most luxury hotels. Again, the rooms at the Westin compare favorably with similar d\u00c3\u00a9cor, are also bigger and you get the Westin \u00e2\u20ac\u0153heavenly bed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which cannot be beaten. The Gansevoort's bathrooms do however offer more space. The hotel itself is in a great location if you want to make use of all the clubs and bars in the area and we certainly did care of some guest passes from the Concierge. The rooftop bar is also a great way to end off the night. The long queue of people getting in and out of the rooftop bar does detract from the exclusivity of the hotel unfortunately. The major problem with the hotel is that the rooms are not very well sound proofed and sleeping is almost impossible after a late night out with the noise and hooting going on below. At least the room provides a CD player to drown out the noise and we made full use of it even after getting back to the room at 4am and looking forward to some peace and quiet. The Gansevoort is no match for the elegance, professionalism and class of The Peninsula and I will return to the Peninsula for my next trip. I would also say that the Westin is far better value for money and worth a consideration if the 5 star hotels like The Peninsula, Mandarin or Pierre are not in your budget.

I hung up after making the reservation and it got me so heated that out of principle I called back and canceled and will now be staying at 60 Thompson where they couldn't have been nicer. When I told 60 Thompson the story, they said, \"no one here is like that\".", "Date": "October 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "paris, monaco, ny", "Title": "\u201cThe best experience in New York--Fashionable Guests, and Beautiful Design\u201d", "Author": "carine m", "ReviewID": "UR5968924", "Content": "This hotel was such a delight.

We are a small family - two adults and one child aged 5. When we arrived our room was not ready, but the front desk manager offered to call us on our cellphone as soon as the room was ready. We went to see the Puertorican day parade and returned a few hours later. We had a grand deluxe room with two double beds, which was perfect for us. Our room was located on the 8th floor, overlooking 13th street. When we stepped out on our small balcony we could see the Hudson river. Okay, it is quite noisy if you keep the windows open at night, but when closed we slept perfectly for all seven nights - the beds where very comfortable. We also thought that the breakfast (included in our rate) was a joke - at first! But after trying the granola with all the different fresh berries, and the very delicious muffins and croissants we gave in. We had thought about going out for breakfast some of the days but we were actually looking forward to granola with plenty of fresh raspberries and blueberries and lots of other kinds of fresh fruit every morning. As foreigners (from Denmark) we can't really comment on the crowd. To us, they all seemend very well dressed! But our friend, who is a photographer in New York, says that she thinks it is \"too much Time Square\". We didn't mind - since we were with a small child we didn't feel like going to the rooftop or the basement bar after all, but enjoyed the people watching from our balcony... The hotel is not a hotel that you would normally bring a kid to, but we loved the area with all the good restaurants, the pool in the afternoon, the dog spa across the street and the nearby Bleecker Street playground. All the things that our daughter had looked forward to (Natural History Museum, American Girl Place, ToysRus) and the sights that we insisted on showing her (like MoMa) where all easily reached by the nearby subway. Also, the staff were all great and when our daughter had an accident (she fell and hit her head) Tim at the front desk did everything he could to make sure that we went to the best ER and that she was doing fine. We have some very minor complaints: We had chosed the hotel basically because of the location and the rooftop pool. Our daughter loves to swim and looked forward to it every day. But two of the days of our stay we came back in the afternoon only to find out that the pool area was closed off due to some private event... this is not okay. Also, we asked for a dvd which never came, and had to ask twice for a playstaion (both free of charge, so really we can't complain about not getting the service, but we were told at all times that they would install both dvd and playstation imidiately). We liked the decor of the restaurant, but weren't too impressed with the lobby and room. We have stayed at some very nice \"design hotels\" all over the world , but we prefer the European hotels over the American. It seems as if the American lacks something... too cold.

Somehow we then got a feeling for the place and decided to stay here for our next trip. The reviews we read where mainly positive. But we were misled. Starting from the top of the hotel, this is an area solely for the entertainment of non resident hotel guests. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hip\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd crowds have since long moved onto another new nightspot, and we can understand why. The view might be great, but the d\u00c3\u00a9cor is simple, cheap and run down. The music is disappointing and the overpriced cocktails are not well done. There is a rooftop pool, which was open but covered by a boring plastic shelter. Even when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s removed it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not going to look by far as attractive or inviting as the rooftop pool you can see across the street at the Soho House.

However as hotel guest there are no other privileges, and to our surprise we could not even get a table to sit at unless we opted to pay the minimum bottle charge. Nevertheless, there are plenty of better clubs to visit in the neighbourhood where the money spent will be much more worth it. Moving down to the accommodation. We stayed in a grand deluxe room which is on a higher floor and has a fantastic view of the Hudson river. The room is small and the decor is simple. We had booked several months in advance asking for a silent room but were put right next to the elevator and we were disturbed by screaming kids in the morning and late night party people in the corridor. We immediately complained to the duty manager but it was left unsolved. Yes they offered us a smaller room with a different view, obviously with no compensation, but on the contrary at same price. A pretty smart try. The breakfast is a JOKE! Fortunately it was included in the price because I would never have paid for it. A buffet consisting of some dry croissants, yogurt, fresh fruit (which was the only bonus), and regular coffee or tea. As you sit down the waiter gives you a menu to order from, but all this is not included, which, of course, the waiter do not let you know. So I reckon a few peoples have been royally ripped off here. The over all service is really poor. There is no charm. And the hotel is starting to become rundown. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stay here there are better hotels like 60 Thompson or the Mercer.

We planned on a night of sophisticated R&R, and picked this hotel based on recent reviews, as well as it's reputation as a top NYC property. Living in northern NJ, we had a pretty good idea of what to expect from midtown hotels, so we decided to stay in the Meatpacking District to avoid all the tourists, noise, traffic, etc., to be close to the Spice Market and downtown shopping areas. It's not that the hotel itself wasn't nice-it just wasn't great. We stayed in a corner suite which costs upwards of 1k a night, and for that money, I expect 5-star excellence. Our biggest complaint was that even from the 10th floor we could hear loud voices and constant car horns from the street below-until 5am. Perhaps it's not fair to blame the hotel for that, but at checkout the front desk agent told me that they get many similar complaints from balcony room guests, and that \"next time\" we should stay in a \"single in the back\" of the hotel, which are obviously much less expensive and less noisy. I just said \"uh...ok\" and left it at that. I'm not a particularly light sleeper, but for that kind of money I expect at the very least not to be kept awake all night. Unfortunately, since we didn't get to sleep until after 5 and slept until 11, we missed the breakfast that was included with the room purchase. The front desk girl just shrugged her shoulders and gave us a \"SOL\" look, and walked on to the next customer. I wasn't seeking compensation, but sympathetic concern even if disingenuous, would have been nice. After a night out, we returned to the hotel only to encounter 50-75 people standing behind a velvet rope at the entrance. Apparently they were on line to get into the top floor lounge, and the ropes were in place to control the flow of people allowed in. It also managed to control the flow of registered guests into the hotel as well. As my wife and I made our way past the crowd and walked into the one single open door, we were met by a bouncer-type who stepped in front of us and barked out; \"CAN I HELP YOU?!?!\". I guess the concept of actual hotel guests entering from the front entrance along with club people was way too much for this guy-or hotel management for that matter-to process. I just ignored him and walked on by, but it's not something you should encounter when paying these rates. The top floor lounge (a couple of appetizers and three rounds of drinks in plastic \"glasses\" totaled $130) was nothing spectacular. After discovering this place, we realized why we had encountered so many image-conscious 20-somethings aimlessly riding the elevators and wandering the guest hallways looking for it. There were no signs anywhere in the lobby or inside the elevator telling them that the lounge was located on the \"PH\" level. I guess it's all part of the \"chic\" atmosphere that people just know where the hip spot is. But don't be surprised to meet some of them on your way down the hall to the ice machine. All in all I would not return for the above reasons, only. The beds were comfortable, and the rooms were clean, modern and well appointed.

Since I used to live near the meatpacking district i chose the Gansevoort.

Normally this would be acceptable, but to have the nerve to increase the rate by $10 per night when my bill was to already going to exceed $10,000 is rediculous. 2) The cheesy bar upstairs didnt help things. The thump from the equally as cheesy music could be heard in all rooms until 5am nightly. Oh, did i mention the crowd was cheezy? 3) The hotel has a unique air conditioning system. If it is 73 degrees outside or cooler the A/C cant be turned on. Well, in NYC if it's 72 degrees with 100% humidity (as it often is) it feels like its 90 degrees!

This July 4th, I decided to stay in NYC, my home town, and create a vacation in the city. This was the best vacation I have ever had!!! The hotel of choice was Hotel Gansevoort. With corporate rates at the other hotels, I was almost swayed against Gansevoort, but I was struck by the images of the interiors, the roof top pool, and a bit by curiosity for the unknown. This was one of the busiest weekends of the year in NYC, but Hotel Gansevoort never let it bother them. The staff always made sure that when there was a line outside to get into the Penthouse Night club (great views and music!!) the guests were wisked up first. Now that is VIP!! During the day, when the pool was crowed, we asked the lifeguard and poolstaff to call us when a lounge was available. About 2 hours later, they called! It is unheard of, even in the best hotels to expect this kind of follow through. The Spa was under renovation, and the gym was split between three guest rooms. We wanted to workout, but the music was missing from one of the rooms (security reasons...very understandable if you saw the stereos in the rooms). I brought the one from my room, and the concierge had an extension cord in my room before I could unplug the stereo and carry it down the hall. Another perk, would have to be the continental breakfast. Often times, I stay at Ian Schrager hotels. I love them, but the breakfast can run you about $80-100 for two people. At Hotel Gansevoort, this is included. Granted, there are no cold cuts (who needs the fat!), but granola, danishes, mini-muffins, 4 types of cut fresh fruit, 4 types of fresh berries, yogurt, coffee, hot chocolate, and tea is plenty to get your morning going. As I said, these three days downtown seemed as eventful and relaxing as a week long vacation in LA, Miami, or any other major city you can name. Hats off to the Staff at Hotel Gansevoort!

So we requested it the following morning at the front desk along with extra pillows, extra towels, and reported that the drain valve in the bathtub was broken and drained terribly slow. Later that morning we ran into someone from engineering with the iPod stereo, but they had brought the one for the smaller iPod. Later that day after having walked around the city we returned to the room at approximately 2pm. Our room hasn't been cleaned yet. Of course our requests for more pillows and extra towels weren't done either. So we called in and reported these issues. We decided to head to the pool to swim and we enjoyed our $30 overcooked filet and side of frozen fries. We asked for the bill once, and our server decided to bus tables. So we had to ask for it again. After hanging out at their pool for several hours, we returned to find the room has been cleaned and we got the extra towels.

Definitely recommend this place, I wouldn't stay anywhere else.", "Date": "April 4, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cFabulous time at the Gaansvoort\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3321270", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Gaansvoort recently. We were greeted by a very friendly and enthusiatic woman who took our bags from the car and helped us check in. All through our stay, our needs were met. The location was phenomenal and the view from our room was spectacular overlooking the Hudson River. I highly reccommend this hotel.
