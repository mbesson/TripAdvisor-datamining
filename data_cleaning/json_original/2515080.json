The rooms (we were in 501 in January) are a nice size and we had a fantastic view of the St Severin church from our window. The staff are helpful and polite - we asked the front desk to help us make a couple of restaurant reservations and she did so with a smile. I've never had the in-house breakfast, since there are so many places for a chocolate croissant just steps away! Very close to the RER and Metro stations, and a 3 minute walk from Notre Dame. Also, the lobby always smells just fabulous - a nice homey touch that makes a great first impression. My boyfriend and I have trouble with the half-covered shower, but this is a minor inconvenience. Don't forget to bring your own conditioner for your hair and a washcloth, as these are not provided. Or you can just buy some at the Monoprix a couple blocks away!

This is a nice, adequate hotel, that is best for its value. The hotel, like most others throughout Europe, is small. I booked the hotel online and booked what I thought was a King room, turns it out was a King Double Room, which was French for - just a small room with a double bed... You get what you pay for - no King sized beds or large rooms in this hotel. The hotel is located near Notre Dame, and it an easy walking distance to many of the shops and hotels in the Latin Quarter and St. Germain area. If you are looking for a nice inexpensive place to stay, I would recommend this hotel. If you are looking for top tier amenities and high end hotel, you will need to up your budget and stay somewhere else. Next time I am in Paris I may splurge and spend more on the hotel, however if I were staying in the same budget I would strongly consider staying here again. The front desk staff was extremely helpful to us - they made a few reservations at restaurants for us and booked our airport transportation. I would strongly recommend researching restaurants prior to your trip - there are a lot of really good restaurants in Paris, and a lot of really bad ones too that will quickly take your money for an overpriced meal that taste terrible. The good ones are great and the bad ones are terrible.", "Date": "April 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cVery good value for money\u201d", "Author": "Christoph J Posted by an Easytobook.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR126827243", "Content": "Stayed 3 days in the hotel.

I know the city well and have stayed in many arrondisements and speak the language. Given that experience I am mystified by the good reviews of this hotel. Though the personnel were very nice and the public rooms downstairs are very nice (albeit small, even for a 3 star hotel), the location is, to me, awful. I can see where people visiting PAris for a first time might be excited to step out the front door and see Notre Dame, etc. a brief walk away, the street is very very noisy, swamped with buses and cars and motorcycles and traffic of every sort, and it is loud. Very loud. Also, the Latin Quarter is extremely congested, filled with students and the cheap restaurants that serve them. It is much less attractive than the 6th, which is almost as easy a walk to the Louvre, Notre Dame, Musee d'Orsay, etc. We were lucky and had a very quiet room at the back of the hotel, but it looked onto an air shaft that, while clean, wasn't very interesting. So the choice seems to be horribly noisy rooms with view on the street, or peace and quiet with a view of an air shaft that could be in any city in any country. I think one can do better in the same arrondisement or others. Paris is a delightful city and you can walk to the same monuments from other hotels without the noise. One other important thing -- they charge something like $15-18 per person for breakfast.

The staff at the desk were all very helpful, advising about good restaurants/bistros/brasseries and how to get here or there. They even helped us when there was a strike coming up to get to the train station despite the situation. I have nothing but good things to say about all the staff at the hotel. One even put up with my many questions about French keyboards and how to use them for the free internet. The only drawback was the beds were kind of old and tired and saggy. Some people have said the breakfast was a little pricy and that you could get cheaper in the neighborhood. That is true and we found more than one place to eat breakfast in. But the convenience of in the hotel has something to be said for it and the food there was good. If you want a place for a reasonable expenses in Paris (not cheap), that is centrally located for many activities, near many good places to eat, then this is a great choice. Within walking distance are the Pantheon, the Sorbonne, all the ancient parts of Paris including Notre Dame Cathedral, St Germain de Pres, St Sevran (across the street), the Cluny medieval and ancient roman Paris museum, as well as the Ile de Cite, Ste Chapelle, and the remains of Roman Paris musuem (under the plaza in front of Notre Dame).

Both rooms were nicley furnished, double room had a mini-bar and a bath with shower over, plenty of storage, lovely and clean with crisp white bed linen and good quilts.

I was shown to my room and helped upstairs in the lift with my luggage which was nice for me on my own after a long journey. Location was brilliant, 2 minutes to Notre Dame, similar to Metro stations and the RER to Charles De Gaulle Airport, over the road a maze of cheaper restaurants, I ate there in Moroccan and French restaurants and had amazing food very cheaply, in fact the best tagine I have ever had. There are also more expensive restaurants in the area where we ate too, good French cuisine. The area is very safe for a woman alone, I walked all over at night. I nearly booked a hotel near Sacre Couer but was glad I didn't, we went up there in the daytime and I didnt like that area as much and didn't feel safe.

Before arriving, we had noticed that the hotel was offering special deals. We had written asking for our reservations to be upgraded as the difference in what we had reserved and what they were now offering for the same room was SIGNIFICANT, i.e. 60 euros/night, and we were staying 6 nights. Needless to say, no one answered our email, so, when we arrived, I asked again and was told that there was really nothing that they could do. I asked then if they could at least throw in breakfast every day, at no charge, since it's buffet style. They refused. They were nice, but absolutely zero willingness to work with us. On top of now realizing that we're paying full price for our room, we're given a room on a lower floor (3) on the street side. And, the room is small, small, small...bording on tiny. The bathroom is even smaller...you can barely move around. I won't even go into the fact that the minibar barely works, so if you put something cold in, within hours, it's lukewarm. Also, they clearly do not change the sheets each day. And, no body lotion, just basic soap and shampoo...no conditioner. And, THEY DO NOT CHANGE THE SHEETS DAILY!!!! Be aware. And the staff, really worthless. They're curteous, but will not lift a finger to help you, but they'll small the entire time they're telling you that they're not helping you. As I already said, they wouldn't help with trying either trying to upgrade our room, lower the rate or include breakfast. Then, the next day, when we had asked how the rental bikes in town work, the woman behind the counter said she had no idea and that we should ask at the Tabac! That completely surprised me. This is a hotel with people coming to visit your city, how could you not be informed about something so significant (they're literally every 370 meters) as bike rentals? Especially since they're pushing every kind of propaganda in their lobby for all the expensive tourist items. The last straw was today, when we asked if we could get a wake up call for tomorrow as we needed to leave for the train station early AND THERE IS NO CLOCK (alarm or otherwise) in the room. The guy behind the counter said that he wasn't the one who'd be here for the night shift, so that we should come back later tonight and ask that person! I was like, 'could you maybe leave a note for the person you're changing shifts with?' He reluctantly agreed. But it was really irritating, zero customer service, they're more like a lifeless/brainless body behind a counter, taking keys and giving keys (yes, you cannot take your room keys with you and you only get one). Bottom line, the location is great, but literally everything about the hotel is a huge disappointment. We have both been to Paris many times, and I lived here in the early 80's and come back frequently. French is not a problem for us. We really just wanted to try a different hotel. We're thinking that the hotel is really used to dealing with people who are new to Paris, willing to pay for a lot of unnecessary things, and accept whatever they're told I can think of many other hotels, in this price range ($189 euros/night), that are much, much better.", "Date": "July 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cLocation superb\u201d", "Author": "Honey46", "ReviewID": "UR33831915", "Content": "My daughter and I stayed here during the recent heat wave. so the air con was tested and worked really well!

We travelled by Eurostar into Gare du Nord. Finding the right RER platform was NOT EASY. After reading other Tripadvisor reviews I knew to look for RER-B to St Michel, but the menagerie of maps, signs, letters, and numbers at Gare du Nord is very confusing. We were loaded down with heavy luggage, toddler and buggy, and trying to negotiate steps, escalators, lifts etc was a nightmare. On our return journey the lovely hotel Receptionist booked us a taxi, that turned up 5 mins later, and took 20 mins to get to the station \u2013 for 16 Euros \u2013 much easier and much less stressful! Before leaving the UK, I had scoped out the hotel and local streets using Google Maps \u2018Streetview\u2019, so we knew exactly where to go after leaving St Michel RER station. The streets around here are narrow, cobbled and like a spider\u2019s web, so having some idea of the geography prior to our arrival turned out to be very useful. The hotel is pretty and elegant, a quaint, tall and narrow Parisien building. Reception staff were excellent and spoke very good English. There is free WiFi in all rooms, and a computer in the basement with free internet. Breakfast at 12 Euros each is not too bad value, there are slightly cheaper places nearby. However, contrary to a recent review, the hotel breakfast quality is very good and the choice is probably better than nearby restaurants: yoghurts, cheeses, cooked meats, Kellogg\u2019s cornflakes, tea (good tea too!), coffee, orange juice, toast, hard-boiled eggs, and a basket of fresh baguettes, croissants and pain au chocolat. However, it is true that there are patisseries nearby where you can buy a large fresh croissant for just one Euro. We had room 304, at the back of the hotel, a triple. Due to the lack of a double bed, this room would be no use to honeymooners! The AC worked OK, but then it wasn\u2019t hot during our stay. Our daughter\u2019s cot was squeezed between the window and our beds, making access to the wardrobe/window difficult. The decor I would describe as shabby chic, it was tired in places: ripped carpet, faulty TV remote, and quirky showerhead that liked to move out of the way and spray the walls instead! It was reasonably clean, but not thoroughly clean (hair in plughole, on bathroom floor etc). The bathroom was very small, care needed to be taken when stepping from bath/shower, anyone hung-over, half-asleep, or like me, myopic, could easily find themselves with one foot in the loo! My main concern with this hotel, and as a Mother, was that the fire escape runs through the rooms at the back of the hotel (including ours), and the door leading to it from our room was bolted/locked on both sides. Meaning, if there was a fire, the main staircase is the only route out in a six/seven storey building. There was no smoke detector in our room either (it was out on the landing). We paid nearly 900 Euros for 4 nights and 3 breakfasts, and at current exchange rates, this is the best part of a thousand pounds. For \u00a3200/night in other parts of the world you could probably find 5* luxury, but this is Paris, and the hotel\u2019s location, staff, and general ambience is good, as others have said.

I loved the style of the hotel (shown well on the website), the green/grey/beige colour scheme was kept up throughout and I enjoyed the not-too-modern interpretation of the French style (think wood panelling, striped materials, large glass-topped tables displaying high-class magazines). The double room wasn't huge, but big enough, but the triple really was great. I'd recommend going for the triple even if travelling in a party of 2, as it's worth the additional cost and the room simply feels more spacious. When the 3rd bed isn't in use as such, it is set up as a couch in a niche by the door, a couple of steps up to the main room. We were on the 4th floor, so I can only speak for these rooms, but they had lots of storage space with clever mirrored panelling on the closets to enhance the spacious feeling. There are only 4-5 rooms per floor and the doors close solidly, so we never once noticed any noise from the hallway.

I never got round to asking about it, and it might well have been from the drainage works going on outside, but there was a slightly nasty (sewage?) smell in the public areas. But not in the rooms, so it wasn't really an issue or a reason not to give 5 stars.

There is still some noise leakage if there's someone very loud about in the dead of night, but traffic noise is just about entirely eliminated. The room was really quite a decent size for Paris, where hotels can be very cramped. The bathroom was small but entirely acceptable.

The room was of a good size (for Paris) although if very tall you might have a problem as the room is in the eaves so you lose some head height in part of the room next to the window.

A magnificent hotel, extremely well-located, with a great value mainly if you consider you are in Paris. - Booking - easily made directly from the hotel website. You only need a CC to guarantee your reservation. Hotel staff answering very quick. - Arriving - either by train (in Charles de Gaulle airport take the RER B, direction Robinson or Saint-Remy and get off in Saint Michel-Notre Dame station; it's a 35 minutes journey, EUR 8,50 each, and leaves you a few steps from the hotel) or taxi (about EUR 55; 30 minutes). I recommend the RER. Easy, safe, cheap and fast. - Check-in and Hotel - also easily made. The rooms on higher floors are better because of Saint S\u00e9verin Church great view. Air conditioning was perfect, one of the bests I've ever seen. Minibar with some beverages (from juices to Cokes, all of them EUR 3). Free and fast wireless internet access. Bathroom is nice and the bed, huge and comfortable. Furniture's a little old, but who cares? (at least I didn't) There's also a little closet next to the door. The windows and the walls don't let you hear any sound of other room, even if there's a party over there. We didn't try breakfast in the hotel (EUR 12 each) as there's a LOT of caf\u00e9s and restaurants near. The staff at front desk is very helpful and gives you good tips about the main touristic places. - Location - absolutely perfect. Walking 3 minutes, you're inside Notre Dame. The hotel's almost \"in\" the Quartier Latin with tons of good restaurants, shopping, a great nightlife and tons of tourists walking until late at night. It's short walking distance from the Panth\u00e9on, Luxembourg Gardens and the elegant Blvd. Saint-Germain, with Paris best caf\u00e9s. Also near the Louvre and a little far from Eiffel Tower but, if you don't mind walking near the Seine river about 20 minutes (the views are breathtaking), for sure you would not spend a dime with transports. The location of this hotel is the main thing you have to consider. - Tips - do not lose the opportunity to eat a great Gyros in one of the dozens greek restaurants near the hotel. Try one cr\u00e9pe sucr\u00e9e in Cr\u00e9perie de Cluny. Taste a raclette in Saint-Emilion and some hours with good food and music in Chez Cl\u00e8ment.

It is in a FANTASTIC location (I'm sure you've read its walking distance to everything. It is, but also know that the streets are short and you will be crossing a lot of streets, which does slow you down. Also, the French are leisurely walkers, so if you are used to a New York paced walk, forget about it and relax. This is PARIS!) and the service was great. Fredrique always met us with a charming smile which helped in a city where no one really speaks your language. There were quality umbrellas as you walk out the door, and walking through the city in March at least, you will need a wind-resistant umbrella. It really is the little things. So, ok, the hotel is great. A minor quip: We had room 601, a triple room that overlooked the church. There was a rattling coming from the heater, and on nights when your body is sore and aching and its tough enough to fall asleep as it is, this noise didn't help matters. We alerted the front desk, but it was never taken care of. This could have possibly been because they did not understand our complaint, but regardless, if you get 601, make sure the problem is dealt with. The reviews stating the RER is very close are true. However, after navigating the INSANELY disorganized CDG airport, the last thing you will want is to walk down a steep flight of stairs to the train with heavy luggage (there is an escalator UP but not DOWN?!). When you get to St. Michel, you will have to go up quite a bit of stairs. If you are not in shape, or if your luggage weighs more than, lets say 15 kg, you will not be very happy. If you have young kids or infants, forget about this option completely. Also, if you are taking the RER from CDG, don't be scared when the train doesn't stop at any of the stations. It is an express to the major stops, starting with Gard du Nord. I didn't know this and thought a bunch of awful thoughts, not limited to us ending up in the suburbs (not quite the place i want to be on vacation...). Thankfully, the French are actually extremely sweet when you treat them with respect, and a nice young lady helped us when we were about to freak out over this. On the way to the airport on our last day, we took a shuttle arranged by the hotel. Make sure you have cash for this, and a service fee (2 euros) for the driver. We were short one euro because we didn't know, and I am still embarrassed. Also, if you think the shuttle is a breeze, its not. Driving patterns are insane and at one point, you will be praying. You can quote me on that. Maybe. A few other tips: If you are one thirsty person, Paris is not the place to buy water bottles everyday. It gets pricey very quick. A liter of soda at the cheaper supermarket was about 3 or 4 euro. Also, the tap water makes your pee smell funny. True story. A few places i recommend: Crepes Cluny. Get the Comedie del Arte ice cream sundae with pear sorbet. It is absolutely unbelievable. Also go to Berthillion on Ille St. Louis behind Notre Dame, as has probably been recommended. It might very well be the richest, most amazing ice cream on the planet, and I've had a lot of ice cream My favorite was the white chocolate, but the regular chocolate was superb as well. Falafel in the Latin Quarter has great falafel. Croissants and pastries about ten doors down to your left when you are facing the church are great. Its named something with \"__-& Sofia\" in it. Tell Aziz , the guy who works in the morning,I said hi and that I'm sorry I never called him. I lost his number. I really did. Crepes Nutella at Boulagerie de Papa were the best. Look for the guy with long lashes and a funky colored hairstyle. He's married but nice to look at. If you are a fashion freak like me, you must visit 31, Rue de Cambon, the site of Coco Chanel's first haute couture store. If you love art, don't rush the Louvre and the D'orsay, and don't be cheap. Get the audio tour. Walk the streets at night (its safe and quiet) for the most thrilling views. Most of all, believe all you have heard about Paris.

The hotel room itself (room 103) was clean and well maintained, but was small and basic, with no view external view, small double bed not very comfortable, small TV with only one English speaking channel (CNN), basic toiletries and no tea or coffee making facilities. It was acceptable for our short 3 night stay but we would not have wanted to spend a week there. It certainly was not what I'd expected for a room described as a 'Superior Room'. But main problem we had was with the breakfast fee. We booked via Expedia and the room description stated that price included breakfast at 10 euros per person. However when we checked out the receptionist told us that breakfast wasn't included. She was adamant that the hotel never advertised rates including breakfast and also adamant that the hotel had never provided breakfast for 10 euros (breakfasts are currently shown in the hotel as 12 euros pp). When we produced a copy of our booking confirmation she then accepted that the price quoted was 10 euros but still refused to accept that breakfast was included in our rate despite this being clearly stated on the confirmation. We were handed over to speak to a hotel director by phone, who also refused to accept that our breakfast was included despite being faxed a copy of the confirmation. He was insistent that the statement \u2018including breakfast at 10 euros per person\u2019 actually meant that breakfast was excluded. He became quite rude, accused me of trying to blackmail him, and said that he would sue me if I left a negative review about the hotel. We were given no option but to pay the breakfast charge, despite protesting that the hotel had never informed us about it either at check in or at the breakfast itself. The breakfast waitress had also never asked us our room number as is normally the custom when being charged. The breakfast itself was very basic: tea or coffee, 1 roll pp, 1 croissant pp, orange juice, corn flakes, yoghurt. Perfectly adequate for an inclusive breakfast but certainly not worth anything like 10 euros, especially with so many cheap cafes and restaurants just yards from the hotel. (Many of the restaurants offer 3 course dinners for 10 euros or less!) It\u2019s interesting to see that the room descriptions on Expedia have now been changed to say \u2018excluding breakfast\u2019. So I\u2019m guessing that our room description may have been a genuine mistake rather than deliberate deception, but it was extremely poor customer service not to honour the confirmed rate.

After reading other reviews, we decided to book a triple room instead of a double because we wanted to have the largest room possible. We requested the highest floor possible, and we received just that! We were in room #601. It had an absolutely gorgeous view of St. Severin, and we could see the Eiffel tower in the distance. The room was very spacious and clean. The bathroom had double sinks, towel warmers, and all of the hot water you could ever need. We had two twin beds pushed together, and one twin bed off on its own. We only wish we got one of the rooms with an actual double bed! The hotel staff was very friendly and spoke great English. Our room was always made up when we returned from sight-seeing in the late afternoon and before we went back out to dinner. There was not an alarm clock in the room. The TV has a digital clock, but unless you want to ask for a wake-up call every morning, I would suggest bringing a travel alarm clock. Luckily, we picked one up in the airport on our way to Paris. Our only complaint was the noise (sirens and bar hoppers at 4:00am), but we expected this when we booked a hotel on the edge of the Latin Quarter. You could ask for a quieter room on the back of the hotel, but you would miss out on the view! The pros of this hotel, however, certainly outweighed the cons! We walked to almost everything, and when we chose to take the metro, we were near the St. Michel and the Cite metro. We did not have breakfast at the hotel. We either ate breakfast at the museum cafes or at a cafe. I highly reccomend Laduree (we went to the one on the Champs Elysees but they have other locations) for a delicious breakfast of macarons, pastries, and even bacon and eggs. If you wake up late enough you can even get cinnamon, sugar, and butter crepes just steps from the hotel. We loved Creperie Cluny (one street up from St. Severin, deep in the tight streets of the Latin Quarter). I highly reccomend branching out for all of your meals, but if you want a delicious bowl of French Onion soup and a glass of wine, Le Petit Pont is about ten doors down from the hotel, on your way to or from Notre Dame. Also don't miss all that the nearby Ile St. Louis and Ile de Cite have to offer. Amazing ice cream at Berthillon, wine and cheese shops, and wonderful places to eat and shop for gifts (L'Epiecerie is fabulous- it has over 70 types of preserves and countless types of mustards).

We did not have breakfast at the hotel as there are plenty of patisseries nearby. This hotel was very clean, nicely decorated and had lots of original features - I particularly liked the lobby area. There was a fridge in our room, but no tea/coffee making facilities, which would have been useful. Our room was warm, spacious and the bed was very comfortable.

Firstly on arrival, we were greeted at reception with the key to our room, nothing more - nothing about the nearest metro, surrounding area, etc. Not fantastic, but not a deal breaker. The room was clean and well appointed, with a good location, but it was very small. But the icing on the cake was when the client in the room above us started a fire on their balcony by extinguishing a cigarette in a plant tub while drunk. We were rung just before 9am, with the front desk telling me (in french) to please be careful when extinguishing our cigarettes. I assured them that we do not smoke. She assured me that someone in our room must smoke because a burning plant had just fallen from our balcony onto the head of a passer by on the sidewalk. I again assured her that I was still in bed, and my boyfriend was in the shower, it was not us. She insisted that despite my denials it was definitely our hotel room, they could tell by looking up at the balcony. I had to put the phone down when I heard loud rapping on the door (which had a do not disturb sign on it). I found the house keeper there, who demanded to be let into the room. He ran past me to the balcony, only to find all our plants in tact. He leant over the balcony, realised it was the floor below, swore, and ran out of the room again. Funny story, unless you were the ones accused of lying When going to the lobby shortly afterwards, we expected at least an apology; instead we were thanked for our assistance in this matter. My parents, who were staying in Paris with family friends at the time, and were appalled at this story, and their hosts wanted to confront the hotel. I imagine most clients when confronted with such bad service would have shouted the house down. But we decided a suitable review on tripadvisor would do the job.

My only complaint is about the exhorbitant rates for wireless Internet - 45 euro for three days access! The hotel has a communal computer downstairs, but you have to pay for access in 15-minute increments.

I would post candid photos that I took of the hotel and room but it would be redundant, seeing that the same photos have already been posted by others. Anyway, on with the hotel... This very small and quaint hotel offers a lot of value. There are only 24 rooms in the entire hotel, so I was leery that the customer service would suffer when compared with the larger hotels. Not the case at all. The attendant at the front desk was very helpful with planning tours, dinner reservations and shuttles to and from the airport. They even managed to get us into a fantastic restaurant for our anniversary dinner (Le Compe Chou, highlt recommended). The public areas of the hotel are very nice and comfortable, and the elevator is of excellent size and in good working order. I followed the recommendation of the site and requested room 401 and was lucky enough to be rewarded with it! The room is small, probably smaller than 120 sq feet, but there are great details such as built in closets on either side of the bed, a towel warmer, and in the case of room 401, a small terrace where you can walk out on if you so desire. I will make the note and say that: DO NOT ASK FOR, OR FIGHT TO GET OUT OF ANY ROOM THAT ENDS IN 03. On the fire escape map they seemed to be smaller than our room and looked out on a courtyard. The rooms along the front of the hotel are much nicer. The location of the hotel was also stellar. In the middle of the Latin Quarter, a winding narrow labryinth of narrow streets, you will find endless dining opportunities, as well as bars and clubs. The hotel is also a brief 2 block walk to Notre Dame, and another 5 blocks from Le Pompedieu. Then you have the Metro station that is a block away and you have all of Paris at your fingertips. Some other things to comment about the hotel: * It seems as though all of the rooms can be smoking rooms, and while our room didnt reek of the odor, it was present in small doses, so be forewarned. *If you have a problem in small places or are travelling with more than 2 people, only consider the triple, there is no floor space for a 3rd person in any of the other rooms. *The building two doors down from the hotel seems to be undergoing some kind of reservation, so if you are a light sleeper you might have trouble. One morning the jackhammers started at 0830, but other than that, there wasnt really anything to note, and I am a light sleeper myself CONCLUSION: If you are looking for a nicely finished hotel in a great location for an out of this world price, look no further than the Henri IV Rive Gauche.

A small friendly hotel without all the pretentiousness of some of the larger chains. We stayed in Rm 502 which had fantastic views of St Severin church. Previous reviewers have talked about the view of the church. From this room the view really is fantastic - the church is only metres away! The rooms themselves are very small. We had two large suitcases and struggled to not to have them in the way. That said you are in Paris and in truth should be out and about and not in your hotel room all day! The rooms were very clean, and the bathroom was small, clean but perfectly formed. The breakfast at the hotel is 11 euros but we felt worth it. There is not really a selection. Its simply cornflakes, bread, croissants, toast, fruit and coffee and orange juice. That said what you do get is good and some of the restaurants close by are significantly more expensive. The room has a minibar which is stocked. The drinks are usual mini bar prices. The location of the hotel is great. You are however very close to a quite trashy area, full of late night bars and tourist shops. That said we never had any impact from this either in noise or the usual tourist trail of beer cans etc the next morning. I would definately book to stay at the hotel again. The location is fantastic and the cleanliness of the rooms and public areas is spot on. In a perfect world the rooms would be bigger. This is however a minor criticism and would not stop me re-booking. You also get a free safe in the room which is handy. Tip - Try to get a 01 or 02 room preferably with a higher floor.

It is a key attached to a door knob like thing with the hotel's address engraved on the side in case it gets lost.

The Louve and Jardin de Tuleries are 15 minutes away if you are walking. The Champs Elysee and Arc de Triomphe are about 30-40 minutes away if you are walking. Nathalie had told us to take the RER to the Arc and Champs, but I was a little hesitant so we ended up walking. The Eiffel Tower is 40-45 minutes away. I think the best way to see Paris is on foot. The only time we took a taxi was when we got a little lost at Printemps on Blvd. Haussman. By then it was the end of our trip and I was tired of walking.

Many previous reviews mentioned how nice both Rose and Natalie were, and they were right. Rose speaks perfect English and Natalie's isn't bad either. Our room was on the 4th floor and I'm happy to say that the elevator was working. A very nice bellman accompanied us to our room and showed us how everything worked. I was pleased to see a minibar in our room because I don't remember reading about that in any of the other reviews. Also, just like everyone before me said, the bathroom is very modern and the whole room was immaculate (old world style but modern at the same time). My favorite part was the windows that opened to the balcony overlooking the Rue St. Jacques. Yes, it was a little noisy with the windows opened, but I didn't care because it felt like the ultimate Paris experience. From our balcony we could see St. Severin directly across the street (this church is the setting for one of the scenes in The Da Vinci Code) as well as up and down the busy street. There are many wonderful shops and restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. Right next store is a creperie which had great crepes and sandwiches. Across the street and down a bit is a tiny little alleyway leading to about 20 restaurants of all different ethnicities (Greek, Italian, Mexican, Middle Eastern, etc). There's something for everyone. Notre Dame is just around the corner. Also around the corner is a cafe called Cafe Panis where we had wine and cheese at a table near the window where we watched the people walk by. It was a great experience. We did have breakfast in the hotel and it is pricy at 8 Euros, but it was convenient and tasty (rolls, croissants, fruit, cereal and delicious coffee with warm milk). Another thing we did was take the Paris Seinorama tour with Cityrama and I wasn't impressed by it. It was a 1 hour bus tour and 1 hour boat tour (the boat tour was boring and the boat itself was old, crowded and uncomfortable). The bus part of the tour was good as it took you to all of the highlights (Eiffel Tower, Champs Elysee, Arc de Triomphe, The Louvre, etc). I also want to mention that we had expected the French to be snobby and unfriendly to us because we're Americans and know very little French, but we found this to be completely untrue. 90% of the people we met in the shops, restaurants and on the tour were delightful.

The nearby surroundings were adorable. - For Paris, this place was unbelievably inexpensive for what we got. For those of you who are typically luxe travelers (and we're usually in that camp), this place: - is generically decorated; if it weren't for the view of St. Severin, we could've been anywhere - the room was small, but not as small as I thought it would be after reading about it on Tripadvisor. We had two overhead-bin size rolling bags and we were comfortable in the room. If we had two gargantuan suitcases, we would have felt cramped. - has no lobby of any merit. - has no concierge services that I would use; I didn't ask the front desk to make restaurant reservations; I did that. - doesn't have bathrobes, fancy soaps, or any of that. (But it did have soap, shampoo, etc, that seemed to get me clean just fine.) - was too American for my taste (this might be a plus for some of you, a minus for others).

You're literally steps to the metro, five minutes walk from Notre Dame, ten minutes from l'Hotel de Ville. We stayed on the sixth floor, with the great views of St. Severin and the Eiffel Tower. (I'll attach the view from the room.) The staff was quite helpful in booking taxis and recommending non-touristy places to eat. A special thanks to Rose who was so friendly that our two-year-old would ask to go down and see her. We look forward to retuning.

The hotel is quite new and very tastefully decorated. No outside noise, and the continental breakfast was lovely, served in a relaxed environment complete with a variety of newspapers. We walked everywhere, including Mum who is 63 years old- so nothing is too far away... except Sacre Coer of course! We found a lovely cafe and supermarket across the road, bottle shop around the corner and a variety of restaurants. We missed out on the jazz bars, but ask reception and they will point you in the right direction. My only advice, if you are thinking of seeing Moulin Rouge??? is to go independently, not on a bus tour- as we 'thought' we were booked for the 9pm show, but were taken on a merry ride to look at city lights, then a boat up and down the river, before lining up for an hour for the 11pm show!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

However it was very nice, clean, great staff very friendly especially Rose at the front desk, great English and very helpful. Hot pot of coffee delivered to my room in the morning, 3 euros was great. The location was very good from a sight seeing perspective close to many of the attractions and very good shopping behind Notra Dame. The area right around the hotel was packed with inexpensive restaurants and shops that all sold the same trinkets, not a fan of that kind of environment but it was fun to people watch. There was a killer restaurant at the end of the block across the street from Notra Dame that had live music at night. One night they had a little Jazz trio and the other nights they had a great piano player. Relax listen to a little music with a nice bottle of wine. I stayed in room 303 with my 80 year old father we had two small beds in a very small room with no view, which was fine because it eliminated any street noise and we really only were there to sleep.

We were extremely pleased with our decision. Rooms were spotless, tastefully decorated, and, while not large, were more than adequate for 2 adults plus luggage. The mini bar fridge was handy for a small amount of cheap snacks and drinks purchased at a local supermarket. We stayed in #602 for 7 nights, went to Normandy for a few days, then checked in to #502 for last 4 nights. Location could not be more central; you are in the heart of the city. This has its positives (convenience, can walk everywhere, stone's throw to major sites like Notre Dame, Louvre, etc) however, the downside is that the area is extremely touristy. As we were there mid-autumn, it was not too bad, although there were still plenty of tour groups to contend with in the immediate vicinty. Proximity to the metro is excellent, and on future trips to Paris I will use it more often as it is cheap, clean, safe, convenient and gets you where you want to go fast. However this being our first time in Paris, we walked EVERYWHERE on the left bank, and much of the right bank, and it was well worth the tired feet (bring excellent shoes, ie: Clark's are great). This is the best way to see the city's beautiful sites, amazing architecture, and to get a real sense of the people and the culture. We made sure to visit all the big attractions but spent at least as much time OFF the beaten path, in order to fully appreciate the city. The hotel staff were great; very friendly, spoke excellent English and were not at all patronizing when we practiced our limited French on them. They were very accommodating when we asked to store 2 suitcases and some packages when we departed for Normandy for a few days, rather than drag all our stuff with us on the train and from hotel to hotel. Our belongings were intact when we returned for the remainder of our stay, including a baggie of approx. $150 Canadian in Euro coins (in an unlocked front pouch) that I had forgotten to take along. One day we returned to the hotel with takeout, and seated ourselves in the breakfast area where some of the staff were having their lunch break. One of the housekeeping attendants jumped right up from eating her lunch to come over and offer us something to drink. This kind of attentiveness and courtesy was consistently displayed throughout our stay. I cannot comment on the hotel breakfast, as each morning we would enjoy our breakfast of take-out cafe au lait and pain au chocolate seated on a park bench at Luxembourg Gardens. So my only unenthusiatic comment might be the cost of the breakfast which seemed high, however in all fairness, may have been well worth it. Overall an excellent stay in a beautiful city. My only hesitation in returning to this hotel would be my desire to check out other spots in different neighbourhoods, however I have absolutely no complaints and only fond memories of the Henri IV Rive Gauche.", "Date": "December 20, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Clearwater, FL", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay - amazing location!\u201d", "Author": "vlmail2", "ReviewID": "UR4221827", "Content": "My mother and I stayed at the Hotel Henri IV RIve Gauche Nov. 24-28 and enjoyed it very much.

The two beds were pushed together, but we were able to pull them apart a few inches to pull out sheets and comforters. The room was quite spacious, even compared to my experiences with hotels in the US. The bathroom was adequate in size and cute in a funny way. (Yes, the sink really looks just like the picture on their website!) As someone else posted, the shower door is kind of strange - only spans halfway across the length of the tub. The trick to not flooding the room is keep the shower head low and pointed away from the shower door. There was a mini-bar with extra space for a few bottles and some cheese/snacks. Everything was very clean and quiet - I wondered if we were the only guests until I saw some others at breakfast one day! We didn't really need assistance from the front desk, beyond ordering a taxi for our departure, but each person there was very pleasant. We did have breakfast at the hotel most mornings; expensive, yes, but worth every penny to not go out in the cold to search for morning coffee! Finally, location, location, location. Several metro stops within a couple blocks, Notre Dame and the Seine two blocks north, shops, quick eats and restaurants for blocks surrounding the hotel - c'est parfait!
