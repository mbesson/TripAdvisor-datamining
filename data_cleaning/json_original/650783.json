No kettle in the room, the only way to boil water is to use the single cup coffee machine, although they provide a microwave oven, you need to have your own microvable containers. I got a room on the 2nd floor, window facing an airconditoner compressor, you can hear the humming noise, but when the airconditioner in the room is so much louder, you won't mind the compressor noise. I had to switch off the aircon in order to sleep. The pillows are super thin, uncomfortable to sleep with. The hairdryer is not user-friendly, I had to hold it in one hand, and press a blue button on the wall to turn it on, once i let go of the button, the dryer was off. So I couldn't comb and blow dry my hair at the same time cos both hands were occupied. Room is very clean though, no dark spots on carpet or sofa. Toilet and bathtub is clean too.

It's a good 5 miles south of the center Strip area; you aren't going to walk it and cab fares will really add up. That said, it's a great place to stay if you're not bound for luxury. Nothing about the place screams luxury, but so much screams value. Start with a good size room, a nicely sized flat screen mounted on the wall with way more channels than you're used to in a hotel, free wifi that just plain works, plenty of counter space in the bathroom, and a small fridge and microwave in the room. The staff at check in is friendly and easily answered questions. They always smile when you come in. And get this: a complimentary breakfast buffet. Not just a few stale pastries and coffee. Scrambled eggs (shaped into small pancakes), pancakes, home fries, biscuits and gravy, waffle dough and a waffle iron, oatmeal, toast and bagels, cold cereals and milk, muffins, coffee, tea, iced tea, cranberry juice, and apple juice. I forget, but there may be a bit of fresh fruit. You can start your day hearty, you can start your day healthy, but it's a fabulous way to start your day. And did I mention it's free? Although close to the airport (just south of it, the location gets very little airport noise. It's within walking distance (right across the street) from an outlet mall. And it's easy to get to from the freeway. There's a small indoor pool and a teensy workout room. The workout room reminds me of those I've seen in condo complexes, basically a small closet, albeit window-lined, crammed with a stairmaster, a stationary bike, and an elliptical machine, just so they can say they have a workout room. About the only drawback to the property is that there's no store for amenities and necessities. I found this when I was looking for a bargain place to stay over the first weekend of March Madness, when rooms at the Imperial Palace, the bargain basement of the Harrah's empire, even with the Total Rewards discount, were going for a New Year's Eve-like $100+ per night. For 4 nights here (Thursday through Sunday), I paid a total of $200. No dishonest \"resort\" fees either; what you are offered is what you pay. It's not a big place, just 3 stories and a couple of different wings. My room was at the end of the hall, and on the top floor, so I heard very little through walls and doors. The cabinetry in the rooms isn't of the highest quality, and the narrow desk in the room was right under the TV, but these are minor quibbles. I saw all sort of travelers here, from spring breakers to single travelers to families. It's a freind;y and accommodating place. Unlike just about every hotel, bar, restaurant, convenience store, grocery store, etc., this hotel has zero gambling machines. So the clientele comes here for the hotel amenities alone. Like the Clarion around the corner from Encore, this turns out to be another hidden Vegas gem. I'm not sure it reaches the \"4 star\" level in terms of typical hotel ratings, but it definitely deserves it for what it does offer at the \"star\" level it places itself in. I mean, if you were to look on Priceline of Hotwire or Expedia or Kayak or other hotel and consolidator sites, it'd likely be considered to be somewhere around 2, 2.5, or maybe 3 stars. Which according to their rating system would be about right. But in that range, this hotel shines.

And this place is not too far from the strip. If you rent a car, it's only at most 10 minutes with traffic if that. But if you're travelling by bus or taxi, do some research. But we STRONGLY recommend you don't use a taxi because they cost wayyyy too much! Costed us $20 to ride from airport to this hotel which is only 2-3 miles away! You spend far less money traveling by bus, but it will take you longer to get there. Either way, put on some comfortable shoes because you will do some walking on the strip. Also when it gets late, the bus doesn't go to a stop near this hotel. There are two stops near this hotel, both by different buses. My wife and I had to walk late one night about 3-4 miles on the streets because no one told us this. Which brings me to the only thing we didn't like about the hotel. The front desk clerk didn't know anything about the buses. Not where the bus stops were, when they came, cost, nothing! She was very friendly, but not very informative. We went to the nearby outlet mall and got more information from the information clerk there than the hotel clerk. You probably can pick up a bus schedule there too.

Despite an assurance this would be taken care of, it was not. A minor issue, as we were told that the room would not be let out during our stay (Vegas in the off season I guess). The free buffet breakfasts were superb, with a variety of both savoury and sweet. The make-your-own waffles were the highlight. The only problem was that the dining area was a little cramped, so we usually took ours to our room. Anyone who has stayed in the massive Strip hotels will appreciate that from our room to our car was thirty seconds walk. I never imagined this would be an issue, but it was.
