The room is approx 100+ sqft with attached one bath room. You will experienced the HK's style home with the tiny room. Wifi is working good in our room. Location is near to MTR station. The hotel is located next to recycle garbage (not smelly at all) & coffin shop (even I am a chinese but it wont bother us much because the shop is not open early morning and it closed very early, too) It has a lot of nice restaurant around that area such as (eg: Four Season Claypot rice). Our room is come with breakfast and i can say this is the BEST breakfast that I ever had (Even compare to 5 stars hotel). I bet you would say how come? The reason it is the best because they served their best and delicious breakfast. Although is very limited selection but all the food are delicious. I suggest you eat in rather than go out spent HKD 25 for tasteless spagetti or omelette sandwich breakfast set. Their hashbrown is even better than McDonald. The dim sum is simple but delicious taste. The coffee is good and environment is cozy. I would definitely return to this hotel if it still offer reasonable price.", "Date": "February 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cVery small room\u201d", "Author": "seanfood88", "ReviewID": "UR122201153", "Content": "Okay for a night stay.

Initially We placed the reservation for a deluxe room, ended up the room was so small so myself and my husband decided to top up additional $ (never trust the picture) to stay at the higher floor which is 27th storey. Guess what, when i opened the mini bar to put the complimentary mineral water bottles in it. We found cockroaches crawling out from the mini bar (so many of it), oh my god, due to the fact the hotel is less than a year. So We decided to call the front office to request for changed of room. Somehow they did assigned another room to us at level 26, guess what again, the TV not working , the front office personnel explained that due to the Satellite problem thus must wait for further instruction. For so many days no TV channels to watch. My advice to all, couple that wish to choose this hotel, better re consider the choice as, first issue, it is next to a coffin shop selling coffin (We did not realised until we physically there). Cockroaches breeding in the room and no TV channels to watch. Given the credit of the interior room design look so hip, provided you pay for the higher premium cateogory. Never consider this hotel unless the hotel managment really put in effort to look into the root of the matter.", "Date": "October 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paranaque, Philippines", "Title": "\u201cLocation Perfection\u201d", "Author": "Monica S", "ReviewID": "UR116948333", "Content": "It's a Convenience dream come true-- just cross the street and you can can either take the subway to the MTR or hop on buses along Nathan Road. It's neighborhood, Yau Ma Tei, is also worth exploring! Shops vary from hardware to kitchen/homeware to fruits and vegetables to pornography materials. Food finds in the area are wonderfully delicious and cheap too! Parks, bars and casinos can also be found within the vicinity. Don't be bothered by the hotel's coffin shop and garbage junk shop. They make interesting photographs and tales. The hotel itself is elegant in a simplistic manner. It's very modern earthy chic. The soft rugs in their rooms are a nice comfortable touch. It makes the tiny space of the rooms seem more cozy instead of irritatingly tight. Bathroom design is interesting-- be prepared for glass, mirrors and a tad bit of exposure. Their pillows could use a bit more stuffing perhaps as they were too flat and uncomfortable. Oh and there weren't a lot of English channels on cable. Staff was friendly, except for that male receptionist who was playing Warcraft on his laptop during his shift. He barely offered an attempt to satisfy my inquiry, let alone help me understand between his mumbling tone and accent. Highly recommended and will definitely be back next time!", "Date": "August 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cOnly good as a budget hotel\u201d", "Author": "Indulci", "ReviewID": "UR115405414", "Content": "The hotel had it's grand opening during my stay. So this explains why during the stay there was a strong turpentine scent in the hotel. Service staff: No complaints about the staff. They were very competent and polite. Rooms: We booked the standard rm and it's really tiny. I'm 1.55m and the bed just fits me. So I have no idea how bigger built guest will be able to have a good nice sleep. And you really pay for what you get. The room is so tiny, you have to utilise the window seat as a luggage stand else there will be no walking space. Even though the hotel claims to be a 100% non-smoking accommodation, we are welcome by a smoky room every single night. Cleanliness: Decent, but depending on the rm you stay in the bedrm may have a strong sewage smell. Security: Bad. I went back to my room when the housekeeping staff were cleaning up. I manage to walk into my rm without even flashing my rm card. The housekeeper just let me walked in and took stuffs without even checking my rm card! Goodness what if I was a thief?! Location: Easy to locate. BUT it's beside a fresh meat wholesaler, garbage re-cycle centre and the grand finale- a coffin shop. If you don't mind walking pass these shops with all the filthy water infront of the hotel then you won't mind the location of the hotel. Overall I would not go back to M hotel as the space is ridiculously small even for HK standard. I would much prefer Cityview or Nathan hotel even with the price difference.", "Date": "July 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia", "Title": "\u201cNew Hotel, close to to MRT\u201d", "Author": "WingsHeong", "ReviewID": "UR114889823", "Content": "Styaing there on 02/Mar to 04/March with family and group of friends...

I stayed in alot of budget or boutique hotel before but M-Hotel is probably the smallest. Do not trust the photos on the web as what is shown is a deluxe room. My twin standard room basically consist of an 8sqm space. With the wall and bathroom glass sticking at the edge of the bed. Between the 2 single bed, there's only about 50cm space. But as I'm always out shopping, space is not my main concern. But as a whole I'm happy to choose M-hotel for my trip.The hotel has everything u need, safety box, hair dryer, bedroom slippers except iron and wardrobe. But the design is great and modern with a 42' LCD TV and it's HD!! Super sharp!! The best part definitely is the LOCATION! 2min walk to MTR, 5 mins to end of Temple street, 8mins walk to Ladies Street with lotsa good eateries around the hotel. just right next to Nathan rd.

Satisfied with the overall services (e.g. free WiFi, friendly check-in staff, room is small as expected, standard breakfast) except for the hard mattress which is more suitable to the elder folks.

Air conditioning the first night so noisy that I could not sleep and had to turn it off. Result: Woke up with a headache next morning. Then the misssed morning call which almost made me miss an appointment. Pillows are not comfortable. Then there are only English TV channels, no news channel at all. At night, you hear the ringing of the elevators since it rings every time it moves... Free WIFI is nice, but only if it works.
