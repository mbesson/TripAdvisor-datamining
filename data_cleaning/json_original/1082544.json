Treatments: The treatments and yoga/meditation are outstanding. Each guest receives personal attention and gets customized treatment/yoga regimens. The staff and head doctor are skilled, conscientious, and really take an interest in your progress.Location: The area surrounding Zen Resort has not yet been reached by tourists. It is almost hard to believe it's on the same island as Kuta. The people in the area are incredibly friendly, and the natural surroundings are beautiful. Premises: The rooms are clean, colorful, comfortable, and cheerful. The open-air showers are a wonderful way to start the day. The infinity pool is outstanding with beautiful views. The gardens are gorgeous. Staff: The staff is attentive, accommodating, and warm. You really get the sense that they care about your happiness and your progress. I can't say enough how wonderful everyone was. Dr. Shah (the owner) also happened to be staying at the resort at the same time I was there, and he is just as attentive and concerned with your well-being as the staff. Other: The field trips offer another bonus that sets Zen Resort apart. During my two weeks at the resort I went dolphin-watching, trekking through rice fields, and snorkeling, and also visited a temple and a hot spring. Through these trips, you get a sense of Balinese life that you would otherwise miss by sticking to the spa grounds. All of the trips were wonderful and highly recommended.", "Date": "Nov 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR874449478", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "benbilla"}, {"Content": "little piece of paradise MK, Wien, AustriaArriving at the Zen wellness resort was like arriving in paradise. After the long journey, the hassle at Dempasar airport, we were collected by car and driven three hours with a cheerful and very caring young man through villages and small towns, catching our first glimpses of the many temples and abundant flowers and rice fields which this island has to offer. As the car turns off the main road into the resort one is immediately impressed with the beauty and exquisite design of the buildings and gardens. Warm smiles, and a cool drink was awaiting us at the reception and, as our luggage was taken to our room, we followed a flower strewn walk to the front of the chalet. One can read books and see films but still not be prepared for the fragrences, the beauty, the delicateness that one can experience here. We walked first into a large open air bathroom, with shower and a huge sunken bath. From the bedroom, which was beautifully decorated with flowers, we walked out onto the terrace complete with chaise longue, cushions, candles and a small waterfall. Everywhere there was the feeling of light, of spaciousness. And the jungle was only meters away. In the following days we were to have visits from the brightly colored butterflies, almost the size of sparrows.One of our main wishes was to see as much of the island as possible. Each evening, the owner, Dr Shah, would discuss with us what to visit and the next morning after breakfast, a car with driver would be waiting for us. As everyone knows, what better way to go sightseeing than with a local. So we visited temples, (including a famous cat temple), holy baths, rice fields, coffee farms, artist\u9225\u6a9a villages, crocodile farms, monkey forests, saw mountains, lakes, forests\u9225?no place was too far, or too inconvenient for our driver. We would arrive back at the resort comfortably tired, full of joy and very satisfied. All the meals we had in the resort were freshly cooked. We were always asked first what we would prefer and it was heaven to eat outside, breakfast or dinner, in the calm and peacefulness of that wonderful garden. One evening there was more excitement then usual, one of the guests had birthday, and the staff prepared special desserts and performed a typical Balinese floor show. This was totally impromptu and was appreciated by all the guests. We had the feeling that all the staff at the resort loved their work and really enjoyed making the guests happy.One can hardly stay at a wellness resort without having a massage, but I had some pain, was hesitant, and had to be persuaded. No need to fear, the ayurvedic doctor paid special attention, usually with hot oil, on the problem spot. The ayurveda massage was invigorating, just out-of-this-world. I was back for further treatment It has a lot to do with the tranquility, the peace one feels within this resort, knowing also that the people around you were caring.

I went to Bali on a Yoga Teacher Training course, my main aim of the trip.I thought the Zen Resort looked gorgeous on its website, but when we arrived, I was blown away with the natural beauty of the site, the perfect warmth of the staff who welcomed us with garlands of marigolds, and lofty, spaciousness of my individual guest villa overlooking the sea. Dr Mahendra Shah, owner of the Zen Resort took it upon himself personally to ensure all his guests were well catered for...and I was fortunate enough to spend some time talking to him about this piece of sustainable paradise he's developed, which includes an idyllic infinity pool, an incredibly peaceful meditation deck overlooking the treetops and sea, an amazing yoga hall, and the most blissful Ayervedic Spa centre I've ever experienced. The 'house' treatment I had there, was a full body massage with two Indonesian women therapists whose synchronisation and skill were phenomenal.My favourite moment of the day was early evening after supper, which we took outside by the pool, relaxing on the bamboo armchair on my private verandah with a book on Yoga philosophy, breathing in the fragrant night air. I'll definitely go back.

The first time was last year in january. It was the most peaceful, rejuvenating and luxurious stay. The owner, Mr Shah and his wonderful staff, took special care of each one of his guests. The infinity pool is wonderful and a great way to relax and unwind from jet lagg. The ayurveda spa is outstanding, with each therapist individually trained by an ayurvedic doctor from Kerala. I have had some of the best massages during my stay there. Each treatment is individually tailord to each guest.Food is divine and cooked with fresh ingredients from either the local market or the spice garden in the resort. Cooking classes are also organised for guests so that you learn the local cuisine.Some wonderful treks can be organised with very knowledgable local guides. As well as boat trips to see dolphins in the morning. During a walk on the beach, which is a 10 min walk from the resort, the area is so preserved and isolated that I actually saw a dolphin swimming by the shores.Overall, this is truly a wonderful place. The staff and the owner are kind, caring and devoted to the well being of their guests. Peace, quiet, relaxation, rejuvenation and general well being were the key features of my stay. I enjoyed it so much the first time that I came back this year again and look forward to my next visit very soon.

It is only small - 15 villas - but beautifully peaceful and calm, and a great price (I paid only 60 Euros a night). I understand the resort has been open for 8 years, but in many ways it looks more recent and also like it's been there for ever. The gardens are magnificent, and the view out over the ocean is fabulous. It is right next to Lovina - and a far quieter and more peaceful option. I stayed here as I was going to a conference in Lovina, and was very glad I was here, as the hotel the conference was at was far noisier and had no views over the ocean. This resort was incredibly beautiful and peaceful. My villa had an outdoor bath and an outdoor shower which was lovely. The bed was really comfortable. There was no phone, no tv and no hairdryer - but in many ways this was nice. I had a number of ayurvedic massages whilst I was here which were well priced and fantastic. The food was also great - although I didn't eat here that often due to the conference. The pool was a fabulous infinity edged pool - which I love - as you can sit on the edge and look down over the ocean. There are dolphins just off the coast which you can catch a glimpse of if you are lucky. I would definitely return here - it was great value for money, and a wonderful place to stay.", "Date": "Jun 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR742981142", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "KTee:P"}, {"Content": "Das Zen Resort, ein paradiesischer Ort zum Entspannen       Reisfeld am Weg vom Flughafen zum Norden Balis", "Date": "Oct 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR412364213", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Marti1511"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g469403-d1082544-r22712688-Zen_Resort_Bali-Lovina_Bali.html", "HotelID": "1082544", "Price": "$129"}}
