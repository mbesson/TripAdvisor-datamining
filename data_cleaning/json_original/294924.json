The lobby was undergoing renovations and looked like it was mess. The room we initially checked into was on the first floor had a tiny window that allowed no light into the room. We requested another room and were moved to the fourth floor with slightly bigger window. The rooms were old and worn as were the furnishings in the rooms. Missing light bulbs from fixtures, mini-fridge not well stocked and out of place. The bathrooms were a bit grimy and our sink had major blockage issues. Breakfast buffet was ok - not much of a selection and the same thing is served everyday. The staff were friendly and nice and were happy to help when requested.

My son and I visited for 9 days in March and just returned from Istanbul. Hotel is in a superbly convenient location, safe for visiting all the major sites such as The Blue Mosque, bear in mind that the call to prayer which is quite loud occurs 5 times a day but after a couple of days you get used to it. The Lobby service staff to name some of the standouts: the Manager, Ozan Eris, and the owner along with Cem and Onur were simply splendid, delightful and most accommodating to requests. It is quite a reputable place. The rooms although on the smaller side are perfectly adequate and quite clean and some have views of the Blue Mosque and views of the Sea, beds were comfortable and bathroom although small was modern with a shower. Breakfast which was included was an excellent spread of fresh local flavor and is served on 5th floor with beautiful views, an elevator services the first four floors. Wi-fi also included and reliable Hagia Sophia, Topkapi Palace, Bosphorus Cruise, the Grand Bazar, Spice Bazar, The Cistern, restaurants etc. all within 2 to 15 minutes of the hotel. All of the aforementioned can be accomplished within 3 days and are a must see. Local Tram is also near hotel and quite impressive; we experienced it by hopping to different neighborhoods. Street vendors offering roasted corn on the cob and roasted chestnuts are quite good. Also the vendors with local baked good \"simit\" are also very good. Other than an abundance of Istanbul cats on the streets and much haggling going on, this is a must visit. We also flew down to Izmir and visited nearby Efes (Ephesus) which is quite worth the time and small expense. . Should we return to Istanbul a second time, we would most assuredly and without hesitation return to Hotel Spectra.", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cSome good, some bad\u201d", "Author": "JF81", "ReviewID": "UR122819095", "Content": "The Hotel Spectra has some positive and some negative aspects. I'll start with the positive: if you want to be in Old Sultanahmet then the location is superb. You are certainly close to the Blue Mosque. The proximity to the sites of Old Sultanahmet is the primary reason I stayed here. However, if I were planning the trip again I would stay elsewhere (Taksim Square perhaps) because it doesn't take more than a couple days to knock out the attractions of this area of the city, but then you not close to much else in Istanbul. My fiance and I stayed at Hotel Spectra during Ramadan and I enjoyed seeing Muslims do their religious activities near the Blue Mosque. If you are sensitive to sound then beware because the call to prayer and general activities near the hotel will bother you. I found it to be an interesting cultural experience. The rooftop of the hotel has a wonderful view of Old Sultanahmet and we enjoyed eating breakfast each morning on the roof. The breakfast is outstanding and among the best I've had for free at a hotel anywhere. I recall that the woman who set up the breakfast each morning was very sweet and eager to help. On the negatives, the rooms are not especially charming and are very basic. I do realize that \"you get what you pay for\" so I am not complaining too loudly, just stating a fact. I had one problem with the gentleman at the front desk concerning transfer to and from the airport. It was ultimately resolved favorably, but I recall being annoyed that it took some explaining. As I said above, in my view staying in the Old City was a mistake, but not the end of the world.

The location is great for the historical sights in this vibrant city but be prepared for noise. The hotel is very clean and the amenities good though the decor is rather down-at-heel. Typical eastern plumbing and virtually no sound-proofing makes for noise early and late. We were initially in room 103 and as mentioned in previous reviews the whole hotel's plumbing seems to route through this room, rather like living under Niagara Falls!! that was OK but the radiator began continuous clunking at mid-night and made it impossible to sleep! After much fuss we were moved to room 305 where there was still clunking but only every 2 hours for about 10 minutes rather than continuous. We were too afraid to alter the thermostat on the radiator in case of increased noise so slept with the window open, street noise being preferable to continuous clunking. The breakfast was very nice, two of the front desk staff very helpful, one a bit grumpy but I think this is because his English is poor. The bell boy was very pleasant and helpful. Tram system is great and very easy to use. Strongly advise going to the Kempinsky Hotel for a wonderful buffet afternoon tea, great live music while watching the sun go down on the Bosphorus. Served 3-7p.m. 68 Lira per person and includes a glass of Prosecco. Otherwise Topkapi Palace, Grand Bazaar and Aya Sofia were great, Blue Mosque a bit disappointing. Whirling Dervishes were remarkable.

They recommended restaurants and tours, and they even gave us a map to show us the nearest pharmacy. They offered us tea whenever we liked. We're sure they probably recommended tours that the hotel was \"connected\" to somehow, but we took their advice with that awareness in mind. They even reduced the price of a city tour when we suggested we wanted to go with another company. Every day when we returned, they inquired about our day and made sure everything was okay. The only problem we faced was waking up to a lack of running water in our room, but with a quick flip of a switch, the front desk had it fixed immediately. The staff recommended prices for items we were thinking about buying, and they looked up anything we asked. They were extremely helpful. Our room was just fine. We had two beds and plenty of room to walk around. The television is small, but we didn't go to Istanbul to watch TV. The shower is small, but not ridiculous as some reviews suggest. I thought the bed was a little hard, but I slept through every night. We had curtains on the windows for privacy. We stayed on the fourth floor, and never had any issues with privacy. Istanbul in general is full of very \"forward\" men trying to entice every woman to their restaurant or shop, so it's definitely a place where women need to be aware of their surroundings.

The breakfast was very good, and the rooms were fine, so we felt it was good value for money. However, our experience was completely spoiled by a hotel receptionist as we checked out this morning (20th Feb 2010). The receptionist in question is a young looking guy (I'm guessing in his 20's) with an outwardly surly demeanor. As we checked out he asked us if we had used anything from the minibar. We said we hadn't (which of course was true). He then looked at us accusingly, and asked if we were sure. We both responded: \"yes, of course we're sure\". He repeated this question, so we reconfirmed. He then hesitated, before asking us if we had had the nuts! At this point, we were both starting to feel somewhat annoyed. Instead of accepting our word, he continued with his cross examination, stating that there had been a record of nuts being removed from the minibar on the 17th. At this point I responded that if I had eaten the nuts I would have been honest and admitted it. A long awkward pause entailed, and at which point he nodded and muttered \"ok\", which indicated that we were free to leave! He did not say goodbye, not offered us any other appropriate exchange. Because of this regrettable experience, we will not be coming back to this hotel, nor are we able to recommend others to stay here. On a slightly less serious issue, we asked this same receptionist for some advice regarding catching the public ferry to a certain location. He tried very hard to steer us away from this trip, and instead persuade us to accept an expensive tour, which no doubt he gets some commission for. A similar thing happened with another receptionist here. Therefore, be mindful that you might not receive unbiased advice from the receptionists.", "Date": "February 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "berkshire", "Title": "\u201cthis hotel is the perfect family hotel\u201d", "Author": "lleandra", "ReviewID": "UR55685980", "Content": "the hotel was extremely clean..with an ideal location..the staff were very pleasant and accomodating..and nothing seemed to much trouble..", "Date": "February 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Tx", "Title": "\u201cworth every penny\u201d", "Author": "E_Akdemir", "ReviewID": "UR55322368", "Content": "i have recently visited Istanbul and stayed in this hotel for 5 days. very convenient location and friendly staff made our choice right. also the staff will go out of their way just to make sure you are satisfied with their hotel. the hotel room is cozy and will answer your demands. we enjoy our breakfasts at the terrace which has beautiful view of both blue mosque and marmara sea. i strongly recommend this hotel. they have really affordable rates and i really think that they are charging under the avarage around that area. will definitely stay again on my next trip.

We were told that there was a room available for the extra night, but they refused to match the price we were paying for the next 4 nights. I asked why I should pay more when I could simply go online and book it for cheaper and he said \"go ahead\". What made it even more ridiculous was that we were paying around 52 Euros/night for the days we booked, he wanted 60 Euros for the extra night, and we saw the sheet showing that Expedia only gives them 40Euros! If we could have cancelled we would have left immediately. The breakfast terrace does have a nice view, but don't count on a good breakfast. The woman that serves it cuts up a couple of tomatoes, a cucumber or two, a small part of a watermelon, all of which are gone after a few people have eaten. She does not replace them and looks very surprised when you ask if there is any more tomato. There is bread, cheese and yogurt, but get there bright and early for the fruit. They will also ruin the peaceful atmosphere by loading the dishwasher, which is cramped in with the tables in a very small area, nice and slowly. The rooms were nothing special.

From the welcoming cups of caj, to the wealth of information provided by staff members (who don't try to sell you anything), Spectra could not have been more helpful.

The breakfast room is always open, so often people enjoy a late night glass of wine (you provide it) overlooking the floodlit Blue Mosque and Aya Sofya. The seagulls glide over the minarets with the ethereal light from below. In the morning light, it becomes a breakfast room with lots of homemade treats and a great selection of typical Turkish items. We had a three night stay (were greeted by a driver which is free with three night min). We were planning on returning to Istanbul the following weekend after a four night trip to Cappadocia, but were not sure of the exact days and didn't think it would be a problem to get a room on Easter weekend....WRONG. The Sultanahmet district was essentially full. The Spectra staff spent quite of bit of uncompensated time trying to find us accommodations. Ultimately after two nights in the newer section of town, we were able to return to Spectra for our last night in a great corner triple room. The Spectra was built as a large private home in the mid 1800s, so room sizes tend to be smaller, as in many boutique hotels. Reponse to complainer review: many Euro hotels have motion sensors for hallway lighting. Would we go back to Spectra? Of course!

It has obviously had a very poor quality conversion at some point in its history with the first floor rooms jammed in with the tops of the ground floor windows being the only light. The room divisions were very thin. We stayed in two rooms (the first was appalling the second just bad) and in both the noise from the corridor and other rooms was very apparent. Street noise was also a problem, even on the top floor, due to badly fitted single glazed windows (which were also very draughty). When we left the hotel in the mornings there was always a guest trying to change to a quieter room so it was not just the two rooms we stayed in. The reception and hallways were very dark with movement sensitive lights which often required you to wave your arms around to get some light. The rooms were fitted with an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcenergy saving\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 device which required you to put your key in a slot for the light to work. This ended up with you groping around for the slot every time you came into the room. The bathrooms were so small it was difficult to actually sit on the toilet and in the second room I could only stand upright in the show and had to bend nearly double to use the sink. On arrival we were offered tea then subjected to constant sales of restaurants, cruises and other attractions.

When I first arrived at the hotel, I was congratulating myself for choosing such a perfect spot. Just after I entered the hotel I was received by Erzin which is an incredible nice man. He offered me free apple tea (which tasted like heaven) and then he grabbed a map and explained to me the best places to visit in Istanbul (which by the way, a lot of them are not far away from the hotel for example, the Topkapi palace or the Grand Bazaar). The room was great, very nice and clean with a great view of the Blue Mosque. The breakfast was very well served and the dining room has as well an incredible view. Finally, besides Erzin, there is also an incredible nice young man at the hotel named Mustafa. I remembered one day, he even agreed to take me to the Grand Bazaar and look up for the best prices.

Hotel Spectra has some strong pluses-- a wonderful, central yet quiet location, a lovely and helpful manager, good staff, and a terrific rooftop breakfast overlooking the Blue Mosque. But in spite of these pluses, the experience was not what we'd hoped for and the hotel seems overpriced for what it is. As someone else said here, I really wanted to like this hotel, especially since the staff was so nice and accommodating....but in the end, I felt it was desperately in need of some basic maintenance. We knew the rooms were extremely small when we booked and had no problem with that. However, due to asthma I had requested a well- ventilated room with windows and hopefully a view at the time of the booking. Since we were paying about 81 euros a night (US $125), we didn't really expect to get a view or to find a five star hotel, but we did expect a functional room. When we got there we were shown to a very small room on the first floor that had an unusually low ceiling (definitely not legal height by American standards) and two tiny floor -level windows that did not go higher than my knees. The curtain did not hang down low enough to cover the windows so that people on the street below could look up into the room, (Apparently, the first floor of the hotel had been created by dividing the ground floor into two stories). Several of the light fixtures in the room were broken, the room fridge did not work, and the bathroom shower was a pan and curtain affair that promised to leak. We politely explained that this was not what we had expected and asked for another room. We were told that the only rooms for three people were all located on the first floor and that all of these rooms were basically the same...with low ceiling and tiny low-on-the-wall windows. The staff, however, recognizing that the initial room was problematic, showed us to another room on the first floor that was slightly larger with windows a wee bit higher up (though still small and no higher up on the wall than my waist). As in the previous room, the curtains did not fully cover the windows leaving us exposed to people passing by on the street below, and letting the outside neon light into the room. Same lower than normal ceilings, again a non-functioning fridge and a broken wall light fixture, as well as wires dangling from one wall just outside the door. The bathroom, though very small, had been recently retiled and appeared cleaner. We moved into that room and decided to spend as little time in the room as possible...after all, it was only for sleeping. And, despite all the problems with the room, the bedding was wonderful--higher than normal quality sheets and comfortable beds! The ventilation, though, was poor, and we didn't sleep well. After our second night in that room, the manager graciously moved us to a dramatically better room which had become available for the final two nights in the hotel. This 3rd floor room was in the corner of the building and had a spectacular view of the Blue Mosque and square below. It was significantly larger and had normal height ceilings. Best of all, the bathroom had been redone and actually had a glass shower (rather than the cloth shower curtains of the rooms on the 1st floor). It was as though we were staying in a different hotel! I should say, though, that maintenance problems were still an issue in this much, much nicer room...and this was probably the best room in the hotel. The shower nozzle holder had broken off the wall, so when showering we had to hold the attachment in our hands and could not hang it on the wall...not a problem for us, but I could imagine others who'd paid more for this view room being frustrated by this. Likewise, two of the four light fixtures in the room were not functioning. The TV did not work at all...which we discovered when my husband and daughter spend a sick day in the room. Still, we were happy and grateful to have this room and have nothing but praise for the manager and staff. I guess the bottom line is that you do NOT want to stay on the first floor of this hotel. If you are a party of three you'd be wise to go elsewhere. But if you are a party of two and can reserve a room on the 3rd floor (especially the corner room), you'll probably be content.", "Date": "October 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cWonderful views and breakfast, very very small room.\u201d", "Author": "emcentar", "ReviewID": "UR19609693", "Content": "I really wanted to like this hotel, but my feelings during our stay were a bit mixed.

I do think that for one person, this room would have been fine, and a couple on a budget would probably also be fine, but for two family members on an extended trip, we were badly cramped.
