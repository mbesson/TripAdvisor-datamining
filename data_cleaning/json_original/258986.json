Prices for hotels also magically increase during this time...... Arrived at hotel and were slightly wary of it at first as carpets in corridors are in a bad need of changing! The labyrinth which are the corridors can be also be off putting. Pleasant surprise as room was a nice size and bathroom was great! Best shower I've had in a long time which is always badly needed after a long day trekking around the city! Even though the weather wasn't very warm, I thought the air conditioning in the room didn't seem great for the sweltering heat which you can have in Rome? Reception staff I encountered were lovely and helpful. Breakfast was also nice and kept us all fed and energised well until lunch time. Variety of breads, pastries, cold meat, scrambled eggs and the all important coffee helped to keep us all happy! Being opposite to Termini was a huge advantage with metro and bus links.

With three friends I booked it for a rugby trip, when the hotel we normally use was full up. I was surprised to find it had quadruple rooms and, since we tend to spend very little time in the hotel on these trips, we booked one. In the event one of our party couldn't make it, but we were pleasantly surprised by the size of the room and the huge bathroom. It was fine for three and would have been adequate for four. Like most Rome hotels of this type there is little public space and the corridors and staircases are somewhat threadbare and in need of renovation. However the room itself was well maintained with marble floors and good storage. The breakfast room is not as cramped as some and the breakfast buffet was better than many other similar Rome hotels. Coffee and fruit juice are fine and there is a choice of cereals, scrambled egg, cold meat, cheese, bread pastries and cake. We had a slight problem the first night with noise from a school party who were running about the corridors. However order was eventually restored and the school party left next day and there was no repeat. The staff were friendly and helpful and I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel as good value in its price bracket. It is located almost immediately opposite the side entrance of the Temini station and about 100 yards from the stop for the express bus to the airport.

Thanks to all the comments here i had really low expectation from this hotel. So why still chose this hotel? Because of the nearnest to central train station, the relatively low price and because other hotels were booked out. So therefore i was pleasantly suprised when it wasn't as bad as i thought. Okay. Location: GREAT! No problem with breakfast either. Scrambled eggs with bacon, cheese, ham, sausages, sweet croissants, buns, hard-boiled eggs...hot water for tea, hot milk for making hot chocolate and coffee. The only thing awful were the juices. Waiter and waitresses were friendly and helpful. The men at the counter did not appear friendly but then again, we had no reasons to chat with them. They were friendly enough when we checked in and when we paid. Now to the rooms. We booked a Quadruple Room. It was all occupied when we arrived. So we got two double bed rooms for the price of the one Quad Room. Room 1 was done up in gold (lovely) and faced the side road. The sound-proofed windows really cut down the noise level but if you need to sleep with the windows open (for personal reasons or because aircond not working) then it gets loud. Bathroom really clean. Some days we got plenty of towels some days less (?). Kept topping up the bars of soap (heh?). Mattresses were alright. Room 2, hmmm, not exactly to my liking. The blue colour (or is it green) is a bit strange. My young teenagers did not mind though. Could it be that because this room has a view of these three dirty walls (airwell) the size of room was much bigger. A lot of space to move around. Bathroom was also clean. Number of towels constant. But the beds! If felt like a few heavy men has been sleeping on it. You just sink in the middle. Again for children's weight, was not a problem. So i think where the mattresses are concerned it has a lot to do with luck what you get. The children also loved the hotel labyrinth, what the adults would say irritating. All in all, for the price we paid, i think we got our money's worth. Would i stay there again? In the vicinity, definately.

We went up to the room hoping that they fixed the problem (although honestly we could not figure out how one could remove the stench of mould in such a short time!!!). The room still had an awful smell, at which point we complained again. A maintenance guy was sent over to check and told us that the smell was due to the wallpaper being cleaned but left to dry without opening the windows, hence the stench. He suggested we open the windows for a short while. As soon as we did so the stench of mould was replaced with an awful smell of fried food. We again complained and asked for a new room. We were told that none was available, but they promised they would change our room the next day upon other guests departing. They changed the room and gave us a room that had no smell but had an awfully filthy bath (vide photos). Worst of all was the continious humming noise that could be heard in this room that was caused possibly by some sort of machinery placed on the roof (on top of our room).

About 14 euros per person. We stayed at this hotel for a total of 4 days and 3 nights. We only used the hotel at night to sleep. So, for that purpose it was great. There were three people in my party and we got a \"triple\" room. There were 3 twin sized beds all pushed together to make one large bed. We pulled the beds apart (they are on casters) and arranged them in opposite sides of the room, much more comfortable. The staff never said anything and they left them the way we arranged them for the duration of our stay. The room was a good size and had a great bathroom. It was early September when we visited, so the a/c was still functioning. I hear they turn off a/c access after September. There is a small fridge with two 16 oz bottles of water. This fridge never kept anything colder than \"cool\". We thought it was broken, except for the fact that we could hear it kick on. The location could not have been better. The hotel is literally across the street from Termini Station. All metro lines pass through here and the major bus station is on the opposite side of the street. Taxis are everywhere, but beware...if it's not white or green and has a taxi sign on the roof, it's not a real taxi. If you don't see a meter, it's not a real taxi. This means the driver will charge whatever they like. This unfortunately happened to us once, and we paid 12 euros (about $18). Not too bad, but on the return trip we only paid 7 euros...live and learn. Termini Station has a wide variety of shops and stores on the lower level for all kinds of shopping. As another reviewer suggested, we visited a small grocery store downstairs and bought fresh fruit, snacks and a pack of bottled water. Much cheaper than what the hotel will sell you water for (about $3 for each 16 oz bottle at the hotel). The hotel offers a good complimentary breakfast from 7 am to 10 am. Don't expect pancakes or waffles. They have an assortment of cold cuts and cheese, scrambled eggs and pastries. They have several kinds of juices and wonderful coffee. They also have cold cereals and yogurt. My tip is load up on the breakfast...it will tide you over until lunch. When in Rome, do as the Romans do...buy a sandwhich and some fruit at any of the restaurants you pass by in Termini. Have them wrap it and take it with you. You can buy drinks just about everywhere and Rome is great for public water fountains. Keep an empty bottle handy and keep refilling it. People were extremely helpful and you will be surprised how far hand signs will take you!", "Date": "September 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "CreepingAsh", "ReviewID": "UR79696277", "Content": "You cannot fault the location of this hotel.

The guy on reception was reasonably friendly but no one was around to help with the luggage. The lift was very dodgy and we both had the feeling it could break down at any minute. The room was dark and cramped but it was the bathroom that really angered us. Incredibly narrow and the shower stall was so tiny. Any idea of having a relaxing, refreshing shower quickly disappeared. This was a double room but the toiletries were a joke. No box of tissues and just one small bottle of shower gel. They couldn't have made it less attractive if they'd tried. It was a very warm night but the 'air conditioning' that is mentioned on the website was more like a fan blowing hot air. By the time we'd unpacked we were both too tired to complain and proceeded to have a very uncomortable night's sleep. The bed was two twins pushed together, one paper thin pillow each and a rock solid mattress. Breakfast was ok, although the staff were very unwelcoming. Well, at least this review has a happy ending.

The hotel suited us fine and was great value for money, it was basic but it was clean, the receptionist was friendly and helpful, the rooms had two beds, a tv, mini bar and a desk with mirror. All we needed for our 3 night stay. There is so much to see in Rome you are not in your room much anyway and this was a perfect base, close to the station where you could take a bus anywhere. Rome is an amazing city, I would recommend it to anyone - not the best for coeliacs though - I would do your research before you go!!

Two lifts took you from the beautiful marble entrance to the rooms. Our room was on the 6th floor but remained quite easily accesable to us. The room was small but had everything we needed. The beds were comfortable but were 2 singles pushed together. The room featured a fridge and reasonably priced mini bar. (1 euro for a bottle of water) There was plenty of storage and a writing desk. The ensuite was clean and featured a really classy suite which was tiled in dark marble. The breakfast was basic continental food but there was plenty of it with something for everyone including fresh juice, yoghurt and cereals. On the whole we were very impressed with the overall value and experience of the hotel. OK the room was not luxury but for the very reasonable price we paid it represented an excellent deal.

Staff were friendly and helpful and the breakfast was good, with lots to choose from. After reading other reviews I was a bit scared of what the area was going to be like but it was ok (although there were quite a few dodgy looking people hanging around), and the proximity to Termini station (literally opposite the hotel) meant that we could easily get around all the sights. In Termini if you go down the escalator and turn right there is a small supermarket selling food and drink that you could take up to your room and keep in the fridge. We bought lots of water (v. cheap) and some fruit that we took with us when we went sightseeing. The other guests were quiet and were mostly students and young families, so we had no problems.
