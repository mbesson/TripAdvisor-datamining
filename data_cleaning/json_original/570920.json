The cost is EU 185 which is very reasonable but by no mean do not expect it to be a Hilton in Rome. As for location it is very close to the bus stop 3 to take you to the colosseum, the tram to Argentina to take you to the Pantheon and Campo D'fiore and regiona train to take you to the main terminal or to the airport. The location is also where the people who work in Rome live. So do not expect Beveryly Hills but an area where there is the local butcher, small market, and grand ma and grand pa around the center sitting watching their grandkids play. Authentic? Yes. Noisy, drunk, people waking up early to get to work...Yes, yes, and yes. Do not expect a suburm in US...but a real, neighborhood where a community has lived and grown up in. Now the down side of the hotel...bed was tough...but the room was bigger than what I got in Tokyo for the same price range. The room was bigger but my hotel in Tokyo was cleaner. Because of the price, it is popular to other tourists from Italy and other neighboring nations like Spain, Portugal, and Greece. It can get a bit noise from other guests and neighbors on the street. However, the front desk is very supportive to tell other guests to quiet down. They were able to tell a group of students on a tour to quiet down so I can get some sleep. Breakfast is ok but there is a pastry shop on the corner that has an amazing cappuccino. I gave this hotel a 4 because it was a palce to rest and shower and the proximity to all the transportation and the feeling that you live there with the locals and actually \"live\" in Rome was priceless.", "Date": "September 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oud-Beijerland", "Title": "\u201cnice hotel, just outside center, basic rooms,basic breakfast\u201d", "Author": "fmoreijn", "ReviewID": "UR117479922", "Content": "Comparing quality to prices for hotels is difficult in Rome, especially when there is an event in the city just like when we were there last april.

All in all Villa Rosa was a cozy choice for us, who had to travel to Rome fair every day (close to highway connections to Fiumicino) and not very far from city centre (about 15 min with bus, which costs 1 EUR single).

We booked a 'double economy' room and paid Eur 60 per night up-front. Our friend also booked the same room type but didn't pay up front.

I asked to upgrade and was shown a normal sized room for Eur 70 a night and this was perfectly fine, with a normal sized bed and bathroom (but in the end we stayed in the small room). My advice is pay the Eur 10 extra for your sanity. I am used to staying in small and basic rooms but, for four days, this was pretty unbearable. There was approximately 1 meter square of free space that was not taken up by bed or furniture. There was no space to put our two large bags and it was impossible for two people to be standing up in the room at one time. I am not joking; it was really *that* small. Beware too, of the bed. It's really a large single and, if you are of large body build, you will not be able to get into the shower. The heating also made dripping and clanging sounds all night (which won't be a problem if you are there in the summer). On the positive side, the place was clean and the staff friendly. The normal sized rooms seemed like good value - just don't pay until you get there. Once they have your money, you'll be shoved into the worst room.

I was staying with three friends who all had clean rooms,not massive but with subtle decoration and fresh bed linen and towels daily and most important powerfull showers. I couldn't find any walls with anti climb paint and the wall outside the hotel where you were most likely to sit was completly clear. The only criticism if any would be that if you get a front room you can here the traffic but even that's not too loud and lets face it your in Rome!I think for a budget hotel you couldn't ask for more.", "Date": "March 2, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Cloud", "Title": "\u201cPleasant stay at the Villa Rosa\u201d", "Author": "ptofview", "ReviewID": "UR4455724", "Content": "I enjoyed my stay at the Villa Rosa very much.
