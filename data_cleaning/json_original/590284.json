We payed approximately US$350 for both nights for a room with two twin beds. This hotel is best described as average, or mediocre. It has a vaguely modern but very heavily-used feel to it. We were assigned a room on the second floor and took the stairs each time, as the elevator was terribly slow. Our room was tiny, with a window that looked out onto the unpleasant backyards of low-rent apartment buildings and unfinished construction sites. The bathroom was good size, but the shower was so tiny that I bumped into the door or wall with almost every move. A very noisy tour group moved onto our hallway on the second night, and made a huge racket with kids running between rooms and adults yelling which was, of course, wonderful... We took the Aerobus in from the Barcelona Airport, and had a very difficult time finding this hotel. The hotel is simply not well marked, with barely any visible signage from the sidewalk. Upon finding it -- finally! -- we encountered a line at the check-in desk and a very flustered staff person who spoke only broken English. It took about 30 minutes to get our room key -- so annoying. Hotel Gran Ronda is located in a quiet, non-descript, non-touristy neighborhood about a ten-minute walk from Las Ramblas and right near the University. It is also on the same block as a subway stop, which was convenient as we took the subway a few times to get to different sights around Barcelona. The location is somewhat random, and also gets a bit sketchy at night with homeless people hanging out near the university, and alleyways that we were told to avoid after dark. The hotel has a computer station available for guest usage for free which I appreciated. There is also an Internet cafe around the corner where 1 Euro buys you an hour of computer time. Breakfast is not included with the hotel. My sense is that hotels in Barcelona are pretty pricey. Given that, the Hotel Gran Ronda is not a bad choice.

We booked two rooms each for two adults only a few days before our stay and got a good deal of around 90 euros per room which for a three-star is not bad going (don't believe what you see on the web about it being a four-star - it's not!). The guy on reception when we arrived on Saturday evening was very friendly and polite and spoke excellent English and the reception area was smart and modern. Although when booking we'd asked for rooms on the front of the building with windows overlooking the street, one was actually by the lift overlooking the foyer so for any kind of privacy you would have to close the curtains and we were concerned about the noise. But we asked to change and they were happy to switch us to a room with a street view. The hotel looks like it has recently been refurbished and the rooms are very modern - all dark wood and painted walls - and uncluttered, with decent-sized bathrooms (with constant hot water and a power shower), air con/heating, and small, flat screen TVs. Noise from the street did filter in as the windows didn't shut tightly enough but there are shutters and heavy curtains which help minimise it and after a long day sight-seeing it didn't stop us getting to sleep! Breakfast wasn't included and I think it is quite expensive if you pay for it there seperately but we found a nice place at the top of La Ramblas which served english and spanish breakfasts. The room was cleaned to a good standard but quite late in the day - it was getting done when we returned from sight-seeing at around 4.30pm - and the staff we came across were friendly. We didn't need much advice from reception about where to go and how to get there but they were approachable and always available. The street was bustling on the Saturday night when we arrived but Sunday's seem to be quite a dead day in the area - there are lots of electronics shops - but even when it was quiet it felt as safe as you could expect for a big city, although a short-cut through El Raval from La Ramblas isn't advised at night if you're not in a group. The only real gripe about the rooms would be that the matresses are quite hard and the amount of bedding you get isn't enough for February.

There appeared to be a mixture of tourist nationalities, with i think one hen party whilst i stayed, but they were the civilized type, in the daytime anyway. Finding Las Ranblas is pretty simple as its 5mins walk away, but the beach is a rather longer walk of 20mins due to having to wlk around the harbour. We decided on a principle of walking a different route everyday and we found that walking south through El Raval is generally NOT a good idea if you're female and on your own. We stumbled upon the prostitute street at 11am!!! which was a nice wake up call. If heading to the harbour and the beach, go via Las Ramblas. There are two metro stations very nearby and you should buy the T10 pass which gives you 10 trips. More than enough for a week's holiday. The rooms were decent sized, clean with a nice tv.

The bathroom was a good size and again very modern but the room itself was tiny, infact the smallest we have ever stayed in. This however did not spoil our holiday as we only used it to shower and sleep in! One other small gripe was the price of the breakfast (which was not included in our stay).
