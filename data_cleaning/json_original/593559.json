The pension is family-run and has a central location at Wittenbergplatz close to KaDeWe department store. There is a grocery store next to the pension with opening hours till midnight Mon-Sat. We had a \"Komfort-Zimmer\" room on the 1st floor with windows to the square. The room was lovely. Spacious, beautiful decor, comfortable bed, LCD TV, and a small WC/shower. There was no furniture for storing clothes which could be problematic if you stay for a longer period of time. The pension offers free wifi and it worked perfectly also in the room throughout our stay. The lady at reception was very friendly. Breakfast was good quality but small selection. They offer wonderful fresh bread rolls, good cold cuts and cheeses but no warm dishes. This place can be reached easily with U-Bahn as the next stop is in front of the building. We definitely recommend it to people who are not looking for luxury but good and affordable accommodation in friendly surroundings (and with a personal touch of a family business). Location is also great for shopping and nightlife.", "Date": "March 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Frankfurt, Germany", "Title": "\u201cWorst \"hotel\" ever - uncomfortable, unfriendly, dishonest, overpriced, overrated\u201d", "Author": "georg123456", "ReviewID": "UR116206185", "Content": "We stayed in a double bedroom. First of all, the room was not clean at all. There was dust on the furniture, hair from the previous guest in the bathroom, mold in the shower and dirt on the carpet. The furniture is old and looks very very old and used. It is dirty and scruffy. When I complained about the dirty room, the owner - a crazy german woman - screamed at me, that if I didn't like the place, I should go somewhere else. As it was already late in the evening and my girlfriend didn't feel well, we decided to stay anyway. The next morning we woke up as there were unbelievable loud rumbling noises just above our room. It turned out, the so called \"hotel\" is actually just a flat in a big house with apartments, offices and stores and in the apartment above the \"hotel\" the owner was renovating. I again complained and asked for a compensatory discount - again the crazy old woman was screaming at me, I should complain at the floor above and that she didn't care. This was when I decided to check out immediately. I have been to many hotels almost everywhere in Europe, but I have never experienced anything like this. It makes me sad for Berlin and embarrasses me as a German, when I imagine this crazy old woman talking like this to tourists. The price (80 Euro per night) would already have been to high, as this \"hotel\" is nothing more than a hostel, but considering the dirty place and the non-existent service, 0.01 Euro would have been to much. Don't stay there, you will only be angry and frustrated and this will ruin your trip. We left immediately and stayed at a nearby hotel, which was very nice, and we had a wonderful weekend in Berlin.", "Date": "August 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "berlin", "Title": "\u201cnot a honest woman owner\u201d", "Author": "SophieundCoco", "ReviewID": "UR56252088", "Content": "The owner wanted to make us pay for breakfast even though we had never taken any breakfast in her hotel (since when we arrived we had a look at the food, and the quality is bad, ham seemed to have pasted its sell-by date). She wants to get as much money as possible, she is not a person to trust. Be careful if you plan to go there, check your receipt, she might try to get more. It was our second time here, we went there in March 2009 when we found a nice French waitress working hard there ( it is always pleasant to meet fellow citizens!!), but she leider left, I assume she went crazy with this owner.
