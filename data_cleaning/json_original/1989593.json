Hotel is situated in the classic German building, it has spacious rooms, comfortable beds and matrasses. It is quite clean, quiet, and relaxing. It offers good breakfast (few sorts of ham and salami, cheese, fresh bread rolls, yoghurts, selection of tees, coffees and juice). The hotel is situated in the Wilmersdorfer and Schoneber area quite close to Berlin\u2019s West City Centre. There are bus, metro and train links to the hotel. As you would expect from German\u2019s capital, you do not really need to wait for too long for anything, including public transport.

My room was clean and well-decorated, the design is not really that fancy \u2013 but classic hotel look is there. Room was quite spacious and warm. Hotel is in the quiet (too quiet?) residential street just off the city centre. That was quite an interesting contrast \u2013 buzzling city centre minutes-walk away and quiet place to retire late at night. Buildings in the area are very interesting \u2013 Germany in its beauty! Schoneberg attractions are quite close to the hotel. Alexanderplatz is on another side of the city centre though. Breakfast is OK. I would suggest adding a few more items to the menu though.", "Date": "October 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Berlin, Germany", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel in Berlin Centre\u201d", "Author": "gijosp", "ReviewID": "UR119242849", "Content": "Hotel de Ela is a very good Hotel. It is more of a Family-hotel though. There is no big brand behind it, rather a welcoming couple at reception desk. I felt a little like at home, and not in the hotel. It is located in centre, it has a couple of U-Bahn stations next door, it is close to Ku-damm, KaDeWe and West Berlin City. There are direct lines to Zoologischer Garten, Potsdamer Platz and other destinations. Rooms are well equipped (the safe is missing though!), good TVs, German and English channels, not LCD. Our room was facing the street and had large windows. Staff is welcoming and accommodating. We also made many friends with other travellers staying at Hotel de Ela which was fun!

We were part of a group that had booked 13 en-suite rooms, however on arrival we found that only 11 were available. One of the two rooms that I had booked was not en-suite and the only compensation offered was 2 cans of warm beer, shameful! Breakfast was pretty basic, but I thought that it was Ok for a continental. On a positive note, the hotel is quite close to the western side of Berlin, and within an easy walk to Metro. Also the Europa Centre was within easy reach.

The rooms were clean but very basic, though to be fair my own room was spacious. Breakfast was a basic cheese, ham, roll, yoghurt etc, not a huge selection of stuff and it tended to be using the super cheap budget products. Location was decent, central Berlin was walkable within 20 minutes and the busy road outside did not keep me awake.

We felt like at home. Really appreciate a big room with the old-aged furniture and high ceiling! The staff attitude was very warm and helpful. The location is very good - we walked to the Zoo for about 15 minutes, a nice small park with fountains is nearby, metro is at walking distance. The street looks noisy but it did not discturb us at all at night (though i'm very sensitive to noise). A lot of small bakeries and italian restaurants are around. We did not try breakfast as we had to leave early but we were kindly provided with sandwhiches and jogurts. Needless to say that the price is very reasonable and affordable compared to hotels and even hostels around and include the breakfast. Would definitely stay here again and recommend it to everyone for a short stay.

There is no big sign outside. If you are lucky, you get a room with your own bathroom. Otherwise it's in the hallway. The 3-bedrooms are spacious enough but the matress, pillows and blankets are not very comfortable. The location is quite good. My only real criticism is toward the breakfast which consists of the cheapest stuff you can get at the cheapest discounter supermarket (probably Lidl). The rolls made me feel ashamed since I promised my friends that Germany is the home country of the best bread in the world. The yogurt was standing outside the fridge for hours and is probably recycled the next day! The coffee was merely agua de calcetin! Also there was no shampoo available (which actually is a prerequisite for getting a 3 star ranking in Germany) - only some liquid soap (also from Lidl). The outside street has some traffic and it's thus a bit noisy but acceptable. One of the three-bed rooms has a very nice couch and is therefore quite cozy. Just outside there is a very nice French bakery. Go there if you want a real breakfast with good coffee and croissants!
