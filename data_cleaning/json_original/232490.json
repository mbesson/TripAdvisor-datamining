How pleasantly surprised were we? The hotel was extremely well run and clean and every member of staff we encountered were friendly and helpful. Special mention here to June who was the man on reception for most of our stay - could not have been more helpful! We had two rooms between us and they were both completely adequate. They were clean and both the actual bedroom and the en-suite were a good size. We had rooms 304 and 306. They possibly could have done with a bit of updating but the hotel is being renovated a bit at a time so I guess they will get to them. Our rooms were cleaned every day and there were tea/coffee and a kettle in the room. Breakfast was very good. At least 4 cereals, various different breads (and a large toasting machine), at least two cheeses, at least two cold meats, hard boiled eggs, croissants, pain au raisins, pain au chocolats, fresh fruit, jams and marmalades. On the hot side there was sausage, scrambled egg, bacon and mushrooms. Also teas, coffees and fruit juices. We never used the bar but did look at the prices and they were not much different from other bars so certainly did not look like rip off prices. As I say, reception could not be more helpful, allowing us to drop bags early, leave them there on check out day, offereing advice when asked and we heard them booking trips for other guests. The hotel is a bit of a rabbit warren in that you cannot get away from the fact that it used to be four separate buildings so there is a bit of up and down stairs to do to get to rooms. For example we took lift to third floor, walked along corridor, up one small flight of stairs, up another smaller flight and then down a small flight! Our room faced away from the street and was quiet. The clock that others mention was in ful view and chimes beautifully but I am an insomniac and I know for a fcat that it di not chime all night - seems to stop after 11 and start again around 7. Our friends room faced the road and was a bit noisier but as I have said in previous reviews of hotels, if you book a hotel in the centre of a city is not going to be like being in the middle of the country. The hotel is exceedingly close to the red light district and this sadly does mean that in the morning you leave the hotel amongst the rubbish left scattered on the ground that the council have not got around to clearing up yet. I guess this might put some people off but all in all I would have no problem recommending this hotel provided you accept that it is a city centre hotel and that not all tourists treat the area with respect when it comes to litter. In summary, I think it was a very good value hotel with a good range of food at breakfast, pleasant staff and there was always a large bowl of sweets on reception too!", "Date": "March 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Halifax", "Title": "\u201cGreat location & great value!\u201d", "Author": "Superguest", "ReviewID": "UR125945096", "Content": "I booked this hotel with some trepidation, but as we were only staying for 1 night I was more bothered about location than luxury.

The location was perfect. 5 minutes walk from the centraal station, steps away from the Damrak with all it's shops and restaurants and just around the corner from the lively red light district. As a first timer to Amsterdam I was a little concerned that the hotel was practically in the red light district, but I needn't have worried as we walked around we felt really safe and it wasn't as seedy as I expected. The only negatives I could find were that there was some noise from the church bells and delivery vans etc early in the morning, however as you are smack bang in the middle of a capital city this is to be expected. Also there was a cigarette burn in one of the chairs in the room which made it look tatty. Minor gripes and the location made up for any of the negatives.

On the way out, and due to the 89 euro room rate, we deemed this worthy of reporting and getting sorted. On giving them the option of repairing or putting us in a different room, we were immediatly offered another room which we could move into straight away. I got the sense that that repair was never going to happen and they were going to chance how many people took issue with it (or not!). They offered to show us the alternative room, which was huge and had a great bathroom etc BUT was on the ground floor (windows looked out over one of the streets in the city). As it was midweek, we said okay and moved room. Still was noisy a bit at night so would definately not recommend doing at the weekend.

The hotel seems very much a group hotel for international tour operators as groups were coming and going at intervals. Depening on the location it can be tricky to reach your room as it feels the hotel has plenty of levels and annoyingly the lift did not work. This made lugging heavy luggage really difficult and not helped by the many fire doors and stairs. The rooms are far from luxurious. Basic, clean and relatively comfortable if somewhat small. For a stay of up to two, three nights it will suffice at the price if you are not a guest house kind of person.

Firstly the hotel is in a particularly good location. A five minute walk from Centraal Station and backing onto the Red Light District. You are less than five minutes from Dam Square and all the major attractions. This however is the only strong point for this hotel. We were greeted by a fairly pleasant enough receptionist who booked us in efficiently and directed us to our rooms. The hotel is made up of three or four converted houses that have been knocked together. They are all on different levels and there are several sets of spiral stairs that lead all over the place. Needless to say we got lost! Upon locating the rooms (263 and 264), I was amazed to see just how much could be crammed into a small space. I could easily touch both walls with both hands! There were two single beds laid out end to end with a wardrobe near the window containing a single broken hanger. There was a desk with a flat screen TV mounted above on the wall. The bathroom was truly spectacular. You could sit on the loo, have a shower and brush your teeth in the sink all at the same time. I am 6' tall and could barely move in there. Next comes the heat. The hotel was baking throughout, particularly the bedrooms. You could open the window, however this set you out onto a late night Irish pub no more than five meters away. The chanting from the various stag groups will ring in my ears for days. This of course continued throughout the day and up until 1am every night. Not that closing the window did much in any case due to the single glazing. For a hotel group of this size, one would expect an investment in double glazing by now, particularly when considering all the other reviews. Instead they offer two sets of ear plugs, something I have never seen in a hotel before. You will need to use these too, as not long after the pubs shut you get the singing drunks beneath the window followed by the chiming of church bells every half an hour and throughout the day. I quite honestly got no sleep for two nights. The beds are incredibly soft which may suit some. However, they are fitted with sheets that are too small and they ride up exposing the mattress beneath. Nevertheless the linen was all clean and changed daily. There were also some complimentary shower gels and shampoos. On the whole, I did think the room was fairly clean and if I was to be picky there was a huge mound of cigarette ends on the window sill. The TV showed a good selection of channels including pay per view movies. It also had internet access. You could get all the channels and internet for E19.50. This is all great until you try and watch the TV from your bed. It is mounted so high on the wall and so close that due to the angle you cannot see a thing. There was also a kettle with accompanying teabags and coffee, but no milk or cups! No iron or ironing board anywhere. Finally the best bit of all which was checking out. I was greeted by a very obnoxious woman who refused to call us a taxi and demanded payment for the TV despite me telling her that it was un-viewable. She was not interested at all in any of our problems and gave the impression she didn't want to be there, which is understandable given the the state of the place. To summarise, I would heed the advise of all the other reviewers on this site and avoid the place at all costs. It is exceptionally noisy, fairly run down and staffed by rude disinterested people. There are plenty of decent hotels in Amsterdam and this one is the pits. It advertises as a three star but I would give it two at best.

Because it's so centrally located we walked everywhere - the Anne Frank house, torture museum, ice bar, hard rock cafe, etc. On a map a lot of the attractions seem a long walk but they're not! The maximum we had to walk was around 20 minutes. However watch out for the maps you get from your hotel or on the back of a leaflet they're all different from eachother and place the attractions in different places its quite confusing we had to use a combination of 4 maps!

What you will also notice is that you share the basement not with other guest rooms but with cleaning cupboards and the sort. The room itself looks ok however it only has a small window looking out onto walls making it very dark and dingy in the room. The bathroom, although refurbished is very narrow. Some of the walls in the room are also damp as they had black marks on them which was starting to also affect the curtains. The advice from reception was to either open the window or they would put a fan there (not too sure how this gets rid of damp in a couple of hours?!) Reception were unable to do anything for me, however eventually I moved to a room on the third floor which was a vast improvement on the basement room. Reception were however very poor. None of them had any idea from one to the next what was going on making it very difficult to arrange a simple room change.

I can recall worse service, but never a more horrible room. I stayed at the Terminus with my girfriend from July 25-29, 2009.

We made the silly mistake of flushing the toilet and it was approximately 20-30 minutes before we were able to flush again. We complained to the hotel staff and they said that they would fix it, but nothing changed during our stay. The Terminus is centrally located, but almost too centrally located.

I'm from NYC--one of the noisiest places in the world, but this was ridiculous. The lighting in the room was dim (which was probably a good thing) making it difficult to see inside of the room. The hotel offered breakfast, but we didn't feel confident eating there since the hotel was filthy. In any event, Amsterdam has so many great breakfast options we weren't too concerned with breakfast at the Termius. Although we would have loved to spend another week or so in Amsterdam, we were thrilled to leave the Terminus. I have no doubt that there are 10 youth hostels in Amsterdam that are far superior to the Terminus. Simply the worst.

We took our time to plan our three days visit of the city, but for the choice of the hotel, we relied on the advice of our (ex) travel agency. At the hotel we were given a relatively small room; the furniture was outdated, but still functional, and the walls required fresh painting. Nothing special so far. However, waking up after the first night at the hotel was special: the sheets were covered with large blood stains, my wife and myself had bites everywhere, and round fat insects were moving all over the sheets. We did not know what kind of insects were those, as we never saw them before. We started killing them on us, on the sheets, smashing them with the towels, acting with the febrile feeling of survival. It was gruesome. We took a shower, packed everything and left the room immediately. At the reception I shouted as loud as I could at the people there, making sure that everyone present hears me. I told them that they should burn down this filthy hole, where they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t keep elementary rules of hygiene. We checked out immediately, and called the agency to cancel the payment of the hotel. At the railway station we managed to find tickets on the spot, and left Amsterdam with the feeling that we will not come back. Home, I found out that these things are called bed bugs. It appears that they do not transmit contagious diseases, despite of the fact that they consume blood. I hope the scientists are right with this. This hotel is the worse hotel I have ever stayed! It ruined our holiday, we had to throw away a good deal of clothes (getting these insects out of them isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that easy, and we wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t risk it), and it left us with the very negative feeling of having slept in a junk yard, while paying for it.

Usually my budget for a hotel room is approximately GBP80 (depending on the location). Anyway, this is the first time i stayed in a non-chain hotel. I paid approx GBP65/night which is a very good price for a 3-star hotel in Amsterdam as most hotels charge over GBP100/night. The location is very good, its approx 5~10mins walk from the Amsterdam Central Station (Train) and right next to the Red Light District. The hotel generally looked very old, nothing like the photos on the official website. Either they Photoshop the photos alot (which most hotels do anyway) or they haven't updated the photos for like 10yrs. Looking at the hotel room photos what other users submitted, it looked alright and looked a bit better than Travelodge. However i think the hotel rooms are very inconsistent. I stayed in room 320, the room was worn out, very old and very stuffy. No air-conditioner, the windows were not double glazed, the shower curtain is not working well and no tea/coffee facilities. The toilet was disgusting and designed very weirdly. Thats not the worst, when me and my girlfriend came back, had a shower and went to bed. It was very hard to sleep as it was very stuffy and then after a while we both start to itch. After 1hr or so, we realised there are bit marks (similar to a mosquito bite) on our arms. It is most likely from BED BUGS or FLEAS. We went down to the concierge and showed him the bite marks, he was very nice and changed the room for us. We moved to room 25 (at the ground floor) which was a A LOT BETTER - there was tea/coffee facilities, air-conditioner,. much nicer walls/decor compared to room 320. To avoid any chances of bed bugs or flea bites, we asked for the antiseptic spray and sprayed the bed just in case as a precaution. Finally a good sleep and definitely worth the GBP65/night i paid. What i suggest is perhaps pay an extra GBP10/night or so for a better/cleaner and decent room. There is definitely a huge inconsistency of the rooms. My girlfriend is generally quite sensitive with fleas/bed-bugs and i myself would say i generally dont attract fleas/bed-bugs. Some say its because of the blood type but whatever it is, it must be very bad. Anyway, i would stay in the hotel again and would recommend it to others if its room 26 but i will NEVER stay in room 320 as it seemed i got the worst hotel room in the hotel. Just don't expect the hotel to be modern decor or with many facilities Tea and coffee facilities is extremely important in Amsterdam because there are no proper supermarkets and a large bottled water cost EUR3 and a large bottled coke cost EUR4. The left luggage room was very poor because the staff just hands you the key to the room and you put your own luggage in yourself. I dont think they'd know if you took one more bag with you away. There was no tag or anything to ID your back. Most hotels usually have a tag or at least have a staff with you to the room. Therefore i would recommend you keep your passports and money with you if you want to leave luggage in the hotel rather than taking the luggage with you all around town. Overall, I reckon the bad reviews were from users who probably stayed in room 320 or similar and the good reviews are from users that stayed in rooms like room 25. The location is definitely very good if your planning to visit sex shops and the Red Light District.

We searched long and hard for a hotel in Amsterdam that was affordable, was centrally located, & looked clean and nice. And we thought we found that with the Hotel Terminus! When we made the arrangements at the Hotel, we mentioned that it was our little, brief, honeymoon, and if they could accommodate us, that would be wonderful. When we arrived with our two friends, they promptly put us in the most terrible and disgusting room I have EVER stayed in in a hotel and put our two friends in a gorgeous room. After I had nicely mentioned again while checking in that it was our honeymoon. (Now, as a side note, I really have to say that my husband and I travel A LOT. We do not usually have very high expectations for where we stay, and are usually very pleasantly surprised both by accommodations and service. We are both very nice and polite and understand that there are very different cultural traditions and customs everywhere you go, so we try to be kind, understanding, reasonable people!!!) So, after we got to the room, which was very difficult with all our bags from the wedding (because the Terminus must me named for it's interminable staircases and strange, Stanley Kubrick-esque hallways!) my dear husband went back to the front desk to explain that the dirty, stained 1970's porno-nightmare we were staying in was not really the modern, nice hotel room we had seen in the pictures and had expected. So the girl, with a little smirk on her face, apparently, said no problem and immediately moved us to another room (Obvs, they didn't offer to help with our many bags). So my husband thanked her, took the new key, and came back to the old room to get the bags and me. After shuffling down the long, long staircase with our ridiculous bags (we don't normally travel that way - remember this was just after our huge wedding and we had a ton of stuff for that!!!) and got in the questionable elevator that was, thankfully, working just fine. As we were getting in, some poor guy that worked at the hotel was getting off, and my husband asked him to help us with the rest of the move. To which he graciously agreed (per what I assume is actually his job description.) So, and I am not kidding, we went down a floor, walked down a long, hallway, down some stairs, through another hallway, up some more stairs, around several corners and another hallway until we found the other room at the end. And THAT room WAS the exact room we had seen advertised online. So, it is there, and it was very, very nice. However, please also note that the Terminuns is VERY close to the Belfoi, so if you want to sleep past 8 in the morning (which might have been nice for us on our honeymoon, exhausted as we were after the trip!) DO NOT stay at this place, either. The bells are VERY loud, unpredictable (didn't follow any kind of pattern time-wise we could decipher) and went off at all hours of the day. Some staff was very nice, but I think the woman who checked up in must have been messing with us. We are always really polite, but I think she just made an assumption about us based on our luggage and nationalities. We looked a little bedraggled when we came in, too. But I would have to say, if you are trying to have a nice, easy stay, I would not recommend the Terminus. The location IS amazing and very hard to beat, but the hotel staff, other than the poor guy who bore the brunt of his colleague's little trick on us after moving several of our bags down the hall, is questionable. And the other man who worked as a concierge was very nice, but extremely understaffed with a huge line of people waiting to check in the next day. Maybe not very effective at his job. And our wake-up call for 6:30 am on our last morning (in order to make our 7:45 shuttle) was, for some reason, maybe by accident, maybe not, scheduled for 7:30. After being really clear about it. Anyway, our trip was great, and the room they moved us to was like a different world compared to the first, so all's well that ends well.

The location cannot be faulted, being down a side street off one of the main areas near the red light district. However be prepared to be woken up from approximately 7am with church bells every 30 minutes and traffic straight outside your window. I booked three triple rooms about 6 months ago. When we arrived, the receptionist informed me that one of the rooms had been changed to a quadruple room and they were 'fully booked', but \"don't worry, this is an upgrade\". The quadruple room was located in the basement. It had one small window, was dark and dingy and not too dissimilar to that of a dormitory. It did, in fact, have 6 beds, no mirror and no safe. I complained at reception, to be told that they usually gave this room to groups of lads. The receptionist then informed me that she had in fact just sold the last room, so earlier when we arrived they were in fact not fully booked. Eventually they upgraded our room to a business room, which are very nice, has a free safe, a hairdryer in the bathroom, nice toiletries, towels, a TV and a fridge in the room. On the day of departure, we left our bags in the luggage room, as our flight wasn't until the evening. The door to the luggage room had a key card lock on it and was straight opposite reception. On return, approximately 6 hours later, the receptionist (whom I believe was the Manager), was very blas\u00c3\u00a9 in informing us that our bags had been gone through by a thief. She then went on to tell us that if we so wished to make a complaint, the Police Station was down the road, which was no use to us as we had a plane to catch.

We booked through europeandestinations.com for 8 nights, air and train for 2 for $2800. We arrived from Paris on the Thalys train to Central Station. Of course, it was typical Amsterdam and drizzling when we arrived. We started to take a taxi to the hotel, but the taxi host told us, you can see the hotel from the station, which is true. If you walk south from the station, turn left at the end of the canal and it's the 1st street on the right. Our room: Check in was nice and easy. They all spoke great English, all over Amsterdam. Our first room was on the '2nd floor'. Just so you know, there are 4 stairs to get to the elevator, once we got to the 2nd floor, there was another set of 4 stairs and a 15 stair staircase to get to our room. It was tough to lug the bags up there. Our friends were on the 1st floor and only had the 1 set of 4 stairs, so if that's an issue for you, ask for the lower floors. Day 1 was great, nice bed, view of the church tower and a nice bathroom. We came back after lunch and there was a horrible smell of urine! We called the front desk and were immediately switched to a quad room in a basement type floor, much better. We had 2 singles separate and 2 twins together. Bathroom was the same as before. Plenty of counter room, hair dryer etc. Note: All rooms smell like smoke, even the non smoking ones, I can only wonder how bad the smoking ones smell. But then again it's Amsterdam, everyone is 'smoking' everywhere. Also, the staircases are more like ladders. They are so steep. Red Light District and Coffeeshops: If you walk 2 streets over after making a right at the end of the street Beurstraat, there you are in the top of the red light district, it goes on for blocks and on all the neighboring side streets. It was even packed just walking around when it was raining. It was a strange sight to see. The coffeeshops are EVERYWHERE, the only difference between them is the type of seating and music. They do have great coffee! Food: We liked the Marco Polo pizza on the main street near Central Station. Also, there is a nice jazz bar/restaurant called Old Quarter pub. Day trip: We bought $10 tickets and took a train ride to Muiden where they have a castle from 1280. Was the best part of the trip. Anne Frank house is good too. It was raining, so we took a cab from the hotel, it was $12 and we walked back, just a few blocks. Please let me know if you have any questions. Would I stay here again? It felt a little dingy, but I probably would because the other hotels in the area looked a lot worse! If you want to be in this area, it's an ok place to be. Nothing fancy.

The location of the hotel is probably it's best factor. It is located on a very quiet street but 10 seconds away, around the corner you encounter an endless amount of shops, bars, coffeeshops and a really buzzing atmosphere. It's great! Dam Square and great shopping is literally 5 minutes away, if even. The Hotel is also right beside a police station as well so security is very good. I was worried about the bells when I read previous reviews but we really didn't take any notice of them.
