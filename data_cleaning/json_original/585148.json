The room was quite spacious with a nice king size bed, large wardrobes, a working safe, and a good quality hairdryer (my wife informs me). Great bathroom with walk in shower, WC and bidet. The room was very clean and was cleaned to a high standard every day. The staff were very friendly and spoke good English (better than my Spanish certainly!) and were always helpful. Slight downsides? No tea/coffee facilities in the room. There is a menu for a local pizza company in the rooms. Avoid. It took me 36 hours to recover from a very dodgy pizza!

This is an extremely well located hotel. The staff is gracious and quite helpful. We stayed in a standard room. The beds were very comfortable. The room was very clean. Having read reviews on TripAdvisor, we had exactly the right expectations for the room and the hotel. The bedroom was somewhat tight, although it seemed much airier due to the very high ceilings and the ceiling to floor window. There is a nice desk area and a small flat screen tv. The closet is nice sized. Also, the safe in the closet is big enough to store a laptop. The bathroom was fairly spacious, although toiletries are somewhat limited. For example, there is a gel dispenser in the shower; there is no separate shampoo. Our room was on the first guest floor of the hotel, facing the street. There were some street noises. We generally are not noise sensitive travelers, so this did not unduly bother us. If you are noise sensitive, however, you probably would want to be on a higher floor or in a room that does not overlook the street. Previous reviewers noted how slow WiFi is -- that is true. Also, the business center consists of an older computer on a desk near the reception area. There is a printer. Serviceable but not a separate full business center. Overall, however, this is a very good, well run hotel. I recommend it.

Owned by NH but quite different in feel. Rooms are spacious and light but furnished more cheaply than the usual NH. The floors are some sort of laminate and the furniture is stuck-on veneer rather than wood. Replacement light bulbs could not be found. On the other hand the bathrooms seem to be where all the money was spent and are excellent (except that they provide shampoo from a wall dispenser rather than the usual NH toiletries). Staff: The staff I encountered were very friendly and helpful but sparse in number, consisting, for most of the day, of a single receptionist attempting to handle three checkouts while answering all telephone enquiries, (there must also be cleaners etc) All in all, the hotel is perfectly satisfactory, but could use an NH upgrade and with youth unemployment at an all-time high in Spain, would benefit from more staff.

The basin is in the room - it's not a separate bathroom - well there's a \"cupboard\" that hosues a separate shower and loo (no bath). v. small. Very little external light.

We were quite disappointed. I asked the front desk if they had any other superior rooms available for our stay. The staff member was gracious about our request and switched us to room #208. Beautiful!! Large airy bright room with sophisticated color scheme. Huge windows with two small balconies. Views of the charming street, yet quiet at night. Wireless access with good connection.
