{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Horrible Sure, it's cheap - but you get what you pay for (and then some). Room was FILTHY and TINY. So-called Housekeeping consists of daily replacement of two towels for bathing (hand-sized towels). Dark, small, dingy rooms (carpet at least 30 years old; had huge stains and cigarette burns all over).Cable TV non-operational (managed to receive five channels); no remote (management refuses to give out, citing theft).Despite the above, my biggest complaint was with the weekend overnight front desk clerk. Do not DARE to bother him; he went as far as to say to me that he doesn't give a sh*t, when I inquired about a FedEx delivery from work. Beyond me why they retain an employee with this attitude towards paying customers'.Management needs to reaccess employees' and their presentation, in my humble opinion.", "Date": "Oct 15, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR145949694", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "jmiamiflo"}, {"Content": "Cheap, noisy, bad TV", "Date": "Jun 22, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR483916646", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "great little deal! I travel alot in my job and in san fran I discovered a very reasonalbe bed and breakfast located just 4 blocks from union square. I have been paying just 63 US Dollars a nite for a private room w/bath and it includes both breakfast and dinner. Rooms are a good size and they have claw footed bathtubs/shower which is great for us tall people!! The hotel could use a few upgrades ie the weather channel and newer tellies but who on holiay really watches the telly anyway except for the news. I highly recommend the hotel for the budget saavy traveler and for those that want something other than the normal corporate box rooms that you find so often. This hotel is in a 6 story older building that has bay windows in the front.

Some of the front desk staff are most friendly and helpful, while others do not hesitate to show they hold guests in utter contempt. For a traveller on a budget who only has to spend one night, my suggestion is to pay extra and stay near the airport. If you are staying any longer, investigate the area further before committing to the Ansonia. If I would have know earlier how unfriendly this hotel is to the paying customer, I would not have given it a second look. While proximity to events downtown is desirable, Ansonia has only location as a drawing card, and that is most definitely not enough. I have found much better lodgings in the area now, and will truly never return to the Ansonia. Business or pleasure travel should not have the stress of this environment. My overall rating of the Ansonia is less than one out of ten, and would not recommend it, either for dollar value or atmosphere. San Francisco is a great city, but my experience at the Ansonia has genuinely affected this visit.", "Date": "Nov 14, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR976313446", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Great location, quaint hotel stayed for 3 nights at the end of may.the location is great, walking distance to almost everywhere of interest. the rooms are cute and spacious for the price. the heat even came by early evening even though the temperature didn't dip below 60 yet.", "Date": "Oct 18, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR387983497", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "ansonia is a terrible hotel This is the worst hotel I have ever been, STAY AWAY from this hotel!

It's a safe, clean, quiet hotel at a great location which hosts to alot of respectful foreign/exchange students. Breakfast and supper are included which saves you alot of ($$).

I checked in last night for a 6-night stay. I have stayed at many BB hotels (which this place is). I believe that it is a good value because for $63 per night inlcuding tax (14% hotel tax in San Francisco) I receive: * a private room with bath (lots of hot water) * all-you-want-to eat breakfast (e.g. French toast, scrambled eggs, orange juice, tea/coffee/milk, bacon, ham) -- all average * all-you-want-to-eat supper (e.g., shells with ground beef, steamed broccoli and carrots, coffee/tea/milk, canned peaches) -- all average * free high-speed Internet access (5 computers with 24/7 access) * safe neighborhood only 3 blocks from Union Square My room has some carpet stains but the sheets and pillow cases are clean, the bathroom is small but clean, the room is reasonably quiet (get one in the back of the hotel and on an upper floor), and the staff folks are friendly and helpful. My room has a TV but only one channe comes in well; but I don't watch TV at home and one doesn't go to San Francisco to watch TV anyway.The Ansonia ain't the Hilton or even the Holiday Inn, but it's adequate for my needs and it fits my budget.
