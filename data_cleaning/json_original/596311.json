The rooms are spacious and large so you don't feel cooped up and the bathroom is beautiful and clean with a lovely deep tub to soak in! I travelled with my son (6 yrs old, full of energy, he gave a 'thumbs up' after jumping on the beds) and my mother (lets just say she's got her free bus pass) who loved the fact that there was a lift (very important after a long day walking around the historic sites) as not all the boutique hotels have lifts and she adored the cleanliness of the hotel and room. We stayed in a triple room and the furniture was very comfortable and all the soft furnishings were pristine, nothing appeared worn in any way, it was just as the official hotel photo's show. The chairs in the room were also very comfortable and we faced the front of the hotel so had a lovely juliette balcony to look out over the street. The hotel is situated about 20metres down a side street from the main thoroughfare so you literally fall out of the front door and are right in the thick of things. The room had great sound insulation so our sleep was never disturbed by any noise during the nights. The staff were faultless, everything we required was executed swiftly and without fuss whether it was room service, taking tea in the grand foyer or obtaining information at the concierge. Breakfast is served in the rooftop terrace restaurant which has lovely views and a further viewing level is accessible from here which is open all the time. The breakfast was very good with a wide variety of both hot and cold dishes, cereals, breads, fruit, cold-cuts etc. There was something for everyone. I am sure the evening meals were also exquisite but we ended up eating out every night due to our itinery. The restaurant staff were polite and discreet at all times. The great location of this hotel means that all the sights are no more than 10-15min walk away and the tram stops at the top of the street if your feet are tired. The blue mosque, hagia sophia and grand bazaar are easily within walking distance but you might want to take the tram for topkapi palace and the harbour where you'll find the spice bazaar, galata bridge and onwards to taksim square. I normally like to book flights and hotels separately but on this occasion I could not beat the combined price by BA (bear in mind that you MUST fly to ataturk for istanbul; the other airport will mean you spend half a day getting to your hotel!). I would also recommend that you take the metro/tram into the city centre. It's just as quick as a cab but one tenth the cost.", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Potomac Heights", "Title": "\u201cOverpriced for what it offers\u201d", "Author": "seenitallpprune", "ReviewID": "UR127626268", "Content": "The location is convenient and the lobby is impressive, but little else is worth the 230 euros/night.

I booked this hotel after reading reviews on tripadvisor. I must say it was a great hotel, brilliant location and very friendly staff. As soon as our taxi entered sultanahmet area our smiles went away b/c it seemed a bit run down with quiet cheesy hotels around but when the car stopped infront of Hotel Sultanhan we got our smiles back. It has a great big enterance hallway which is very clean and spotless. The staff was friendly and the manager spoke English. The room was the best part, good size, newly refurbished and spotless bathroom. When we arrived there was no cot in the room as ordered on the internet and niether was their an iron. We brought this to the attention of the manager before leaving for dinner and by the time we got back it was all done. It's located 200 yards from Divan Yolu (Tramway) the main tourist road. Nearest tram station is 500 yards away. The tram can be used to go as far as Dolmebache Palace (get off at Kabitas stop)The Turkish Hamam Cimberlast is only 5 minute walk. The blue Mosque is a 5-6 minutes walk and Haghia Sophia is right opposite the mosque. Topkapi palace would be a 10 minute walk (max) and the Grand Bazaar would be the same distance. We also use the sight seeing bus parked infront of Haghia Sophia (but i thought it was a waste of 35 YTL -PP). Since we had an 8 month old baby with us the prime location helped greatly as we could go back after seeing one site and freshen him up for another trip. The breakfast was great and had good variety from cold to hot and the staff in the restaurant was even more friendlier to our baby helping to look after him while we ate. We made good friends with Engen over there who alsi guided us about local sight seeing and price range of different product. We also tried their roof top restaurant for dinner one day and it was really good (overpriced though 25 Euro per person) and had 3 course meal. The only flaw I can think of is that there was no electric kettle in the room and since we neede hot water to make the baby's milk therefore it was a bit of a hassle. But the hotel overcame this by giving his hot water in a glass kettle in the evening when we called them up. The room rate can be said to be overpriced and if they were slightly cheaper then this would have been a 5 star holiday. So in short it was a great stay and we hopefully shall go back.", "Date": "January 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel and location\u201d", "Author": "swinesheadvillage", "ReviewID": "UR11065761", "Content": "Excellent hotel with very welcoming staff.

So, we crossed our fingers and hoped for the best. We were pleasantly suprised. I had e-mailed the hotel inquiring as to airport pick up, their reponse was immediate and very informative giving us several options. We chose the have them meet us at the airport. The driver was lovely, giving us a quick description of all of the sights we saw along the way. The sampling of Turkish delight was a nice touch. Our room was small, but extremely comfortable and immaculate. The front desk staff very helpful with restaurant recommendations, bookings and sight-seeing information. I don't think there is a language that they don't speak. There is a bar in the reception area and the bartender was superb! Every afternoon when we came back in from our outings he would greet my husband with a beer and snacks and me with a fresh squeezed lemonade, the best I have ever tasted. The guests at the hotel come from all points across the globe and we were fortunate to make quite a few new friends. The location couldn't be more perfect. The view from the balcony above the restaurant is a 360 degree panorama of the old city, the Sea of Marmara, the Bosphorous, not to metion Haga Sophia and the Blue Mosque. All of the major sights are within walking distance. The tram stop is at the end of the street and the ferries are about a 15 minute walk away. We only ate at the restaurant for breakfast (included). I must recommend The Cistern, which is across from Haga Sophia for dinner, an actual cistern that had been converted and 5 Kat in Beyoglu. Make sure you book for a table near the window for an amazing view of the Bosphorous at night. The hotel value was great, however, Istanbul is no longer the bargain it once was and we found it quite expensive.

Very nicely, but moderately decorated lobby and rooms. Twenty four hour, very helpful and friendly consierge. Air conditioning worked well, rooms were large, bathrooms were adequate with very nice amenities. The views are really from the roof ( if you crane your neck on some of the rooms with a terrace, you can see the Marmaris) but the view from the terrace is spectacular. The breakfasts were sumptuous, wonderful Turkish pastries, croisants, a variety of cheeses, sessame spreads, fresh juices. The wait staff was effusively attentive and the view from the terrace absolutely memorable. The trick is not to spend the whole morning at breakfast! There is internet in the lobby, and , off and on in your room ( at least when we were there ). It was a bit of an annoyance to have to go to the lobby, but it was complimentary, and they were not in control of the situation. There is a Hamam in the basement which is very nice, if you know how to use it , because it is not attended.....you are sort of on your own. They offer massages , but the lady who officiated did a mediocre job and didn't understand English....if you have a tender spot ....good luck!!..... All in all a wonderful hotel!

We opted to book directly rather than Expedia, to get a discounted rate and an airport pick up. We were picked up at the airport by a delightful man hired by the hotel who brought along his young daughter, as it was a Saturday morning. The hotel staff were helpful and courteous in getting us situated and making suggestions how to get around. They let us look at four rooms before we made our choice (we had asked in advance to stay away from the staff elevator, due to a review on this site). The room was spacious and clean, with decent A/C. We faced an inner courtyard on the recommendation that it was quiet, and it was. It began to get hot the week we were there; we found the lobby without A/C tough for the guests and worse for the staff who had to stay there all day in the heat. I hope they've turned it on air conditioning in the public rooms now that it is so hot there, as the reception and lobby area is very pleasant as a place to relax, look at the internet etc. By the way, I never had a problem getting access on the hotel computer, but it's confusing until you figure out the keyboard \"translations\", then it's fine. The desk staff is patient and will help you sort it out. The breakfasts are wonderful, as is the roof terrace. Don't forget to go to the very top, I only discovered the higher terrace on the last night there. The hotel gives the standard, but delicous assortment of typical Turkish fare, plus scrambled eggs. I was impressed by the service and the food. The hotel restaurant is really good. A couple of nights after we enjoyed the Cemberlitas bath, my friend and I opted for soup and fresh rolls, with the vegetable lasagna or soup on its own. The soup is fantastic, and the rolls are tasty. The waiter treated us like royalty, even when having a modest meal. We got stuck in the elevator when the power went off briefly, which was a little disconcerting as there is no light to see the emergency ringer, or intercom to call the front desk. We asked them to improve this. Another thing you should clearly watch for near the hotel and along the main street is that pavements for walking are at all different levels. There is often a step down which at dusk is easily missed by a tired arrival, or if you're looking around at the sites. I almost tripped myself one evening, when distracted by a local vendor calling out the usual \"Lady, lady\" .... A couple who arrived at the hotel had a nasty accident one evening. They were going to the bank at dusk for cash after arriving, he missed the step, went flying and broke his arm and cut his eye. I happened to walk by just as it occurred, it was quite upsetting. There are no reflective strips anywhere to warn tourists that there is uneven pavement, even in a highly trafficked tourist area. However, all the bystanders were there to help - especially the lovely man outside El Torrito next door who called the paramedics. Seeing them later on, the couple stated the local hospitals both public and private were good and they got good treatment. The hotel is close by the Blue Mosque, AyaSofia, the Grand Bazaar, and the incredible Cemberlitas hammam. More about hammams on another posting.

We were on the back side of the building so it was quiet (but had no view, overlooking a residential building.)

The location is excellent, right in the heart of the Sultanahmet area of the city so very close to the Blue Mosque, Aya Sofia, Cisterns, etc. We walked everywhere. Istanbul is a fascinating city with a rich history, nice people & surprisingly good food. We decided to book a turkish bath experience with the hotel and found it to be worthwhile. The masseuse was a slightly Donatella Versace-esque woman from Ukraine with very strong muscles & a minimal sense of modesty. But she was nice and very concerned to appropriately adjust the treatments to my pregnant state.
