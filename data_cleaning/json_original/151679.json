If you like laying on the beach the sand is clean there are beautiful palm trees that provide nice shading however this part of the beach is not good for swimming there is a very rough current and high waves. There are a couple of great little cafes close to the bus stop, which is great because the buses really follow no schedule. Look for the sign that is all green and says parada its only 75 cents one way. The bus doesn't make change so be sure and ask your hotel clerk wherever you stay which one stops at your hotel and which to come back on. Taxi service is always available but, is a total rip off. Learn to find your way around on the bus you will save TONS of mula. The inn is beautiful but it's not not luxury living by any means. In fact the room I stayed is simply not very nice the room far from perfect but gentle on wallet. They do provide towels for the pool and if you ask for two single beds you will naturally get a bigger room trust me you will be glad you did. The airconditioner worked great, the bar was under construction,the food if you order any is from the sister hotel and way more pricey then the local places just up the road. A few little things the bedding, sheets and comforter felt more like hay then bedding the shower curtain was ripped in places and there was some mold on the curtains. When I booked this vacation we planned on trying to stay on a budget so we could spend more on drinks & food which worked out great. Also we wanted to be in more with the community and not totally in the tourist only area and this location is perfect. Beyond the cosmetic issues which are easy too overlook with some rum in your belly I would reccommend this hotel to anyone.", "Date": "April 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, New York, United States", "Title": "\u201cBest place to stay in San Juan!\u201d", "Author": "NataliedeP", "ReviewID": "UR127756311", "Content": "This was my first trip to San Juan and I made sure to thoroughly research and read plenty of reviews on all \"budget\" and boutique hotels in the area. I finally chose the At Wind Chimes Inn and I couldn't have been happier about this decision! The place is in an upscale residential area, one block from the beach, which is a local spot and there are hardly any tourists- I went during a spring break weekend in March too. Within walking distance to great, local restaurants, as well as Condado. But if you want my advice, don't even waste your time on the Condado strip- this is where all the big hotels are and all the tourists. Super crowded and no good restaurants! The hotel was small and quaint with a pretty Caribbean feel. The staff was amazing- super friendly and helpful, especially Calvin! They went out of their way for us constantly; booked our excursion trip and made a bunch of calls when one of the trips we wanted to do was fully booked. They give you fresh towels and beach chairs whenever you want them for the beach. The room was small but it was inconsequential because I didn't go to San Juan to sit in my room- all I needed was a bed, A/C and a shower with clean towels! Overall, not a single unpleasant thing about this hotel- amazing location and if/when I go back to San Juan I will definitely stay there again!", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, TX", "Title": "\u201cWorst Part of our trip to Puerto Rico\u201d", "Author": "Alfredo V", "ReviewID": "UR126307734", "Content": "First of all I want to clarify that we are an average family who loves to travel but tries to save some money when possible. Also, I want to clarify that we spent a lot of nights in non-chain type hotels, so we know how to survive without the standard curved shower curtain, or the standard Hilton Brand alarm on your night stand.... but the experience at At Wind Chimes was so terrible that I really need to talk about it. My wife booked 3 nights at At Wind Chimes 1 month in advance, and when she called the hotel to confirm a crib, she was told that we would be upgraded to the Acacia- wonderful! Call before arriving to know where to check in, they warned her. We got to San Juan, called and found out that the upgrade was fake \u00e2\u20ac\u201c back at At Wind Chimes we were! We got to At Wind Chimes. Check in was already troubled by this reverse upgrade, or downgrade. Owner denied any upgrade had ever been offered, and he told us that there are 4 different hotels in San Juan owned by the same owner of the At Wind Chimes. Acacia is right down the road, and is one of these co-owned hotels. Trust me, it is not even in the same category as At Wind Chimes. The look of the hotel is overall Caribbean authentic, at least from the outside. Some renovation was going on\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6not very convenient considering the Spring Break period. According to the owner the hotel was full. The swimming pool is in a corner next to the reception.. not very good looking. Not very inviting. Since we were traveling with a 9 month old baby, my wife had called ahead to make sure there was a crib for the baby. Our room at the Acacia was supposed to have a balcony (perfect for when baby went to bed). Our room at At Wind Chimes- not so much. No balcony, no space, very tiny room. We were so disappointed. First of all they asked us to provide the credit card to pay the whole amount. We thought it was for any incidentals, but then we were handed a receipt to sign for another payment. But hey- we already paid in full on Expedia! No, according to At Wind Chimes, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. (We later checked online- yes of course we had, and we had to repeatedly ask for a refund). Our room was the very last one available (that's what they said). Our room was on the 2nd floor of the 2nd building. After 3 ramps of stairs (no elevator, but they have ground level rooms if you have mobility issues), we finally got to our room. The room was 10' x 10'. Air conditioner under the window 2' from the bed (great for my back...), the room smelled like mold, and it did not look very well cleaned. But the greatest surprise was that the restroom did not have a door (!?!?!) and the window of the bathroom was actually looking at the corridor where all the guests where passing by (the window could not be closed, and we realized quickly that you could hear everything going on in the bathroom from the outside...) The crib was first placed in one position, then moved to another to allow us to access the bed. With the baby, luggage, and us, it was like a puzzle... The smell of mold was still there by the way. Off course there was no balcony either\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 so after 7:30 PM, our day was practically over. We had a stained pillow (replaced), dirty towels in the bathroom (replaced). At Wind Chimes really feels more like a hostel than a hotel. Just dirty, unkept and old in general. Internet connection was related to the Boat Bar which is part of the hotel. Connectivity was very poor, and worked only the first day. Speaking of the bar, it was closed for renovation. The carpenters were working from dawn to dusk and everything was happening right in front of our only window. You want to relax in peace, enjoy your time away, have a baby that takes naps? Tough. It was also very noisy with the traffic outside. Remember the window in the bathroom facing the corridor? The corridor has a large opening on the street, that was working as a funnel for all the noises that were easily entering our room every time of the day (and night). The smell of mold was still there by the way.. no matter how low you were trying to keep the air conditioning hoping to reduce the humidity.. it did not work at all. The safety of the room was extremely poor. The same key was opening too many doors... and the lock was very weak. We complained with the owner, but off course the answer was always the same: \"We are trying to find you a better room, We are fully booked, We are sorry, but no refunds...\". The second day I decided to go with our baby to the swimming pool. As I said the one at At Wind Chimes is not very inviting, but the owner told us that if we want we could go to the sister hotel (the Acacia), I decided to go there to see how it looks. The Acacia is a totally different story. No Smell of Mold (off Course!) and very beautiful. The swimming pool (that is actually a very large hot tub) is on the second floor. Once I saw the hot tub I could not believe that both hotels were actually owned by the same person... The Hot Tub is amazing! It is worth the fare for the hotel just by itself... luckily I found that it is not a real hot tub.. it is just a little bit warm.. Perfect temperature for the baby! We had a wonderful time. I had occasion to look into the rooms facing the pool while the doors where open for the cleaning. They have a big LCD, and very nice paintings. The doors are new, and the lamps are new as well. Very good looking, and very nice style. Unfortunately, at the end of the day, I had to go back to the smell of mold, the small room, and the air conditioning hammering my back all night long. A very good thing of the hotel is the location. You are 5 minutes walk from Kasalta Bakery (wonderful for snacks, breakfast, lunches), and many other small restaurants for the night. 10 minutes to the west, and you are in the center of Condado with hundreds of restaurants and bars. The bus stop is 5 minutes from there. Line #53 will take you straight to the old San Juan (amazing place!). The beach is literally 1 minute walk to the north. You can see the palms or the water at the end of the street. Again, let me reiterate- when I read negative reviews on TripAdvisor, I always think: these people expect too much, they are snobs, etc. However, this is unfortunately my true experience as an absolutely normal person. The level of decency is severely lacking at At Wind Chimes. Of course, as long as you do not like the smell of Mold! In that case, the At Wind Chimes is the perfect place for you!

We had a blast because of him, not to mention he gave us a great referral to a sailboat company that was a highlight of our trip. Aside from the employees, they had a charming cat named Popo, tropical plants everywhere, and our room had three huge windows that we could leave open throughout the day. The pool was just the right small for a boutique hotel, and we enjoyed walking the half block to the huge jacuzzi at the sister hotel around the block. The beach was a 3 minute walk away, and never too crowded. Every day the maid came in and cleaned and tidied our room-- even arranged our shoes that had been scattered around the room!

I was born and raised in Puerto Rico and \"go home\" often. Circumstances have changed and so I don't have a family member to stay with, forcing me to look at hotels. Well, when I go home I want to spend my time and money on quality things. The fluff and puff don't attract me, so obviously I want to stay away from the \"tourist traps\". The following are my recommendations/observations. The Wind Chimes hotel is right in the middle of the best part of the Condado, a small section of San Juan area, for night life, beach, restaurants and shopping. Let's face it, even the locals hang out in San Juan/Condado. Just a few short blocks West of the Wind Chimes are some great restaurants and the new \"rodeo drive\" with big ticket shops. The beach is just a short walk across the street (half a city block). Which is awesome to be able to walk to and not have to worry about parking (which is very difficult in Condado). Kasalta bakery is a few blocks East on the same street- breakfast is a must there. As far as value- i loved not having to pay $300/night for a non-personal, crowded hotel experience. Instead I paid $150/night for a King size bed with friendly service. The room wasn't a modern clean-cut pristine model of perfection, but i was comfortable and the room/sheets/towels were clean.

Since we arrived during the end of the off-season, there were less touristas around than typical. The ride from the airport was only about 10 minutes, and one of the first things we noticed was the crazy drivers everywhere! This is relevant because it makes the cab fair ($15-20) to and from the airport and Old San Juan seem reasonable when you realize how much work is actually involved protecting the precious cargo. It is also relevant since there is a likelihood you will wake up to car horns if you sleep in and leave your window open. The hotel is by no means on a busy thoroughfare though, and seems more like a quiet garden plucked down in between the tall buildings surrounding it. Hotel staff was very friendly, and upgraded us to the honey moon suite since it had not been reserved (we had requested a king size bed, not sure how available that request may have been otherwise), so we had our own private balcony overlooking the inner courtyard! The plaster walls, terra cotta shingles and tiling are warm and inviting, surrounded by the plant life and pottery decorating the interior walls of the resort. The pool is small but inviting, and unfortunately the in house bar was closed for the off season. Our room was not the largest for a suite, but more than adequate for our purposes, with nice amenities and furniture. We also spent a fair amount of time at the sister hotel Acacia about a half block away towards the beach, which boasts a fine restaurant, along with the largest hot tub in San Juan (or is it all of Puerto Rico?). The staff there was also very welcoming and accommodating. While we unfortunately did not have occasion to enjoy dinner there, we had two excellent breakfasts and the menu is diverse. Wind Chimes is perfect for anyone who wishes to stay near the beach, and who does not require the perhaps more extensive (& expensive!) amenities of a larger hotel (hence the boutique tag). Besides being close, the beach appeared clean and well kept, although the water was a bit rough this time of year.

The shower stall was nice. Of course, as with almost every hotel in Puerto Rico, the water pressure was lacking. The young lady bartending at the Boat Bar was very friendly. She made us some interesting tropical drinks which we enjoyed very much. We had a pizza ordered from the hotels sister hotel/restaurant, to the boat Bar and it was very tasty also. The pool was well maintained and very pretty. The common areas are very cute too!

As a travel professional, I know that brochures and websites can be extrememly mis-leading and I found this to be the case. The photo of two beach chairs and a wide angle photo of the building showing it all by itself did not represent that the hotel was surrounded by rundown highrises. Tiny pool and a dim room without even a window. There were certainly no beach chairs, only thin towels that were loaned out at the desk. I believe At Wind Chimes has many positive qualities and many repeat customers. Rooms are inexpensive and the staff did seem nice. The building is attractive and reasonably well furnished. It is on a residential corner surrounded by a high wall. The \"limited four star\" rating is a bit of a stretch. I did not think that the advertising lived up to the reality, so this makes it difficult to rate. Reservations must be paid in full in advance, and the cancellation policy goes into effect 10 days prior to arrival. And they charge for three nights. So with four prepaid reservation numbers, I was asked to pay for 10 hotel nights when we left after the first day. We actually only stayed in one room for one night, then checked out and cancelled the rest of our stay and our friends' stay.

As I shared in the ratings, the staff and service is very nice and very helpful, there were issues beyond their control that will ensure that I never stay there again. THE ROOM: Firstly, the room (room 120) was in a location that made it very loud and difficult to sleep. ALl night long there were cars and trucks heard on the street below. Besides this there were also sounds coming from within the building itself, such as a whining fridge motor, or a squeaky ceiling fan. These sounds combine to make it very difficult to get a good night's rest. the room was also not cleaned very well. When you closed the bathroom door and looked at it from inside the bathroom it was covered with dust. This leads me to believe that they cleaning crew has not done a very thorough job. The tile floor was also very dirty, and walking around barefoot left me with a collection of grit and sand on my feet that I had not brought into the room. To top this all off, on the last night we were there I discovered a COCKROACH in my clothes! My wife found another one a few minutes later that scurried across the floor. Granted, upon bringing this to the attention of the people at the front desk we were immediately given a new room for the night, but it was still a big negative for us. LOCATION: While I did feel safe within the hotel and with the location of the hotel itself, I felt like we were right on the edge of a safe area, venturing into a bad one. If we walked one block further from the beach or one block to the east, the neighborhood became very run down, barren, and dark.

The only con I have is that there were not many places to eat near the hotel. We did not rent a car so when we were back at the hotel we had to walk. The hotel restaurant which we heard was exceptional was in the sister hotel, Acacia next door and never seemed to be open, plus it's prices were 5 Star, so not a place to go for every meal on my budget.

It's a Bed & Breakfast type boutique hotel in a beautiful Spanish style villa in a nice residential area. The beach - public, clean and mostly empty when I was there - is literally 2 minutes (walking ) away, just 1/2 a block down the road. What makes the Wind Chimes Inn such a great place to stay is its staff (very attentive), the location (you can walk to most restaurants in the area as well as to the beach) and for me, that I felt safe and well taken care of as a solo traveler. I had planned to travel with a friend, but she canceled last minute and I was a bit worried going solo, but felt right at home . If you want to meet fellow guests, you can do so at the pool (small, but nice to cool off), sun terrace or the cute bar where they offer coffee (no food) in the morning and a no cash bar at night. Breakfast and dinner are served at their sister hotel, the Acacia, which is about 50 yards down the road towards the beach. The Acacia has 1 star mor eand reminds me a bit of a tiny W style hotel. The restaurant at the Acacia, the Niche, is top notch. Chef Oscar is combining international food with a local flavor. I went there 3 times for dinner and a wonderful Sunday brunch and each time the food was excellent and the pricing was fair considering quality and quantity. The service was excellent. I also tested a few of the other \"higher end\" restaurants recommended by TripAdvisor and none of them was better than Niche and most of them more expensive. I travel a lot on business organizing events and off sides for a living and stayed at 5 star hotels, some of the named \"Best of..\" by Conde Nast Traveler over the years. This was a private trip, not paid by my clients and I was on a budget. The Wind Chimes Inn is a 3 star hotel and doesn't pretend to be more than that, but you get a lot for your money. I'll be back!

Cocoa is the resident cat. Adorable. Very private and peaceful accomodations.. We skipped the boat bar, but those who were there, seemed to be having tons of fun. Yes, the place could use a bit of sprucing up, a little paint and nominal updates, but it has old world CHARM. We stayed in room111, with a couch and really nice king size bed The room was large!!!. The refrigerator/sink and 2 burner combo was old but adequate. I would have added a microwave for convenience sake. 2 ceilling fans, great a/c. I bought a can of lemon air freshener as I felt the air was a bit stuffy. That fixed the problem. The windows in that room do not open, but I think that some on the upper floor do.. Breakfast was served at their sister hotel. The waves were fierce but the beach was just 2 blocks away. \\I waded in the surf and my hubby is part fish so he had no probs swimming.. Loved the shared patio with lounge chairs and shade, overlooking the pool.. Small pool but we felt like we had the entire place to ourselves.Mini library on the second floor was a godsend, since I finished the 2 books I brought with me. ( I added mine to their collection.) The bus was fun to old San Juan..75 cents. Exact change only. The greenery and flowers on the property were lovely. Also, the full moon from the top patio...amazing! That area has 2 couches and an overhang, if you are outside and it's too sunny, plus 2 tables with chairs under the twinkling stars or endless blue skies... Multiple windchimes singing and birds birds birds chirping in that area. Remember...this is a BUDGET HOTEL (. Fodor's recommends it.)

The bathroom was tiny and dingy. The grout in between the pink tiles was brown and black on both the bathroom floor and in the shower. The shower also had rust stains running down from the faucets. It was like they never scrubbed it down. Needless to say, neither of us took our shoes off...even in the shower. There was no clock and the small tv had bad reception.

I chose the hotel based on reviews here on Trip Advisor, but found a very different place from what I had been led to expect. This shocked me since I've come to rely on Trip Advisor through the years and have always been able to add positive reviews from those experiences. To start, the check-in process was slow and cumbersome. It took the clerk a very long time to take care of the fairly simple needs of the party ahead of us in line, and just as long for our simple reservation. Eventually we were led to our room, but given no assistance with our luggage on the many steps up and down. Those who checked in ahead of us had to wait for us to be taken to our room before being taken to their room in a separate building down the street. The room was small and dingy, even for regional norms - and especially for the price. There was a lot of dirt between and on top of the vinyl tiles on the floor, peeling paint on the walls, and even a couple of roaches. The bed was uncomfortable, but usable and clean. It overlooked the hotel's bar and a street, so it was quite noisy until about midnight unless you closed the window and turned on the air conditioner. There was no deadbolt on the door, the door closed only loosely, and you could see light from the hall even with the door closed. The window blind was cracked and curtains weren't fully attached. Furnishings were very unattractive and crowded. The tiny TV only picked up two over the air stations (both in Spanish) with very weak signals. The bathroom was terrible. The sink only had cold water since the same supply pipe was connected to both the hot and cold water taps. The shower had very little pressure, a poor shower head, and missing and discolored wall tiles. The bathroom's window opened to the hall next to the stairs, so it couldn't be opened while maintaining privacy. While the hotel has wireless internet in the bar (and in our room due to its proximity to the bar), it took some effort to learn the passcode. The front desk clerk didn't know anything about it, and neither did the first person I asked in the bar area. Finally, one of the servers was able to provide the simple code. The hotel has a nice pool area, but some advertised features didn't work and it closed at 6 pm. It was just a short walk to the beach on a safe street, and was a reasonable distance from Condado restaurants.

Perhaps we as younger travelers got the short end of the stick and were given a shoddy room. I didn't complain about our accomodations to the staff. Maybe other rooms would have been more satisfactory. So that said - if you go make sure you get a high level room away from the bar. (There's one room that's actually UNDER the pool's lounge area and right by the compressor for the waterfall - ugh!) And forgo the hotel breakfast and walk down McLeary to Kasalta's for great local food. My husband and I took brunch each morning splitting a sandwich and large soup and dessert (the coconut flan is to die for).

We decided on Puerto Rico since we hadn't visited that island yet. (We travel through the caribbean quite a bit). We needed somewhere clean, near to the beach, with good staff and as inexpensive as possible. Wind Chimes was pretty good in all these areas. The room we stayed in was about the size of a standard bedroom, located upstairs w King Size bed and a bathroom. The water pressure wasn't that great, i guess because we were upstairs, and the hot water was intermittent. That wasn't a problem for us because this is a pretty standard situation in the caribbean unless you're in a big hotel. Bathroom was fairly clean, and our towels and linens were changed daily. Cable TV available in the room, and my friend picked up the internet on her laptop. The swimming pool is really just there to wade around and cool off in. Very small, but i liked it. There is a separate tanning area above the pool as well. The staff is awesome, we found ourselves hungry late one night and the chef/bartender Angel fixed my friend a tasty vegetarian pizza and i had a chicken quesadilla. AWESOME!!! The front desk staff is also really helpful with area information. The hotel is literally a block from the beach. The Condado beach is choppy and the sand isn't as nice as you would find in Negril, Jamaica but for Puerto Rico it was ok. Isla Verde beach is much nicer and not as many teeny boppers about. There were good restaurants to choose from. A five minute walk takes you to a Dominican Restaurant called Beso's. The french eatery La Patisserie was also excellent, the Quiche was amazing. Although my friend insists that the lunch meats there gave her a virus. (I recommend eating cooked meats in foreign countries...newho). 10 -15 minute walk takes you to a wide array of other eating areas, including Uno's Pizza, Starbucks, and other selections. We followed the suggestion to take the bus to Old San Juan and that worked out well for us, since we didn't feel like spending the extra money for a cab. Be prepared to be disappointed with the Bacardi tour, personally had I known what i do now, I would have skipped it. Basically you get 2 drink vouchers, then you take a trolley to the 'tour', Which is essentially videos and pictures, and then you get sent over to a drink expert who tells you how to make Mojito's, Cuba Libre and Daiquiri's. Then it;s over to the gift shop. That's it. No tour of the actual facility or taste testing or view of the estate.

On the up side, the location was completely safe, we walked everywhere and stayed out on the beach til midnight every night without any problems. We also found a great place for breakfast called Kasalta, it's more like a bakery than a restaurant, but very good. The staff may recommend Pinky's, but we say nooo way. Everything just felt not right about that place, and I'm all about eating from vendors and kiosks, but that place was way too dirty feeling.

It is located in a residential neighborhood , and the whole property has a cozy B&B feel to it. Although not overly friendly, the staff is competent and efficient (Felix at the front desk is the star of the group); the rooms are attractive, clean, but not luxurious, and a little smaller than some people may prefer. We don't spend a lot of time in the room, so it worked out perfectly fine for us; if you expect to do more than sleep, shower, and sit in rattan style chairs and watch TV or read a little after a busy day, you will probably be disappointed. The pool area and elevated sun terrace are near the street but a stone wall surrounds the area to provide some privacy. The boat bar a few steps away provides a welcome oasis with a limited menu (breakfast and lunch) and reasonable prices for food and drinks. The bar tenders were very friendly and the whole place has a very laid back, casual feeling to it. Unlike some other reviewers, our whole group did not feel nickel and dimed to death ; we felt they gave us good value for the prices they charged. Driving and parking in San Juan is a REAL CHALLENGE, so you might want to think twice about renting a car unless you plan on visiting other parts of the island. Although the cab fares do add up, it's the way to get around here if you go somewhere beyond walking distance. Public transportation is available and cheap, but we found it took a lot of time to get anywhere; service is a little erratic sometimes. All in all, we had a wonderful stay here.

We felt we paid too much for what we received. First of all, it seems like Wind Chimes Inn charges about 25% tax when everyone else on the island charges about 9%. We paid over $150 per night with taxes included when we only booked the room for $120 per night - do the math, that is a ton of \"taxes\". We didn't know better though, because it was the first hotel we stayed in. The room was nicely decorated but pretty small - also, we were given a room right beside the lobby and the front door, even though we told the lady at check-in that we were on honeymoon and wanted some peace and quiet. This definitely caused some problems, what with the spring breakers slamming doors and yelling in the lobby til about 3:30 am every night and the hotel not doing anything to calm the freaks down. Nothing is complimentary and you WILL get nickel and dimed more than anywhere else. Also, the hot water seemed to be non-existent half of the time - take a quick shower if you stay here. It is close to the beach and shops and restaurants which is nice. Also - no parking unless you want to pay $10 per day, and it is pretty difficult to find a spot near the Inn. All in all, the Inn is clean and nicely decorated, but we felt it is overpriced and doesn't offer very good service or value.

The noise at night didn't bother us. Also parking is VERY limited; you can pay $10/night if you have a compact car to park in the tiny gated lot---but there is only space for 4 vehicles.

The chairs that you can take to the beach are $3. Whenever you call a taxi you pay a tourist fee which is much higher than what the meter shows.

The hotel staff will probably recommend you eat at Bebo's, but there is a restaurant called Jataca that is across the street from BeBo's and a few steps down (to the west) that has great food for very cheap. All in all we had a wonderful time.

We booked a room in the At Wind Chimes Inn through Expedia but when we arrived they said that our room was in their other building down the street. This other building is a new hotel that's just opening called Acadiana so there was lots of construction going on. The parts of the hotel that were finished were absolutely gorgeous and it was closer to the beach than the at wind chimes (which is only a block from the beach). Even though we were in the Acadiana, we were able to use all the amenities of the At Wind Chimes Inn. We ended up not minding the switch but if you would mind, you should confirm which building you will be staying in. The LOCATION is great! You are a block from the beach and only 10 minutes from downtown Old San Juan. It really is the best of both worlds. The neighborhood is quiet. If you go a block in one direction you hit designer shops and fancy restaurants but a block in the other direction and the area is a little sketchy so be aware of that. The FOOD at the bar was amazing! They cook everthing right in front of you. It's really fresh and just wonderful. It's not super cheap but it's not super expensive either. The bar staff is friendly and welcoming as well. It can take a while if you get there when it's busy though. The POOL is small but a nice place to relax and if you want to swim in something bigger, the ocean is just a block a way. The BEACH nearby was not that crowded and had lots of great waves.

The inn was the perfect tropical oasis in an ideal location within the city of San Juan. It provided more privacy than a bed & breakfast while still giving a wonderful feeling of coming \u00e2\u20ac\u0153home\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd every night. It is a lovely white stucco Italianate villa located one block from one of the most beautiful beaches we saw in all of Puerto Rico. We felt that the inn was an excellent value for the quality, location, staff, and facilities. STAFF: The staff is very friendly, knowledgeable, and generously invests their time and enthusiasm into making sure that you thoroughly enjoy your stay at the inn and in Puerto Rico. Genie took us under her wing and made us feel like part of her own family. ROOMS: Room size varies widely. We strongly recommend asking questions and reserving a particular room. We stayed in Room #121 and highly recommend it. Located on the 2nd floor of the main villa, the room was very spacious with two queen-size beds, a small refrigerator, a round table & two chairs, one six-drawer dresser, a small closet, and three end tables. Moderate-sized bathroom, not big but not cramped. Shower (no tub) was large enough for two. Two ceiling fans and an air conditioner kept the room a comfortable temperature. Three large and attractive paned windows in the bedroom, one overlooking McLeary Ave, the other two overlooking the inn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pool and side street provided lots of nice light. Street noise from passing cars was moderate and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother us. Room #122 was attractive & spacious with 2 beds. Room #123 had 1 bed and was a small but nice room. We felt that room 104 was way too small & dark, and we would caution about rooms 101 & 102; they were right off the lobby which can be noisy with lively conversation, sometimes late at night or early in the morning. Room #111 is off of the boat bar; it looks like a nice room but expect nearby activity & conversation. CLEANLINESS: Everything at the inn was clean, clean, clean and very tidy! POOL: The small pool is pretty as a picture and is the perfect spot for cooling off at the end of a hot & humid day. Lounge chairs are very comfortable. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let the posted pool hours of 9am to 6pm discourage you. As long as you are quiet and respectful, they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t chase you out of the pool at any hour. BOAT BAR: Delightful! It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just an in-house convenience; the food and drinks are very good and this is a nice spot to mingle with other guests. Chef/bartender Danny shared some excellent restaurant recommendations and Freddy or Marcos steered us to a private waterfall swim in El Yunque. Room service is also available. JACUZZI/HOT TUB: One half block down the street is Wind Chimes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sister\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd property, the Acacia Seaside Inn. Guests from both inns are free to use the facilities at either location. You MUST visit the Acacia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jacuzzi/hot tub\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 It is something straight out of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Spa\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd magazine. This long, curving rectangular pool is made entirely of Chinese granite; it is framed by several swaying palm trees. Gentle waterfalls flow in two of the corners and pretty little fountains line the granite wall on one side. At night, this oasis is beautifully lighted with soft changing colors Go to the Jacuzzi! ISSUES: The only \u00e2\u20ac\u0153issue\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd we could come up with is that the water temperature and pressure in the shower is quite erratic. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like the temperature or water pressure? Wait just a minute; it will change. We chose to approach it with a sense of humor. LOCATION: This is an ideal location! We felt safe in this lovely neighborhood of luxurious villas, beach houses and high rise condos. It is only a 5 minute drive to the upscale restaurants and shops of Condado Beach; a 10-15 minute drive to Old San Juan or Isla Verde. Only a five minute drive to conveniences such as gas stations, Walgreen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, a grocery store, and a fantastic pandaria (bakery/deli/coffee house/liquor store). Route 22, the major highway leading to points outside of San Juan, is also less than 10 minutes from the inn. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a car, there is good food and drink within walking distance, the public bus stop is just a few blocks away and taxis are available. PARKING: The inn has a tiny parking lot for a maximum of 4 cars; it is not easy to park in the lot but, otherwise, you must find on-street parking on one of the nearby side streets. Neither option is ideal but both are workable. We opted for the inn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parking lot for $10 per night.

We also used the spa at Acacia and really enjoyed it. The room was clean. We felt completely safe staying there, and even kept our valuables (including cash) in the room without using the safe and didn't have any problems. I was not comfortable doing that at first but my boyfriend asked Jeannie at the front desk about renting the safe and she said there was no need, the housekeepers had worked there for 15 years. She was right. My only complaints about the room are that there was no full length mirror and the shower was OK the first couple of times, but by the end of our stay I was wishing for my shower at home. Just not enough pressure for me, I guess. Also don't forget to bring your hair-dryer as there is not one in the room. We rented a car and parked on the street, as it was a last-minute decision and the parking lot was full. We had to drive around the block a few times, but other times we found a spot right outside the hotel. I'd rather save the $10 a day. We had breakfast at Kasalta a couple of times and it was really good--fresh pastries. Leave the hotel and go right, towards Ocean Park (within walking distance). We also ate at the Columbo Frozen Yogurt place in Condado one morning and that was surprisingly good as well--really good Cafe Con Leche. For dinner, we ate at Latin Star in Condado (good local food), Mirabueno in Old San Juan (great food--more upscale, and we happened to go on \"Opera Night\" which was a neat experience), and Pamela's in Ocean Park. Pamela's was my favorite, as we went a little later (9 pm or so) and had a table on the beach. It was really quiet out there, only about 8 tables. The food was really good--I had fish, my bf had lamb. We had snacks at the Boat Bar at the hotel a few times--the mango salsa was very good. We went drinking in Condado the first night and walked back to the hotel with no problems. We took a cab another night. We also took a cab into OSJ Saturday night.

The inn is located in the Condado area of San Juan, which is a bustling area. It would be fair to say Condado is similar to Miami Beach - very busy, a beautiful beach with lots of high-rise condos and hotels, a main strip loaded with restaurants and shops. Condado is not a quiet, laid-back \"zen\" place (if that's what you are looking for) but it offers great convenience for visiting sites like Old San Juan (the bus stop is only 2 blocks away and costs only $.75) and El Yunque Rain Forest (although you'll need a car to go there or go with a tour guide). We stayed in room 106 which is off the main couryard outside the pool area. Our room was furnished with a bed, 2 night stands, a full dresser (with lots of drawers), a coat rack, and a small bathroom. There was no refrigerator or anything else like that in the room. What we liked about this inn: very clean, attractive, charming, well-kept place with a very pleasing asthetic. Pretty courtyard areas with lots of tropical plants and an adorable cat whose tongue seems to be perpetually sticking out. There are also a couple other quaint public areas to hang out - little sitting areas with chairs and tables or couches that are very attractive and relaxing. There is a small but nice pool area for a cool dip. The maid service was excellent - our room always looked perfect when we returned from a day of siteseeing. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The inn is located the main strip which becomes Ashford Avenue a few blocks down and all restaurants and the main strip are within a 10-15 minute walk from the inn. Guests at the Windchimes also have priveleges at the Acacia Inn which is a pretty seaside inn just down the block. The nice thing about this is that the Acacia has a BEAUTIFUL outdoor jacuzzi with waterfalls that has a view of the ocean and sitting in this jacuzzi was a highlight of our stay. I've included a photo so you can see what it looks like. I have only 2 criticisms of this inn. First - the bar. While it is a very cozy place to sit and the help is very friendly, we found the food and drinks were overpriced and of average to poor quality. A sandwich I ordered was downright terrible (overcooked, bland). On our first morning there, my hubby stopped at the bar to get coffee and was charged $2 for a cup of coffee that was probably no more than 4 ounces of coffee. Needless to say we didn't go back after that. There are tons of wonderful places in the area to dine, so my advice is to explore! On that note, our favorite restaurants in Condado were Ajili Mojili and Zabo. We had scrumptious meals at both these places (these are somewhat pricy restaurants with entrees averaging about $22-$30, but in my opinion worth the splurge). We also enjoyed having gelato at Pico Bello as a treat after dinner. My only other criticism is that there is some kind of loud generator running in the pool area that is so loud, it completely detracts from the environment. That pool area would be a wonderful, relaxing hideaway if it wasn't for that generator. I am not sure what it is, but it is loud as hell and runs continuously. So overall, despite the couple criticisms I have pointed out just for your information, I have to say that we were very pleased with the Winchimes overall and felt it was a wonderful place for the money.

The hotel is allied with (managed by? owned by?) the Acacia Guesthouse, which is half a block away and just finishing renovations. At this time, guests are allowed to use the common facilities at either hotel. The hotel is definitely gay-friendly and probably 25% of the clientele were gay couples. My room was nicely appointed, exceptionally clean, and a bargain at $80 plus tax for a queen size bed.

However, my boyfriend and I took a chance and thoroughly enjoyed our stay! It is a wonderful, comfortable, affordable inn that feels like home away from home. We stayed 3 nights pre-cruise and we do not have kids. Here's a rundown of Wind Chimes Inn... Location-quick walk to the beach, restaurants, shopping, and only 10-15 minute drive to airport and cruise ships. We felt very safe walking around by the Inn and neighboring homes were all well kept. Parking- did not have to deal with since we always walked or took taxis. Doors to property- require your room key to enter and exit, but not a big deal and worth it to feel safe. Front desk staff- ALWAYS helpful and accommodating. Got to know each one a little bit. Rooms-Our room was wonderful. Very comfortable, cool, high ceilings, lots of room to put our stuff. The bathroom was on the small side, but that didn't bother us one bit. Public areas- The lobby is lovely and inviting. The upstairs terrace area with the wind chimes is a quiet place to enjoy a book. The sun deck has several big comfy lounge chairs. The courtyard is a great place to meet people and read. Pool- Not heated but it doesn't need to be! Very comfortable water temp. and the perfect place for a dip. No smaller than a lot of back yard pools! Bar/restaurant- Our favorite part! We spent a lot of time here chatting with the staff and other guests. The drinks were wonderful and the food was affordable and delicious! It was just so convenient to have this bar right inside the hotel and it made meals times very easy. Contrary to other reviews on this website, the bar staff does not make any of the food on a George Foreman Grill! Several of the bar staff members are studying culinary arts and prepare your food on open flames right in front of you. All of the food was beautifully presented and delicious. Worth EVERY PENNY! Overall- we just loved our time at Wind Chimes Inn and we were sad to leave. We highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a charming, affordable, friendly place to stay.", "Date": "March 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver", "Title": "\u201creserve early\u201d", "Author": "gulfislanders", "ReviewID": "UR6898995", "Content": "After vacating a rundown hotel, we were scrambling for somewhere quiet & clean to stay.

Not sure if they were trying to book for a cheaper rate than the $99 room that they offer but trust me when I say that it was more than worth the price and there were DEFINITELY no bugs there! Now...on to my report. We found the inn to be charming and clean, and the management were absolutely fantastic! Hats off to Gabby and Juan for their help and kindness with directions, restaurant advise and anything we could think of. Always willing to help with a big smile - they made our stay! We had the cheaper of the rooms on the ground floor level right next to the bar. The private nooks and crannys of this restored casita are what made it so special. You truly felt as though you were in a cozy place miles away from the world. As you walk through the front doors into the lobby, the delicate smell of incense makes you feel as though your vacation has begun - nice touch. The room itself had 2 double beds, a dresser with TV and a table and 2 chairs, A/C and spacious bathroom. The artwork in the rooms was local and very cheerful. The floors (including inside the shower) were red tile which was really unique. The swimming pool is small but very lovely with a small rock waterfall.

Our room was in the back, past the boat bar. Accommodations were comfortable, slightly above basic. The ceiling fan made the room actually quite cool, even with the A/C turned to low. The bathroom door was slotted (like blinds) so there was almost no privacy. The shower had a curtain, but was otherwise open; the size of a tub. I agree with comments that the water takes awhile to warm up: let it run about five minutes before jumping in. The pool is small, but is great if you can snag it to yourselves (which isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hard to do). Staff. The staff was very friendly. They directed us to restaurants, the bus stop and the Pueblo. When it came time for us to venture beyond San Juan, they assisted us with a car rental and a flight back from Vieques. The man at the front desk was very informative about the flights, ferries and car rentals, providing us with information to help make our decision about transportation to and from Vieques. The beach is just one block from the hotel, and is not at all crowded. If you have a rental car while staying here, check with the hotel first (in advance) to find out if they have a parking space available (very limited parking). If not, you will have to park on the street\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand there is not much space on the street, either. For the one night we had our car at the hotel, we had to park illegally on the street, along with about a dozen other cars. There were no problems, but it made me nervous. Dining. Most of the Condado restaurants are about a mile up Ashford Avenue (which is called McLeary in front of the hotel). Bebo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is a Puerto Rican cuisine restaurant a bit closer, about two blocks toward Condado on Calle Loiza. They are fairly inexpensive ($10pp) and seem to be quite popular with locals. Transportation. The A5 bus runs to Old San Juan for $.75/person each way. It picks up on Calle Loiza; ask the front desk to direct you. If you take a taxi back from Old San Juan, go to the Plaza Colon (in front of San Cristobal). There is a taxi stand here, and because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s at the edge of town, you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to sit in OSJ traffic. We took a taxi from Plaza Colon to At Wind Chimes Inn and it was $12. Location. The hotel is in a residential area, about a mile from the Condado strip.

The hotel is in a residential neighborhood 1 block away from the beach in Condado, which is a beautiful town. There are 2 buildings - one is contains the main hotel lobby, some larger guest rooms, a small pool, a sundeck, and a tiki bar/cafe. The other is on Taft St. and contains the rest of the rooms (this building is much closer to the beach). The beach near the hotel is decent and very pretty, although the waves were very rough during our stay - not great for swimming. This may have been because of the recent windy/rainy weather, I'm not sure. The beach was not overcrowded and was clean and safe, although I wouldn't recommend walking out there at night. We ended up switching rooms because of some error made at the front desk, but our 2nd room ended up being amazing. We had a huge deck with a partial view of the beach, a queen sized bed, nice bathroom, A/C, large dresser. The first room we got was not great, though, there was no deck and the window overlooked barbed wire and a parking lot, and the window didn't lock which was dangerous since we were on the first floor. Maid service was good, though, the pool/tiki bar were nice, and the people at the front desk were super friendly, fluent in English, and helpful about suggesting sights to see. The one annoying thing about this hotel is that there is no fridge, and in order to keep our drinks cold we had to walk to the main building to the ice machine multiple times per day. Also there is no alarm clock (or any clock) so bring your own. Some things we recommend are going on their El Yunque rainforest tour (the hotel makes reservations for you through a local tour company). It was only $45 which is a steal compared to other rates. It was amazingly beautiful, although it was about 1 hr away and they bring you in a tour van which is packed and hot. You get to go hiking, though, and swim in a waterfall, eat local food. There is 24 hr desk service and they can hold your bags after you check out so you can go have one last day of sightseeing. To recommend a few places to eat around the hotel, Bebo's Cafe on Loiza St. was pretty good and very inexpensive, although service was very slow and it was always crowded. No one speaks English there, either. If you walk down towards Ashford St. there are tons of restaurants there which are more touristy and more expensive. Do not walk down Loiza St. towards Isla Verde at night - it is very sketchy! If you need to get around DO take the bus, it's 75 cents and it will save you loads of money.

It was an easy walk to Bebo's Cafe for dinner and we were completely comfortable walking back to the Inn at night. Bebo's, although lacking in atmosphere (it is a little bright) is a great value. It is definitely a local favorite, generally packed with what are obviously nearby residents - friends and families, young and old. They tend to give English menus to tourists but be sure to ask for one in Spanish as well - the daily specials are only in Spanish and they are a good deal - mostly $5 - $6. We ate there twice and everything was delicious. Cafe de Angeles on Ashford is also good - more atmosphere and an open air eating area but it is mostly tourists.

We stayed at a guest house \"At Wind Chimes Inn\" that offers great personalized service. You can pay $300.00 at a larger hotel chain, but for the internet price of $99.00 for a queen size bed, you can't beat this. Realize you are in Puerto Rico and the rooms are nothing fancy, but comfortable. What makes this hotel is it's location and the friendly staff. They also have a bar just for hotel patrons and it's very reasonably priced for drinks in comparison to other places. We recommend four fabulous restaurants, each offereing the best of Puerto Rico. First, Tantra in old San Juan - the Mofongo is to die for and the Black Love Martini - a real winner in the asian fusion type cooking style. Second, Al Dente in Old San Juan - an excellent Italian Restaurant - quaint and intimate like Tantra but of course a different flavor - italian. We had the calamari with tartar sauce - it was outstanding and would have like to eat dinner there but already had plans. Service at this restaurant was impeccable. Lastly, an little Mexican place recommended to us that we absolutely loved. It's called Celito Lindo and it's on Calle Magdelene just past the Marriott J.W. and one street away from the ocean. It's next to the U.S. Post Office. At first glance and even entrance you might be a little unsure, but hold with it - fabulous food for a very reasonable price! We ordered the black bean soup and a combination plate (Number 3) and couldn't have enjoyed ourselves more. Simple, but good mexican food made from scratch. Lastly, for breakfast and just up the street from At Wind Chimes Inn is La Patisserie - they have $3.99 breakfast specials each day, look for the sign at the entrance of the restaurant (lunch specials also). We ordered the standard $4.95 breakfast, but it wasn't so standard - it was delicious served with potatoes (some spice I couldn't quite figure out) and french baguette with french toast, bacon, and eggs.

I booked on-line and there was no choice in rooms. Upon arrival I asked for an upgrade and we were accomodated the next day. We stayed at the additional house which looked to be still in progress 1/2 block down the road > closer to the beach. Rooms were somewhat small but very clean and nicely furnished. The bathromm was also in good condition. Both rooms were kept in imacioulous conditions by the cleaning staff during our stay. The gated doors of that house were kept closed (guests had a key) and we felt safe and comfy there. We checked out the breakfast bar twice. The first time was great. A German lady most efficient and very friendly served us a sumptious breakfast. On our last morning, our second breakfast, it was a little less uplifting > mix-up in the order, missing food item, food came at different times for my husband and myselve etc. We were served by 2 people of which one said he didn't do the breakfast bar for a while and the second one spoke Spanish only and was just given instructions. So Ok Breakast bar was soso. Parking is a problem. Not many spaces and you have to make reservation otherwise you find yourselve circleling the blocks. The pool was a dissapointment. It looked nice in the pictures but turned out to be just a little more than a bath tup. The staff at the reception/concierge desk was fantastic. Always extremely helpfull and really friendly and sincere. Thumbs way up for these ladies. THANK YOU!!! To the neighorhood. At first it looked a little run down which it was. But for the people in the stores and restaurants they were warm and friendly to us tourists and made us feel ok and safe. No problem there. Buses are readily accessable and a bargain for 25 cents just one block off the hotel. No need for taxis. The beach looked nice and clean and hardly anybody enjoying it at the time we were there. For somebody who doesn't like the hype of the big hotel chains this hotel is perfect. It's clean, quite, private and everything is easily accessable. Also, Puerto Ricans are special people. Respect and kindness is in full swing. That's what we have experienced at our stay at this lovely island. My husbad and I are 48 and 54 years young of mixed race and culture and like to do things our way especially on our vacation.

My family and I were there for 13 days. It's a lovely place, lots of charm and intimacy, beautiful physical plant and the people running the place (Gaby especially, who was so accommodating to our needs and helpful with advice about where to eat and how to get here or there.) are fantastic. The location can't be beat. A four minute walk from the beach and at the perfect spot to pick up the central highways on the island. There are great restaurants within walking distance (Bebo's, Kasalta) and if you don't have a car, public transportation can be picked up close by as well. I felt safe there...but I wasn't in the annex, which sounded a little fishy to me when it was mentioned when I first called. It's not completed and I think they're using it eariler than they should. Here's what could be better at Wind Chimes: pool hours are too short (9-6); the pool is TINY! Literally four people max can move in that space. And as for the jacuzzi, uh...it's more like pool pumps that you can press your back against. ANd the last two days we were there, the pool was developing a disturbing cloudiness that no one seemed to see fit to apologize for or explain. There is no complimentary breakfast...even continental could do the trick, especially when the place bills itself as welcoming for kids. A family can't plunk down 8 bucks a day for a bowl of cereal and a glass of juice, which is what you'd spend at the \"Tikki Bar\" at Wind Chimes. The room attendants make the beds and refresh towels, but don't reliably sweep the gritty sand that inevitably comes in on your sandals, nor do they re-supply the shampoo unless you ask. There's no iron in the room, which one might need if one were doing business on the island and needed pressed clothing. They supply beach towels, but could think about renting out beach umbrellas, especially since they bill themselves as having access to the beach. One cannot just sit there and roast all day without serious damage taking place. The parking facilities are horrible. There are about five spaces and you have to park about an inch from a wall in order to fit, so if you're not ready or able to climb out of the opposite door, you're stuck. I'm getting a little too crickety to have to climb out of a car. So, the bottom line is, it's a cozy, reliable, safe, convenient, and pleasant place to stay in PR.

You are forced to back out of the alley onto a busy street.We had reserved what was supposed to be a renovated room (Like those on the website). The first room they showed us had broken tile on the floor, paint peeling in the bath, a tiny TV, and a window which would not close (not good for the bugs). The second room they gave us was even smaller (Think walk through the door and hit the foot of the bed) but in a bit better shape.Though we downgraded, we weren't offered a lower price or any apology. The showers were nothing more than a corner of the bathroom with a shower head covered by a curtain. It wasn't particularly clean or quiet. It was a bother to have to open a lock to get OUT of the place! The pool closed at 6 p.m. (when you'd like to get IN). Don't go by the website--we were surprised at the exaggerations. Not a wind chime in the place! But for the price we paid, about half of what we'd have paid at a large hotel, it was OK. Didn't feel particularly safe but not in danger, either. The staff was friendly. I saw that you should make VERY CLEAR what kind of room you want and be ready to accept the bare bones.

All of the hotels and condos were booked so we couldn't find anything and this was the only place that had any vacancy. Lucky for us, or else we would have never known about this place. The hotel is small, quaint and cozy. So if you like those big crowded resorts, this is not the hotel for you! The atmosphere is permeated with a rich incense smell that gives it an even more homey feel. In fact, it feels just like a big house, with its personal touches of art and those quirky turtle shaped lights on the steps. We got the junior suite that had its own terrace and made us feel like we had our own wing. It was not fancy by any means, with its wicker furniture and basic amenities, but it was clean and comfortable. The decor was bright and tropical, and the art reflected the local flavor. The staff was very helpful, especially when I needed new linens at 3 am, thanks to my son, they really took good care of me. My old linens were taken by housekeeping early the next morning, from where I had laid them to dry on the terrace. We had a nice visit with some friends on that terrace and it felt like we were at home. The pool, albeit small, felt like our very own pool. It wasn't crowded with rowdy children; in fact we were the rowdy ones in comparison to the quiet sunbathers and novel-reading sun lovers. The courtyard is adorable and really added to the bed-and-breakfast feel of the small quaint inn. The only downside is the lack of parking and the difficulty in getting in when you first arrive but that is for our own safety, so I could deal with that. Plus it's close to town where we could walk and get anything we needed. We did our laundry and picked up some odds and ends. It was close to Bebo's, where you could have a nice, affordable sit down meal. It was close to anything you needed, really. I preferred walking as parking was at such a premium, once I found a spot, I didn't want to move my car. However, the area was very secure and the car was safe. We loved it here so much that we are going back on our return visit in October. No matter what, we said, we had to get in at least one night at The Wind Chimes.

Secondly, it is a very pokey hotel and the staff seem very wary of you having a look around. I asked if I could have a look around and the resopnse was \"why do you want to look around the hotel?\".

We came from Chicago with our 2 children (10 and 16) and the staff gave us a great rate on two rooms (one queen bed one with two double beds) for staying the whole 9 days there. The rooms are small but clean and comfortable. They certainly weren't fancy, but quite reasonable and the beds very comfortable. The original art in the rooms is also a very nice touch. The location was excellent. It was convenient to the beach (1/2 block from a great section of Condado beach which was never very crowded with great soft sand and warm and inviting water) as well as only a short walk to a 24 hour grocery store (we kept a small fridge in our room for fruit, water, and snacks - at a small additional fee). It also had excellent access to the highways and busses. We rented a car for a week of the trip, and although they were out of reserved parking spaces we usually could find a spot to park on one of the two blocks next to the hotel, and never felt any security problem parking there. The small pool was very calm and relaxing, and despite its small size was great for us as we were the only people using it on every occasion but one. They also have several small decks for lounging and some nice plants and a charming deck with a number of wind chimes. They also have a nice bar which also serves breakfast and lunch/dinner plates. But more than the nice rooms and charming and relaxing atmosphere, it is the staff at the Wind Chimes that truly deserves credit. The people at Wind Chimes are friendly and helpful at every moment. They are extremely conscientious and would always provide guidance with places to go, directions to get there, and help you organize your travels. From restaurants to tours, towels to postcards, there was never an unmet need or an unhelpful staff person. From the moment we entered the hotel we felt at ease and at home. They really show you the true meaning of Puerto Rican hospitality. Clearly this is the not the spot to go if you looking for one of the fancy hotels with luxury spotless rooms and a casino in the lobby. However if you are looking to stay at a really convenient place with a wonderful and welcoming staff, a relaxing and refreshing atmosphere, at a very reasonable value, then this is a great place.

Its the kind of hotel where nothing is spectacular but everything is just right, especially the staff - they helped us with excellent restaurant recommendations and taxi service every day. BTW, we were hooked on the tapas bar at the Hotel Convento in Old San Juan. If you go, say hi to Rafi the bartender and get him to set you up with a few of his signature mojitos - you'll be glad you did.", "Date": "March 9, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Durham, NH", "Title": "\u201cGreat location in a safe residential neighborhood.\u201d", "Author": "Adams", "ReviewID": "UR1683514", "Content": "The inn is like a garden apartment in a residential neighboorhood. Lots of places to relax. Easy access if you want to sight see. A car is nice but public busses are just fine. Driving is okay everywhere but Old San Juan and during rush hour. Bring your own shampoo and hairdryer and request the larger rooms ( King suites) for a little more money you have a fridge and microwave and two rooms. Very helpful staff and great small personal tours with Paul . We stayed at another place for twice the price and didn't enjoy it as much as windchimes.

We loved this Inn. The staff were so friendly and went the extra mile to work out our requests. We had an unusual parking situation which they bent over backwards to accomodate. We also had laundry we needed cleaned before our cruise and for $20 had everything done by that same afternoon. The Boat Bar was a great place to hang out during the day or evening. It sits in a kind of courtyard area where the seats at the bar are protected but just behind you is open to the sky. We loved sitting there during lunch as it rained for a brief period...very cozy. The food at the bar was good and the drinks excellent. We didn't use the pool as we were not in the mood, but the beach is only a block away and very nice. Our room was large with a king size bed and a nice size bathroom with a large walk-in shower. I noticed a few comments about the hot water, but we had no problem at all taking hot showers. There are a number of nice eating places nearby, from local cuisine to American fare. Shopping is available too within walking distance. We intend to stay here again. It is the perfect place to fly into a few days early before a cruise as it sits between the airport and on the way to the cruise ships.

What a marvelous find! First of all, let me say that if you want the Hilton or meaningless glitz, go somewhere else. I happen to love small inns and this one was just marvelous. Yes, the rooms are small, but the whole place is small! Big deal. It is very clean, brightly decorated with original artwork, and the staff is exceptional. It is right on the street, so you do hear traffic, but I live in New York, so that was normal! The Boat Bar, their little bar/restaurant is wonderful - if the weather is bad, or you don't want to go out, you can just eat in. There are all sorts of lovely touches, including that if you want to leave your luggage there after check-out and zip down to the beach, you can do that and then come back for a quick shower before leaving for the airport. The inn is between two strips of fancy hotels, so the beach is less crowded. Bus to Old San Juan is two blocks away, and it's 25c. Is this a five-star hotel? No - but they deserve a 5-star review.

It had saltillo tiled floors and cherry yellow floral and pale blue accents. The pool was small but had a nice little waterfall. My daughter's room was above the back of the Inn. It waas a little smaller but had a large sun porch with comfortable furniture. The boat bar was a big hit with everyone and staffed by a very pleasant young lady. The Windchimes is very clean with spotless white walls. The was a very welcoming scent throughout the lobby from either candles or incense.
