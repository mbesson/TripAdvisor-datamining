We had plenty of space in our double-queen room with refrigerator & microwave. It was very clean, freshly painted, clean carpeting, NO BUGS, (we pulled the sheets back & checked), thin towels, new sheets & blankets, comfortable mattresses. We all slept well each night. The continental breakfasts were quite adequate consisting of yogurt, sweet rolls, apples, bananas, oranges & good coffee and we all had our fill. All of the staff was quite helpful in giving us directions and tourist tips. They were friendly to us. My mom says \"to have friends you must show yourself friendly\". It works both ways. I can hardly believe these negative comments I read. I am not sure what people expected from a NOT 5 star establishment, but perhaps they should have gone across the street to the Hilton and paid 4 or 5 times what these rooms cost. For the price, (and for someone who travels all over the world), this place was very adequate with everything we needed. The best part of all, THE LOCATION, with the subway-transit system only a few blocks across the street which very cheaply took us right to the Rose Bowl stadium. It also connected with a line to get one of us to the LAX airport quickly & cheaply. No traffic snarls! I think we got the last parking spot and it was free, so we were thankful & not complaining! We will be driving a subcompact this year so it should fit ok. Two of us plan to stay here again because our beloved Oregon Ducks are in the 2012 Rose Bowl again!

I decided to drive them down. I picked this hotel which was a good price with close proximity to the park. What a great choice. While the two other hotels are known for their reputation, this little hotel was clean, offered eateries within a few steps and a great price. While its' not the Sheraton, it has clean bedding and a nice staff. There are only two problems and I wouldn't consider them complaints but just one thing that can be worked on and the other can't be just because it can't. The one that can be worked on would be to upgrade their towels. They are older and more than well used (actually one was torn) but they were clean and they were just towels (again, not the Sheraton). The other can't be worked on because at one point this particular issue didn't matter and now that people like me with larger vehicles come in and it's a problem. That would be the parking. A very small amount of parking and mainly for smaller cars. I have a suburban and had the luxury of parking next to a truck that had taken two parking spots and so, I took advantage of that and used just a little of that unusued spot that he had taken up. The problem was in dealing with another \"monster\" truck who came in late or was visiting and blocked in about four spots in the early morning hours. It wasn't my car blocked but I felt sorry for those that did because I guess they needed to leave and didn't know what to do. In any case, this is a nice little motel that I would visit again. If you can overlook the parking and the worn towels, you have a bargain hotel for a place that is within reasonable walking distance of University Studios.", "Date": "October 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lake Hughes, California", "Title": "\u201cLawsuit waiting to happen\u201d", "Author": "dazzll", "ReviewID": "UR78420105", "Content": "Booked this hotel because of the location and they had a jetted tub.

I grew up there so i am familiar with the area. We settled for this hotel after spending a couple of hours of going around to several hotels in Studio City and in Hollywood. All were either sold out or too expensive for our budget. We came across this hotel as our last one and we were going to take it if it was cheap enough. After talking to the lady at the front desk she told me that he had only 1 room left and it was a smoking room. After getting the approval to stay here from my wife we got the last room. We got our key and went to our room. In order to get to the room you had to unlock a gate that led upstairs where there was only 2 rooms. I like the fact that at least we were secure up there away from everyone else. As we walked in, it didnt smell very much like a smoking room so that was good. The floor was old and dirty and sticky at some points. I never walked on it without shoes on. (my wife laughs at me since I'm extremely spoiled about hotels. Ive spent my entire life staying at Four Seasons hotels. So when i have to stay somewhere that isnt Four Seasons, I'm beyond picky) I checked the bed sheets as soon as i walked in and could tell that they were clean. then i checked the bathroom and that was very clean also. the only think that didnt look very clean was the towels. Luckily I thought about bringing a towel from home. After getting changed, my wife and I went out to dinner. When we came back, parking was a nightmare. Its not the hotels fault as much as it is the people staying there that cant park a car in a space if their life depended on it. We went back out to the room and went to bed. The bed was stiff as a board but we were so tired that we didnt care. The Air conditioner worked great. and the noise from it was like the best white noise machine out there. In there morning at least there was plenty of hot water in the shower. and by their 11 am check out time we were out the driveway.
