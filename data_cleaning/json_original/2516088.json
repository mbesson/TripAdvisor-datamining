He was most helpful, and had the information we needed. There is no description of the hotel property and amenities, I had to call for towels to my room, as there were three of us, and only two towels, and was rudely questioned as to whether or not I needed pool towels, as they did not provide them to rooms... (there were no pool towels, either...brrrrr!!) Another thing you don't learn until you get there, is that the pool is open to the public for a fee, so if you paid a lot of money to stay there, you are treated to rude locals with mis-appropriated senses of entitlement, and nowhere to sit, lounge, let alone swim without being treated to the spectacles of other people's ill-behaved children...I noticed that \"rules\" were more like suggestions. The property itself was nice, but seems to be the victim of people who just don't care...trash everywhere...loud people...cigarette smoke drifting...I will say that I was happy to not have a poolside room, due to noise, and blatant disrespect for \"quiet hours\", but it would have been nice to have chairs on my balcony as well....Pool bar was fun, if slow...and the food was average, and in my opinion, overpriced, with the exception of the grab-n-go breakfast ...I was happy for the grocery store across the street...The maintenance, housekeeping and bell-staff should be commended, because they are the only ones who live up to the hype of L.A.", "Date": "May 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cCharming, classic hotel in Studio City\u201d", "Author": "trinisteph", "ReviewID": "UR129252471", "Content": "If you are in the area for business or pleasure, this is a convenient location to get to anywhere in the East Valley (Sherman Oaks, Studio City, NoHo) and they have a free shuttle to Universal Studios.

It is like stepping back in time, you can imagine the greats of the silver screen staying here in their heyday. Now it is still a nice hotel but needs bringing back to it's former glory. The hotel is huge, with a large car park to match so no problem finding anywhere to park. The staff are really nice but on your way to your room you will see what I mean, the decor is dated as are the rooms with a 1970s feel. The rooms though are comfortable and clean, and our trip was one where we weren't spending any time in our room so it's wasn't like we were at all disappointed, but just to let you know what it's like so you know. We didn't use the restaurants at the hotel, they did seem a bit pricey, so we headed outside, walking down to Jerrys and also Twains, two diners very nearby One main advantage of the Sportsmens Lodge is the location, especially for Universal. The hotel offer a free shuttle to the park, all you need to do is tell them what time you want to go. You can also book the shuttle for later on, I think the latest one is 8.15pm, which we were going to get but found a good spot on City Walk at the Hard Rock Cafe so stayed for much longer and caught a cab! Also a good spot for the Warner Studio Tour, which is brilliant and along with Universal I would recommend. We drove to Warner in 10 minutes or so and drove into downtown LA in 20 minutes. Again, if you are staying here for a short period, then i would definitely recommend the Sportsmen Lodge and if the hotel owners decided to spend a siginicant amount of money on this place it would rise up and be great once again!", "Date": "April 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cRetro LA Vibe Near All the Hollywood Attractions\u201d", "Author": "SalsaPicante78", "ReviewID": "UR128595934", "Content": "I recently stayed at this hotel for business and I was pleasantly surprised.

There are also quite a few things within walking distance, including restaurantsand shopping. The vibe is definitely old Hollywood and it works.

We were in the LA area to make a delivery, and figured we would stay the night and have some fun in the big city. The Sportsmen's is close to many great restaurants and bars on Ventura Blvd, so we didn't have to travel far. We enjoyed a lovely meal at Ahi Sushi the next block over, and had great cadillac margaritas at MexiCali a few blocks down the other way. Yes, the hotel is older and slightly warn, but the place has a great funky vibe going on. The lobby bar was only open in the evening, but we enjoyed great company with our fellow travelers over delicious mai tais and conversation about LA and Studio City. We had such a great day at the Sportsmen's, we decided to stay another night and soak up more of the city. The hotel is conveniently located with many restaurants, bars and shops within a few blocks. There's a grocery store across the street for those forgotten items, and it's just a few blocks off the freeway, making it very convenient. There was a some type of movie being filmed when we first got there, but in no way did we feel it distracted from the common areas of the hotel. The second night there was a huge class reunion party in the gardens by the pool, but the kids were having a great time, and quite frankly the noise of their revelry was downright cheerful. The staff we dealt with at check-in and other times were all very helpful and pleasant. When we initially checked in, the gentleman at the front desk asked if we had a AAA card, and he was able to give us a great discount with our card. He didn't have to do that!

Long story short, I drove from San Diego for over 2 hours with my 3 year old daughter to surprise my husband for his 40th birthday. His company is located in this area, knowing that many of his colleagues stay at this hotel I booked a room for one night. At roughly 11pm the nightmare began. The room next to us became increasing loud and obnoxious as the night went on. From loud laughing, yelling and talking to finally sex that became so loud anyone walking by within earshot would have been able to hear it. I called the front desk a total of 3 times starting at 11pm to voice my concerns. I was told they would call the room and \u201ctake care of it.\u201d Working in the hotel industry myself in the past (Westin Hotels) I know the importance of customer satisfaction as the customer is PAYING for a night away to get peace and quiet and most importantly, sleep! Something my family was NOT afforded last night at your establishment. After 3 phone calls to the front desk I was offered a room change at 1am. Let my say for common sense purposes that option was NOT possible. My 3 year old daughter was finally asleep after all the noise that kept her up. At that point changing rooms would not have been feasible. I want to be reimbursed for this nightmare of a \u201ctrip\u2019 to your hotel. In essence, I paid to be kept up ALL night by ignorant guests at your hotel. What is more disturbing is the lack of pure good judgment on the part of your employees who told me \u201cwe will take of it\u201d then the manager \u201cI would like you to calm down\u201d offering me a 25% discount.

As previously stated, your hotel is where most of them stay when here on business. I am expecting someone to get back to me regarding this letter ASAP. My sister is a journalist for the local paper and I would not want to have to get the local media involved as it would severely DETER guests from ever staying at your hotel again. My experience and being offered a 25% discount in short, NOT ACCEPTABLE.

While I tend to stay at 4 or 5 star hotels, my son is comfortable at a Motel 6, and so I prepared myself for a $129 (cost of room) Los Angeles experience. The lobby was neat, clean and comfy with a round, surround fireplace providing a nice holiday feeling. Service was immediate and I had my room key in about 2 minutes. The room was a bit of a walk past the pool, but not too far to walk with light baggage. The room itself was very comfortable, certainly large enough and the balcony had a nice view of the pool. There was enough room on the balcony for two chairs, though only one was provided. As a cigar smoker, I was disappointed that you could not smoke on the balcony. On the other hand, I am sure this will please some non-smokers. The room had a decent set of amenities and was very clean. The lobby bar was friendly and the drinks very reasonably priced. The bartender (either Joe or Jim ... I forget) has been at the hotel for 29 years and has a few celebrity stories. This hotel (or motel might be more exact) is a favorite of rock bands but it has a quiet and graceful demeanor. Several sports stars stay there as well.The walls are lined with photos of movie stars, mostly from the '40's- '60's. I don't know if they ever stayed there, but I would not be surprised if they did. Checkout was as fast as check in and, as I was leaving, a staff member pointed out that I had not taken advantage of the free continental breakfast (a car was waiting for me). It is that type of personal touch that makes this a very comfortable and enjoyable stay. My only one disappointment turned into a positive experience; the, what would be called in other hotels a \"business center\" had two computers attached to a cash / credit card machine. In order to use the computers you had to pay. The charge was a minimum $3 but the computer was so slow that it would be easy to consume that time long before you got your passes. Not that $3 is a lot but then to have to wait was frustrating. In the end, the machine would not print and so, after waiting and paying, I still did not have my boarding passes. The front desk apologized, explained that the computer is owned by another company (there is a phone next to the computer with the phone number of that company) and that he could not fix that. On the other hand, he quickly offered to print them out at his station and apologized again for the inconvenience. I would surmise that if you asked them to print out your boarding pass without bothering to use the pay computers, they would. This is that type of place.", "Date": "December 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Rosa", "Title": "\u201cGood deal in heart of LA\u201d", "Author": "KathsGottaGo", "ReviewID": "UR121577273", "Content": "My sister lives in Sherman Oaks and recommended this hotel.

This was Los Angeles, a major metropolis. There was a huge levee in back of the hotel, condos, apartments, grocery strip mall, telephone wires.

It was hard to find a chair to sit in and the pool was crowded, nothing relaxing about that. The service was awful, the waitress was not only slow but couldn't understand our food or drink order.

That was only Saturday! On Sunday morning we decided we would eat in the cafe, food was ok but again 2 hours to get food and there were only two other tables in our area. We started our day early, by 10am the pool was filled with what we named \"the bracelet people\" again no place to sit and no towels. We were there for a wedding so we all together had about 15 rooms. We were also told the hotel was sold out, so why would you have public swimming at your pool when your hotel is sold out and no where for your paying guests to relax or swim. We had one table and two lounge chairs between 20 of us because there was no other place to sit, we had to alternate who sat and who stood. We even had a person come sit in the middle of our group! I had two rooms in the hotel and that is not what I paid for! In all my years of traveling (34 yrs) I have never seen anything like this! On Monday morning we checkout early and ate breakfast elsewhere. Your hotel is poorly managed! I would have put a sign up a month before that the pool would not be open to the public that weekend because the hotel was full. I think if it was not for the convenience of the banquet hall next door you would not have the amount of guests staying in your hotel. I know that when I come out again and it is for a wedding there, I will not stay at your hotel. I will drive the extra time it takes to stay elsewhere. When we checked out we were asked how was the wedding, we said \"great\". And then we were asked how was our stay and we said \"Not so great\", we were never asked why it was not great and what was wrong with our stay. Again poor management!

The pool was heated and they did provide hair dryers in the room. The bed was very comfortable and the decor in the room was suitable. Lobby and hallway decor made the hotel feel very dated and I felt like I was in 1960's Hollywood. The conference room was pretty and the other grounds (which I didn't know existed until I went to the conference room) were very picturesque. They have very nice waterfalls and streams which seems separated from the main hotel and like a completely different place. We did eat in the hotel restaurant. The food was very tasty but the wait was just unacceptable. Our conference broke for lunch and we had an hour and fifteen minutes to eat. For the first fifteen minutes we didn't even get menus and after getting menus it took another fifteen to twenty minutes to place an order. The food is cooked to order, but considering we ordered hamburgers, it took about half an hour to get two burgers. Needless to say we came back late from lunch. The doors slam very loudly so when you're sleeping, you might awaken to these loud slams and in the morning, if you want to sleep in, it would be difficult to do so because you can hear the plumbing through the walls when everyone was taking a shower.

LA turned on some nice warm weather for us! We were especially pleased when all we had heard prior to leaving that LA gets a lot of rain in February! Rain it did not, which was nice. We took the Prime Time Shuttle from LAX to our hotel. Was very efficient and we even got a \"free\" tour of Hollywood as the driver took a different route to Studio City so we could see some sights as we were the last to be dropped off. Upon arriving at the hotel we thought it looked rather nice. It has a huge car park and lovely gardens/trees. It is located across the road from Ralph's which was handy for groceries and there is also a coffee shop across the road, as well as a petrol/gas station at the end of the street. All of this about a 2-3 min walk from the hotel, depending on how fast you walk! There are many shops and boutiques along Ventura Blvd with something for most ages. The Sherman Oaks fashion mall isn't too far down Ventura either. The hotel's interior was old, but nice. It had a timeless kind of feel to it with all the pictures on the walls of old Hollywood actors and film-makers. The check-in staff were nice and helpful. We were helped with our bags as soon as we arrived so we didn't have to personally lug them to our room. A man by the name of 'Justino' was especially helpful and happy to help with anything we needed. He took our bags to our room for us and was very thorough with explaining everything. The lobby has an open fire, couches, bar, hair salon and business centre. We didn't use the internet though as our friends staying at the hotel had a laptop. The restaurant (Patio Cafe) is cute and decked out in all old-fashioned seats and tables. You feel like your in an old-time movie. The food was FABULOUS for reasonable prices and was able to be taken back to the room. The bathroom was squashy, but seemed to be OK for just the two of us. The shower was hard to work out at first, but I guess that's because we aren't from the United States! The TV had MANY, MANY channels which we enjoyed and had plenty of pay movies which are either old, classic, in cinemas or just released on DVD. The beds were the most comfortable I have ever slept on and the pillows were amazing! I wanted to take one for myself! ;-) hehe Sleep was interrupted one night (we were on the 2nd floor). Kids were very noisy and a bus was parked outside the hotel with it's engine running which seemed to go on ALL night! We asked to move to the 5th floor, and the staff gladly helped us with that the next day. They also provide free wake-up calls!! We were pleased to see a table and chairs with an extra lamp in the room and got a \"Welcome to LA\" book to read. There is cupboard and drawer space and a nice lil balcony with a nice view of the mountains. Not sure if it was Laurel Canyon that we were looking at??? Downsides: -One elevator was out-of-service for the duration of our stay making it slower to get to and from the bottom of the hotel/lobby -Front desk people said there was no other way to get to Warner Bros studios apart from taking one of their private cars (Over $100 just to Burbank one way!!!) We ended up using public buses and got there for $5 return trip each!!!!!!!! Always explore all transport options! There is always more than one way!!! -Chemicals in the pool & spa were VERY strong, I'm guessing because of the large size of the pool. If your kids have sensitive skin I would just be wary of that. (But they should be fine because a little girl with severe skin problems went in the pool and she seemed to be OK surprisingly. But the kids did smell of chemicals when they got out. So there are pros and cons to the pool which is a great size though and can fit something like 150 people) -Noisy kids in the room next to us and people constantly slamming doors! -The perv looking down on the kids in the swimming pool one morning from the 4th floor. This is LA, watch your children!!! Apart from these few gripes, we liked the hotel and would probably stay here again. But not for long term. You can get better value elsewhere.

The rooms appeared to have had a recent makeover. Furniture and carpet were in good condition, the bed had an extremely comfortable pillow-top mattress, and the bathroom was lacking the grout stains or smeared caulk that you see in truly run-down hotels. Each room had a nice porch area with chairs and a small table (the hand rail desperately needed painting, however). Overall, a great value at our $95/night rate. One aspect of the hotel that really stood out was that it is located in a nice neighborhood, rather than alongside a busy highway (although the highways are only a few blocks away). Ventura Blvd. around the hotel was fun to walk upon arrival. There are loads of shops, restaurants, wine bars, coffee shops, etc. The hotel cafe was fine for breakfast, but we were really pleased with the 24-hour deli/diner (Jerry's?) a half block down Ventura Blvd. for breakfast and late dinners/snacks. An Italian restaurant across the street (Risotto's) also deserves mentioning for very good fine dining. The supermarket across the street (Ralph's) served as our tailgate headquarters (we were going to the nat'l championship football game) and had everything we needed except a crying towel. A Starbucks is also just across the street and a Pete's coffee about two blocks down Ventura Blvd.. The olympic size pool surrounded by the courtyard was a big surprise and made me wish it weren't January. The most serious complaint that I had was not being allowed to use the luggage cart at check-in or checkout. We had to unload a Ford Expedition that was filled to the ceiling with all seats folded down for full cargo capacity. The cart really would have helped. We were told its use by guests was prohibited by their insurance company, but I think they should talk to their insurance carrier, or maybe another one. I haven't heard of a wave of luggage cart litigation gripping the country. I would have spent $40 on bellhop tips getting all that gear unloaded and later reloaded into car.

The elevator that was broken had been broken for over month (see other reviews to confirm this). There was a sign on the door of the elevator that it was temporarily out of order. This is dishonesty. We were there on an off week. There were very few cars there when we came back to our room late at night, yet they charged us $10 a night to park, something that should have been waived during this period. They were skimpy with soap (i bar), quality of towels, shower cap,etc. We are sad, as we really looked forward to staying at this unusual place. Housekeeping was not a problem. The breakfasts that we had in the restaurant were just fine, but the service varied according to waitress. One lovely young lady (whose first name begins with a V) was so nice that we would walk in and ask her which tables she was serving, and we would sit there.

The remote wasn't bolted to the nightstand which was also nice. The sliding glass door leading to the balcony had sheer curtains as well as black-out curtains. The first light source when entering the room was very near the door (not in the middle of the room like some hotels I've stayed at). The room came with an iron, ironing board, hair dryer, coffee pot, coffee and tea bags, ice bucket and liner, 6 shirt hangers and 6 pant hangers, suitcase holder, an extra blanket, a desk, two chairs, a vanity outside the bathroom (no chair), and a mini-fridge. The switch for the lamps on the nighstands were on the lamps themselves (I've stayed in hotels where I had to get out of bed to turn off the nightstand lamp), There was a recycling container for paper, cans, and bottles (nice touch!). There is a card for breakfast service that you hang on the doorknob. There is a \"do-not-disturb\" sign you can hang on the doorknob (Yes - I have actually stayed somewhere that did not have \"do-not-disturb signs!). There is a back entrance that you can access with your room key (which is near the elevator and much closer to the parking lot). The wi-fi service is an additional $10 for 24 hours. The bathroom did not have a fan or a window. There was a vent over the shower but it did not have a motor. There were only two large bath towels (I'm used to four). There was only one bar of soap (instead of one for the sink and one for the shower). My biggest complaint, however, is regarding the shuttle service to Universal Studios. The current driver is consistently late leaving the hotel for the park and leaves the park early when bringing guests back to the hotel. The driver is required to write down a return time from the park (there are only 3 to choose from) for each guest he brings to the park. I chose 5 PM. I arrived at the pickup spot at 4:50. I waited until 5:15 to call the hotel because the driver never showed and I was told that he had already completed his 5 PM pickup. Then I was put on hold while they \"tracked him down\" but he couldn't be found. The hotel took my number and said they would call me back as soon as they found the driver. I decided to just take a cab. I was already back at the hotel by the time the front desk called me back. The shuttle service was the main requirement when I was researching hotels, so for this to be the subject of my biggest complaint is very disappointing. Like the title of my review states, don't stay here if you plan on using the shuttle to Universal Studios. Note: My reservation confirmation stated that parking was $10 per night. I was not charged parking for my stay, but I do not know if it was because it was comped due to the shuttle service incident, so if I were you I would call the hotel directly. I would only recommend this hotel to a friend if I could also warn them of the shuttle service, wi-fi fee, and lack of a bathroom window/vent.", "Date": "November 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cVery nice affordable hotel, located perfectly...\u201d", "Author": "MacJedi27", "ReviewID": "UR48228230", "Content": "As affordable goes, it was a wonderful hotel.

It was the biggest room of three hotels we stayed at on our California trip, so that was nice. The old A/C unit takes some time to get going. The sign on the patio door about locking it twice was a little unnerving, but we did so. The bathroom was standard. Front counter staff was average. No real complaints, but nothing special or fancy. This is an old place which I love for the history, but we didn't spend much time here except to sleep. The bed was quite stiff, but the linens were soft. $9.95 for a day of internet service, so another nickel-and-dime tactic. Our room was spotlessly clean, and though the room and especially the hallway has an \"old\" smell, it's an old place, so I can't complain. Good central location to many attractions, Ventura is lined with plenty of restaurants and shopping, but I think for the price I should have gotten something in Universal City instead; something that had parking and internet included in the room cost, perhaps. One thing we really loved was our late-night walk to Twains restaurant just down the street (same side). It was fantastic. No-frills, delicious diner food, I believe open 24-hours, and for $10 a piece we had the most jambalaya, spaghetti and meatballs, mashed potatoes, garlic toast and chicken-fried steak we could possibly eat.

It's the kind of thing where you keep telling yourself, \"This is insane!\" I paid $200 per night for what I thought would be a quiet night in a convenient location near where I was conducting some business. Instead I ended up in front row seats FOR THREE HOURS to a series of poolside singers - none of whom were very good. The room was nonsmoking but smelled like cigarettes, although that happens at a lot of hotels. There was one good part to the stay - after we realized we were \"stuck\" in that room - we laughed a lot since the singing was comical - especially the one who sounded like he was from The Godfather and sang \"O Solo Mio\" really LOUD.
