Reception was a bit of a problem as people who phoned for me were told I was not there, and someone left a message three times but I never got it.

From the concierge who greeted us, to the 5 or 6 times we needed something we forgot to pack, the staff was standing by to serve us. The entrance to the hotel captures the essence of NYC with their modern design and nightclub adjacent to hotel lobby. Checking-in was handled in 2 minutes at most as opposed to under-staffed front desks which make you wait on-line as they are on the phone. Our room was simply MAGNIFICENT, and I urge any couple who is staying here to upgrade to the \"King with soaking tub.\" The view we had on the 15th floor was amazing and having a skyline view in the shower plus a balcony made it worthwhile. The layout of the room was great with a contemporary couch and coffee table set-aside from the plush King-size bed (which was very comfortable). We didn't use the bath, but the rest of the bathroom was spacious as there were something like 8 different mirrors and more than enough towels available. (which is an area where most hotels fall short) I can't get over how fast the room-service was. The breakfast was brought up 15 floors in less than 10 minutes. I was impressed by how great the coffee tasted and the blueberry pancakes were \"out of this world.\" It was very convenient to have the nightclub right next-door. After dinner we took advantage of this and it was just great to be able to have a few drinks in a club rather than an average hotel bar. We checked out about 1 hour after check-out time and the staff was not pushy in this regard. We were also accommodated by them allowing us to keep our bags in the hotel until 6:00pm, 6 hours after checkout. What more can I say?

It would be nice if the bellhop would show this to new guests. Then, the service was slow to nonexistant. Our refrigerator stopped working, and the staff said no one could fix it until late the next morning. They did put some food we had bought in the hotel kitchen refrigerator. The second day our room was still not made up when we returned late in the day. As we were waiting in the hotel lobby for our room to be cleaned, we were greeted by the new general manager, Marcanthony. He listened to our complaints, said he would take care of things, and comped us breakfast for the next morning (which was delicious, by the way). After that, everything improved 100 percent. Service was immediate, our refrigerator was fixed, and we set about really enjoying the hotel. The beds have temper pedic mattresses, which are wonderful. My daughter's favorite thing is the steam shower room, and there is a huge tub as well. The room is spacious. As for the street noise, there is some. We were on the third floor.

My room was a corner king with great views - both out of and in to the room. The bathroom and shower had a glassed exterior wall - that is definitely not for everyone. There was a huge (think small car) soaking tub that was outstanding. Actually OUTSTANDING. I'm not a black bathroom fan - particularly in hotels. How clean or unclean it might be is anyone's guess. I was disturbed that the two bottles of water in the bathroom (for which there is a charge) had broken seals and were probably refilled by the previous occupant. The finishes were largely inexpensive and starting to show wear. Security is LIGHT. Anyone could walk in from the street into the elevator unquestioned and onto any room floor (as my husband and a friend did on separate occasions). When you consider the neighborhood,i find that a concern. I wasn't cool enough to learn the lights, locks, etc. quickly - but I did. Sounds unappealing - but there are great things too to be fair. I found the front desk quick sharp and helpful - true, no offer to help with the bags, but they handled checking in and checking out more efficiently than some of the 5 star hotels I've been in. Room service for dinner and breakfast is FANTASTIC and QUICK and I found the prices very fair for the quality of the food. Servers were inexperienced but very attentive, helpful and caring and refreshing in their want to please attitude. We ran up quite a bill because we liked the food so much and ordered several times in less than two days. Lots of wine, beverage and snack choices in the not overly cooled \"mini\" bar, including an assortment of menu appropriate half bottles. The fridge is a lot larger than \"mini.\" Note: their kitchen does not provide lunch - they send out to local places as indicated on their menu. Didn't try that.

The views from the room were absolutely fantastic, we could see across the whole city. The room was so bright with lovely furnishings and the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. We loved the shower - nice to be able to see the NY skyline while washing your hair. The hotel sent us a bottle of wine to make up for the room change, this was a nice touch. We loved the space in the room, a total change from the normal tiny NY hotel rooms. We also loved the location of the hotel, refreshing to be away from the total tourist hot spots. Lots of bars and restaurants nearby and a real buzz about the place. We had dinner in the hotel restaurant (Co-op) and have to say it was one of the best meals we have ever had.

Room - Balcony room on the 19th floor. Views fantastic.

After much research on here and reading the good and not so good reviews I decided to take my chances and book it anyway. We booked a high floor corner king with balcony. Before our trip I emailed the hotel and asked to ensure that our room was north facing (i.e. with a view of the Empire State Building) and received a response to say this had been added to my reservation and if there was anything else they could do to please get in touch. Lovely. We arrived a couple of hours early and even though our room wasn't ready yet the doormen took our bags straight from us and gladly stored them and assured us that as soon as we checked in they would bring them right up. The hotel reception staff rang us as soon as it was ready (which was before the 4pm check in time). Check in was smooth and pleasant and I found all the reception staff that we dealt with during the stay helpful, and friendly. The reception area, the lobby and the lifts are all very funky which we liked. Doormen always around although sometimes they are a tad frosty but never rude. Security guy on a weekend plus the added security of needing to use your room key to access the lifts and stairwells after a certain time at night. Makes for a very safe feeling. One of my downfalls - when we got to our room on the 12th floor which was very spacious, big tempur bed was heavenly, large bathroom with a fabulous shower, a little lounge area and a decent sized closet - it had a DOWTOWN VIEW! My fiancee popped down to reception to mention that we'd requested a north facing room only to be told that THE ONLY ROOMS THAT FACE NORTH WITH AN UPTOWN VIEW ARE SUITES!! Unfortunately it doesn't say this on the website so be warned people!!!!! Nontheless we still had a lovely view of the bridges and it was stunning to see the sun rise over them in the morning. I wouldn't have bothered with a balcony had i seen it beforehand, it wasn't anything to write home about, you couldn't sit out on it or anything. We still really enjoyed the stay, lighting was never a problem - bright sunshine in the day from two walls of windows and plenty of light in the room and bathroom at night, i think people who have had a previous issue with low lighting don't realise there are dimmers on the light switches. Didn't hear a peep of noise from our room other than usual city noise of sirens and the odd car honk. The hotel bar was wonderful - good strong drinks, albeit a little pricey but if you're going to any upmarket bar in Manhattan expect prices like these. Good music, didn't try the food but a nice mix of people and a wonderful guy on the door. I read online that they open the penthouse on a Sunday for a rooftop party - they don't - private events only. The area is great - loads of funky bars and restaurants a stones throw away and a subway just round the corner. Never felt unsafe, plenty of people wandering round at all hours and a real buzz to the nightlife. Spitzers Corner Bar, just a few steps up the street is great for people watching and the bar staff in there are great fun.

So, really not a big deal if you don't want to put in your contact lenses, or apply makeup. When you walk in off the street, the carpet is dirty. The carpet in the room is black, so good luck finding anything you drop that is also dark. I almost left a shoe there because it blended in with the carpet, and I had a black case that went to my iPad, but I couldn't find it--a combination of the low lighting and black carpet.

Spacious room - for the regular king room, there was a king size bed, a spacious \"living area\" with 2 sofas, coffee table and the bathroom was of a decent size too. 2. Good location - ridiculously near the Delancey/Essex subway station, and a decent walk to several restaurants at Lower East Side and the shops at Soho. There were several pubs and restaurants within the vicinity of Rivington, so there is always people around the streets. Pretty safe neighbourhood to walk about at night - there is no lack of food choices. 3. The hotel itself serves great brunch. Try Co-Op for brunch and this place transforms into a pretty happening bar at night. Cons: 1. There is a see-through window at the shower area, which we were not too comfortable about. 2. Although the hotel is rather new (built in early 2000), some of the places and furnishing shows wear and tear. But this is something I could live with. 3. As an Asian who is used to the wide array of amenities offered by Asian hotels, I was mildly disappointed when I found out that there was no toothbrush, bedroom slippers and cutlery in the room.

Perhaps more sad is that the bar and restaurant are now almost completely estranged from the hotel.

The new Co-op restaurant is a blatant attempt to entice the local population in, to the detriment of the hotel guests.

We booked a high floor king corner room with a Japanese Soaking ~Tub as a paid extra. What a mistake. The signs were there from the beginning - the famous bar downstairs was under renovation (and apparently had been for some time). Nowhere was this made clear on the website or even in the hotel. Staff at check in gave us no information about anything - breakfast, fitness center, check out times, hours of the smaller lounge bar. Eventually we found out that this opened at 6pm and headed downstairs to enjoy a cocktail, only to find a completely incompetent bartender who (at $15 a drink) was unable to offer us a menu, and unable to offer any suggestions when we asked him for house specials. We even had to tell him what the word refreshing meant. In the next fifteen minutes the hotel staff decided to carry out a building meeting in front of our very eyes (why this couldn't have been conducted outside of opening hours I don't know) before we witnessed check in staff and our bartender then descend upon the leftovers of a plate of food at another customer's table. In front of paying guests. The room was equally disgraceful - stained towels, loose tiles in the bathroom, no hotel information pack, no shampoo/shower gel in the bath area, nothing but a rubber plug in the bath which would dislodge with the slightest bit of movement, letting all the water out. The hairdryer was broken, insufficient cleaning had left clumps of hair on the armchairs completely ignored, and the general furnishings showed all the signs of scrimping and saving on the proprietors' part; furniture and units (probably from Ikea) that might have looked slick when first bought for the hotel's 2008 opening but only three years down the line look tacky and tired. We presented these compaints to the manager (after initial check-in staff were completely indifferent) and to be fair she accepted our compaints and offered to waiver the room fee for one night.

Check in was smooth and problem free, and I was given a room on the 16th Floor. With floor to ceiling windows, looking south, I had an amazing view, which only got better the next morning when the weather cleared up. A huge king bed with a Tempur Mattress was in the bedroom area, and there was a well stocked mini bar, desk, sofa and table, and plenty of closet space. I couldn't have asked for more! The bathroom was huge, and in all my years travelling, I've never had the bonus of a bathroom with a window, so an opening window next to the shower, and being able to admire the view was just out of this world. Cookies on turndown are a nice touch, and also not having to request the turndown service, it is automatic is even better. Free Wireless internet really makes a difference, I still don't get why some hotels charge! So, onto the bed. First time I've slept on a Tempur Mattress, and it was just amazing. First morning I woke up, I didn't want to leave. Onto that mini bar. Not really overpriced when compared to a bar price, but over priced if you compare it to a store. Plenty of space to put your own things in the mini bar too, so you can buy things locally to stock it up a bit more. The bathroom had both the shower with a view, and a huge japanese style soaking tub. Yeah, it takes a long time to fill up, but it's worth it just for the relaxation after a long day pounding the Manhattan streets. The floor to ceiling windows were amazing, and also I had a small balcony to walk out onto, maybe not the best in March, but perfect for taking some amazing photos of the view. The only annoyance with the room, (which I did get used to within a day), was that even though you had a black out curtain to block out the light from the main window, there was a frosted window in the bedroom to the shower area, which then, when it hit morning, let light into the room from the bathroom windows. The first night it annoyed me, and I found it bizarre, but then the second night it didn't bother me in the slightest. The hotel itself is great, the location in the Lower East Side is great for exploring the nearby area, East Village, Greenwich Village, and up to Union Square, all really within walking distance, plus you have a few subway lines around the corner to hop on and get you into Midtown for the normal NYC sightseeing.

So here is my trip: Arrived from the UK on a late flight so didn't get to the hotel until around 10.30pm i could instantly tell the hotel was about fun as Thor was buzzing (the restaurant / bar at street level), we were greeted by the 'door man' who was really friendly and took our luggage straight away). NOW here is a note to management - I hate uniforms, too stuffy, but i was slightly concerned that the 'door man' was really employed by the hotel and was a little concerned with leaving my bags on the street, no reflection on him as he was great, but maybe a badge or something? Headed to the first floor where the staff were friendly and check-in was quick and easy on to the room. Yes the corridors are dark (very dark), then i walked in to my room on the 18th floor and i realised why - THE VIEW is AMAZING - yes i'm shouting you walk in to this room and the lights of the NYC skyline are amazing! As for the room, very clean,very big, massive closet, big bed (mattress too firm for me, but that is just my preference), free wi-fi (I hate paying for wi-fi) then i walked in to my \"oversize corner bathroom with soaking tub\" OMG AMAZING - so half frosted glass and half clear glass with slate floors open shower - i just loved the space (they even provide candles in the bathroom). Now as for location - The area is a real \"locals\" area so if you want tourist NYC this is not the hotel for you, if you want to live and party like a new yorker it is for you!! Things to note: This is not a hotel to relax in, head here for the real NYC, head here to party and if you book a room below floor 15 on a weekend i expect you won't get much sleep!

The door staff were more interested in texting on their phones than opening the door for you - which they are paid to do. Customer service at the hotel desk lacked a little, I did at one point ask a staff member to fetch a taxi upon our departure. I was told it's a busy day and I would have to go down to do that myself. Having said that the actual hotel room was fantastic. Modern, fresh, and had the best bed I have ever slept in. I even checked the mattess as I was so impressed. FYI it was a Temper mattress - ads on tv talk about it being used by NASA in the past. The soaking tub was massive, and kind of felt guilty filling it up to the top using up so much water...! But it was lovely, candles and toiletries ready and waiting. There was also a walk in shower with floor to ceiling windows so you can shower whilst watching New York! (bottom half was frosted glass!!

On my most recent trip, together with my wife, we opted to stay in the Lower East Side. For those who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know Manhattan, the LES is a bit more gritty than other parts of town. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good 10-15 minute stroll from more bustling parts like Soho. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s considered an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcedgy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 part of NY, with plenty of thrift stores, antique & art galleries, cafes and fashion boutiques. If this is your thing then the Hotel on Rivington might be a good place to stay. By far and away the best thing about Hotel on Rivington are the views. If you get a room high enough (we had a corner king with balcony on the 18th floor and loved it) the views over Manhattan are spectacular. In fact waking up and seeing the sun rise of this part of New York is something to behold. The rooms are nice. General style is modern and decor is overall pretty slick. All rooms have floor to ceiling glass windows hence the great views of the city. There is plenty of wardrobe space and spacious room. The bathrooms are quite special with the floor to ceiling glass windows continuing into the shower (perhaps not great for the very shy). Our room also had a very large soaking tub, complete with candles and matches. The beds were extremely comfortable. A fantastic night sleep was had (this despite the relentless hustle and bustle of NY streets 18 floors below us). Breakfast was not the greatest I have ever had. The continental breakfast comprised bagels, toast with a choice of cream cheese or jam and fruit, but it was not very well organised. Likewise I was not overly impressed with the level of service - there was at least two occasions we asked for something to be done and it was totally ignored. A personal gripe of mine.

I told him I'd been doing that and suggested he go back and get the drinks. He didn't seem to find this a reasonable suggestion and so did so with bad grace. The doormen display the same attitude. The room service staff are a bit better, although they are let down by the food they deliver. It would seem reasonable that if you order some food that is what will arrive. Something else probably will. Something that isn't even on the menu on one occasion. And if the food should be hot, don't expect that it will be. And if you don't order a wake up call in the early hours, don't assume you you won't receive one. On realising the caller has called the wrong room, don't expect an apology either. Expect him to laugh instead. Don't expect the furniture to be clean either. It's in an interesting part of town but the hotel's a triumph of slightly dated style over substance.

To my surprise so were the hallways on the floor were my room was located. I actually had to use my Iphone to provide extra light to gain access to my room. If you have poor night vision, I'd recommend bringing a flashlight with you if you're going to stay here. The room is fantastic! Large by NYC hotel standards with floor to ceiling windows. I would think the view would be amazing, but, unfortunately, the corner room I requested was below the 12th floor and I looked onto the roof tops of the buildings below and a limited skyline of NYC.

While the position is simply stunning (you gotta love the Lower East Side!) and the roomas are great, the customer service of the hotel is poor to say the least. The problems are the following: 1) the reception NOT being on the ground floor 2) the unfriendliness of the the doormen 3) the awful bar on the ground floor 4) the breakfast and waiters So here's my experience. The staff at the front desk is polite. I asked for a different room, even offering to pay more, but they gave me a free upgrade. Besides this, even though I stayed for a full week, their attitude wasn't anywhere close to \"friendly\". Also, no one takes your suitcases upstairs, when you get to the hotel. Which I find rather odd considering the price of the rooms, not very far from those of the most famous 5 star Manhattan hotels such as The Plaza or The Pierre. 1) so, the fact the front desk isn't on the ground floor means the doormen are perfectly unguarded and can act how they see fit. If you need to go to the airport, they will try to get you in a \"private car\" (not a cab, or a black car) that'll take you there. And the minute you say you'd rather take a cab (especially if you're a woman travelling by herself) they'll start being seriously rude and basically, insisting you do what they say. I don't know what's up with that. I found it most unpleasant. 2) the bar, The Feast I think it's called, gets seriously crowded on weekends, to the point that if you get back at 3 am you have a hard time getting to the elevator. Also, depening on your personal taste you might find the crowd terrible. It's mostly drunk twenty year olds. The music? Super loud dance tunes. The good thing is that if your room floor is high enough (I was at the 7th) you won't be bothered at all. 3) the breakfast id BAD. Especially if you are in for a long stay like I was. They basically have only bagels, boxed cream cheese and a few croissants. If you want orange juice you have to ask for it: it's free, but you still have to ask for it and the waiters barely speak any english (though most of them are pretty nice). What's preyy annoying, though, is the \"a la carte\" service: the choices are quite limited, but most of all the dishes come after 20 minutes you ordered and won't respect your order. I asked thrice for running yolks eggs and three times I got them hard boiled (I eventually sent them back, the third time). On the bright side, and to be fair, I must say that the rooms and large, well furnished and extra-clean. For one, the maids are precise - even if they still knock even if there's a \"do not disturb\" sign.

Putting reception on the second floor seems daft. The whole layout of this hotel is odd as the ground floor bar/club/restaurant takes presidence and the hotel seems to be an after thought stacked on top. 2. Getting guaranteed great views of Manhatten is hit or miss. Even if you book a Suite. The Suites are badly designed ( bathrooms being located in the middle of the suites thus breaking up the flow of the rooms,making them feel dark,cramped and pokey ) and feel smaller than the ( less expensive!!!! ) Corner Kings which had a better view of Manhatten. 3.Don't expect a good room if you book via a 3rd party site as the hotel prioritizes guests who book direct. 4. Shower drain was blocked ( we read this on a very old review too - so they have not sorted this issue ) down lights were blown and taps leaked from their wall sockets!! 5.It's cheaky to put two small Evian bottles by the sink in the bathroom and then place a small card stating they cost $4 each!! We drank 2 days worth until we realized we had to pay for them. Drinks in the minibar is understood to cost money, but drinks left by the sink in the bathroom is a bit crafty. Plus points. 1. They moved us from our expensive suite overlooking some graffiti on the 8th floor after 2 nights and placed us on a 15th floor Suite. The views were simply magical. Watching Manhatten light up as the sun went down was unforgettable. Highly recommended. 2. Personally, i liked the Dub music they played in the lifts. I understand that this point is totally irrelevant to people who do not like Dub music.But hey ho. 3. Location was fantastic. LES is very much like Hoxton in London. Great vibe and gritty while being totally safe ( the whole of Manhatten felt safe and we never saw or heard trouble anywhere - in fact it felt way better than London ). So many cool bars,restaurants and places to go near by. Highly recommend breakfast round the corner at 88 Orchard St. You will love it.The hotel does $5 breakfasts which we never had.Cheap but i suppose ya get what ya pay for........ Over all the Rivington is a cool hotel more suited to the younger crowd and having said all the above, we are planning on staying there again as the whole NY experience was great. We checked out the Gansevoort Hotel a few times and found the roof top bar staff too cool for school and rude, which we never experienced at the Rivington.

First note: I got a great price on Quikbook, $219. I knew I would get a lower floor room at that rate & I understand the hotel is all about the upper floors. Still, it was in the heart of the \"new\" Lower East Side, and the rooms supposedly modern and nice. For $200 in NY that is enough! The hotel upgraded me to the 5th floor, which is still a lower floor, the main difference being that it looks at rooftops rather than brick walls. The room was good-sized, decent bed with ok sheets, nice modern bathroom, closets, couch & small table. The windows were wraparound and frosted up to waist level (this is about when I started snickering). They were covered by an automated curtain which was pretty well broken and had to be manhandled to open and close. The bathroom had a steam shower (that was part of the upgrade) and REN products, which are lovely. Now...how do I put this delicately?- there was a large picture window in the bathroom with no shade and no way of covering it, and for a male guest, well let's just say you would have a VERY difficult time not serving as entertainment for the building across the street. (This is when I really started to laugh. I call the place \"Hotel Exhibitionist\".) During my stay various lights burned out and so forth and were never fixed, eventually making the room nightclub-dark, which is the mood of the hallways and entrance. That was my biggest annoyance- total lack of upkeep. Wifi was that 24-hour deal that is constantly expiring & you need to call the desk for passwords. Kind of a drag. Don't remember if it was free or not. Service here is nonexistent, but it didn't really bother me. The doormen were too busy chatting to open doors or check who was going in and out of the hotel, and the only thing that stopped them talking to each other was when they stopped to flirt with me and my friends! I never once saw them hail a cab or grab a guest's bags. If I had expected service I'd be horrified, but having read TA reviews, I didn't expect a thing, so it just made me laugh. This hotel is NOT hip in the slightest, and it so wants to be that it's kinda sweet. How can I explain \"not hip in the slightest\"? Let's just say that the hot party while I was there was a \"fashion show\" put on by the hair salon next door, which seemed to be trying to re-enact \"Jersey Girl\". The lobby bar has attitude which is a little less amusing. All that said the location is FANTASTIC, near all the good LES restaurants and shopping. If I were dropping $500 a night I'd try to get a good rate at Gramercy Park or something, although the Riv high floor views are amazing, but for my two bills I was actually fairly happy with the hotel.", "Date": "December 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cDefinitely Recommended\u201d", "Author": "letyaknow", "ReviewID": "UR51312264", "Content": "We booked a block of rooms at this hotel for guests who were coming to NY for our wedding, including the room we stayed in on our wedding night.

It is also 10 minutes walk from Soho. But is not the ideal location for tourist hotspots, if this is a priority. For me, the location was perfect, but it is worth noting. Key positives: the hotel was slick, the room smart and minimal, light with very comfortable bed and decent bathroom. Upgraded to a 10th floor corner room with a great S Manhattan view. The bar was pleasant enough for an early evening drink and the inclusive breakfast offered fruit, bagels, toast, jam and tea and coffee, which was enough (though for something more imaginative google 88 Orchard, a decent cafe within 5 minutes walk). The LES location is great for evenings out (also close to Soho and East Village) and there is a Subway within 2 minutes walk that gives you quick access to Manhattan/Brooklyn. Free wifi also gets a ++. Key negatives: the hotel designates all rooms as non smoking, but does not enforce it. Hence my room smelt like a smoking room on arrival. The best the hotel could do was offer an air machine during the day, which took two days to have an effect. In addition, the exterior primarily being metal framed glass, the room got cold in the evening without pumping in enormous amounts of hot air through the AC. Summary: A great location, great views and no complaints about the size or contents of the room. However, it's not perfect: anybody who is a non-smoker probably doesn't appreciate a night in a smoking room and it can get chilly in winter without blasting the AC.

Oh, but it is, for some mysterious reason, achingly hip. So if you're young and want to be feel you're at the epicenter of cool, this is just about the only upscal lodging option available to you in this area. The hotel was, and to some extent still is, a little glittering gem rising from the gloomy tenement buildings surrounding it. Stayed here for a week in a high corner floor king with balcony. At the time something like $500 a night, which isn't cheap, especially for this part of town. The room isn't large in square footage, but because of the wraparound, floor-to-ceiling windows, it feels airy. The decor is downtown modern chic, but I imagine susceptible to becoming dated pretty quickly as all trendy things are. Judged by conventional measures, the hotel rarely rises above the merely adequate in terms of service, professionalism, the quality of the accommodations (though the Tempurepedic beds\u00e2\u20ac\u201dI was skeptical of the foamy mattress at first\u00e2\u20ac\u201dare incredibly sleep-inducing and comfortable).

Having said that, it is a question of money as, unless you pay for an upgraded room, you'd be stuffed with some pretty uninspiring views (a wall maybe?) on the lower floors. The room itself had nice touches (eg Ipod docking station; nice shower stuff), and a nice seating area, but looked a little dated in parts (the wardrobes are quite scruffy and scuffed and the bathroom door came off its hinges one time - someone was sent very quickly to fix it but it really shouldn't have happened and was quite dangerous as the door was heavy). We got an apology from Reception but that was it. Also while the floor to ceiling windows in the bathroom are spectacular, the water pressure in the shower wasn't great and you couldn't turn up the temperature much (which was pretty surprising and not great on a cold winter's day). Breakfast is really disappointing, pastries, some fruit and cereal in packets, and you get coffee in paper cups which is nasty. Even though breakfast was included in the room charge, we chose to venture out almost every morning - there are some really interesting local cafes nearby. We also ate one evening in the restaurant - it was ok, nothing special, and pricey for what you get. Room service was completely blah. The bar had a fun happening vibe late into a Saturday night.

My room was a corner room on a relatively high floor with a small balcony that overlooked the atrium of the restaurant and had both the biggest/deepest soaking tub I've ever seen and a lovely shower with a view. In fact, I had the most amazing view from my bed, which was nothing short of magical when the snow started falling the next morning. It was hard to find fault with anything on this stay. Certainly not the cookies they give you at turndown! The second stay was very nice, but I didn't feel like they had pulled out all the stops like they did the previous stay. The room I got was not a corner room and much plainer on a lower floor. Same sort of decor, just no soaking tub. The beds are SO comfy though. Still got cookies at turn-down and even a little welcome amenity of nuts, chocolates, and dried fruit. I used the gym this time and it was small with no windows, but the equipment was great. The room's windows faced the back of the hotel which was over a courtyard of a bar/pub I think. VERY loud on the Thursday night that I was there and other coworkers that have stayed there since have also complained of noise on certain nights of the week.

I had seen it on the back page of Conde Nast Traveler \"The Room\". Lucky me - I actually got \"The Room\" shown in the article. In the years since, I have stayed here about 30 nights. It has been great to watch the transformation of the neighborhood around the hotel. Initially a little run down, now filled with cool boutiques and restaurants. If you read the other reviews, they are all accurate about the hotels hip and trendy clientelle and decor. I love this hotel. However, I have recommended it to some friends who felt a bit scared hanging out in the Lower East Side. However, I also have a friend who took her 12 year old daughter for her first trip to NYC and they had a blast. Why is this hotel so special? The views and the bathrooms. The view: If you want a view, you need a room above the 7th or 8th floor. Definitely worth the extra to get as high as you can. South and West views look over to the financial district and Brooklyn Bridge (just visible). North side rooms are what you really want. High North facing rooms have views looking all the way up across midtown. A highrise condo was recently completed a few blocks away, so you now have either a view of the Empire State Building OR the Chrysler building. Used to be able to get the full panorama. Either way, its simply gorgeous and I have spent many a late night watching the lights go out across the city. Who needs the LCD TV?? The size and layout of the rooms varies widely. From basic accommodations to uber-luxe hip suites. Furniture is minimal. Walls are white. almost no artwork. But you get floor to ceiling and wall to wall windows overlooking Manhattan. All the bathrooms are done in glass tile and a lot of windows. Many bathrooms are located on exterior walls and the shower is full glass with the view (with strategically placed frosted glass to obscure your privates from outside view). Some of the rooms have enormous bathrooms with spoon shaped tubs filled from a spout in the ceiling, or deep Japanese soaking tubs, or full shower/sauna combos. The Hotel web site has several good photos - they really need to add more to show the full variety of what they have to offer. I also highly recommend this hotel for a romantic getaway. This may not be the place for you to spend a week in NYC (not centrally located - but there is a good subway stop on the block), but get a bottle of wine, bring some food from Inotecca across the street, and camp out for the night on the Tempurpedic bed and crisp sheets. The rest will follow. . . Oh, and when you are finally done with the view, be sure to close the drapes because you are in a fish bowl and the sun will wake you up VERY early.

They told us that they would do something about it but never did. After 2 hours we went to the reception again to ask if they could give us another room because we really didn't want to \"party\" with these people. It was REALLY loud, never experienced something like that before. And I didnt' really understand why they would let people stay in this room when there is a huge party going on in the penthouse. It is simply ridiculous when the walls are so thin that you think you're in the penthouse, too.... Anyways. It ended with us being \"downgraded\" to a room on the 9th floor which was really not worth the money at all!!! Apart from the noise there was no view at all.

I thought it was pretty large considering NYC standards. The bed was totally comfortable, the bathroom was clean and the view was incredible. Even though we had made it to our room, the housekeeping had to come in and finish restocking the mini bar. Seems the hotel management needs to hire more staff or become more efficient.

Its also surrounded by 'real New York' - Delancey St around the corner offers a taste of this which is always exciting. We stayed in room 412 - an upper floor king suite with Japanese soaking tub and balcony. It was spectacular - you must stay in a room with a view. The tub offered full emersion with a view over LES to the Williamsburg bridge. The room itself was very spacious with floor to ceiling windows, a sitting area with couch/ coffee table, a massive king bed with high thread count linen and a plasma. The mini-bar wasn't overpriced like some hotels can be but had a big fridge so it was easy to buy drinks at one of the local deli's and stock up for a sun downer drink on the balcony - beautiful! The air-con and lighting in the bathroom were fab. The blinds successfully blocked out all light allowing for a deep sleep and were operated by the press of a button. House-keeping was great and room service menu was extremely reasonable and delicious. The complimentary conti breakfast was great - a selection of pastries / bagels / croissants / cereals / fruits and coffees avail from 7-11am with 3 choices of newspapers in the gorgeous bar area - we sat in the window overlooking bustling Rivington St most mornings in the sun next to rockstars and celebs with their agents - its a very trendy hotel (not really for kids, nor is the area). I was very impressed by the folder the hotel provides which lists all the local shops / bars / restaurants worth checking out - we tried a few and they were all fabulous - you really can't explore enough around this part of town. The uber trendy East village, Soho, and Nolita are all within 10mins walking and if you head towards the river you can easily walk through chine town down to Southport and walk across the Brooklyn Bridge to thriving Brooklyn - highly recommend this. There are also plenty of bus and subway connections close by. Cabs are easy to come by and don't cost much to move around. Most Sundays Rivington Hotel host a party in the penthouse which everyone is welcome to go to - definitely worth checking out even if just to check out the view across the city and the jacuzzi!

The voyeuristic facade is entirely transparent including bathrooms and showers on the facade wall, some with fritted glass - though the rooms have drapes. But once in the room you want to leave the drapes open, and it is obvious when looking up from the outside and seeing the occasional human silhouette in a towel or robe that many of the hotels guests feel the same way. The location is interesting, the building is great, and the rooms are great, if money is no object. I was disappointed by the operation of the hotel though. For the prices and the architecture the staff did not make you feel welcome or like you were in a special place - that feeling stopped with the physical environment - I felt like I was at a trendy bar begging to be let in - not a hotel. I dare say I would have liked the hotel better if there were no staff, and I checked in by machine - because the hotel itself is great (perhaps it has too few elevators!) - it was something about the atmosphere created by the staff that had the negative impact - they were neutral and indifferent - like in a trendy club. Not rude, but not attentive as I would expect from a property like this one. Upon check in our \"non smoking\" room reeked of smoke as if it was a bar the night before. We told the bellman who said they would deodorize, we left for a while and came back to the room. It was too horrible of a cigarette smell. We called the desk and said we needed a different room, the insisted they could air it out. We said it was too horrible a smell and we could check into another hotel, and they said they would call us back. They called back and found us a room two floors down on 10 (We had requested a High King With Soaking Tub on floors 9-20 and specifically asked for a high floor). We asked to see the new room first. It had great air quality so we took it. We enjoyed the rest of out stay - watching a fantastic thunderstorm move through around the glass facade, enjoying the deep soaking tub, the view, and the local restaurants and bars. Actually there was one staff person who we thought was great - the housekeeper. She aimed to please; she brought us treats at the turn down service. The rest of the staff could learn something from her.... The continental breakfast was drab, and the service for this was also indifferent - things were empty, things were cold, and staff could care less, or if they did care, they tried hard to make it seem like they didn't - perhaps they were just recovering from a late night out the evening before... who is to know. I would go back, but I would go back not expecting anything from the hotel staff - and I would actually pay more money for a better room higher up... when you are into the experience for $475 (plus tax) you might as well spend $675 to get something more over the top... I would recommend this hotel to people from Europe who sees tremendous value in the currency rates. I would not say that it has great service - so if that were what you want I would not stay here.

Having stayed in the W Hotel Times Square for 5 nights for the \"touristy\" intro to New York, this place really made us feel like we were in New York (rather than just another big city). You can literally spend more than a week in and around the walking vicinity of this place. Shopping nearby or in Soho. Eating at funky restaurants like WD-50, Katz's Deli... Then there was the room itself. We went for the Suite, and it was just awesome. Designer furniture and bright white walls (which were freshly re-painted). Excellent toiletries, two flat screens, automatic curtains that reveal a corner room which is pretty much glass all the way round (out one side you are staring right at the empire state building, the other towards the lower manhattan business district). As just another highlight to our stay, on the way down in the lift from our room to the ground floor, none other than lindsay lohan was entering the lift. Its certainly not your Hyatt/Hilton/Sofitel hotel experience because of its surroundings, and those who are so used to that might find it a bit \"different\" and edgey (you'll be kept awake for a while from the horn honking and happy party people through the \"glass\" exterior to your bedroom for example on a saturday night), but thats all part of the appeal of this place. Dont bother spending exorbitant prices for a brand name experience in New York that will be the same everywhere. Come here and get the real deal... One thing I would definately recommend though is that our experience could have been very different if i wasn't in one of the rooms on a higher floor.

When we told the server she offered no apology, but said that she would bring a fresh drink right away. She came back about 10 minutes later with a new drink and our bill.

We were visiting friends in New York for a week, and as it was my birthday on the Friday we thought we'd stay somewhere special. I had read an article on this hotel and thought the floor to ceiling windows would be great, and heard lots of good things about the Lower East Side. When we got to the hotel they showed us to our room, and it turned out to be a basic king room when I had booked a high level corner king with a balcony on their website. We went back down to reception and I showed them my print out of our reservation. They said that there had been an error when updating their website and we had booked the high level with a balcony for the same price as a basic king. I wasn't impressed, and was really disappointed with the basic king, so was going to kick up a real fuss if they said there was nothing they could do. Turns out they looked for the room we originally wanted, but there weren't any available, so they had to put us into a suite at no extra charge! It didn't have a balcony which was disappointing, but the room itself was amazing and on the 12th floor. Apparently this was a $700/night room. It was quite large with a wall of closets, a sitting area with two couches, a bathroom with a massive shower with two showers in one and a view, and a bedroom area with corner windows. It was obvious they were gutted that they had to give us this room for $350, but it was their mistake and put it right with no fuss. The shower was the best I've ever had, the bed was the best I had ever slept in. The views were great to the north, the east side wasn't the greatest but still cool. I didn't notice that the room was shabby. Room service was prettty good, we did get apples and cookies left by the bed, though when we called to have something picked up for drycleaning it took them a while to pick it up, but we were around anyways so it didn't matter. The staff were all friendly and helpful. The only thing was that I had mentioned in the reservation that it was my birthday and did they do anything special for that, and where most hotels would give you a bottle of champagne, we got nada. They probably thought they had done enough by giving us the suite!! Also we had some friends back to the suite after dinner for some champagne and they were happy to bring up some extra champagne glasses if it did take a bit of time. We had dinner in THOR on my birthday and the food was really good and the restaurant looked great. The only thing I could say was that it was a little empty until about 10-10:30pm. The bar was really nice with good cocktails, though we did have a bit of a pain trying to sit down in it late on a Friday night, apparently they would rather leave the couches empty in case someone who wants to buy bottles of booze comes along, but saying that once they found out we had just eaten there they took us and my friends who had just arrived straight to a couch and sadly it did make us feel a bit special..... but only saying that we were staying at the hotel didn't mean much, we had to say we had just eaten there. It was very lively and cool on a Friday night and there was a line to get in outside. The Lower East Side is a fantastic area in New York. Really lively and lots of nice bars and restaurants. I would really recommend this hotel, but I would definitely recommend that you pay extra for a high level and better room, otherwise there is no point. The basic king we first saw was disappointing for the price I thought. It was pretty basic with not a lot of windows and a dark and unspecial bathroom. Pay the extra and get a better room.

The hotel bar and local clubs are hoping even during the week. I was happy with everything about the hotel except the view from the room. Like one other reviewer, I specifically requested NOT to be put on a lower floor and I was put on the 5th floor, which for this hotel is definitely a lower floor. The view was horrible and looked out onto an alley and into people's apartments, and yes that means their apartments looked directly into my room. This might not sound so bad except that the shower wall is only half frosted glass, which means anyone in a floor higher than 5 in the adjacent building can look directly into the shower and bathroom, which can be a little uncomfortable and I'm no prude. I complained and asked for a higher room but was told no rooms were available. I believe this to be completely untrue given the significant number of dark windows for the duration of my 4 day stay and the low level of traffic in the hotel. I didn't pay rack rate but could have gotten in an equally nice hotel with a much better view for far less. Given the horrible NON-view, I opted to not spend any time in my room at all, which is a shame because the actual room itself was quite comfortable. For the business traveler, if you're looking to work from your room, forget it, there is no desk space and the T1 lines are hidden behind the furniture. Over-all, if you don't care about a view or are willing to pay full price to get one, this is an okay place to stay.

We never requested a room with any additional amenities or luxuries othert than one simple request that it be a medium room with a city view as advertised on the website for the hotel. Needless to say, we got a room facing the alley and overlooking the glass ceiling of the restaurant in the hotel lobby. On trying to bring it to the attention of the hotel staff, we were snubbed and told that due to the lack of any further vacancies, we would have to contact Manuela Kolb, the manager of Hotel Rivington during our time there. We were not able to get a hold of her at the time of our stay, so resorted to emailing her after returning back for an explanation. Having paid well over 900 dollars for a 2 night stay in a medium room that according to the website said that it had unobstructed views, anyone can imagine our dismay. She insisted that the room was what we had 'asked' for and given the reservations to, when to my insistence our experience was to the contrary. To this day, she has not replied to our emails and the staff has not offered a satisfactory explanation. It is to my dismay that having heard so highly of this hotel, we were left with such distaste on the response of the management. I would have expected resolution of the situation quickly haivng acknowledged the decor and the reputation of this hotel.

If you want to spend most of your time seeing Broadway shows and visiting museums, you might be better off in midtown or uptown. But if you would like to be near the Village and Soho, the Rivington is a stylish choice. My husband and I stayed here three nights over a long weekend in July. We had room 113 on the 11th floor, which was a king room. It is a corner unit, with wall to ceiling glass windows on two sides. The bathroom has both a shower (with frosted glass windows, so you get the feeling of showering in front of an open window in the city), and a soaking tub. Toiletries are nice and replenished daily. The design of the hotel is funky and cool. The room is by no means large, but it is well-designed and perfectly fine (hotel rooms in NYC are definitely smaller than average). The continental breakfast is pretty good. There is coffee, whole pieces of fruit, cereal, pastries, and bagels. The bagels and pastries are from a bakery. The downsides \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no juice, tea, or water. I suppose these could have been tracked down if we had gotten a waiter to help, which we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do. I gave the hotel four rather than five stars because (1) there is no music in the hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you have to pay $10 to play a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153jukebox\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on the TV for 120 minutes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a total ripoff, I think. A CD player is standard in this kind of place; (2) the NY Times was not delivered to the door; (3) ice was quite difficult to track down (no ice bucket in room, I was put on hold when I called for it, and finally went to lobby restaurant and got some); (4) no tea/water at breakfast. I found service good. Upon check-in, there was no bellman to help with my bags (my husband was parking). The man behind the desk helped me instead. When I looked for ice, the hostess helped me track it down, even though the restaurant was quite busy. The club is hopping on Friday and Saturday nights. We did not hear a thing in our room, but I can imagine that rooms on the lower floors might be quite noisy. I would watch out for this if booking a less expensive room. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t order from room service, but it looked to be quite inexpensive, which was a good thing. The minibar was also well stocked and quite inexpensive (in other NYC hotels, I have seen water being sold for $10!) I did not feel a bit unsafe in this neighborhood at any point. There were plenty of normal looking people out on the street barhopping and clubbing, and I never felt that weird \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re the only ones on an empty street with only a strange-looking man across from us\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd feeling.

I could see all the way to mid-town from the front room and the bedroom and from the other side of the bedroom, we could see the financial district. With no other buildings to hamper our view, it was fantastic! The room decor is spare and modern. The mini bar is large enough to put your own wine and cheese in and is stocked with some fun, sexy items. I had initial misgivings about the Tempurpedic bed (I thought it would be too soft) but my fears were unfounded, as I slept like a baby. The housekeeping staff did a good job of keeping things clean and well stocked. Room service is prompt and expensive, but, hey, what room service isn't? Now I did stay for a whole week and as the days progressed closer to the weekend, so did the noise from the street. Folks, it's a party down there and if you don't have a room on a higher floor you might as well join the partyers because there will be no sleep for you. We were on the 14th floor and still could hear the noise from the bars across the street. On the plus side, during the day the area is a peaceful. The bathroom is spacious and the shower was huge with great water pressure and a view. I did not have a room with a soaking tub. If you are looking for the Times Square/Broadway/Central Park experience, you may want to book a hotel closer to mid-town so you don't spend your time in taxis or on the subway. I would stay here again. I loved the artsy neighborhood and yeah, it can be a little gritty, but I never felt unsafe. I loved that I could go into a dress shop and actually see the owner designing her dresses or the shoe shop and see the owner making his (very expensive) shoes and purses I loved the small restuarants and bars that seem to come alive at night.

As everyone by now knows this hotel is located in the LES, so people that stay here WANT to stay here - no tour buses (thank god) or tour groups. Guests were mostly European (heavy on English accents) with very few North Americans - I think the location scares the businessmen. GOOD: Front Desk Service was pretty good from the young (but def. not model looking) staff. Housekeeping did a great job, Doorman were great guys with taxi requests. Steam Shower is amazing - never seen that in a standard room anywhere before. The rooms are HUGE by NYC standards. I am sure my \"Regular\" room was bigger than most Manhattan apartments. Comp Breaky with coffee, pastries, ham, cheese and bagels (but no juice - gotta pay for that) was sufficient and more than most hotels give you. Wait staff was seriously flaky and obviously did not want to be there. Their regular rates seem high but comparing it with other NYC hotels of similar caliber it is not bad. This hotel is a good deal if you get it for under $300 (which I did) BAD: The much lauded Beds were not all THAT. I personally prefer the Westin Bed. Room was spare, minimalist to the extreme. For a relatively new hotel the furnishings and finishes are already seriously scuffed and dirty. Tables, carpets, chairs, etc are all showing major wear and tear and will need replacement soon. This is a PARTY Hotel. The Bar and Resto was crazy packed Fri and Sat night with everyone and their mother. The guests in the room next to mine decided to throw their own party and it took many calls to security to break it up (they had like over 50 people in their room!) The original construction of this hotel is poor if the guests can see it (which we can) paper thin walls, poorly cut carpets, badly laid tiles, etc..I think this place was built in a hurry.

I was aware that the hotel was fairly newly opened so expected that there may be some issues. Unfortunately some of the disappointment I experienced was nothing to do with newness - rather there is just a really bad finish to some of the fittings. Given the supposed standard of this hotel I would have expected better. First class hotels need a first class finish - that is what customers are paying for. I have a horrible feeling that the rivington hopes to attract the kind of guests to whom shelling out big money is nothing. I'm not one of these guests - this was a big treat for me and was supposed to be my first experience of a really good new york hotel. I was particulary shocked by the lack of music in the rooms - having to pay for the privelege when the rooms are so expensive seems really mean. On check out we were informed that we could have had an i-pod docking station, however this was not mentioned when we checked in and was no-where in the hotel literature. Also - even if we had been mad enough to pay for music in our rooms - the selection was dismal. Not what one would expect from a hotel situated right in the heart of New York's hippest music area and presumably targetting the kind of audience who want to hang out in local bars, clubs and gig venues. My biggest disappointment was the view (or lack of) I was of the impression that even the cheaper rooms had great views of the skyline - wrong!! all I could see was the restaurant and the fairly grimy back yard. On the plus side - and yes there were some - the basic design of the hotel is good and the staff were very friendly. The bed was AMAZING - don't think I have ever slept so well, and the mid level bar was really nice and cosy. However I can't shake off the feeling that the price is just to high for what is on offer, and I know that when I was there I was still getting quite a good deal as not everything was complete.

This one claims to be luxurious, but in terms of service, being responsive to customer's needs, cleanliness of the rooms, amenities, and price. It supremely fails in every category. In addition, the staff are inexperienced and you can tell--have no background on hospitality or understand common courtesy (or is common sense a better word). For example, when we called to check if we could check-in one hour early while we were heading into New York City, the reservationist told us to come by (the hotel) and they would see if they could work something out. We get to the hotel and THEN are told that there were no rooms to be checked into until 3PM (check-in time) because they are booked, We wasted our time going there.. they could have told us earlier. We wait until 3PM on a couch near the receptionist. When 3PM approaches, we are told that they don't have our reserved room. We wait until 3:15PM and are told that we have been upgraded because of the inconvenience. We of course take this as a bonus... However, when we reach our room, the \" large suite\" which is nice, but NOT worth the $$$$ (I am telling you guys, don't waste your money) it smelled of stale cigar smoke (the smell reminded me of a OTB joint). So immediately, we go back to the lobby and ask for a new room. We get our new room and it's not much better. It isn't even clean. But we thought, what are the chances they would change our rooms again without them thinking we're being prima donnas (which is totally justifiable when spending $400 plus a night). I don't think the room was ever cleaned before they gave it to us. because days later when we checked out, we were charged for an intimacy kit that we didn't even use. It was ridiculous when I called to complain about the charge, the guy giggled when he described what was in the kit. It was pretty humilating. There is little professionalism when it comes to this hotel, I tell you. Also, when calling to speak to the manager, you never get him. It's impossible to reach the man. So if you guys have any complaints, good luck trying to get any attention or resolution. Your words fall on deaf ears. I also must complain about the food as well. Maybe at the restaurant and possibly for dinner, Thor is considered good. However, for breakfast, it was edible at best... and to top it all of... the simple breakfast came close to $50 for two people. It's not the expense as much as what you got for it... If you are the type that expects the full package when spending a lot of money, this is not the place to stay. The only thing the place offers are cool windows. I'm in the design industry and our \"large suite\" was kinda unimpressive. I expected better decor. Especially after all the press.

Favorite example: while checking out, the woman at the counter kept me waiting a few minutes while she dealt with a customer complaining about food-poisoning from the room-service breakfast, and then chatted with her colleagues about what to tell him... really not something to do in front of another client! (We also ordered room service and had no problems.) All this is really vastly outweighed by the hotel's many charms. The vews of New York through the full-wall windows are just unbeatable, and the Rivington has the benefit of being the only tall building in the area (something you can't get in midtown, no matter what the price). The curtains and shades retract at the press of a bedside button. The beds are top-notch though a little strange (tempur-pedic memory foam). The bathroom products are excellent. Free WiFi that works seamlessly. Great minibar. Very reasonable rates. The neighborhood is my new New York favorite, close to all of downtown (SoHo, East Village, Tribeca) with a real culinary renaissance going on right now, lots of exciting new restaurants and clubs within a few blocks. It's still a little rough, so wouldn't be ideal for people scared of urban grit, but we felt very safe walking around even late at night. Once the staff hit their groove, it will be a five-star hotel for sure (and the rates are likely to climb).", "Date": "January 29, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orange Park,Florida", "Title": "\u201cOkay hotel, bad hood, they can see you too\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4365191", "Content": "Once your inside the hotel, it is okay.

Best part is their thermapedic beds (the NASA ones) - but this suite it was the stand alone bathtub in the bathroom the same size as the bedroom, with the water filling from the ceiling into the tub....very nice. The neighbourhood is edgy and not the norm - worth 2 nights of wining/dining in a very relaxing/un-pretentious hotel.

Although the hotel is not in the most convenient neighborhood, I still gave it a try to check out the rooms and decor. The staff at check-in and at the front door were nice, although clearly not very experienced. My room had some very interesting features (heated floors), electric shades. For being only open a few months, however, the decor was already showing quite a bit of wear - dirty and worn carpets, scratched floor in the elevator, worn drapes, etc. The big problem comes, however, when you try to get any help from the front desk. I tried to get some help booking dinner at Balthazar. The hotel advertises a \"special relationship\" with the owners of Balthazar and Schiller's. When I had them try to book dinner, they could not. I asked what about the \"special relationship\", I was told by the concierge that they don't really have one. I was a little surprised (given that they advertise it on their website) and asked for the manager. The manager basically got in an argument with me about how could I expect to get in at a hot restaurant on that night. I continued to explain to him that my problem was the false advertising not the failure to get a reservation. He proceeded to become belligerent and rude and yell at me and call me classless. After basically reducing me to tears, I asked him what hotel management school he possibly leared that this was the proper way to treat a customer and he said life. Life was where he had learned to do that - nice life to know to be yell and scream at a customer. Don't waste your time or your money.
