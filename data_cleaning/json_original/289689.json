We took two rooms for 4 of us and both the rooms are spacious with nice black and white decor, clean with amenities including a mini fridge. The rooms and the toilets are clean with towels changed daily. Since we arrived early, we were happy that we were given 1 room to check in immediately. The reception was also helpful, assisting us to book for our flamenco show and to call for a taxi early in the morning for our next destination. Breakfast came together with the room price and served in a neraby cafe. The hostal is centrally located and you can walk through the shopping districts from Puerto de sol to Gran Via and Plaza Mayor, you can walk to most of the tourist attrctions, including Museo del Prado.

The man at the front service desk was really nice and provided very good service, however when we left he was quite anal due to stress.

The best about the hotel I would say is the location, since its close to pretty much everything we wanted to see and we barely used public transportation. Also the rooms are modern and very clean. The things we disliked were mostly the noise, in the morning we could hear the showers of the rooms closer to ours and hear people in the hall with theis suitcases leaving the hotel. We also didn't enjoy the breakfast too much. It was served it a restaurant very close by but it wasn't continetal style, we had to ask for coffee and toast. The staff was helpfull except when we tried to get a recomendation for a good restaurant to eat a good spanish meal. They would only recomend the restaurant where we had breakfast, even knowing it wasnt even spanish. Guess they must have a deal with them. So even after we told them we had already dinned there, they would keep saying to go there again. Overall we enjoyed our stay and would recomend this hotel.", "Date": "November 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "DFW, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat hostel right on plaza del sol\u201d", "Author": "ksigpaul", "ReviewID": "UR80645907", "Content": "Amazing location and amazing accommodations.

Really enjoyed this hotel. It's really steps away from Plaza del Sol and even closer to great food and fun places. We booked this hotel two days before we arrived in Madrid for the last two nights of our two week vacation to Spain. The hotel was very clean and kept in nice condition. The room was very spacious, bathroom modern. The balcony great for people watching. Staff very friendly. Breakfast was included in the hotel rate and was off site at an restaurant just around the corner. A choice of a large sandwich and selection of fruit and cheese as well as Coffee and fresh OJ was plenty for a good start to the day. Next time you are in Madrid and want to stay at a great place steps away from all of the action, stay here.

I was searching for a single room but instead ended up on a double bed room. Didn't mind because I got the most quiet room on the hostal!

We found this hostale through a website called Madridman . The hostale is in a great location, right by the Sol metro stop on a small street. While it is right in the heart of the \"Party Zone\" the street was not too noisy, though if you can get one at the back of the hotel you will not hear any sound at all.As a family travelling together this was a great hotel for anyone that is doing it on a budget. Our kids, who are 14 and 11, never had a problem with the room. I have stayed in far worse hotels that are ratty and far more expensive. This was just great. We actually extended our stay from 4 nights to 9 nights, after we decided that the hotel was better than we had expected and that we could use Madrid as a base for days trips to Avila, Segovia and Toledo. Four of us stayed in a room that could sleep 5, the price was $84 including tax and breakfast - which was at a small cafe around the corner.", "Date": "April 11, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hostal Alhambra", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187514-d289689-Reviews-Hostal_Alhambra-Madrid.html", "Price": "$79 and up*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">C/Espoz y Mina, 6</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Second Floor</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">28012 </span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Madrid</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "289689", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/7f/c3/7fc309b546bf0b763c72c7f2b85d9bf35large.jpg"}}
