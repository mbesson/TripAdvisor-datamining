Catalonia Ramblas is a very modern and clean hotel. It's situation was perfect within walking distance to everything. The room was very very big and lovely big beds and parquet floors. We overlooked the pool so we never heard a hint of traffic. The beds were very big and easy to move. Breakfast was extensive with lots of fresh fruits, delicious pastries, good cappuccino etc etc. The dining room staff was very friendly and obliging. Free Wifi was welcomed change to usually high costs in hotels. But, unfortunately we had problems with the bath room. There was a very bad stench of sewer in the toilet. When I brought this to their attention on the first morning, they explained that when it rains in Barcelona, there is a sewer problem. OK, as we say \"[--] Happens\" Anyway we spent very little time in the room. There is also a large door between the toilette area and the bedroom, so the odor didn't permeate to our area at night. The other problem was the shower. There was no way we could adjust the water. Either it was scalding hot or freezing cold. All this without touching the faucettes. Showers were a nightmare. My room mate was in tears. They offered to change rooms, but when we checked, they were all the same problem with the water temperature. Usually, I am not the one to complain, but our experience in the hotel was definitely soured by the toilet and shower. We went to the manager and as compensation, they allowed us late check out free of charge and also didn't charge for the dinner we had one night. I must say they were very forth coming. Other small problems we had was the hairdryer. The covering always fell off, exposing the wires. The bed sagged, causing one to slip to the side. There was virtually no place to put clothes apart from the hanging closet. I had to remove the coffee/tea shelf and leave things there. But, I wouldn't go back without assurance that the problems I mentioned were fixed. When I read Trip advisor, this was a re-occurring comment by other travelers.

When we arrived our room was not ready so the lady at reception suggested we upgrade to a suite which includes lots of extra services for an additional 30 euros per night, so we did........... The extra services were..... A pair of paper slippers and an xxl dressing gown!!! This extra service would have infact cost us 120 euros! We then changed back to a standard double which was almost identicle, minus the slippers and dressing gown! The menu in the restaurant is fine if you enjoy the more extreme side of Spanish/French food but not for the fain hearted! The 'gym' is a joke! It's an old tred mill and 2 old bikes in a broom cupboard and the spa is shocking and dangerous! All in all this stay was way over priced and the hotel is no way near 4* standard especially the service. It is a shame as I'm sure run properly this could be a fantastic hotel.

I think it took us 30 mins at least to get checked in. The staff, particularly a certain Dani, was not helpful at all. He was stationed at the reception. We needed to reconfirm a tour booking and we approached him to ask him if he could reconfirm the tour details for us. His reply was absurd, that he was not authorized to call and that we should call the tour company ourselves. Moreover, he said he could find the reference code to quote the tour operator. Um, well, the reference code is there on the voucher we had printed. Eventually, he did call the tour company and reconfirmed the booking.. But his customer service skills are clearly lacking. It appeared to me like he did not want the hassle of calling the tour company. The rooms LOOK nice and modern and hip, but the functionality needs repair. The aircon thermostat didn't work, for it was only set at 24 degrees. You couldnt change it. In the bathroom, the water pressure was weak. The shower thermostat was flaky, for sometimes it was too hot, then too cold. My wife almost got burnt a few times trying to regulate the temperature of the shower water. The shower tub drain needed de- logging because the tub also flooded when we took a shower. There was even one night when all the water in the bathroom was hot, and this happened when my wife was in the middle of taking a shower! She couldnt rinse herself because of the hot water. She almost burned her face trying to rinse the shampoo from her hair. We couldn't find the lukewarm temp of the water. The water in the sink was hot too, even when you set the thermostat to the max cold position. For the breakfast times, the restaurant opened at 730 am. This was not good for us since we had tours that started at 9, so we had to rush our eating so as not to be late for the tour. They should start breakfast times earlier, during weekends.

I paid for the standard room and after seeing the Junior Suite with pool, decided to upgrade by paying an extra 70 euros. The room was located on the new 7th floor, and there were no bell boys, so you had to carry your own luggage to your room. This was further complicated by the fact that the hotel lifts did not serve the floor. The room was pretty spacious and the wooden deck terrace and paddle pool was a nice touch. Aside from these external extras, everything else about the room was pretty much identical to a typical room. The beds were not particularly comfortable (too hard), but the rest of the furniture in the room was pretty good, especially the sofa and the 50 inch plasma television. The bathroom and its layout was excellent. There is a Jacuzzi bath tub and a separate rainfall shower room. The toilet was located in a separate part of the room. The shower water temperature kept fluctuating during my stay which was disappointing. The main problem I had with the suite was that the pool in the terrace was tiny, not heated and had no lighting. This is contradictory to the website photos, which clearly showed the pool having underwater lights. The seating area was very poorly lit, which meant it was virtually impossible to enjoy any of the outdoor facilities after dark, which is disappointing considering the extra money I paid for the privileges. The standard of English amongst the receptionists also fluctuated massively. Laura at the front desk was excellent, and really went out of her way to help me choose a good room, but a bloke I had the pleasure of speaking to, couldn\u2019t actually speak English and kept apologising. I found this rather bizarre, as most guests, as like many other hotels in Barcelona tend to be occupied by English speaking guests. Despite being marketed as a luxury hotel, there was something very budget about it. I can\u2019t quite put my finger on it, but I reckon it might be a combination of the so-so service, inconsistent hotel design (some floors were very modern and swanky, others were run down) and questionable maid service (a platter of rotten fruit was left outside my room by another guest for several days).

The Hotel is located less than a 5 minute walk to the top of Las Ramblas and a large Plaza. Additionally, there are dining and shopping experiences immediately upon exiting the hotel. The Staff is friendly and multi-lingual. I attempted to use my Spanish abilities many times, but the English is so well-spoken by staff that speaking their language is almost difficult. The Hotel offered Free Water in the Rooms, as well as more importantly, FREE WI-FI. Even the Marriott charges a crazy Euro sum for an hour up to 24 hours when you stay in their Elite part of the hotel, near the Airport. I recommend the Catalonia Ramblas highly and should I ever get back to Barcelona I know exactly where we will stay!

Although I was in Barcelona for work, I took my Girlfriend along and specifically chose this hotel for its spa and gym. Problems were. Limited opening times for the spa and when it was open, only half of it was working (No Jacuzzi). The Gym is a joke, despite the website, it is really a box room with a few pieces of old equipment. Oh well live and learn, but however--- Our room was small for the price (no balcony despite being promised) outdated decor with sliding doors (that jammed and covererd the tv) to store clothes. Smelly toilet and shower. Window that was difficult to open. Basic TV channels. The bar is nice with comfy seats, but expect to pay nearly 10 Euros for a gin and tonic. A bit overpriced really. The layout of the hotel is bizarre with a strange, exaggerated stroll down to the restaurant for breakfast. I payed in advance for breakfast, but wish I hadn't. A fair selection of food, but the hot food was limited and not very hot at all. The staff were friendly enough when need be, but coffee was to airline standard only I'm afraid! Over all cleanliness is limited (example of which, were the same crumbs were on the bar furniture from the night before). It took me a couple of days to work out, but this hotel is really only interested in big groups of people or large business conventions. We discovered that the more people checked into the hotel, the better the service overall. Things started to appear that were not there at the weekend like chocolates on the bed at night, fruit and water by the lifts, freshly made milkshakes at breakfast. All very nice, but too little too late. To top it all we asked the male receptionist for a nice area to walk and get somewhere to eat that evening. Took us through a very ethnic part of town. Girlfriend got her handbag snatched! (although this is very common, we have since found out, so be careful) Wrong info given me thinks! A different receptionist booked us a taxi for the airport, but expect the Taxi driver to charge an extra 10-12 euros for this privilege. The meter was already up to 6 euros before we got in and it magically ramped up another 6 when we arrived at the airport. He seemed to know all the staff at reception so this must be the accepted price at the hotel?? I would not recommend this hotel for value for money. If I had payed half the price I would still feel let down and disappointed. This is not a four star hotel!!

My tea and coffee service in the room was not cleared one day, and the tea, coffee and milk were not replenished. Also, I ordered room service one evening and the dirty plates etc were still standing outside of my room for the whole day and evening the next day (even though the cleaners had visited). I have to say the laundry service was very good though. It was great to know that we had free WiFi, however the service was terrible. We really needed internet access so it was very frustrating when we could not connect, even in the meeting rooms of the hotel. The hotel does have a \"business centre\" but it only has 2 pcs and a printer. One of the computers was not working during our stay, and also you have to pay to use these machines (minimum of \u20ac2 for 10 minutes). The breakfast buffet in the restaurant is very good and the food we had for lunch and dinner was pleasant, however we had a coupls of dietary requirements within our group which the hotel had difficulty in dealing with. The vegetarian alternatives were not good, even though we had informed the hotels days in advance that we had these requirements. I did notice someone else had mentioned the soap was not changed each day, and for me this is a good thing. I find it most annoying when hotels feel they have to give me a new bar of soap everyday as this is just a waste. I commend this hotel for not changing the soap everyday.

Pros: -Excellent location -Excellent breakfast buffet (lots of choices, everything fresh, lots of staff) -Excellent shower (large stall, lots of hot water, great water pressure) -Decent-sized rooms -Comfortable beds -Nice little pool (though very cloudy while we were there because of...???) -Nice little lounge area around the pool, plus a pool bar Cons: -The only channels in English are news, so if you like to watch T.V. you're out of luck. -If WiFi is important to you, be warned the service is spotty and slow. I had more luck picking up the signal of the Hotel Lleo a few doors down, and it was a faster connection too. -There are computers in the lobby, but you have to pay to use them! In a hotel this expensive I don't see why this should be so. Not to mention, they are absolutely filthy (Seriously. One of the screens looked as if it had been sneezed on and I saw it was not cleaned the whole time I was there.) One computer froze up while I was using it and the young woman at the desk seemed royally irritated with me because I wanted help instead of just using the other machine, which was her first suggestion. I tried to explain I had swiped my credit card and was paying for the time ticking away while I waited for someone to help. Finally, after the third person came over and shrugged, I said, \"Why don't you just please unplug it and plug it back in\" which they did. (I would've done it myself if I could've figured out where the outlet was.) That computer sat broken for the rest of the week I was there. -Staff not particularly friendly or helpful: I hate to base this on one or two staff in particular, but these were young women who worked the front desk most days we were there. I used to work in a hotel and know how difficult it can be, still... One young woman in particular seemed so constantly annoyed with anyone trying to speak Spanish (or even those of us asking politely for English) it made me reticent to approach the desk, Her demeanor changed considerably with anyone who spoke Catalan. I am not one to walk up and rudely demand things, and I personally feel that not speaking the local language puts me at a disadvantage, so I act accordingly. I'm not the type of guest who expects to be fawned over (years of past work in various service industry positions have made me far too empathetic to what the staff have to go through) but I do expect staff of a hotel this pricey to at least be civil, if not friendly. Not to mention, fully half or more of the guests spoke either Spanish or English, so it seems the staff should be prepared and not angry about it. I don't need hotel staff to be overly accommodating or to be my friend, just polite would do! -Cleanliness lacking: They say never look under a hotel bed, but I dropped something a few days into our stay, and when I bent down to look for it found fingernail clippings (which were not ours!) along the wall under the bed. YUCK. These had been under the bed the whole time, and indeed, stayed there the entire week. While the linens were changed daily, and sheets seemed spin 'n' span clean (thank god) the rest of the maid service was sorely lacking. During he first shower I took, as the steam fogged everything, I noticed soap scum up the walls and glass shower door. I also owned a small cleaning business once upon a time, and know if you merely wipe down the smooth tiles or glass doors with some regularity, you don't get that sort of buildup. The walls and shower door had obviously not been scrubbed in a while. Worse were the long, dark hairs that began to accumulate on the white tile bathroom floor. They weren't ours (I am a short-haired blond, my husband's head is shaved). I thought, \"Are those from the guests before us?\" Then as the days wore on and more accumulated, I thought they must be from the cleaning staff (or had they been on the unvacuumed floor and we tracked them in. Bleah.) The thing is, more were brought in, as the original hairs also remained. Obviously the floor was not given even given a cursory sweep during our whole visit. All I could think was if things this obvious were not attended to, how dirty was the rest of the room? The black tile floor? The sink? Ew. We just kept to the bathmats, and tried not to touch the shower walls. If the bed linen had given me any pause, we would've canceled the rest of the reservation and found something else, but as it was, it was easier to stay. The worst part was after a couple days interaction with the staff, I felt it was just easier not to mention the poor maid service, as I felt staff would certainly not be sympathetic, and probably nothing would change anyway. It really wasn't worth the trouble. Overall impression: This place would be an excellent value if the staff were just even the smallest bit warm and the rooms were cleaned properly. I don't want to give the impression it's a pit or anything, it's just...come on! Sweep the bathroom floor every third day for crying out loud! I'm pretty sure we won't be back. Note: We stayed at the Hotel Jazz on our last trip and found it clean, well located, reasonably priced, and the staff very helpful and friendly. The only reason we didn't stay there this time was that we were part of a conference and several friends were also staying at the Catalonia Ramblas. Also, the Jazz is right on top of a metro station and in some of the lower rooms you can hear and feel the trains as they pass. I was worried we might not get into a higher room, because I was booking so late. Next time I'll book early and book into the Jazz.", "Date": "August 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel, good location\u201d", "Author": "francky88", "ReviewID": "UR35098416", "Content": "We stayed for two days with my wife at the hotel.

Disliked: The restaurant, the unhelpful snotty staff and the big screen tv in the (very expensive) bar area. In total: Was I happy with it? Yes. Would I go back? If I got a good deal. Breakfast was truly fantastic. Different gorgeous breads and cheeses, yoghurts, cereals, cooked \"English breakfast\" buffet, great omelettes made to order, Spanish cake selection. It was a feast! And the breakfastroom itself is roomy, quite elegant and never felt crowded. And still- what I can recall best is grilling a piece of \"rustic\" bread in the toaster, putting on fresh tomatoes, and a little drizzle of olive oil. Hard to beat. The room was really nice. Very stylish- striking bold colourscheme, clean but also I suppose some would say smallish. Only a frosted glass door to the bathroom, which in our room was next to the bed. Again- very stylish, but not what you would want if you are on your first trip away with a romantic partner. The lobby area was also stylish and modern, with a bar. But the drinks were dear- and remember you can get lovely wine for next to nothing in any little bar only around the corner. And there was a huge flatscreen with sport on all the time, which totally ruined the classy and relaxing atmosphere. The staff were rather snotty, and could only be bothered to point in direction of the hallway with lifts to show us where our room was. Not very serviceminded.

The customer service ranged from lacking to actively insulting. After having to deal with (1) rude and unhelpful customer service, (2) a lost reservation, (3) broken air conditioning, and (4) a lying front desk attendant (even the reception manager admitted that the front desk attendant had lied to me), I would never recommend this hotel to anyone. *LOST RESERVATION* The first problem was that when I arrived at the end of a long trip from Valencia, I was told by the attendant at reception (Quentin) that he was unable to find my reservation. After about five minutes examining the list of reservations, I asked Quentin whether there was a problem with my reservation. I handed him my printout of my hotel reservation confirmation (I made the hotel reservation directly on the hotel website). Quentin curtly responded that there would be no problem, but for the fact that they did not have my reservation in the system. He then tried to send me to another hotel down the street. However, it was late at night at this point, and I was exhausted, so I asked Quentin if he could find a room for me. I had my reservation in hand, so it was clear that I was not in the wrong. After making a few phone calls to some other hotels, he finally assigned me to a room in the hotel. I asked Quentin how he was able to find another room. He snidely replied that he was only able to do so by taking a room away from a later-arriving customer, so he would have to deny them a room. I also explicitly confirmed with Quentin that the room he had assigned me to was the room that I had indeed contracted for. He responded, \"Yes, and this room is even superior to the other room.\" *BROKEN AIR CONDITIONING* When I arrived in my room, I was dismayed to discover that the air conditioning didn't appear to be working, even though I specifically booked the hotel because it said that it had air conditioning. After calling guest services, I was informed that I should turn on the air conditioning, and wait 15 minutes before calling them back. So I called - and was told that I would be called back in 15 more minutes. After waiting for far more than 15 minutes, and having received no call, I finally called back. And called. And called the front desk. And called. Until I finally got through - and when I spoke to Quentin at the front desk, he seemed totally unsurprised that the air conditioning wasn't working, and simply told me that there was nothing the hotel could do until the next day. Now, this was the middle of summer, and it was swelteringly hot in my room. I was forced to open the windows because it was incredibly hot. Even then, the room was still very hot, and because of the loud street noise consisting of rowdy partygoers that persisted until at least 5 am, I could not sleep at all that night. I had a full day planned the next day, and was exhausted all day because of my lack of sleep. *RUDE RECEPTION MANAGER* The next day, I spoke with Carola, the reception manager. When I calmly told her my story, and about how dismayed I felt at my treatment by Quentin, she interrupted my recounting of the incident at least 3 times, demanding, \"Are you done?\" She actually *ADMITTED* that Quentin had known about the broken air conditioning when he had assigned me to the room. And as for Quentin, she scornfully asked me, \"What do you want me to do - ask him to apologize to you because he knew that the air conditioning was broken?\" Well, Carola, I entered into a contract for a room with a/c - but your hotel breached that contract my giving me a hotel with NO a/c. Moreover, your hotel representative acted in bad faith by lying to me about the lack of a/c. I was so disturbed by Carola's accusatory attitude of denial that I asked to speak to her supervisor. *UNACCEPTABLE CUSTOMER SERVICE* Throughout this whole situation, I received no apologies from Carola or Quentin. It was only when I spoke directly with the director of the hotel that my concerns about shoddy customer service were even addressed. However, the director of the hotel still failed to make me feel like my concerns about shoddy customer service had been adequately addressed. He kept repeating that he had confidence in his staff, and he did not allay my concerns at having been treated poorly, despite NONE of the problems (lost reservation, broken a/c) having been my fault. Perhaps the hotel director's lax management skills has resulted in the unfortunate attitude with which the staff now treats the customers. I have never in my life complained about the customer service I received in a hotel - nor have I ever had to. Even in the smallest B&Bs I stayed in in Italy, I received service with a smile. I selected this hotel based on the positive Tripadvisor reviews as well as the hotel's proximity to Las Ramblas. However, I cannot in good conscience recommend that anyone else stay at this hotel, nor any of the other hotels in the Hoteles Catalonia group, in the future.", "Date": "September 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Delft, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cStylish, good location, friendly staff.

When you first see the Hotel you might think it's quite small but once inside you'll think differently. The staff was nice and helpful and the hotel itself has a a stylish and luxury feel to it. Lot's of wood & marble panels. There is a bar lounge area inside (quite large for a hotel), and on the A-level there's a pool with bar as well. When you stay here make sure you know you way around. There are multiple levels and a second set of elevators that get you to some those. Our room (std. deluxe room) was okay although the bathroom door was located really close to the bed. but the rest of the room was spacious enough. Minibar, an in-room safe (big enough for a laptop), Flatscreen Tv, plenty of closet space are all present in the room. what i particularly liked was the double entree doors so most of the hallway sound is blocked. what I didn't like was that the beds came with a hard mattress. The hotel is located near the Catalonia Square (turn right outside the hotel) and La Rambla (the must-see boulevard) starts right there. all in 5 min radius. Opposite of the hotel is a bus stop for the red-route tourist bus which can take you to all the famous places in the city (get tickets/map at kiosk on Catalonia Square).

I was disappointed, but also surprised. I was surprised by the superb location of this 4* hotel. But disappointed, by the size on my first look. But once inside the hotel, I realised that, I had no reason to be disappointed, as the hotel from the outside, was very misleading, when infact, the hotel is really big! We checked in with no problems, even got a free upgrade. Happy days! The room was fabulous, virtually brand new, with all the mod-cons. Oo, I must mention the shower in our room, one of the best showers I've had in a hotel! Lovely and big, and clean. Perfecto! The location of the hotel couldnt be better, right next to the world famous Ramblas, yet, near enough away so that you dont get all of the hustle and bustle throughout the night. As I write this, I am sat in the hotel's reception/bar/t.v area waiting for our time to come before we can fly home. I will miss this hotel, as I think of all the hotels I've stayed in the world, this is one of the best. One thing I should mention, is the pick-pockets along the Ramblas, although that has nothing to do with the hotel, any one visiting the hotel or area should be aware that they need to bare in mind their security during their visit, might I suggest a bag that you can see and not carrying around lots of money or important travel documents The staff are friendly, and polite, and couldnt do anymore to help us. Another bonus, free wi-fi! The instructions said that we'd only be able to pick it up in this area on the first floor, but I have managed to pick up the signal in my room on the 3rd floor and at the other end of the hotel. To say that I am impressed with this hotel would be an understatement. I have already planned my return visit with some friends.

Despite initial problems with checking into the hotel, we would still strongly recommend it. The room was very comfortable and spacious. I think it is the most comfortable hotel bed ever!

The buffet breakfast selection was second to none. Absolutely fantastic. The location of the hotel was ideal, very central but yet quiet at night when we wanted to sleep. No noise at all.

Our room number was 239 and the room and bathroom were very spacious, the view is not great but we did not go there to sit in the room. The spa is to die for- again very clean. The pool on the roof is a great bonus the staff at the bar particularly one called Festus was a dab hand at the cocktails! The hotel restaurant is a must - top class meal, but you must book beforehand. You must have breakfast at this hotel, everything is so fresh and the choice is great. The location is cental, you leave the hotel and everything is on your doorstep, we were there for 5 days and did not use a cab. The harbour is a 20 minute walk. The designer shops LV, YSL etc are a 15 minute walk but if you are the kind not to venture too far this hotel is ideal.

No bottled water is provided free of charge in the room, but there are plenty of shops nearby to get all you need. The hotel had a small outdoor pool with a pool bar.

Metro stop less than 100m at Universtat. Airport bus only a few hundred meters away. Hard Rock Cafe on the square. Plenty close shopping. I'd stay here again, no hesitation.
