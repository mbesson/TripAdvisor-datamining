Hated the pillow but then does anybody like a pillow that is not his/her own? The only improvement could be that the ceiling fan in the bathroom needs dusting. An added benefit was that there was a computer where people like myself not travelling with a computer etc. could use to check email. Thin walls, but all other guests were very quiet so no problem. Some noise from street but that can't be helped. Breakfast: Wonderful selection - rolls, pastries, cheese, salami, granola, cereal, milk, juice, fruit bowl, yogurt, jams, melba toasts/crackers etc. Everything was fresh. A great way to start the day. Staff: Reserved but always, always, always polite and pleasant. If you ask for help it was forthcoming and excellent. Location: Location! Location!

The hotel also offers a computer station on each floor with free internet. This proved very helpful in confirming subsequent hotel and airline reservations. If you decide to take a gondola ride, we would suggest getting one from near the Santa Maria Formosa church area (a couple of blocks behind the Da Bruno) rather than the Rialto bridge area.

We were tired and cranky from the lack of sleep, train ride, walking, and it was warm that day so by the time we got to the hotel we must have looked pitiful and tired. We walked to the counter where we were greeted by a very polite and helpful desk clerk. He looked at us and walked way. At first I thought \"great, another rude desk clerk\" but to my surprise he came back with two glasses of fresh orange juice and offered them to us. He then proceeded to check us in. He apologized for the lack of elevator and offered to help us with our backs to our room (we declined, it was only one flight of stairs), but the fact that he offered was above and beyond what we expected. The hotel was quite, clean, in a great location, and the staff were incredibly helpful and courteous. The room was a decent size - small, but functionable and certainly not out of place from the rest of Europe. There was a nice sitting area on each floor with access to a computer, a printer, and the internet. The hotel itself would have been enough for me to give it four or five stars, but the extras that came with it -- the friendly staff, the way we were greeted and the attention paid highlight top notch customer service.

We book directly with the hotel, and fly with Ryanair from Stansted to Treviso. Marco Polo airport, served by Easyjet, is closer to Venice proper but we find that the timings aren't quite so convenient. A small (but hopefully useful) piece of advice: Check how long it takes to travel from the airport to the hotel, as you will need to allow this for your return. It's horrible, having just arrived, to be worrying about the journey home, but you won't want to be stranded at Treviso or Marco Polo. However, it's made easier: Coaches are specially timed to coincide with the flights, both inbound and outbound - you simply buy a return ticket to Piazzale Roma (the main bus terminal) when you are still in the airport arrivals hall. The desk is at the end, furthest from the arrivals door (of course !!). You need to validate each ticket in the punching machine at the desk, show it to the coach driver, and retain it for your return journey. This link may be of use: http://europeforvisitors.com/venice/articles/venice_airport_buses.htm You can also purchase multi-use tickets for the Vaporettos (water buses) at the same time, which is extremely convenient to say the least. These similarly need to be validated, but not until the point of boarding your first Vaporetto - just that one time. It's dated and time-stamped at its first use. You then simply present the ticket to an ACTV employee before boarding each Vaporetto to verify its validity. The 72-hour version is good value, but of course it depends on your length of stay. The assistants in the booking desk at the airport arrivals hall will also give you a time-table for your return coach journey. The conveniently-timed airport coaches leave Piazzale Roma from stand D2. Having arrived at the coach drop-off point, make your way across to the Vaporetto landing stages (water-bus stops, basically) and look for the signs for a number 1 or 82 towards The Lido. Your trip towards Da Bruno will be an excellent welcome to the city - you even alight at the famous Rialto Bridge. You may be \"herded\" at Piazzale Roma by a well-meaning Venetian, but he'll be steering you towards the water-taxis. These are very expensive - the Vaporettos are more fun, too. Just look across the bus-station for the ACTV signs - and the yellow Vaporetto pontoons. Do be advised that the water-buses are the most popular form of transport, well-used by the Venetians, and although we're putting hard-earned money into their economy, they seem to forget it when you're struggling to board with baggage. They give none or very little quarter. They're bad enough with each other, so don't take it personally...... It sounds more complicated than it is, but after a few hours you'll be well acquainted with the system. It works well. Although the hotel is well-placed for the main sights, the Vaporettos offer excellent views of the city and should be made good use of. For your return to the airport, allow about 50 minutes to get from the Hotel Da Bruno to the Piazzale Roma for the coach pick-up to the airport. A No. 2 Vaporetto is a little more direct, as it doesn't stop at so many points along the way. If you are in any doubt, speak to one of the guys at Da Bruno, tell him your flight time and number, and he'll check on the Interweb for the coach connecting time. They vary, depending on season, but for example the 1445 flight from Treviso (May 2008) is served by the 1210 coach from Piazzale Roma. We always find Da Bruno to be more than we need - after all, a visit to Venice isn't about looking at the four walls of a hotel room, is it? The excellent location makes it extremely good value for money - and as other reviewers have said, it is centrally placed between San Marco and Ponte Rialto. Yes, the rooms can be a little shady, but that's the nature of Venice - the narrow alleys do make for shadows. The staff will go that extra mile to make your stay as pleasant as possible, and their love and knowledge of the city means that they can advise on just about everything - you only have to ask. I'd gladly mention some names, but to forget any one of them would be an embarrassment. Suffice it to say that the three-star category of this hotel is a little unkind. If you do stay at the Da Bruno, look out for Igor - he has a brilliant sense of humour, and will look after you very well.

In the end, I settled on Hotel da Bruno as the reviews here were very good and it seemed to be very well situated. Also it was much more reasonably priced than all other places located near St Mark's Square. I booked through Venere.com but emailed da Bruno's to confirm this. They were very quick to reply and confirm which was a very good sign. We arrived on Friday 16th March about eleven in the morning after a very early flight from Dublin. We were all a bit tired and very hungry. We were greeted by a man who was very friendly and professional. We were all checked in very quickly and while we were waiting, we were given complimentary glasses of orange juice- a nice touch. We had to bring up our own luggage up to our rooms but that was no big deal as we all only had small hand luggage for the weekend. When we came down from our rooms, we asked the same concierge about somewhere for lunch. We wanted something light to eat.He said he knew the perfect place. We thought we would get directions but instead he came out with us onto the street and brought us to the restaurant, which was a couple of streets away. It was a lovely place called Canaletto which did great Italian food. It was full of locals who were eating lunch. We got the last big table outside. The meal was very tasty. We all had a beer, a pizza and a coffee and it was only 15 Euros each-very reasonable!!! We ended up getting them to book dinner for the first night.They recommended a place called Trattoria alla Scala on Corte lucatello about five or six minutes away. It was a lovely place with very friendly staff and great food. We really enjoyed it and while it was a bit pricey- 70 euros each for starters, mains, dessert, coffee and wine- it was a very good experience and reasonable for Venice. We went to another restaurant called Trattoria della Remigio on our third night based on great reviews in our guide books. That place is very popular with locals and that is normally a good sign. However when we asked our waiter to help us work out the menu- it was all in Italian- and we all spoke only German, English and French between us- he was very unhelpful and dismissive. He spoke very good English so I think he just did'nt really like tourists. We were all very annoyed as we all either work or have worked in catering and are very easy customers. I had read about this double standard of treatment of tourists and locals but thought it was ever-inflated. Its not. Anyway back to the Hotel da Bruno. The rooms are small and very comfortable. The bathrooms are also small but very clean. Breakfast is served from seven until ten every morning beside the lobby. Its continental in Style but very tasty and a good way to start the day. Most placed I have stayed in Europe charge extra for breakfast so its great that it is included in the price. We were all staying on the first and second floors and all our three rooms were very comfortable. We were all very happy with our experience in the da Bruno. The staff on the front desk were all very friendly and very helpful. They all spoke excellent English which is always a bonus. I would definitely recommend the Hotel da Bruno to anyone looking for somewhere clean and central to stay in Venice. Its also great value and as I said before, staffed by very knowledgeable and helpful people. It is less than five minutes to the Grand Canal and the Rialto bridge and six minutes or so to St Mark's Square .", "Date": "March 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location but Room was really Shabby\u201d", "Author": "ElsiMM", "ReviewID": "UR7160546", "Content": "I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think it merit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s such high praises as the reviews it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s received. At best, it should get Average but truly it deserves Below Average. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure if I had the misfortune of getting a really shabby room. But I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say my stay was pleasant. The room was spacious but a bit dreary and dark, decorated in classic Venetian style. It didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel homey and comfortable. The worst part was that the AC blew at best warm air during the hot summer time which made it very unpleasant and the room had a funky odor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c like something old, dirty and wet. The room didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look dirty, but it just made you feel like it was dirty because of the musky sent. The bathroom in our room was OK. The location and the price for the hotel was great, the reception was OK and the breakfast was very standard. The hotel didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a lift. We had to walk up one flight of stairs with our own luggage. I know that with some European budget hotels you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect luxury, large rooms, elevators, spectacular buffet breakfast and other amenities. But I do expect to have a decent room that makes me feel comfortable to sleep at night \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and I felt that Da Bruno was lacking this.", "Date": "March 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Thessaloniki", "Title": "\u201cEXCELLENT!!!\u201d", "Author": "Ichronis", "ReviewID": "UR6616248", "Content": "We stayed at Da Bruno Hotel during Christmas 2006.
