However, I was very happy with the room - a double standard on the 7th floor, the top floor of guest rooms - which was very clean, quiet and comfortable. So much of Dubai is new, & I'm guessing that the Dhow Palace is one of the older hotels as there was evidence of wear and tear in the room but not to a degree that I would adversly comment. The cleaning staff were cheerful, very polite and did an excellent job. All I ever watch on TV is the BBC news channel which was there. The air-con was effective (too effective at times!) and easily adjusted. Our visit was in February and so the temperature was comfortable in Dubai. I suspect that when it hits 50 in summer the air-con is extremely important. The management staff were efficient and helpful without being overly friendly. The couple of small things we needed doing (opening the room safe left locked by the previous guest & replacing a bulb) were attended to immediately. The travel desk is helpful and tickets bought there appear to be the same price as when dealing direct with a tour/activity company. Breakfast was a buffet with a large variety of options, hot & cold, catering for european and asian tastes; the sort of offering that could find you putting on pounds if not careful. The staff, in their sailor themed uniforms, were very attentive, removing used plates etc. as soon as they were finished with. There are several resturants on the ground floor but we only ate in on one evening and used the hotel's main resturant which was, again, a buffet of considerable choice. Our trip was for business and pleasure and some of the time we were using one or two of the numerous business suites which were pretty busy every day. These facilities were good and the coffee and lunchtime refreshments were excellent. Although not in the centre of town and a little way from most of 'the sights', taxis in Dubai are cheap and plentiful and if using a standard taxi (as opposed to a hotel limmo) all are metered and the clock starts at Dh 3.50 - my fares never topped Dh30 (Dh5.4 to 1GBP at the time of travel). Taxis are pretty much always waiting outside. In short a good hotel which I would happily return to and recommend.", "Date": "February 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lagos", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel, close to lovely places like the Dubai Mall, World Trade Centre\u201d", "Author": "Femorata", "ReviewID": "UR124331110", "Content": "Very good hotel, courteous staff, several good restaurants for in hotel dining, clean rooms, good mix of TV programmes, good accessibility to major places of tourist interest.", "Date": "February 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bangalore, India", "Title": "\u201cThis is like again a 3.5star hotel which I can rate\u201d", "Author": "manny m", "ReviewID": "UR124235373", "Content": "good side of the hotel a) the hotel from the exterior and interior looks very charming b) the rooms are also well decorated c) the variety of break fast is really wide and big which I enjoyed very much. d) all facilities of the hotel are working and in good condition e) the hotel staff is friendly f) the location is quite a central location.

After three days i went to reception manager and raised my complain with big shouting and anger he took immediate action and shifted me to another room. when i told him how come they have vacancies while they staff told me there is no vacancies he just kept quiet, which means the staff were lying. one disadvantage of this hotel was the lobby is so crowded of hotel guest because of free wifi in the lobby.The food was fine for breakfast and lunch. overall i wont stay at this hotel again because of the service.", "Date": "November 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Delhi", "Title": "\u201cNot a bad hotel but wireless internet is terrible\u201d", "Author": "NG2010", "ReviewID": "UR119314382", "Content": "I stayed here for business recently.

Room is large, tea/coffee stand, large couch and side chair are super. Did not use the restaurants and was out of the hotel much of time due to business. Neighborhood offers many restaurants near Al Karama and Burjuman metros, and on Mankool Rd. Just near the hotel there is nothing near 100 meters; more of a 5-10 min walk. Metro is awesome to get me to Trade center. It is low cost and clean and well designed. The hotel does what I need and still offers good service. I like the size and facilities and good location.

Let's see whether I was successful: Location: ======= The hotel is located on Kuwait Street, somewhat in \u201eno man\u2019s land\u201c between the \u201cold city center\u201d and the financial district with its beaming skyscrapers, including Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world. It is easy to get to and from DXB airport, the taxi fare is around 25 Dirham / AED (= 7 USD or 5 EUR). An alternative would be to take the metro that departs from DXB airport. That would only cost around 5 AED but you have to walk from either Karama or Khalid Bin Al Waleed metro station (near the upscale Burjuman shopping center) to the hotel, which could take you almost half an hour (and during the extremely hot summer months is absolutely NOT advisable). Of course you could also take a taxi from Khalid Bin Al Waleed metro station to the hotel at 10 AED. So you would wind up paying 15 AED, including the ticket for the metro from the airport to Khalid Bin Al Waled station. In all you would save around 10 AED or 3 USD and you have to decide whether it is really worth the trouble. I recommend simply taking the taxi: not that much more expensive and more convenient. The situation could change however in March 2011 with the opening of the new airport (DWC), the world\u2019s largest which is located pretty much outside the urban area. The surroundings of the hotel are not very inviting: There\u2019s hardly anything interesting within 10 to 15 walking minutes. The only halfway interesting point of interest at night for me was the music room at the Majestic hotel, a live music venue. Otherwise you have to take the taxi (or take the metro if you\u2019re inclined to walk to either one of the two stations of the \u201cgreen line\u201d) to get anywhere interesting. Facilities: ======= The hotel pool looked very nice on the Internet and was actually one factor for me to book the hotel. However I was totally disappointed. The hotel pool is located on the roof of the hotel, no sunshades, very small pool area and so on. In short: If you intend to spending some quality time by the pool at the Dhow Palace than forget booking a room here. The breakfast room was very beautiful, stunning! So was the reception area and the lift. On one of the upper floors there was a small business area with computers with internet access. Didn\u2019t really impress me. WiFi is available also. The Indian night club / lounge called Mehendi offered a more, well, exotic (to put it that way) experience with young women dancing to very very loud Indian pop music to a small crowd of male Arabian guests, drinking vodka or water. The entertainment starts at around 11 PM and continues until the wee hours. Interesting, to say the least. I wouldn\u2019t bring kids or even your wive necessarily to this club however. The Queens Quays bar is half Irish pub, half American sports bar. They serve the usual beer brands as well as other alcoholic drinks from 6.30 PM on. Food too is available there. Staff was very nice and friendly. Recommended. Service: ====== The majority of the staff was OK: Reception people, bar staff, nightclub bouncers, doormen: all were nice and helpful. Only exception maybe was one of the concierges who was useless. Rooms: ====== Nicely furnished standard rooms. Mine had a view to the neighboring hotel, so not really too exciting. Bed mattress, pillows, kingsize bed: everything was lovely! Plasma TV with fair selection of international TV stations. The size of the room was also good. Nice desk, chairs, safe and so on. The bathroom floor wasn\u2019t spotlessly clean, unfortunately. Otherwise cleanliness was not an issue, but that bathroom floor is still on my mind. Rating: ===== The hotel\u2019s website boasts a five star rating (9/15/2010) but on the entrance of the hotel there are only four stars under the hotel logo. I\u2019d say 4 stars are appropriate for the Dhow Palace. At 205 AED / night (without breakfast) that I\u2019ve paid, that\u2019s around 55 USD or 43 Euros, the hotel was a good deal in my mind. Summary: ======== A hotel in a quiet neighborhood not too far away from the (old) airport with a stylish interior, nice rooms, good bars and restaurants and available at good rates already. Would I book the hotel again? Possibly. But maybe next time I look for a hotel in a bit more \"interesting\" area with a real pool.", "Date": "September 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kuwait", "Title": "\u201cGreat for Stopover\u201d", "Author": "MissyQw8", "ReviewID": "UR79473884", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here for a night en route to Australia.

This time, I was set to stay in Jumeriah Emirates Tower at Sheikh Zaiyd but due to Eid I could not get a confirmation from my favourite website (asiatravel.com) and I booked Dhow Palace virtually 40 minutes before flying off to Dubai. And I am so glad I did! Dhow has clearly offered the best value for my money and is amongst the few hotels that serve great food too. When I checked in, due to eid season, there were lot of guests at the reception but thanks to Mr. Juned Syed (the Duty Manager), check-in was 2 minutes deal all in all. I had booked an Admiral room (720) which was quite spacious, rich in decor and gave a very warm feeling. I was at Dhow for first time and still the staff always greeted me by my name each time I passed by. Ordered room service and loved it, so much that even made a repeat dinner order through the room service. If you have been to Dhow and are not eating in the hotel, you are missing on some of the best kept secret recipes in Dubai. The serving size was amazing, I could not handle it all by myself in one go to be honest. Dhow had a theme of a ship which really makes it different from other \u201ctheme-less\u201d hotels. Even the staff is in navy uniform and I wish my kids were accompanying me, they would have really enjoyed it too. I must say from the bell boy to front office to room service to hotel driver DHOW was a very well orchestrated fine music and a smooth sailing. There is something special about DHOW and Captain of the ship (GM) and his entire team deserves to be commended for going really an extra mile in customer delight that I felt each moment of my stay. Location is great, my previous stays were in Sheikh Zaiyed, Marina and one in Deira but the real fun and happening of Dubai down town is where the DHOW is strategically situated (in Bur Dubai). A new space theme park by the name of \u201cZabeel\u201d for kids has recently been inaugurated (Sep 2009) which is virtually few minutes drive away from Dhow Palace.

It has been one of the worst hotel experiences of my life. First of all, I am generally pretty laid back about hotels, but enough has happened this week for me to sign up for a Trip Adviser account just to relay my experience. This is NOT, what-so-ever, by far, even in a fairy tale, a Five Star Hotel. If I didn't see it myself I doubt anyone would believe this experience as it seems like something you would only see in a comedy at the movies. Background: We are traveling as a large group with an 80 room block for business travel. I arrived a night early for a 8 night stay. Room: When I first arrived, I walked by the 5 Star rating outside the hotel. I thought I would be impressed. The room they gave me was a box with no windows and with the internet connection not working. Thinking the cable was unplugged from the wall, I went behind the desk and found an open box of condoms. They quickly upgraded me to the only side of the hotel that actually has nice rooms (the front) and apologized. Room was nice, but the cleanliness of the room left much to be desired. But at least the internet worked at blazing fast speeds of 56KB per second. Restaurants: Half of the restaurants are closed. They website lists six, but all are closed except Docklands, the Italian place, the Indian place, and the bar. They even list signs to these restaurants and their operating times in the lobby on an electronic display. Clearly this hotel has zero attention to detail if you cannot even delete the restaurants from your electronic screen placed at the front of the hotel. Internet and Business Center: They charge you $27 a day to use the internet at speeds slower than a 56KB modem. Completely and utter rip off. We tried to \u201crent\u201d a projector but they said we could only buy one instead. In the hotel book it says \"A/V equipment can be rented at our Business Center. Please contact our Business center to arrange your requirements.\" We called back and mentioned this and again they said they could only have us purchase a projector. Finally, we had to print pages for a business report, I asked where the nearest Kinkos/FedEx or printing location was. *blank stares from the staff* They finally printed it themselves and charged approximately $1 USD per page. Concierge: Complete Clown Show. First, When we first arrived they pointed us to a bar a 10 minute walk from the hotel that was full of prostitutes as \"the place to go\" that is close to the hotel. Second, I tried to get several tour bookings through them and even tried to set up a golf tee time. Each time the \"concierge\" handed the phone to me and I had to talk myself to make the bookings. I finally gave up. Others in our group had similar incompetent experiences with the concierge. It was joked that they might have trouble booking us a glass of water through their own room service. Security: First story: When locked out of my room, I had to get a new key. I went up to front desk and asked for a new key. They gave me one without asking for an ID. Second story: This is might be a five star hotel if you are a sex tourist perhaps. It seems the ladies just walk up to your room and come on in. To make matters even more comical, one of my business partners had two prostitutes ask for the key to their room at 3 AM because they had left something in the safe the night before. They walked in on the sleeping woman and woke her up to have them check the safe. She took a photo just to prove she was not making up the story. She later found out that the ladies handed out a room key without ID. To test the theory, two days later, she went up to the front desk and directly asked for the key to hey room from a new manager. The manager started to hand over the key without checking for ID, until she asked if they were forgetting something. Final story, While having beers late one night, the \u201cnight club\u201d they had downstairs clearly had some very colorful individuals walk through the hotel. Location: Horrible. Construction is directly on the right side of the hotel. Most of the rooms have zero view if they have a window at all. The location, as we found out, is in a more seedy area of the city. To get to Atlantis or downtown the cab drivers knew where to go better than the cars and drivers that the hotel used. They looked nice and the cars were better than cabs, but each time I was in one of the cars, I questioned if the driver really knew where we were going. In one instance, he dropped us off \u00bc mile away from the location we asked him to drop us off at. Straw that broke the camel\u2019s back): Having come back from a business tour, I headed across the street to Burger King with a friend and we came back to the hotel. Sitting on one of the tables in the lobby not associated with any restaurant we were relaxing eating our food. The head manager walked up and asked us if we were guests and asked us to take our food to our rooms as outside food was not allowed in the lobby. I wouldn\u2019t have said anything, but I felt that this hotel had too many problems for this to be a true concern and they did not have any signs posted. He proceeded to argue with me even though I had asked that they make an exception. Completely flabbergasted we both headed to our rooms after having been scolded like we were in high school by the manager. Is this truly how they treat their paying guests? Final verdict: Between complete lack of customer service, location, value, security, and general feeling the entire week, I would give this hotel one star. Why one star? They at least had working toilets.

The only positive remark that I have about this hotel is the food. Tons of choices and the in room dining was delicious. If anyone has ever traveled to Dubai you know that the times are really erratic for flights leaving and arriving etc. We had a stopover on the way to the Maldives and on the way back. Our first stopover the experience was wonderful because the hotel that we stayed at allowed us to checkin early at around 8 am and without us even requesting an upgrade or telling us they were unable to accommodate us at this time (because they didn't have the room category that I paid for available) upgraded us so we could rest. Most hotels in Dubai will accommodate you but this hotel on the other hand is a real stickler for checkin and checkout times. The lady at the desk was so outrageously rude to other members of the staff in front of us, that I was actually appalled. Then she wasn't pleasant to us either. After grumbling about the fact that we were here early all she could is give us a room is a lower category. We were like fine it doesn't matter because we just needed to rest for a 3-4 hours and then leave. The room she gave us had no windows so it felt like a jail. Very small to the point that our bathroom door wouldn't open all the way because it was hitting the toilet. A design issue? I think so. Room Itself: I just felt gross being inside the room. There was funny smell to it, the lights were dim in a room that already felt claustrophobic due to no windows. I have no idea who gives hotels their official rating because hands down this is not a five star hotel. I repeat absolutely not a five star hotel. Can't stress that point enough and it wasn't cheap either. If I was to compare it to a hotel in the United States it is probably more on the likes of a La Quinta maybe, 2 to 2.5 stars at best. The rating for this hotel should be revised. The only reason we stayed there is the first place was because we wanted to be closer to the airport.

However, I feel that it's a little bit untouched. When we checked the room for the first time, some lamps were not working, the TV set in the living room wasn't working, the toilet spray was leaking. But they fixed it right away the next morning. Breakfast were fine. No complaint about it. Al Madina supermarket is just 2 minutes away to the left.

Just make sure you look around and check who's standing there before you. On our 3rd day, one hotel guy with black suit cut our line twice. It seems that he wanted anyone who asked him for a taxi got a taxi first. And thinking those who only asked a bellboy can wait. The second but was the room service. Only tried once. It took them more than 1 hour to prepare a sandwich at 10 pm. The strangest thing, they have menu option from hotel restaurants, not separated menu, but it's clearly inside the room service menu. But when we tried to order that, they say no. We just can choose for room service a la carte. The million dollar question is why they have the restaurants menu on their room service menu then ? The next but is the hotel swimming pool. It's on the rooftop and very small. So it's a little bit packed on the evening. I think that's all I can say about this hotel.

Our room was very spacious with very high ceilings that gave it an airy feel. There was a sofa and two sitting chairs as well as a desk. The bath was a bit small compared to the rest of the room, but the shower was good and the only complaint I have is that the shower/tub was very narrow making it hard to stand in. The room had decent closet space but could use more hangers. There is a safe in every room. Turn down service was provided nightly. The lobby is very nice and the overall decor is good. There is a bar off the lobby and seven restaurants within the hotel. My experience was with only two and I found the food to be quite good. Everyone I spoke with had high praise for the food. The breakfast buffet selection was very large and the food was of good quality. The rooftop pool is rather awkward to get to, but is quite decent, although somewhat small. There is a charge to use the business center for internet, about $4 US for 30 minutes. I saw a spa and hair salon as well. Now, about calling this a 5 Star hotel - it simply isn't. Just looking at it in comparison to other 5 Star locations such as the Grand Hyatt Dubai makes one realize that some strange rating standard is being used. The Dhow Palace strikes me as a decent 3 1/2 star property geared to business users and I've no doubt that is exactly how it would be rated by US (or rest of the world) standards. The best tip I got came from some of the previous reviews. Use the mini-mart that is less than two blocks away to by sodas and snacks for your room. A 12 ounce can of Coke in the lobby cost 12 Dirham, while two 16 ounce Cokes cost me 4 Dirham in the store. Finally, there is virtually no place you can walk to, so taxis are a must. The hotel, and all the other hotels as well, have metered cars available in place of regular taxis. They are fine and safe, however, the meter rates are about TWICE those of regular taxis. If you are taking a short trip, it is probably worth the convenience, but for longer trips, make the effort to get a regular taxi.
