Unfortunately, the hotel was booked at the last minute and I did not get a chance to check Trip Advisor to get reports. It is simply the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. I arrived at the hotel after 12 a.m. after a long trip. The reception was o.k. and the receptionist whilst not the friendliest was efficient. The minute I opened my room the stench of smoke hit me. The room was dark, smelly, dirty, dusty and very dated and dreary. The bathroom had a dated plastic bath, a shower that was a joke and towels that were almost threadbare. I was so tired I decided not to complain and decided to go to bed. The bed was the hardest most uncomfortable bed and I would more than likely have been more comfortable sleeping on the floor. The carpet was simply filthy, stains all over it and it looked as if it hadn't been hoovered in ages. The noise though the night in the hotel was unbearable and the bell from the lift could be heard all down the corridor. After a sleepless night I asked at reception if I could be moved and was told there was no available rooms. The next two nights were the same, and if the hotel hadn't been paid for I would have moved. After reading the previous reviews I will agree with the writer who said there was a question mark over prostitutes. There is definitely an air of seediness about the hotel and the nightclub that is attached to it. A lot of guys seems to turn up and meet up with Filipino women who are employed by the hotel. On the last day I went up to have a look at the pool and it was a tiny bit bigger than my bath - what a joke!!!! I would definitely not recommend this hotel - it is not a 4 star, nor a 3 star nor in fact any star. It is a disgrace and I can't think of one good thing in its favour. Avoid this hotel at all costs.", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Earth", "Title": "\u201cAverage Hotel near Dubai Airport\u201d", "Author": "Jo-Bob_Bob-Bob", "ReviewID": "UR123399248", "Content": "I spent 6 days in Dubai and because my first hotel did not have rooms for my enitre stay, I ended up moving to the Avenue Hotel on Al Rigga St. It is an older hotel and the room is average size. Bathroom looks dated and the tub is plastic, the shower head is on a vertical rod and is supposed to have a way to tighten it, but that is broken and the shower head is stuck at the bottom of the rod, which makes for an uncomfortable angle to take a shower. The toilet seat also is plastic. It was quite cool in Dubai the day I checked into this hotel and there is no heat. I was sitting my my room with very cold feet and wearing my jacket. I called the desk and the service men that came up said there is no heat. The bed is very hard and you can almost feel the springs. There is a balcony but it's locked and not accesible, the noise from the street comes straight through the door to the balcony, also the wind. If I had not already booked this hotel through a third party and paid for the two nights I would have checked out. I just came from Afghanistan where it is 16F and was not wanting to sit freezing in my room in Dubai! I would not recomend this hotel to anyone unless there was nothing else available.", "Date": "January 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubai, United Arab Emirates", "Title": "\u201cQuiet place and pleasant stay\u201d", "Author": "asterisk1964", "ReviewID": "UR122451523", "Content": "Avenue hotel is located on Rigga road close to the Clock Tower,several minutes from Deira City Center Mall and facing the Metro station. Hotel is tupical 4 star city hotel but some guests will rank it with 3. Lobby is very small,but reception works well. Rooms are nice if you stay in dbl as king bed is Ok,but single bed is too small. It seems management make it for dwarfs. Dinning room is opposite the lobby and food is acceptable. Besides there is a steak house on the mezzanine floor and 49ers night club with live band and another bar.

I've been here many times because my company makes me stay here when in Dubai on business. First off the front desk aslways trys to get you to pay in cash. If you refuse and give them your credit card they'll give it back to you saying it's declined and tell you to pay in cash. They have done this to me three different times. I threw a fit all three times telling them to run the card again and for some unknown reason the card went threw the second time all three times. Second, the bars on the second level are full of Asian prostitutes. This hotel is used for American contractors working in Afghanistan while in transit which explains why there are so many prostitutes in this place. Third, the rooms are smokey, dirty and outdated.

The jewellery stall in reception is poor and the salesman kept pestering us to buy something he would not take no for an answer!
