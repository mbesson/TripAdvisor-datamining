To be honest, room was ok - clean and tidy, just what we expected. The only one disappointment was that the last two nights we could smell cigarettes smoke coming from other hotel rooms even thought we were staying on non-smoking floor. Bad I suppose this is bad habit from guests - not staff members fault. The reason why I would not return to this hotel/or recommend this hotel is very rude staff. When we spoke with them and needed some information, they didn't even look at us and just murmured the answer. Only one guy working at the reception was quite nice, he even smiled at us, I couldn't believe it - can't remember what he look like, younger. Other staff members were absolutely unhelpful, made us feel we are not welcome at the hotel. We couldn't wait to check-out, we were even scared to ask any question. The staff never welcomed us with ''good morning'' or ''good evening'' - not even in Italian language, which I don't find very friendly. One evening my husband went to get WiFi codes for the internet + he had to ask so many questions because the guy on the reception wasn't really communicating, he looked like he has got something more important to do instead of paying attention to his hotel guest. My husband was really annoyed by that behavior. On Easter Monday we went for a breakfast at 6.30 (breakfast was served from 6.30 from Mon-to Fri). That day was our last day at the hotel (thanks god), + we had early flight back to the UK. When we came downstairs for a breakfast, we were bit surprised that lights were still off, the staff just shouted at us ''Come back at 7!'' When we asked why the breakfast is not served from 6.30 they didn't answer back + were talking in Italian between each other, just no respect for hotel guests at all, so we went back to the reception not knowing what is happening. Than receptionist explained breakfast is served from 7 am because is bank holiday. Ok, fair enough, but please, put some sign on with this information next time, or even just a phone call to the hotel room would be very helpful. So we thought nothing else could happened to us, it wasn't really true - when we were checking out + paying final bill, the reception staff did not even say goodbye. They just passed us the bill and that was it. They did not even look at us, they did not pay any attention to us at all, not even word saying ''thank you for staying, hope you enjoyed your stay, safe journey home'' not even goodbye! We felt awful. This was our first wedding anniversary! They made us feel they don't want us there!

I would believe they have an inspector to check each room to make sure it\u2019s clean and comfortable. Also, the bed was even missing a bed skirt and the bed is in bad condition. The location was not at the middle of city but 10 minutes away from Rome by taking the taxi and each way cost 12 to 15 euros. Near grocery stores and few restaurants, which is convenient. The only great thing I love and enjoyed about my experience with this property was the breakfast, hands down. There are many selections from pastry, cheese, drinks, and hot meals. Overall, my recommendation if you can spend a little more on your stay I would recommend to stay somewhere else. The location was good but not great. Room doesn\u2019t have the company standards.

Even though it's not right into the center of Rome it's okay for what we needed it for. To be honest: There were better and worse hotels in my life before. The Holiday Inn Express Rome was something in the middle. Our room was clean, the bed had a good size for two people and there was enough space to put our cases aside. As well as that there was a pretty large balcony and tv. I can't say something to the latter because we didn't use it. We weren't lucky and got a room in which we heard the arriving and departing trains from the train station Tuscolana. Because of that it was impossible to open the windows during the nighttime, so the room was all airless and uncomfortable. No good sleeping in there. Breakfast was good, except for the orange juice. If you want to reach the city by train and then go further to the sights you have two options. First there is a metro station within 10 minutes walk from the hotel, named Ponto Lungo, which takes you to Vatican City in short time. Secondly there is the already mentioned train station Tuscolana. From there we went to the historical center of Rome and it has a good rail connection to the airport which was a plus. It's 350 m from the hotel, a 5 minute walk. We didn't use the buses at all. All in all the Holiday Inn Express was okay but nothing special. Nevertheless it was a good starting point for our trip to Rome.

No problem with hot water. - We paid around 60 Euro for the room which is very reasonable when other hotels considered. - The breakfast is complimentary. There were enough choices as well. (a few types of cheese, jams, cereals, yoghurts. Coffee is good, fruit juice is bad) -Staff was helpful. -Coming from the airport is very easy. Just take the train from airport and get off in Tuscolana station. (ticket costs 8 Euro /person) -Bus stop is very near to the hotel like 5 minutes walk and no 85 takes you to the city center. (takes around 25 minutes to reach Colosseum) -The metro station Ponte Lungo is 10 minutes walk. You can reach Vatican directly with this line in 25 minutes. Cons: -It is a classic Holiday Inn Express, don't expect much. -The location is not fancy. (despite some other reviews, we did not have any safety concerns, it seemed a standart residential neighborhood) - It is not in the city center. - Yes, it is near to the railway station but sound of the trains did not bother us much. - There are not safe deposit boxes in the rooms. And Rome is not the best place to carry your valuable belongings with you. Safe deposit boxes are only in reception area.

That award goes to the Mariner Inn in San Simeon, CA, USA. However this is the second worst hotel I've ever stayed at, and the worst outside of the US. The lower level staff were okay but everything else was subpar, especially management. No complaints on the normal breakfast either, I enjoyed the bread and cereal and hot drinks. Also the location isn't that bad as it's in a non-touristy area so you can go to local shops and purchase libations and snacks at non-inflated prices. It's also only a few blocks from two different Subway stations and a block from the train station. Watch out at the train station though, my friend was robbed with distraction technique when they tossed a mud mixture on us and pretended to help clean it up as someone else stole his bag. That's the complete list of the positives here and it clearly isn't very long or detailed. It's not long because there weren't many and it's not detailed because I wouldn't advise anyone to stay here and I'd like to use your time better to illuminate you on the issues this property suffers from. The real issue is the mold, mildew and disregard for the company privacy policy. Let's start with mold and mildew. The bathroom (especially the shower) in my first room had insane amounts of mold and mildew, and I put up with it for three days until IHG Twitter Care was able to force the staff to move me to a new room. The mold and mildew were just two of the problems in our first room. Others include; normal windows despite facing a major rail yard and train station, toilet so close to the wall it was nearly impossible to use, semen and other stains on the floor and walls, including one stain that I'm pretty sure was blood. Absolutely unacceptable at any price point. At no point did the hotel staff apologize for the mold or offer us anything other than a new room which they seemed to have been forced to do from corporate. They didn't even offer to help us move our stuff from one room to the other or even bring the new key to us, I had to go fetch it. There was clearly a general lack of caring. The new room had its share of problems as well. It had similar stains as the first one and also had mold and mildew in the shower, though not to the extent of the other room. This room however only had the Italian electrical outlets which are not like the ones used in the rest of Western Europe -- it is my understanding most Italian hotel rooms (including our first room) have at least one European outlet. This new room was near the street which was actually much quieter. The wood flooring in the hallway made for a lot of noise considering our new location right next to the elevator. These problems were bad but to me the most egregious issue of all was the re-use of pages with customer information for the \"USA Times\" and other quickie newspapers. The backs of these contained information about each guest including name, price paid, and room number. This is a clear privacy violation and extremely upsetting. I was travelling on a freely posted (by a VP at IHG) F&F rate but I still expected to at least get decent treatment and a clean room (really all I needed was a clean room with electricity) and I couldn't even get that. It's amazing to me how different my experience at this hotel was from the only other HI Express I've stayed at in Europe, the Rue d' Italy -- Paris location.

But when it came time to leave the front desk was stilled manned by the night shift who neither read, spoke nor understood English well. Thus I had to pay again for the stay.

MY PROS AND CONS\u2026 PROS: This Hotel is convenience located close to train station Roma Tuscolana ( the one that you take from Fumiccino Airport to Rome) and Ponte Lungo Subway Station. The Breakfast Buffet is included in the rate and, is very good; with different options of food, the schedule for the Breakfast is really convenience, but I will tell you to get earlier in order to get a spot cause sometimes it\u2019s gets crowed.The people that work at the Restaurant are very helpful and courteous. There is a nice courtyard off the lobby and breakfast area. The area is safe (it\u2019s a neighborhood area) so, you will find supermarkets and pharmacies nearby\u2026Rooms are cozy, clean and decent (except for mine that had a leak in the ceiling) , the housekeeping are very courteous and helpful too..If you want to stay for a week I will recommend you to buy a 16 Euros Ticket that is unlimited and you can use to ride the trains and buses ( You can buy it at any store that it has a big \u201cT\u201d sign). The Bus 85 ( which pass close to the Hotel) can take you through Via Appia to the Colisseum and The Trevi Fountain.. Avoid to eat in this Restaurant \u201cPASTARINO\u201d ( it\u2019s close to the Hotel) it\u2019s overprized and the service and food are not really good\u2026 CONS: Well I can say that my experience with the Front Desk Staff was not really pleasant, they practically \u201ctry\u201d to ruin my stay here with their rudeness and lack of Hospitality\u2026My check in was done by Giselle ( who\u2019s not a friendly person), it was so plain and bored\u2026the staff barely speaks English and it\u2019s kind of hard to understand them\u2026 As soon I get the keys I went to my room and I noticed that the desk lamp was burned out, I reported and nothing was done\u2026 During my stay wanted to get a copy of my bill to see how the charges were going, and the Front Desk Agent (I barely remember his name\u2026.I think is Gianpaolo or Giovanni..Something like that) refused to provide the copy that I was asking, all that he kept saying it was \u201c It\u2019s impossible\u201d..???..How hard or impossible is to print out a single copy of a guest\u2019s bill\u2026He said that I will get the copy of the bill at the check out..but ..\u201cHELLO\u201d I wanted to copy of the bill before my check out to check my balance..This guy started arguing with me and he had the nuts to say \u201c I don\u2019t know what\u2019s your problem..You don\u2019t believe me\u201d\u2026.Excuse me??...I didn\u2019t have any problem and I didn\u2019t say that I didn\u2019t believe you, it\u2019s YOU the one that has a problem!!!...after a long argument he ended up printing out the copy of the bill\u2026 At check out wanted to speak with the Front Desk Manager and after I told him about the incident that I had.. he said that \u201c Well everyone has a bad day\u201d\u2026Well\u2026 let me tell you this..In the Hospitality Industry when you work with Guests and Customers and, if you are having a bad day or going through a tough situation, the guest doesn\u2019t need to take your frustration or your problems, whatever you are going through it\u2019s better to leave it in your locker room or in your house..But don\u2019t take it to the guests..Is not professional\u2026 Will stay here again??..May be...", "Date": "October 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Des Moines, Iowa", "Title": "\u201cAverage\u201d", "Author": "BenDSM", "ReviewID": "UR119502297", "Content": "This is an o.k. hotel, but nothing special.

There are 2 train stations nearby. If you come from airport, you should get off at Tuscalano station (must not take non-stop to Termini from airport) which is about 4 min walk (downhill) to the hotel. You can also take metro from Termini (must take a train from airport to Termini) and get off at Furio Camillo with a 12 min walk to hotel (downhill). Puerto Lungo station is what other reviews recommended but it is confusing to get to from hotel (we used Puerto Lungo first but didn't again after we came to know Furio Camillo). There is also a great Pizza place named Magna Pizza that had the best pizza I have ever tested (we went there 4 times during our 5 day stay in Rome and my teenager loved it).

Also, turn left from via Assisi in to via Tuscolona and about 400m further you will find a deli/ cafe that does roast chicken and fries or pizza with a drink starting at about 8.50 euros. The TV only shows Sky News, BBC News and CNN in English but there are the usual movies on demand if you want them. Internet was 2 euors for 30 mins:4 euros for an hour and other prices ending with 40 euros for a week. On leaving the station at Tuscolana there are two exits, one taking you to each side of via Tuscolana. Just make sure that you go under the bridge and via Assisi is 100m on your left. Don't worry about the area as previous reviews have mentioned, we were out at night and there were no problems whatsoever. Its easy to get into central Rome on the no 85 bus. Just buy a ticket from the kiosk at the bus stop at the bottom on the street and validate it on the bus. We bought the 24 hour pass for 4 euros each and it was good value. The bus can get quite busy in the morning so rather than validate it as soon as you get on you can wait till it empties or do it on another bus. The 85 takes you to the Colosseum and you can get connections from there. If you're going to the Vatican then stay on the 85 a couple of stops until Piazza Venezia from where you can get a no 46 which takes you to the Vatican. You will have to cross a couple of the roads going through the Piazza as the stop is on the far side. At the Colosseum beware of the \"Roman soldiers\", they will charge 10 euro for a photo after standing beside you and being all smiles, giving a sword and laurel crown to your children. They will back down if you argue with them but they can be persistent. Also, ensure that everyone have their shoulders and knees covered if you are visiting St Peters Basilica. They are very strict about the dress code for women in particular but it is a place of worship. Also, be wary of where you go to eat around the Vatican.

The problem is their air conditioning did not function all the time. We were without air conditioning for one whole night, the staff at the reception kept telling us it shall be ready in an hour...and never happened. One of our friends had to change their room 3 times during the night as the hotel staffs kept telling them the air condition was working in the other room.... There were power failures at least twice during our stay, one in the morning which took them half hour to fix, the other power failure happened at night around 9:00pm, and it took them almost 3 hours to fix. We were left sitting in the dark with windows opened hearing the annoying train noises for 3 hours! The drainage in the shower was almost blocked, water was at least 2 inches high covering our feet during shower. I called the reception and they sent a man to look at it, the guy had a quick look at the drainage and said \"it's normal\"! \"Normal\"!? - how can it be if water was not draining away!! There were two ice machines on the ground floor and one had a \"out of order\" sign on it. We tried to use the \"good\" one and guess what, we only got 3 cubes of ice in 15 minutes! We asked at the bar and requested some ice, the guy at the bar told us \"There are no ice in the bar!!\" --??

We ask at the reception and the guy told us that he had someone working on it and shall be fixed in an hour....as we expected, never happened, we waited until 11:30am and decided to check out without waiting.

My advice is to stay away from this hotel, we did not expect much from this hotel as this is a 3 star hotel, after the stay, I would guess this is worse than a 1 star!! We stay in Crown Plaza, Holiday Inn and Holiday Inn Express before and found it value for money.

So much so, that in my first trip overseas in 2009, we booked a room at the Holiday Express Inn in London at the Royal Park. Their facility, staff, service & location was outstanding. May of 2010, my folks turned 75. For their birthdays we booked a trip to London, followed by a trip to Rome. We stayed at the same Holiday Inn Express in London and were treated like old friends and VIPs. My folks were thrilled. The Rome facility was an evil mirror image of any other Holiday Inn Express. First, there was graffiti all over the exterior of the hotel, the front desk staff made it appear our checking in was an inconvenience. The rooms we were brought to had to be the worse rooms I'd ever been in, and as a criminal defense investigator, I've visited a lot of seamy, seedy, rat & bug infested rooms. In addition, many of the interviews I conduct are at our local outdated, over booked, under staffed & under budgeted jail. So it takes a lot to shock me. I was shocked, dismayed, sickened, and embarrassed to have booked my folks into this stinking sewer. The rooms were not only unclean, they had mold growing in them, the carpets ragged, worn, old, unclean, with burns. The walls were cracked, poorly plastered over, the vents uneven and full of mold, dust and dirt. You have to pay per hour to watch the 13 inch TV. Internet is overpriced and spotty. The rooms were hot. Adjusting the thermostat did nothing, so I went to the front desk to ask them to move me to a room with air. I was informed that it was \"out\" but \"maybe it will be working tomorrow\". I asked \"maybe, what that does that mean?\" The desk clerk shrugged and said I mean it will be working tomorrow, I have a man working on it now.\" I asked him to direct me to this man, and was informed he wasn't working on it now. I went to the ice machines. One didn't work at all, the other spit out an ice cube every 45 seconds at best. After 5 minutes, I had 6 cubes, and the machine ceased producing. The desk manager's response was maybe tomorrow. I went back to our room, my other half informed me my folks had been able to get their window open. We couldn't. I went back to the desk, on my way down, I noticed doors were being propped open with chairs & shoes. I asked the desk manager if they had any fans. He shrugged his shoulders & mumbled something I later learned was an unkind reference to my mother. I ran into a another family and they'd been stuck there for a few days. They said the air hadn't worked the entire time they'd been there. The manager mostly hid out, and the one staffer who was available was apologetic for the condition of the place but couldn't do anything about it. I called hotel.com who'd booked the rooms for us. We were able to find another hotel (it was Memorial Day Weekend) but it cost us $265 per room to get a refund. Another $800 dollars per room for the rest of our stay which was at a nice Best Western. I can't say enough bad things about this place. How Holiday Inn could allow their name to be on this rat hole is beyond me, and something I plan to find out. I don't know if you can trust the positive reviews about this place. I only wish I'd read reviews about this location ahead of time.

The first thing to say is that this is a Holiday Inn Express - not a Holiday Inn, therefore it is not going to be a 4 star offering, so do not go expecting it to be so, this means there is not likely to be draws etc but a basic open wardrobe with hangers and a shelf which is perfectly adaquate. We found the room size to be large and although our \"double\" bed was 2 single beds pushed together, it was comfortable enough and the double glazing meant that whilst the train noises were heard they certainly were not troublesome in the night, and my girlfried is a rubbish sleeper and slept through them! The bathroom was clean and the shower weas very good with excellent water pressure and a lovely temperature. Breakfast was great, plenty of pastrys, cereal yoghurt etc and lovely fresh coffee from the proper coffee machine. We did not experience any ants or anything of the sort and always left breakfast stuffed! Although the breakfast times were busy and there was a bit of waiting for things to be replenished tihs was not a problem and indeed when a buffet offering is on the table its not really unacceptable when the restaurant is busy to have a little wait every now and again. Having been stuffed at the free breakfast we did not mind the walk to the underground, it is a good 10-15 minute stroll away and contrary to some reports, the area is really not as rough or bad as some have made out, we felt perfectly safe walking at all hours so this was not a problem, although my feet were sore at the end of the holiday from all the walking what with the sight seeing etc. Check in and out of the hotel went smoothly enough and found the staff to be friendly enough. One thing I would improve would be the TV offering - only one English speaking channel was CNN and it was on a loop, bit dull, but then again i wasn't in Rome to sit and watch TV!

The train from/to Fiumicino airport is frequent (even on Sundays) and only EUR5,50 one way. If arriving from the airport by train, at Tuscolana station take the stairs down from the platform, follow the signs for the Via Tuscolana exit and this brings you up on platform 8 (?) then there is a ramp down to Via Tuscolana.

It was easy to get to & from Fiumicino Airport on the ordinary train (not Leornardo Express). Euro 5.5 gets you to Roma Tuscolana station in less than 30 mins. The train may get crowded so sit near the doors and try to get a rail map so you know the order of the stops. The hotel is in the next street to the station (walk onto Tuscolana and turn left at Via Assissi. Hotel is about 200m - an easy walk even with luggage. We had a good sized room for 3 facing the street. Aircon doesn't appear to operate in April (excellent for the environment - perhaps the UK should adopt the same rules) so the rooms can get hot. Its a good idea to manage the temperature by drawing blinds to keep out day-time sun and open the window to cool the room, shutting it before you go to sleep to cut out any street noise (of which there is some but not enough to call a problem). Rooms around the courtyard may be better in this respect. Breakfast was good - typical HIX but made better by attentive staff who made \"real\" coffee to order. Breakfast ran to 10:30 so you didn't have to be up too early. A short, 10 min walk takes you to Ponte Lungo metro station from where you can get anywhere in the city for Euro 1. Great value. Metro visually grottier than London or Paris and trains plastered in graffitti. But they run every three minutes. Its a good service. The city is compact so you can see all the main sights in a day assuming you don't want to go inside the Colloseum, Forum or Vatican etc. There was a limited choice of restaurants in the area of the hotel so a better bet is to find somewhere near a metro station, and eat there before returning to the hotel. Our favourite was Ristorante Al Viminale on Piazza del Viminale. It was the kind of restaurant that couldn\u2019t exist in Britain. An unassuming single table in a side street, a long corridor leading to a back room that probably hasn\u2019t changed in 30 years. The tourist menu was excellent value with bread a starter, pasta, anti pasta and modest dessert for about 12 Euros. The clientele were a mixture of old friends and a big group. Great atmosphere. Walk from Barberini along Via Delle 4 Fontane towards Via Cavour/Termini and it\u2019ll be on your right hand side off the Piazza. Getting back to the hotel was equally simple. the surrounding area is a bit scruffy and very graffitti infested and can look a bit intimidating but we never felt it was a problem. On Tuscolana there are local pizzarias and a nearby chain restaurant Pastarito/Pizzarito and a little supermarket. Limited choice of TV at hotel - only BBC World in English. Theres pay access to the Internet in lobby but we couldn't connect to the payment site so failed to access online check-in for return flights despite the helpful offers of staff to help with the printing. Ultimately it wasn't a problem. BA has self check-in kiosks at the airport which were quick and easy to use. Rome is a beautiful city but we also took the time to visit Ostia Antica - South of the city. 2 metros and a train cost Euro 1! Ostia is a well preserved Roman town and, for history buffs, is mindblowing. Limited interpretation on site (English translations) so if you plan to go, do some internet research - you can print off an English guide to the town which gives more info than the site's information boards . We also went to the beach a few stops further down the line which was interesting but deserted. Romans think April is mid-Winter. I suspect it would have been better to get off in the town of Ostia and walk further to the beach - at least there may have been other things to see. On the return to the airport we went to Termini and, just to be posh, caught the Leornardo Express. Its not worth the extra over the ordinary train ride (which doesn't go from Termini). It cost double (Euro 11) and was only marginally more comfortable and a bit quicker. However, if you're catching teh train at the end of your last day as we were it still makes sense because Termini is so convenient. Rome is a great place for a short break. If you're on a budget the Holiday Inn Express San Giovanni is a good choice.", "Date": "August 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northwich, Cheshire", "Title": "\u201cWasn't sure at first, but great stay\u201d", "Author": "pchristi", "ReviewID": "UR17978955", "Content": "We found the hotel easy enough, at first the location seemed a bit, shall we say, rough.

We wanted to find reasonably priced lodging that was conveniently located to the various sites and places that we would want to visit during our 9-day stay. We chose the San Giovanni Holiday Inn Express, and I have to say that we made an excellent choice. Review: First of all, it's a Holiday Inn Express. This means, of course, that it's pretty much no frills -- functional, but lacking in the architectural beauty (inside or out) of a more quaint local inn. You'll get a clean room that's just big enough to unpack a few things but not overly spacious or extravagant. (Side note: Our room had perfectly functioning A/C, and it was in the mid-80's outside when we visited Rome.) With that said, let me take a moment to extol the virtues of this underrated establishment: 1. Breakfast: As stated in other reviews, you get a full spectrum of breakfast foods -- both hot and cold -- and also beverages from which to choose. I hope they don't change this offering, because it really got us going each morning and was already included in our room rate. 2. Proximity to transportaton: The subway, train station, & bus stops were all within walking distance -- and we used all three to dart around the area. The hotel itself is in the southeastern part of the city and not near any specific monuments or locations you would want to visit. But within 20-30 minutes, we could be anywhere we wanted to be within the great metropolis. Head down from the hotel, across the main street, and slightly uphill for another four blocks and you're at a subway/metro stop. Head down from the hotel, turn right at the main street, and walk under the overpass and then you're right at the entrance to the train station. Head down from the hotel and there on the main street are two bus stops with multiple routes to pick from. Each bus stop sign has all of its various stops listed in big print, so you can pretty easily tell which direction it's heading and where it will take you. Note: Public transportation was so accessible and easy to use that we did not need to take any taxis. 3. Proximity to food: Go slightly up past the hotel and there is a large grocery store on the left. Both up past the hotel (about 3-4 blocks) and down by the main street there are many local (and one chain) restaurants to choose from in various price ranges. There is also a gelatto shop down on the main street. We had no problems finding someplace different each night where we could enjoy a meal after a long day of sightseeing. 4. Helpfulness of staff: We asked a lot of questions of the folks at the front desk, and they were always helpful. As stated in another review, someone on duty always spoke English. They know the best way to get there and will tell you which stop to get off at. They also took and returned my wife's insulin (she's diabetic) each night from their bar fridge when we needed it --without complaint. Final note: The Neighborhood I feel the need to make a comment (or two) about the local neighborhood, since several people on this site have offered their negative opinions. First of all, this hotel is -- as you may have determined by now by my previous comments -- not on the main street. It is slightly uphill from the main drag, about 2-3 blocks. This essentially puts it in a neighborhood where the Italian people live and work. There is a car repair shop within 20 yards. There are apartment buildings all around the hotel. There is the local grocery store about 2 blocks up. There is dog poop all over the sidewalk (Italians living in the apartments take their dogs out and don't clean up after them; sorry, that's just the way all Italians live, not just those living near this hotel). It gets dark and eerily quiet at night -- the few businesses nearby shut down, and people returning from work go into their apartments. If a dark street with dog poop on it scares you, then this hotel is probably not the one for you. It is *not* in a dangerous or scary neighborhood as some folks have claimed. It is just not on a hustling/bustling main drag with lots of lights and cars zooming by. (Note: Some folks, like my wife & I, actually appreciate these more quiet and secluded surroundings.) So once you adjust your expectations, and you realize that the strange man in dark work clothes walking towards you at night is just a local guy returning to his home, then maybe we as tourists can not worry so much and try to fit in.

The hotel offers the best buffet breakfast I've ever had in Europe in a 3 star hotel as part of the room rate...take advantage of it since food is expensive in Rome. Room (207) was immaculately clean and neat, cleanest I've ever had in Europe. The view from the room is not scenic at all but I suspect you're there to see Rome so the room view is probably unimportant. The hotel is in a residential area and we felt safe walking at night. Less than 3/4 mile radius gives you numerous restaurants, banks and grocery stores. The 85 bus stop is less than 1/4 mile. The nearest Metro station approximately 2/3 mile, a 12-15 minute stroll, no problem when we were there but I suspect a bit long in the heat of summer. The hotel is several miles from the central district but public transportation gets you there in approx. 1/2 hour. Be advised: the a/c was turned off at the hotel when we were there in early May. It was cool enough that this wasn't a problem. But I'd ask if the a/c is on before booking a room in summer. I do not know what the temperature need to be before they turn it on. Also note: the hotel backs up to the Tuscolana Train Station. Insulated glass windows block most of the sound but you still hear the muffled sounds of trains when they pass by. They did NOT affect sleep at all. In fact, I wish I knew about the station before arrival. Instead of taking the express train from Fumincino Airport to Termini Station, and then the Metro, and then lugging our bags 2/3 of a mile I would have taken the local train (makes several stops) and gotten off at Tuscolana. Then a short 1/4 mile walk to the hotel. Just note that the local train leaves Fumincino from another part of the airport. Ask about it if you want to take the train. Cost is the same but hassle reduced dramatically. We are independent, budget minded travelers, in our mid-50s, who always book our own trips. We always opt for 3 star hotels in Europe (we save enough by not booking 4 star hotels to afford to stay an extra 1 to 3 days) and this one is my favorite so far (and, I admit, the most expensive as the dollar isn't worth much lately).

We booked it as a last minute weekend break. Overall we were very pleased with the hotel. The location was OK from the airport (Ciampino). As it is outside the city walls it is the cheaper of the two flat rate taxi tariffs from the airport - we got a taxi as we arrived late and wanted to get straight to our hotel and, although fairly expensive, you know what you're paying before you get in so we were happy. On returning to the airport we took the Metro to the end of the line (Anagnina) and then took the airport bus which cost 2 euros each. The hotel location was also fine in terms of public transport into Rome: a 5-10min walk from the metro (N.B. the metro closes early - around 8pm when we were there) which is then only a short journey to the main attractions. We picked up a three day travel card from the train station (Roma Tuscolana) near the hotel (for directions, see below) for around 10 euros each. We only used the metro (from Ponte Lungo metro station: for directions, see below), but previous reviewers have noted the close location of a but stop too. We checked in around 11pm and the staff were helpful. We were very pleased with our room - it was a decent size and with a good sized, comfortable bed and a very good, clean, bright bathroom. The shower in particular was very good. We had no problems with noise as some previous reviewers have said, but this may be because our room was situated towards the front of the hotel with the window backing on to the courtyard - away from the railway lines which are very close by. The air conditioning unit worked and wasn't too noisy. The breakfast was excellent and the staff were very friendly. There was lots to choose from and the breakfast area was bright and inviting. Checking out went smoothly. Our flight left Rome some time after our check out time and so we left our luggage in the secure luggage room near the hotel reception, had some more time in Rome, and collected it later. We were very pleased with this hotel and it was reasonably priced. The location was fine for our purposes - a first time excursion to Rome. However, if you want to be near to the centre of Rome then this location might not suit you and next time I think we'd stay more centrally, but this is no reflection on the hotel itself. Travel: To get to the train station (Roma Tuscolana) you turn right out of the hotel, along to the end of the road and turn right, walking under the railway bridge. Bear right at the next junction and the station is a hundred yards or so on the right. N.B. go to the post office type shop on the right of the entrance, not the ticket counter, to get a travel pass. To get to the metro station (Ponte Lungo), bear left rather than right at the junction after the railway bridge, cross the road (you're aiming for the flower stall on the other side) and follow the street (Via Gela) straight up to the end - the entrance to the metro station is clearly marked at the top of the street. N.B. It's all true what they say about traffic in Rome! - you've just got to put your head down and walk if you want to get anywhere. Don't rush as this tends to mean motorists don't slow down. Just walk at a normal pace - they're (the motorists) used to it. But do be particularily mindful of scooters which tend to skirt around the slowing traffic.", "Date": "March 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGreat breakfast bar!!

Red line metro takes you to several of the major sights including the Vatican; change to the blue line for the Colosseum The hotel itself is clean, well maintained and has reasonably spacious rooms - and is certainly good value for Rome. Rooms are furnished in the usual Holiday Inn style - which is good quality, but hardly typical Italian. The rooms are arranged in three blocks around a central courtyard. This could be nice for evening drinks in summer, but it was October when I stayed, so the area was very quiet. The buffet breakfast has a very good range, including freshly made coffee in all the italian styles. Bar service is available in the evening, but there is no catering on site aside from breakfast. However there is a good range of restaurants within 5 mins walk on the Via Tuscolana, and as these cater mostly to locals the prices are pretty low by Roman standards. Front desk staff all have good english, as do most of the other staff. Only point to note is that the hotel is next to a station - if you want to sleep with the windows open you may need earplugs.

Here's what I can share to anyone thinking about booking this hotel: Rooms are ok. Breakfast good but you'll be quizzed every day on your room # by the same service people who do not speak English. I was sadly surprised being that Rome is a major city and the Holiday Inn is an American hotel chain. The worst thing was every evening after touring this wonderful city we found that this hotel disabled the room magnetic-card keys. I discovered this because I stayed here 3 nights and it happened every night. Each night they gave me a different reason but then I witnessed this happening to other tourists there. I figured they do this for security reasons but they don't tell their customers. Every night we arrived at hotel at 20:30 which is not late. I will write Holiday Inn here in America to inform them of the disabling the room keys. This is unacceptable. Another thing, getting directions was difficult because no one speaks English.

This hotel chain usually gives great quality at low prices and this was no exception. The room was very large and had all the standards. The bathroom was not very large, with a shower, but I wasn't expecting a romantic jacuzzi anyway! Breakfast was included and the buffet was very, very complete, but remember to ask the waiters for your coffee instead of having one from the coffee machine, because this one was disgusting, the other one was much better. The major complaint I had was the distance to the city centre. It is very far. The name San Giovanni comes after San Giovanni in Laterano church, but it's almost 30 minutes walking from there. I knew that and had planed to use the underground, which was usually fine, except for one day when I found it closed because of a public transport strike and I walked for two hours to get to the Vatican!! (I took pics along the way so it wasn't that bad but imagine, it was very sunny and warm). By the way, if you take this hotel, you should know how to get there by underground the first time. From Termini you take line A and get off at Ponte Lungo. But the problem here is that there are several gates to the streets and you can get lost if you don't take the right one, so be careful: In the station, go always left (I think you have to turn left twice after you check out with the ticket) and then, you will find two steps up to the street, one left and one right. There you have to take the right one, marked as VIA GELA. You climb the steps and go straight till you cross the street and turn right (you'll leave a supermarket at your left side and go under a bridge). Go on for about fifty meters after you leave the bridge and you'll find Via Assisi at your left. The hotel is the building you can see with flags at the door. Just go up the street and you're done! I don't recommend this way if you're carrying heavy suitcases but with trolleys it's fine.

The first visit was very pleasant. We arrived a little early and were given a room right away. I had requested to be away from the tracks based on earlier reviews and was given room 108 facing the courtyard with a small balcony. Floriana checked us in and she was very friendly and very helpful. Nice room, clean but the shower door was off it's track so that caused water to get on the bathroom floor. I couldn't find anything in the room listing how to call the front desk so I mentioned the door when I checked out but they didn't make much of it so it's probably still broken. Overall, the first night was very pleasant. We left for one night to visit another area and returned to check in on July 12. After waiting for one person to check in and a long conversation between a guest and the front desk we were greeted by Nunzia - not friendly or helpful. She bordered on being rude. Maybe she was just having a bad day but maybe not since others seem to find the staff here unfriendly too. I had reserved a double with a sleeper sofa and requested a room away from the tracks and was given a small double room (can't remember the number but it had steps going down to the bed from the door and up to the bathroom) so I went back down and waited for Nunzia to check in someone else then asked if I could have the room I had reserved. She said none were available so I asked for a room without steps because I was afraid I'd trip in the middle of the night if I got up. After at least 10 minutes of talking to her manager (in Italian of course since she seemed to have a lot of difficulty understanding english) she said she had no rooms like I had reserved and she could give us another double room but she wanted me to wait until she checked in the line of people that had accumulated in the lobby and were waiting behind us. I said no, I waited my turn twice previously and I was already there so please finish us before moving on. She didn't like that I guess so she gave us a noisy room that had a lot of water damage on the furniture (maybe a past leak somewhere?) that was so tiny you could barely get around the bed. It was room 114 so be aware if you're assigned this room that you pretty much have to crawl over the bed to get to the side next to the window. Breakfast was the good point for this hotel, good variety, plenty there to eat. It's about a 10 minute walk from the Ponte Lungo metro stop. Via Assisi is not named that until it crosses Via Tuscolana so if you're looking for that street name after leaving the metro stop you won't find it. Walk past the Gymnasium ( on your left as you exit the metro) and turn left at the end of the block and go to the bottom of the hill. Turn right and go under the bridge and the next left (at the light) is Via Assisi. There is a crosswalk at the intersection but watch for scooters - they don't always wait for you to cross if they're turning onto Via Tuscolana.", "Date": "July 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, UK", "Title": "\u201cExcellent value\u201d", "Author": "Col007", "ReviewID": "UR8083608", "Content": "We stayed in this hotel as a group of 50 work colleagues in June 07. I initially booked this because of the high cost of staying in the City centre of Rome. I can not comment about how good or bad it is to get from Campino airport as I had organised our own private coach to collect us and take us back. However what I can say is for what you pay at this hotel you can not go wrong. After arriving earlier that the advertised room time of 2pm we all sat in the bar and as rooms became ready we were all given keys-etc. The rooms are typical Holiday Inn Express clean, nicely decorated, nice bathroom, air-con, TV, coffee tea massive king size bed etc etc. The staff were very friendly and helpful and as mentioned in earlier reviews the breakfasts are brilliant, a lot more choice than the UK EHI's. If you can't find anything to eat from the mountains of fresh fruit, cereal, scrambled eggs, bacon, cakes, breads, yorgart fresh milk , orange juice, grapefruit juice, coffee, tea ...need I say any more!! The hotel itself is in a suburban area approx 2 miles from the city centre. Buses as described earlier in the reviews are every few minutes and stop at the bottom of the road (20 mins into the centre but it's well worth using once or twice to see some of the sights you might not otherwise see. Use Bus 85 to get to the centre (turn right out of the hotel to the bottom of the street turn right again and you will see the bus stop in front of you by the newsagents. THIS IS THE BEST WAY TO GO TO THE COLOSSEUM AS THE BUS PASSES RIGHT BY IT AND THE TREVI FOUNTAIN IS VERY NEAR THE TERMINUS. The metro station is a ten minute walk and although other reviews tell you to turn right at the bottom of the road, we found that if you cross straight over at the bottom instead of turning right walk up the road to the top (next main road) cross over this road and then walk right along it this will take you right to the metro steps and there are many shops, stall and markets up there. This area on a night is alight with local pizzeria, restaurants etc, all of which speak very little English which was fantastic as we didn't know any Italian!! (I now reallise how ignorant we are as english to other languages but had some fun having to fend for ourselves) 2 pizzerias you need to know about up here which were fantastic and were all heaving. The first is when you get to the bottom of the road from the hotel, cross over and carry on walking up hill. About half way up on the right hand side tucked in at the end of a Cul-De-sac between the apartments. (I can't remember any of the names you you will find them easy enough, this one has a green light outside across the front of the place with people sat outside also) Also the second one is further up this hill to the second road and instead of turning right to the metro go straight across onto the precinct you can't miss this place on the right there must have been 150 people inside and outside. We had a short wait for this one but it was fantastic to eat with local families and the food was superb. We are already planning a revisit for next year and without doubt if a small amount of walking does not put you off stay at this holiday inn express, save some money and buy yourself something nice instead of wasting it in the centre on a hotel, and as they always say \"when in Rome\" this is the way to try it!! Don't let the reviews of this being a 1* hotel put you off you won't have time to spend in your room anyway if you want to see everything that Rome has to offer.

Anyway we had no air conditioning our last three nights there. We had to have our windows open in the evenings, luckily trains weren't that frequent. The staff was about as unfriendly as you can get. They pretty much gave a poor impression of the Roman people and the whole experience there makes me think twice about visiting Rome again. Finally, I never realized how ghetto-looking Rome was in and around the city. This neighborhood is covered with graffiti. As you make your way from the train station to the hotel you pass by graffiti and dog poop that litters the sidewalks. I guess the locals don't care that much about their neighborhood.

We arrived at 12.30pm and asked for a quiet room on a high floor and was given the last room on the top floor which was huge and silent throughout our 5 day stay. We flew into Ciampino airport - caught CONTRAL bus (1 euro + 1 euro for large luggage) which took around 40 minutes to Metro line, then got metro (1 euro) to Pointe Lungo - 15 minutes - easy, quick and cheap. It is not in the best looking area, but we never once felt unsafe whilst walking around. We even walked back to the hotel from Termini on the first night as we weren't savvy with the bus/train situation - this took just over 1 hour. As other reviewers have said the metro is much quicker than the 85 bus, although the trains stop at 9.30pm as works are being carried out (building metro line C so expect this will go on for a while). The 16 and 85 bus run until 12 at night. There is a supermarket called Todis just under the railway bridge which is super cheap - 12 bottles of 0.5 litre water for 1.50 euros!! which is the same price as 1 bottle in central Rome. they also sell huge fans for 12 euros - handy if the air con is off! I was a bit disappointed with breakfast following the rave reviews - it wasn't great - well not if you're british anyway! cold meats/cheeses, pastries, pizza, sandwiches and desserts such as blamange and pineapple upside down pudding! There is cereal and scrambled eggs and european style streaky bacon, but no toast/toast maker. However 'when in Rome'... I was eating puddings for breakfast by day 3! Tried the recommended restaurant Torquiti, it was just ok, no English is spoken but we had a phrasebook so just about managed. Our food wasn't great but we might have just ordered the wrong thing. It was pretty expensive as well - we ate in Ciampo de'Flori cheaper at a traditional little Italian and the food was out of this world!

The hotel is very clean, comfortable and in a nice area outside rome called Tuscolona (its about two metro stops from San Giovanni iteself - and the Cathedral there - not within walking distance). The room istelf had only two English Channels, CNN and MTV but Movies were 11 euros and were in English. Breakfast was very nice, lots of choice and run from 6.30-10.30 Mon-Sat and 7.30-11.30 Sun. The hotel bar isnt very well stocked, each time we tried to get a drink they had ran out of wine, orange juice etc. They also ran out of milk sachets so we couldnt make tea / coffee in the room. The aircon also broke while we were there - however dont let this put you off as the hotel itself is very pleasant, modern and clean - staff are very nice and speak good english. To get around Rome you need to use public transport. To go to San Giovanni Cathedral, Colloseum, Forum, Trevi Fountain - get the 85 Bus (turn right out of the hotel doors, go down the street, turn right onto Via Tuscolona and you will see the bus stop). There is a news agent stand where you can buy your tickets, 1 euro for 75mins from the moment you validated your ticket (you must buy a ticket, get on the bus at the back doors, put your ticket into the little machine to validate it, and when you get off the bus, press the button to stop and get off the front doors). The 75 min ticket is valid for unlimited bus journeys and one metro journey. However, its best to buy a one day, two day, three day pass etc. that you can use on any bus or metro. The bus 85 runs to at least 11.30pm, possibly longer. To get to San Giovanni, Trevi Fountain by metro (both stops named as per the attractions) instead of the bus 85 and also to get to the following sights, Spanish Steps (Stop Spagna) Vatican Museums (Stop Cipro) St Peters Basillica (Stop Ottavia) get the Metro (from Punto Lungo near the hotel). To get to this stop turn right out of the hotel, go down the street, turn right onto Via Tuscolona, go under the rail bridge past the flower stall and take the left turning after the flower stall, go up to the top of the road and you will see the Metro there. (red line A - it will also take you to and from the Termini in about 7 stops, 10 mins). The metro shuts at 11.30pm (opens 5.30am) and is by far the quickest and easiest way to get around. From the hotel to the Vatican City (furthest away point in rome) its only 20mins. They are the only two methods of transport you will need. You can walk to everywhere else from the stops that I mentioned. We flew to Ciampino and could have got a cheap bus ticket to the Termini then hopped on the metro. However we got a taxi which was 50 Euros each way (four people in a luxury mini van with two piceces of luggage each). We pre-booked this but there is lots of taxi's outside and a luxury taxi desk just inside arrivals where you can get one there. We ate in two restaurants near to the hotel. The best one was called Torquito. Turn right out of the hotel, go to the bottom of the road, turn left onto Tuscolona and walk for 10 mins straight up the road - the restaurant is on the right hand side of the road, just down a side street although the Taverna Torquito neon sign is clearly visable from the main road. Not much english is spoken, they sell pasta and steaks etc. but the service is very good and food is excellent. Its less pricy than rome (18 Euros for a good fillet steak) and more enjoyable. If you want to eat in Rome there are plenty of places aroudd the trevi fountain / pantheon area - and you can then get the bus back from the bus terminal near trevi fountain or the metro. Piazza Navona a 5 min walk from the Pantheon has lots of nice restaurants, but they are the most expensive in Rome.

The information i gathered from the tripadvisor website was invaluable, and the fact that i was taking my wife, who is 5 months pregnant for a short weekend away, it was more important to not really waste time or have any undue stress imposed on us. The directions that i took with me from a previous reviewer (Thanks Papaya9!), could not have been more precise and the journey from Airport to Hotel was easy, convenient and hassle free. As we had arrived at 8 in the evening, we were effortlessly checked-in, and were in our room within minutes of walking in through the main doors. We too tried a local restaurant, Sacco, within walking distance of the hotel ( and i mean an easy walk as do not forget I am with my pregnant wife here ) and the meal was fantastic, real great italian food, good service and a wonderful environment to be in. Also, as we were tired from the travelling, it was an ideal place to spend our first night in. With regards to getting around, the metro is a 10 minute walk away, the bus stop for the number 85 is at the bottom of the road that the hotel is on, both with easy and good connections to most of the places you would wish to go to in Rome. Visiting the sites was easy, although please be prepared for the queues. and a word of advice here: do check the opening times of the sites you wish to visit as we were caught short with the Cistine Chapel, which closed at 13:30 on the day we tried to visit, but as we couldn't get in it gives us a reason to head back again. With regards to getting back to the hotel, again the bus and metro is great, but should you need to use a taxi, look to pay around 10 euros, which is not a bad price to pay if it allows you to enjoy more of your time in the centre. We were also lucky to be told about the Travestere area, which has some really good restaurants in, and we stumbled across one, with the same name as the area, that was full of the locals, and we used that as a good sign as to how good it was. Boy, were we glad we gave it a go. The food was the best, the place had a powerful atmosphere and we actually ended up staying till closing, which is something impressive when you have a 5 month pregnant women enjoying the spoils of the night as companion. Back onto the hotel, the room are clean, the bathrooms clean yet small, but with nice hot showers. Don't expect panaramic views of Rome from your room. The breakfast was just great, looked after by a couple of lovely ladies. They make fresh capuccino's for you, and there is also a hot food selection available too. One thing is that there is no tip box in the breakfast lounge, so you either have to leave them something at the table or you don't. The hotel manager should take note and place a tip box there so one can show their appreciation for what the ladies provide in the morning.

The hotel was an excellent bargain by Rome standards: we got the 14 day advance rate, which is restrictive but cheap, everything in the hotel is brand new, and yes, in addition to a great breakfast you also get a real espresso or capuccino made on the spot. The area is pretty decent and safe, there are people on the streets at least until 11 pm and there are places to eat and shop nearby. I was perfectly happy with the hotel and would definitely stay there again if I had a similar budget. While far from the center, indeed far even from San Giovanni in Laterano (two metro stops) where the city walls are, the hotel has good commuter connections. First, the nearby suburban railway (Tuscolana station) will get you to the airport at half price the price of the Leonardo Express to Termini, in the same time, and you will not have to change trains, plus it runs every 15 rather than 30 minutes on weekdays. It will also get you to Trastevere (a tram will get you closer to the center of trastevere) and various places around Rome. The second option is bus 85 to the center, with a stop right next to the suburban railway. As long as you avoid the rush hours of Rome, the bus is quite OK. The only trouble is that even though it runs until past 11 pm, there are few buses in the evening (e.g. every 30-40 minutes after 9 pm), so make sure you find out what the schedule is if you do not want to spend your time at the bus stop. The third option, which is normally the best, is the subway. Ponte Lungo station is 2 blocks away from the bus stop / commuter train station, and definitely worth the less than 5 min extra walking time. Metro line B will take you to a more central place from where you can walk or take a bus to the historic center (the subway does not run through the history center proper), or to Piazza di Spagna, Piazza del Popolo or close to the Vatican and St. Peter's. Trains run every 3-5 minutes, and get you everywhere so fast that I would have never taken the 85 bus if not for the subway issue mentioned below. The only bad news is that currently the subway stops service at 9 pm due to ongoing work on the lines, therefore you either have to return early to the hotel area, wait for the bus or take a taxi. In case of a bus/metro strike you will need to take a taxi anyway, as you cannot walk anywhere interesting. The taxi should cost between 10 (to the Coloseum) and 20 (to the Vatican), so it's not that expensive, but if you use it daily, maybe you should stay closer to the center and pay extra.", "Date": "January 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "mclean, va", "Title": "\u201cReally great breakfast!\u201d", "Author": "mira74bela", "ReviewID": "UR6541708", "Content": "According to all of the reviews, the holiday inn is great and it was.

There is fresh scrambled eggs, sausage and ham, all sorts of pastries, a fresh loaf of bread, yogurt (individual and large) and cereal. Coffee is fresh by the cup as well as grapefruit juice and orange juice. If you want a cappucino, you can ask and they will bring it to your table.

Follow the directions on the hotel website and you will get there from the airport. If you are leaving at a difficult time, the hotel will arrange transportation to the airport for 50 euro. We usually stayed out all day long and took a cab home. If you say, \"via assissi and tuscoluna\" they can find it. We took cabs from Trastevere, Pantheon and near Piazza de spagna. All the rides were 10 euro. It's a quick walk around the block to the bus which you want to take towards San Silvestro #85.

The girls who set it up and maintain it are great. If you ask for a cappucino they make it so beautifully. I was disappointed that nobody ever left tips for them, since they do such a nice job. If you stay here be nice and leave a euro for them! They are great. The room was adequate, modern, and clean. The walls are a little bit on the thin side as we heard some clueless Russian women next door who once stayed up all night, but this was the only negative! This hotel is VERY easy to get to, even though it was a little confusing to find with what was written in prior reviews here. Don't ever think that this is difficult--so easy! When you arrive at the airport, look for the signs that direct you to the train station. You may want to pick up some money at the Bancomat ATM before you leave the terminal! Purchase your tickets at the ticket counter with the red motif surrounding it on the left as soon as you walk into the station. Look for the Orte-Fara Sabina Train. Take this train to the Tuscolana station after 35 minutes. When you get off the train, turn right and walk for about 25 ft to stairs going down. Take a left at the bottom of the stairs, walk straight back to the end and make a right up another flight of stairs. It will look a little scary when you step out of the stairwell, but rest assured its not as bad as it looks. Now follow the little path that arcs down and left. Turn left when you reach street level, and make the next left up Via Assisi. The hotel is about 100 ft on the left. Going to the sights is just as easy.

They are just written poorly and really there are TWO train stations near this hotel. Tuscolana is the commuter train which will get you to Fumincino (FCO) and Ponte Lugo is the Metro train that is somewhat nearby. To get to the main attractions in Rome, you heavily rely on the public transportation near the hotel. The 85 busline runs right by the big side street near the hotel and that goes through one of the main veins through Rome (right by the Colosseum). Its not close to anything but the transportation can get you there!!! My husband and I never had to jump in a cab there as we really loved the public transportation (you do have to get used to the tons and tons of graffitti on the public vehicles though!!) The Metro station (to be honest) is not that close but it is useful when you need to make the trek to St. Peter's Basilica. All in all the breakfast was fantastic and the staff was so friendly and accomodating.

Since I had been there before I got the task of finding a hotel. Finding a hotel for 24 people in central Rome in October turned out to be quite a difficult task. Many of the centrally located hotels are smaller and many were fully booked. In the end we decided to stay at Express By Holiday Inn San Giovanni located at Via Assisi 53. We had to pay 125 \u20ac per room. Arriving in Rome We landed in Rome at about 11 am in the morning of October 21st. We walked over to the train station at Leonardo da Vinci airport also known as Fiumicino (FCO). From here you can take the Leonardo Express to Termini but since the hotel is located on the way we decided to go for a local train direction Orte-Fara Sabina for 5 \u20ac and after about 30-40 we reached the train station Rome Tuscolana. It was easy to find the hotel\u2026we just followed the instructions from the hotel web site and it was only a 5-10 minute walk. The room I got a room on the first floor and the room itself must be one of the nicest rooms that I have seen in a 1 star hotel. The room was standard size with a blue carpet and yellow/light walls. The double bed was comfortable enough but there was only a blanket as a cover so it got a bit cold at night. There was an air con control on the wall but it didn\u2019t seem like it was operational because nothing happened when I turned the knobs. There was also a desk and a chair in the room and a small color TV with some Italian, German and English channels. There was also quite a lot of hangers and that was useful since I had brought along a number of tops. I got a room for disabled people (is that the politically correct term?) and the bathroom was a bit strange due to this. The bathroom was tiled with white tiles and had a shower corner with a curtain to avoid spilling the water all over the room. There were no little bottles with shampoo etc that you find at some hotels\u2026only a big Dove shower soap container on the wall. The drawbacks with the room in my opinion are the lack of a safe, lack of mini bar, the shower curtain and the view. From the ground floor I just looked right out on a concrete wall. Behind this wall or nearby was the railway and I was fearing that the noise would keep me up all night. But it was not as bad as I thought. The breakfast buffet was good with a selection of the standard bread, cereal, fruits and sweet cakes. The best of it all was the coffee machine that was in the room. It was possible to get a fresh made espresso, cappuccino etc and the coffee was great. The hotel has a nice inner courtyard that we used in connections with meetings that we had, for having a drink outside at night etc. I hope that we didn\u2019t make to much noise because some of the rooms do face the courtyard. The reception area was small but there is a small bar there were you can get something to drink (beer, wine, coffee etc) and there is also a PC where you can access the internet for a few Euros. The hotel has a wireless internet so if you bring your laptop you can get online for a fee. Location The area around the hotel is not that exciting but it was pretty easy to get into town. We normally took the metro and the nearest metro station is Ponte Lungo which is a 10 minute walk from the hotel. On line A you can reach Termini (to switch to get to Collosseum), Spagna (the Spanish Steps), Barberini (Trevi fountain) etc. A taxi back to the hotel at night was not that expensive either\u2026I think we paid about 10-15 \u20ac. Conclusion We paid 125 \u20ac for the rooms and for a 1 star hotel the standard was very good. The service from the staff was also great. The \u201cproblem\u201d with this hotel is the location related to the city and the minor drawbacks that I have mentioned already in this review. If you can\u2019t find a hotel in town this is absolutely a good alternative.
