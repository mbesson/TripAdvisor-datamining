The zero stars place is about 50 years old without any renovation. The front desk staff know about the conditions of the rooms, but will not tell you. We got a 3 bed room. First everything was old, smelly and dirty. Bed sheets where new at least. I hope we have not taken any fungi from the bathtub. We had reservations for 3 nights, that we immediatelly cancelled. The hotel in located in a residential area without any attraction. Even for one night is not acceptable, but we had to stay because the reservation policy. It tooked 30 minutes to go back to downtown using bus number 22. I will not even pay a penny for this place and cost us 137\u9227?, about US$200 for this nasty experiece. DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT THIS PLACE, spend a little more and stay in another place. You will save in your health, vaction time, and enjoyment. If you are going to Florence, you have the money to stay in a good place.

The photos on the website are enhanced to show the hotel in a good light and the garden they talk about is the car park- mostly concrete with a couple of trees. I stayed there with my two children under five and the garden was not suitable at all for them. The rooms were run down, the bathroom was very small, very smelly, no bath, and the shower did not have a tray, so the water just poured onto the floor in a corner of the bathroom, but because it was so small and the curtain so inadecuate it meant that the whole bathroom got wet and very very slippy. The bedrooms were very noisy - you could hear the sound from other bedrooms as if they were in your own room. The worst thing was that we were woken up at 3 o'clock in the morning by a bunch of men shouting and screaming in the bedroom above....The area is not very nice. Nothing much to do, and quite far from the city centre. I went to the local park with my children and I was a little uneasy about the people walking about. I would certainly not recommend it at all.", "Date": "Jun 27, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR307062196", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "moga1967"}, {"Content": "This place stinks! We stayed at this hotel as part of our Contiki bus trip round europe. This hotel had to be the worst place i have ever stayed at! The rooms look nothing like what was published on the website for a start. The worst part of our stay was the terrible smell that permiated the rooms from the bathroom - it was the smell of raw sewerage - and was so bad i had to hold my breath while using the bathroom. The shower was also quite interesting to try and use - using it flooded the whole bathroom and was quite an unpleasant experience.

The photos of this hotel on some Web sites have been altered and greatly enhanced. This hotel is 3 km (not .7 miles) from City Centre, a 25 minute bus ride from a questionably safe bus stop. The hotel is in the center of what I would call a semi-ghetto. The room views are of the backs of the semi-ghetto apartments with laundry and various and sundry other things hanging from the windows. There are no restaurants that we could find within 15 minutes walking distance in either direction. While making these walks, we were met with multiple gangs, and fortunately were not hurt, but were followed. The hotel is dirty and smelly. The hallways are very dark. The rooms are at best, equivalent to run down dormitories. The walls are tissue paper thin and you can actually hear people in the next room unzipping their clothes, sounds like they are right in your room with you. There are no amenities, despite what some of the Web sites say. And as if things couldn't get worse, the room was mosquito-infested. There was much previous evidence of this in the form of dead and bloody mosquitos squished all over the dirty walls. The light in the room had a burnt out bulb and they were not able to replace it. We did not sleep the entire night and tried desperately to relocate, but there were 40,000 extra people in town for the Women's fashion Expo. We did however just leave the next morning. This hotel is your worst traveler's nightmare!!!
