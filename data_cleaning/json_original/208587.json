Let me explain that both experiences were completely different. Hotel Toledano is really a HOSTAL, so if you're used to staying at hostales or pensiones in Spain there will be no problems. El Toledano provides a TV, bed, desk, airconditioning (a rarity, really, even if it spits out air at 85 F), and a bathroom with hot water. The first time we stayed, we were in a room overlooking the \"Rambla\" with a balcony. IT was a great room. We had a great experience. This past summer we stayed in the smallest double I have ever seen in my life. There was a little tiny window facing a wall, \"airconditoning\" that, quite honestly, was necessary because the window would have offerend no ventilation. A bathroom that probably would break fire stafety standards even in Spain. Mold all over the bathroom. One foot of space around the bed to WALK or PUT YOUR SUITCASE, not both at the same time. A TV and a very dirty comfortor on the bed. Since it was a hostal, and we paid only 45 euros a night, I accepted these conditions. When I complained to the staff after the first night- the sheets were not changed, the comfortor rolled up in a ball and placed under the DESK, the bathroom not cleaned properly, I was met with indignation. It IS a family run business, and of course the person at the desk will defend his family. Understandable. I will not stay here again unless I can get room with the balcony overlooking the Ramblas.
