I was really pleased with the hotel staff and the cleanliness of the room. I slept soundly with no outside noise and the room was large enough to accomodate our five suitcases and other bags. We spent the night here before our trip to Hawaii and I was so impressed that again I spent a night when I had to return unexpectedly to Seattle on my own. I felt like the staff really cared about their guests by offering suggestions for close places to eat and just being friendly, yet professional. I felt completely safe during my stay and I returned two days later when my flight was cancelled due to bad weather in Texas. I really appreciated the manager for extending my checkout time a little to finish repacking those five suitcases. My only complaints would be the fact that there was only one washcloth per room, even if it had two beds. I also would have liked the parking lot elevator to be a bit cleaner. I am not sure how often they check it out, or if they have enough cleaning staff, but it needed attention.

You get what you pay for here - the rooms were decent (if a little large for what was in them - lots of space for luggage or even another bed) and clean. I noticed a few narrow places where it looked like they couldn't get the vacuum in very well but the bathroom was great and the sheets and bedding were clean. Service was excellent and the front desk got us settled very quickly and even offered to provide us with shuttle service to a restaurant if we needed it (we decided to walk). I slept fairly well (although others in our group did not). The bed was \"firm\" and had the feel of being a solid budget mattress (no pillow top here but not sagging either). The pillows were OK - I like flatter pillows and these were pretty puffy but not super firm so they flattened out nicely. My only complaint would be the sheets and blankets - the sheets seemed pretty thin and had a worn feel to them, the blankets were obviously fairly low quality polyester. But for the price wasn't expecting more - for an overnight budget trip or a night before a flight they were fine. Room was cold when we arrived (heat not on) but warmed up pretty quick. No problem with noise from other rooms or flights. Bathroom looked like it had had a basic Bathfitter's reno with a few extra touches. My only complaint was the complimentary soap and shampoo - really didn't smell too good, kind of a Dollar Store feel and smell to it. Make sure to bring your own! Wireless was excellent - had no problem connecting with my MacBook. Great signal and good bandwidth. Other facilities like the business lounge (?) and the fitness room were pretty basic. Don't book this hotel solely for the fitness room as you'll be very disappointed : ). Coffee only in the morning, no continental breakfast. Several restaurants nearby within walking distance. We ate breakfast at the Denny's a couple of blocks down and had dinner at pub further down. Overall this was good value for the money - basic overnighter hotel.

We arrived at the hotel after 11pm and did not experience any problems checking in. However, parking was a hassle since we had 2 cars filled with furniture and other personal belongings. Parking is FREE but the parking lot was full except for one spot near the street, so we had to find somewhere to park our other car. The front desk lady told me about the commercial parking lot right across the street - I guess they have an agreement with them for overflow parking. The process went something like this: The commercial lot would give me a parking ticket, I leave the car and keys for them to park it, then I would show the ticket to the front desk the next morning to get a receipt, and then I present the receipt to the commercial lot so I don't have to pay for parking. I was kind of disappointed that there were no parking spaces left at the hotel, but I was prepared for it after reading someone else's review on Tripadvisor. The commercial parking lot was directly across the street and took no longer than 1 minute to walk to the hotel. I was concerned with the parking situation because of the amount of stuff we had in the car and we had to leave the key with the parking attendant so he could park the car, but I guess the commercial lot was secured so it was kind of more comforting than parking at the hotel parking lot. We decided to park our other car in the hotel parking lot, but we didn't feel safe parking it in the spot near the street but we left it there over night with no problems. It looked like part of the hotel was undergoing renovations - some of the hall walls and carpet still needed work but the rooms looked like they had already been remodeled. The 2 bed room was very spacious. I wasn't expecting it to be that spacious but it was very nice to have the extra room for some of our luggage and other stuff. We found most everything to be somewhat clean. The bathroom could have used more towel racks. Other than that and no breakfast, no other complaints. Wireless internet worked well. The next morning, we decided to leave our cars at the hotel for a few hours after checkout so that we could take the lightrail to downtown Seattle and avoid traffic and parking. The front desk lady said that it would be ok to park our cars at the hotel while we went downtown. The shuttle to the airport says Holiday Inn on it but there's a paper sign with Red Roof Inn printed on it. The shuttle was very convenient. The airport is also within walking distance down International Blvd - less than 5 minute walk to the skywalk/bridge. I know because we decided to walk it on the way back from the airport instead of taking the shuttle.

The next morning, we wake up after having a lack of sleep due to the fact that the building has no sound barriers whatsoever. Everything everyone was doing above us was heard all through the night. If I had a vehicle, I would have slept in it better. A vehicle brings up another subject. The shuttle driver was very polite and offered to drive us to the Denny's a few blocks down since it was a slow night for him and we had just checked in. I was going to walk from the Holiday Inn and just get dropped off there since it was a shorter walk but he agreed to just drop us off there. After dinner, we called our driver as he advised us to do and guess what? The girls at the front desk tells us that's against their rules and they cannot send him to pick us back up. So, here I am with a 3-year old walking down a street in Seattle at 11 pm with him and my elderly grandmother who cannot walk far distances, much less up and down hills to the hotel. In addition to all of this, after the walk and the lack of sleep to add to our stay was the toilet that had overrun into the floor and out into the hallway. The front desk offered to let us shower in another room, 5 rooms down but it's not the easiest thing to do carrying all of our belongings down to wait on one another to shower while holding up the process of preparing to leave this 1-star hotel.

At check-in there were 3 workers at the desk, but only one working (one was watching the person working while literally picking his nose, and other was staring at a computer screen but taking no visible action) -- and the one person working took forever to check in the two guests ahead of us. Later, upon return from dinner, we found no available parking (although some spots were blocked off by orange cones, presumably to keep them available for employees). Upon inquiry, I was told the hotel would pay for me to park in the \"overflow lot,\" which is a commercial lot about a block away. When I asked for an explanation, I was told that the hotel rents parking spaces to long-term travelers and for that reason runs out of space for guests. It's frequent enough that they have a voucher arrangement established with the commercial lot. This could be better managed so that the hotel does not inconvenience its core customers this way; as is, the practice is unacceptable. Despite my protests both when I was being told to park in the other lot and when I picked up the voucher to present to the lot, there was not a hint of apology from the hotel staff.

While checking in at 2:30 pm, reminded front desk clerk of our request for a crib for our 19 month old daughter (made request when room was reserved on website). Clerk said that since they'd had a problem with guests stealing the cribs, they had only one crib for entire hotel. I stopped her mid-checkin and said that we would need a crib or we'd have to cancel our reservation. She said we'd probably have a hard time finding a room at that time, that hotels call them all the time asking if they have any rooms available. I told her I'd have to take my chances, because our daughter doesn't sleep with us and I didn't want her to roll off of the bed while we slept. She then left the front desk and told me to watch for customers while she went and checked to see about the crib. She came back maybe five minutes later, said she'd found the crib and it was folded up by the elevator on the first floor. She said we'd need to get it and take it to our room, due to being short-staffed. I said fine and she checked us in. We found the \"crib\" by the elevator, and my husband and I carried it to our room and set it up. It was, however, missing any sort of sheet to go over the flimsy mattress. We called down to the desk, asking if we could possibly get a sheet to go over the plastic mattress. There was another clerk on duty by this time, because she seemed confused and asked if was our crib that we brought from home. We told her it was the hotel crib, put us on hold, then said that we should grab a maid in the hallway to get one, because they had no way to get one up to our room. The then called back a few minutes later and said that they had one at the front desk, but we'd need to come down and get it. Fed up, we were on our way down when we finally ran into a maid who gave us a clean sheet for the crib. OK, as if this whole experience with the crib was not headache enough, room #136 was an absolute dirthole. The room itself was about as shabby as a room can be, and looked like it had not been updated since 1975. Absolutely terrible. The bathroom was disgusting, cracked tub and unfinished wall around plumbing. We will never stay here again and suggest you stay away!

I went to the front desk and asked for another room and they did move us promptly. But that room wasn't much better. The toilet flushed but I'm not sure it had been cleaned.

When my husband went to the lobby to check us in the person behind the desk wouldn't look up at him for several minutes. When we requested additional pillows (back problem) we were told the entire hotel didn't have any extra. After we got to our room, my children needed to use the restroom so they took turns going in while we unloaded. When I finally stepped into the bathroom there was a pile of towels sitting outside the tub, I assumed one of my kids played with the towels but after asking them and upon further inspection of the bathroom, we realized it hadn't yet been cleaned!!! GROSS!!! Eventually we were moved to a different room, at this point it was very late and we had a very early flight to catch. So, we asked the front desk to please put us on the list for the 4:30am shuttle, they told us that they don't do reservations for shuttles it's first come first serve. My husband and I woke up early got the kids and stuff down to the lobby by 4:33am and we were told we were too late for the 4:30am shuttle. Since we could see the van outside we asked again, politely if we could just go ahead now. The flat answer was \"no, another van will leave in a half an hour.\" So, my family waited in the lobby for another half hour even though we were only 3 minutes late! Upon our return to Seattle we were supposed to call for their shuttle van to let them know what time we were arriving. So, we called from our cell phone when we landed, then we were told we needed to go find a special phone out in the parking garage and call from it. We complied and were promptly told the shuttle van was busy for the next couple of hours (a trip into Downtown Seattle had just left?!) and we could find a taxi and the hotel would pay for it. Well, we're a large family and we didn't all fit in one taxi but we also didn't want to be separated (twin infants) so this caused my husband to demand that they send us a van that would hold all of us. Apparently they finally called in a favor with the parking lot next door to them and we were shuttled over there. When my husband went to get the car the manager did try to make things right by offering us a free night's stay. We're not sure we'll ever use it but it was a nice gesture. Hopefully the management will be able to train it's staff to care for their guests better.
