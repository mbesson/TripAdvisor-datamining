We were embarking on a cruise of Persian Gulf. We were staying at the Fortune Grand on the First Night before boarding the liner. We arrived around 8.00 am after a long flight from Heathrow. Unfortunately no room was available to us at that time of morning but we were able to leave our luggage. We found staff in hotel to be very courteous and helpful.Room was small but adequate and situated in quiet area.The bed was so comfortable. The breakfast the following morning was of a very high standard with a very wide range of food. The hotel was located in the old town region of Dubai which meant that a taxi was needed to get to Dubai Mall . The underground was located quite near to hotel and we found this a fantastic method of transport. For a very few Dirhams you could travel all day and the pass could be used on buses as well. I have never felt as safe in any other place that I have travelled. Yes it was in the flight path to Dubai Airport but we did not hear any planes during night", "Date": "February 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Karachi, Pakistan", "Title": "\u201cGood Hospitality\u201d", "Author": "Bareerah K", "ReviewID": "UR123158467", "Content": "I stayed in the last week of December there.

Don't let the pictures deceive you and don't let other reviews deceive you especially if you want your sleep. No kettle, iron and basic things such as towels. The cleanliness is terrible, the bath was clogged and dirty. Moved to 3 different rooms, all the baths smelt like sewer once you opened the tap. Breakfast was quite bad, no orange juice. Pineapple juice was very, very, very sour! They didn't clean up the tables and there's very limited space and limited food. Most of it had no taste and once they brought the orange juice it tasted like pure water with colourings! Pancakes were yellow and I don't even know how. Rooms had only had one or two sockets and it had a alcohol. One MAIN thing is that I could hear music all the way from 9pm - 3:30am!!! THIS WAS THE MAIN PROBLEM! Couldn't go to sleep at all, we went from room 112 - 212 - 316 and these were all on the opposite side and the highest floor is 3 and we could still hear music very clearly! I didn't come to sleep in a night club! This provided terrible sleeping quality. That morning I found the manager and he was big help and moved us to a different hotel literally 2 minutes away and got a suite for no extra charge which is why I'll add 1 more star for the service. However if I could rate the manager alone I'd rate him 5* as he helped out and found an alternative for us in less than 20minutes, got our bags and a car and left the terrible accommodation within seconds!", "Date": "December 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Riyadh, Saudi Arabia", "Title": "\u201cworst hotel for people who understand what hoteling is\u201d", "Author": "josh j", "ReviewID": "UR120507003", "Content": "dear folks.i would like to update all of you my experience regarding this hotel most recently in November. I forced myself not to stay in this hotel for following reasons and at last i did check out one hour. 1. First of all i called this hotel and asked if the room is available on early check in.They confirmed me that it is available,so i went all the way there at 9.30 am.Once i reached there they said they were mistaken and its not available until 2 pm.any ways i accepted as per the policy and did not mind waiting. 2.the time i was alloted room, i found full smoky smell over floor as well as in room although hotel claims to be non-smoking..i was frustuated at all and denied to stay, then they offered me a room on another floor for which i had to wait another 1 hour untill 3 pm. 3.it was claimed that wifi is working as well as free in all hotel...so i did confirm it also as wifi was most important for me as a business traveler in room. 4,once i check in the room..wifi in room was not working at all,i got bursted, technical person realized that hotel is short of their bandwidth in their room as capacity of people using is more than what they have to offer. 5.i went to manager and asked for check out, he refused and said they will rectify problem,i being technical guy told them its not possible untill they buy routers and increase their bandwidth which would take more than a week... 6.staff on the whole was pathetic except one indian girl on reception.simply pathetic and illeterate sort of staff with no patience and tolerance level a hospitality guy should have. 7.atlast i won a fight and claimed a zero bill for refund through agent i booked the hotel..and check out at 4 pm 8 rooms and lobby is hell small and even they dont allow visitors to meet you back up in the room which is not upto the mark. 9.my whole day was destroyed coz of un-trained zero level tolerence staff.i would suggest you guys to go for other hotels than this as it cant be ranked as a 1 star for me.... Suggetions.. 1.regent palace hotel with deluxe room is awsomly decorated and big enough to make you feel like home. lobby is small but acceptable..breakfast is not much to offer,but cleanliness is of very nice level to stay with.even there standard rooms are big enough to accomodate people..just besides burjuman shoping mall as well as metro station..nice clubbing choices including indian dance club live.american dance club.philipino night club. i will be uploading pics of regent palace at section of regent palace hotel review..check them out.. other recommended 4 star with good budget are sheraton deira hotel dhow palace hotel four points by sheraton landmark riqqa hotel jumera rotana rose ryan by rotana and others", "Date": "November 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "manama Bahrain", "Title": "\u201cvalue for money\u201d", "Author": "arun s", "ReviewID": "UR118270490", "Content": "cheap and afordable , good service and clean with wifi. morethan that what we need when we travel", "Date": "September 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Riyadh, Saudi Arabia", "Title": "\u201cit was indeed grand\u201d", "Author": "aust81", "ReviewID": "UR118100667", "Content": "Excellent in all ways , Had a comfortable stay . room was clean , wifi, reception staffs were helpful. good food . will come back again . was as comfortable as home and affordable rates. will strongly recommend this hotel.", "Date": "September 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tehran, Iran", "Title": "\u201cReally not a good choice\u201d", "Author": "Soheileee", "ReviewID": "UR90028406", "Content": "We stayed there for 4 days.
