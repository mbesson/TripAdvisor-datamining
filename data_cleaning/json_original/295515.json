It was very easy to get to from the airport as it is right on the main tram line from the airport. The street it is on is a large thoroughfare that runs through the busy tourist area of the city, but it wasn't noisy or unsafe for pedestrians. The hotel is located about 10-15 minutes' walk from Hagia Sophia, the Blue Mosque, and the Spice Bazaar, 5 minutes' walk from the Grand Bazaar, 20-25 minutes' walk from Eminonu, the main ferry port. and minutes from a ton of local eateries and shops. The tram also goes to all these locations if walking is not preferred. The room we stayed in faced a little street and a half-way remodeled building, so there wasn't much of a view, but the comfort of the room more than made up for it. The room itself was fairly large and clean with a queen sized bed and a twin sized bed. We pushed them together for a super king sized bed. The bathroom had a standing shower that had a hand-held shower-head and a ceiling shower head. The water pressure was great and there was plenty of warm and cold water. More importantly, the bathroom was clean and had no strange odors coming through the plumbing. The hotel also offered complimentary breakfast that went until 10am and offered hot dishes like sausage and eggs as well as an assortment of cheeses, cold-cuts, fruits, yogurt, breads, pastries (including little hand-held savory pies), teas, juices, and coffee. The coffee came came from a Nestle machine, but it was strong and tasty with options for espresso, latte, cappuccino, etc. There is also complimentary wireless internet that was very fast.

I asked the porter who brought my bags and he told me there was no individual control of the air-con, so I decided to try my luck with another room (I am inclined to change my allocated room on group tours, having found that singles often get the short straw !) Was shown an internal room (319) with a plastic -grassed balcony on the central air-shaft, with aircon that I could control. Pleasant design and reasonably spacious, and the bed being around a corner from the door meant it was well insulated from the hallway - I am a very light sleeper. The hand-basin area was quite small, not much room to put out your bits and pieces, which is odd as the shower was quite large. I was promised a better room with a view the following day but as 319 was nice and quiet, no sound of traffic or the mosques at 5.30 am, I stayed put for the second night of our stay. Breakfast was good - I particularly noted excellent bread - with a wide selection. The reception area was hideous, an extraordinary collection of styles, surprising as my room was in pleasant if rather bland international hotel mode. The hotel is in the Aksaray area, known for its cheap rag-trade wholesalers serving the former Soviet Union countries that abut Turkey. Your neighbours are likely to be gigantic and formidable buyers who devour huge platefuls each breakfast rather than other tourists. The hotel is a short distance away from the historic centre, though close to the Grand Bazaar, but is well placed for the tram that takes you to Sultanahmet and across the Golden Horn to Taksim and Beyoglu and is a god-send to tired tourists. If you are staying for several days get an Akbil. I was pleased to find a simple-to-use safe in the room. Only when I was emptying it did I discover that it wasn't screwed to the wall or the shelf !

It was one of the last Hotels I checked at the internet. All of them very expensive for the period I wanted to stay ( from Dec 30th up to Jan 3rd ) and no available accommodation. So ,when I found this Hotel with very good prices , I thought It was going to be one of those terrible experiences... But, what a wonderful surprise!!! I will describe why I really enjoyed staying there. The location is JUST perfect. You have everything you need surrounding the hotel. There is a tram stop ,a bus stop and taxis available just in front of the hotel which can take you from Beyazit to Sultanahmet in 2 minutes or any place you want . The Kent Hotel is surrounded by all kind of shops (shoes, clothes, bags, etc...), also by restaurants, cafes and small markets. There are a lot of salesman along the streets offering all kinds of cheap goods for late presents The Grand Bazar is 200 m from the hotel (opened up to 8 pm) The hotel is 8 min walking from Sultanahmet where the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia and Topkapi are located Free shuttle service from the airport, fits 4 people (as most of hotels) Arrange some transportation for your day of departure at the reception( cost 30 euros) The Hotel Free shuttle service from the airport to the hotel and one of the cheapest charges for the return I found ( 30 euros) The access to the hotel can be by ramp or stairs. The outside look doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t show what you have inside. Great reception lounge , toilets, a bar with lcd tv, where you could enjoy a chat or just a drink and a view of the terrace cafe on the second floor where you will enjoy a lovely breakfast\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6At reception you can ask about sightseeing, restaurants, trips ,etc\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6They are pleased to give you all the info needed. I must highlight at the reception, the very good service , professionalism and attention I have received from Mr.Halit, Mr.Kemal, Ms Sinem and Ismail, the porter I insisted on calling \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Smile\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for his prompt help and for being so lovely to me and my mom. Thanks to all of them and also Ms Betul for my reservation and emails with all the info I requested. The restaurant Nice, the food is tasty, breakfast is very good with hot option, scrambled eggs, sausages, toasts, fruits, yogurt, jams, juices, selection of bread and pastries, lots of tea flavors, chocolate and coffee, etc\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6I tried the dinner menu. Nice selection and good portions of food served. Children options. The rooms The rooms are brand new. Comfortable beds, nice in size. The room I stayed in( 217) is good for a couple with a child. What you see is what you get. The room is spacious and good to accommodate two large suitcases. Choose the front ones, they have a balcony facing the street, and although it is a busy one, the rooms are noiseless. Air conditioning and heater control in the room. Nice wardrobe. Room service at reasonable price, small fridge with no expensive amenities. Complimentary slippers. Large doors. Should check if there are rooms for people with disabilities. The Bathroom is not so big, but very neat with a good size shower, hair dryer, new seat, amenities, slippers. Housekeepers are very good but the language barrier is enormous although they are very helpful. I travel a lot and stay in five star hotels always and, even though, the hotel didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the same classification, the service was amazing.

Breakfast buffet was very good with a lot to choose from. Location is good, within walking distance to tourist zone but not within the craziness of the tourist district. Tram is cheap and handy. Buy your tram tickets either at a tobacco kiosk or the machines in front of some of the trams for 175 Turkish Lira for one way. Cons: The staff at the front desk are not the least bit friendly or helpful. They are only helpful if they can make some money off of you - booking dinner, booking a tour, or selling you something like a map. Since the computer (and printer) in the lobby was not working during our entire stay, we were unable to look up the directions to a restaurant where we were to meet friends. So we asked the front desk if they could tell us how to get to the restaurant. The front desk clerk tried to steer us to a different restaurant, where they no doubt made a commission, but we explained we were meeting friends at the other restaurant. The clerk said he was not familiar with our restaurant. I asked him if he could call the restaurant to get directions and he said we could do it ourselves. Of course, we could do it ourselves, however, as the street names are in Turkish and difficult to find, we were hoping he would be better able to direct us since I knew the restaurant was within walking distance. I asked if he cold look it up on the computer and possibly print it for us and charge us for the printing since their computer for guests was not working and he said he was unable to help us and that we should call. It turns out we took an expensive cab (since the cab had to take a roundabout route because of the one-way streets) for all of a 6 block ride we could easily have walked. Also, although there is an airport shuttle that will pick you up at the airport - be sure it is the Ataturk Airport - they will not take you back. They charge 30 euros for the trip back. A taxi is about 60 euros and the tram may take you anywhere from 40 minutes to an hour especially between 4-6 pm. We tried to take the tram but had to let 4 go by as they were too packed to fit another person let alone two people with one piece of luggage. The noise is also a concern. The rooms that face the street are noisy due to the traffic and the rooms that face the sea have a beautiful view but are right next to the minaret speakers which are quite loud as they announce the prayers 5 times a day with the first one at 6:30 am. After one day, however, we were so tired from sightseeing that we simply tune it out. It is a shame the staff is so unfriendly because I would otherwise recommend this hotel. I have worked as a front desk clerk at hotels and I am very aware of what hardships guests have when traveling to a country where they do not know the language and the extra care that is needed. However, the staff at Kent Hotel seem to resent guests and their requests and simply see them as tourists they can trick for extra money.", "Date": "January 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Athens, Greece", "Title": "\u201cExcellent and cheap hotel, not perfectly located though\u201d", "Author": "frosw", "ReviewID": "UR87379092", "Content": "The hotel was really great, the room was perfectly decorated and very clean.

It was interesting that I couldn't hear the call to prayer the first two nights (yet the wind kept me awake) but the third night, I could hear the call to prayer but no other noise. Depends on where you are in the building, evidently. Being a single traveler on a tour, I had twin beds. Like most twin bed rooms, the beds were narrow and a little stiff but not too uncomfortable. Room had tons of closet space and a nice clean bathroom, with shampoo and a hair dryer, etc. Hotel restaurant was good -- down the elevator, on the mezzanine. We had the buffet in the morning, which had the standard array of breads and fruits and cereals and numerous cheeses/olives. Dinners were not buffets. They were served at the table and the food was quite good, with various mezes (appetizers) and kabobs and many other options. One night the entire Beyazit area lost its power and The Kent had a generator, so we stayed there for dinner rather than wandering down the street to find another restaurant. Ten of us had a price fixed menu that night with 4 or 5 courses which was only $17 - 20 USD each and had so much good healthy food, I couldn't finish. Location is ideal The Kent is one block away from the entrance to the Grand Bazaar (to the right as you exit the hotel) and nearby gobs of shops with everything one could possibly be tempted by --- and with the tram (University stop) right across the street. From the tram, it's easy to get to the Sultanahmet district to all the tourist attractions. There is some major construction going on next door, lately -- so, if on that side of the building, it could either be noisy or have a view of the deep pit depending on the day or time of day. Looks like they are either building another hotel or a commercial building. My tour company paid the bill for my stay at this hotel, but I'd stay there again, even on my own. The staff at the desk was a bit abupt and surly but the wait staff in the restaurant was very gracious and friendly.

The hotel is well located (especially convenient to the Grand Bazaar) the public areas are nice and the rooms are clean and the staff is courteous. My experience this time around was also good, but not quite as good as 9 years ago. The staff are still very professional and courteous, however if you ask about any low cost tour options, you will be given all the standard high cost tour recommendations. We wanted an inexpensive boat tour and found a lovely one ourselves that the front desk seemed not to know about. The rooms are standard but could definately use a freshening up, so if you are put off by the odd scratch or stain or tear, then this is not the place for you. The breakfast buffet is reasonable however there is a surcharge for omlettes so if that puts you off, at least you have been warned. All in all I think that for the money, this is an excellent and reliable hotel and I would stay here again if I was in need of mid-range accomodation. I have stayed at more expensive and upmarket hotels in Istanbul such as the Marmara in Taksim, which I would recommend for more fussy travelers who are willing to pay more, however if you don't need fancy soaps, fluffy towels, an incredible breakfast buffet and a flawless room, the Kent is more than reliable as a place to stay.", "Date": "July 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cConvenient Hotel\u201d", "Author": "tibbrit2", "ReviewID": "UR17558673", "Content": "Stayed here twice at the beginning and end of our Turkey trip.
