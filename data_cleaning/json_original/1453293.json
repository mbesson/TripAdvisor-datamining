It's actually I believe 3 guesthouses (Plaza, Rex, and I forgot the other one) all pretty much right next to each other on the same block. I checked in before 2pm, and I was actually more than grateful after waiting 15 mins to know that my room was ready at 11:30am. I was jetlagged, exhausted, and deprived of sleep, so when the person took me to my room, it looked like heaven initially. I slept for an hour or two, woke up, and after getting some rest, got to see how there is absolutely nothing special about the place. I had a single room, basic with sink and shower stall installed in the room. Just barely there space for my luggage and other stuff. Only TWO electric plugs in the whole room, so I just unplugged the lil 15-inch old-school TV and used it for my stuff. As I looked around, it looked really dirty actually; the wool comforters were stained/dirty, the bedsheets had holes in it, and the carpeted floor looks dusty/dirty although I've seen first hand that they do vacuum the floors haha. The ceiling paint was peeling off yet the colors arent faded. Lets just say I've seen cleaner and better hostels than this so-called \"hotel\". I stayed there for about a week, and did \"meet\" a mouse who passed from one hole to another in my room. I wasn't the least bit scared being I've been in worst conditions but I was rather surprised. If you're not into mickey mouse paying you a visit, don't come. If you dont mind, it wont bother you the least bit. I literally only used this place for sleeping and showering and changing; oh plus the free breakfast! Beats having to pay up to 5pounds for breakfast elsewhere. English breakfast (without the sausage and bacon) with some cereal, wheat cakes, tea/coffee, orange juice. If you dont care for luxuries, this is enough. If you are going to be hanging out a lot in your room, dont bother being here. Oh and one more thing, while I was there last week, the WiFi only worked in the main Plaza Hotel building; my room was in the Rex Hotel next door where they were doing construction so WiFi was down =o( Had to go hang out at the dining area/living room/reception area when I needed the internet.

The booking was for the Primal Scream gig at Olympia (fantastic!) and the room was booked for 4 guys to share - all single beds and with EN-SUITE facilities. On arrival we were given keys to the room and front door of the Plaza Hotel next door to the Rex (sign on the door of the Plaza sends you to the Rex to check in.) The room for 2 nights (4 sharing) was \u00c2\u00a3200.00 so not over the top on a four way split, but if this was a family room - 2 adults + kids \u00c2\u00a3100.00 per night would have been daylight robbery for a room that was well below any standard for any hotel. On check in, we were asked to pay by cash as the card machine was out of action - as it turns out the reception man/owner? said that the previous ownership of the hotel(s) had gone into administration hence the card machine wasn't available to pay. They also offered to settle by Paypal - which I opted for on MY OWN LAPTOP - fortunate that I had a paypal account and laptop with me. Under no circumstances should anyone use a hotels computer to do a payment - key logging or recording of your details is a possibilty. THE ROOM - have a look at the pictures - they're worth a thousand words!!!! Remember we had booked for four single beds with en-suite - what we got was a room with a double and two singles one of which had a shower cubicle beside it - no roof so any steam would have gotten into the room Thats if any of the four blokes actually wanted to shower in a cubicle with no privacy. (We're shy at heart :) The toilet and shower were shared with the other two rooms on the same floor and anybody that wanted to use it as they passed by! The decor would have made Rigsby's Rising Damp B&B look like the Hilton - old worn, very rough. Communal shower was antiquated, produced lukewarm water and get there first before the other two bedrooms as you will have no access to a toilet until they're finished! Breakfast (which is complimentary) consisted of fried or scrambled eggs, toast, beans, cereal and coffee/tea. But again get down early, the five table room also serves for at least another two hotels in the same block - queues were outside the room the whole time as it only served for 1.5 hours (7.30-9.00) ok if it was serving just it's own residents, but insufficient .

The room did have a freestanding shower cabinet, but so old and grimy I could hardly bear to look at it, let alone use it. It also had a TV, which is unusual for a cheap hotel, but the reception was appalling. Bizarrely, the room was packed with unnecessary furniture - a wardrobe, a chest of drawers, a bedside table and even an ancient fridge - but the few things that really would have made a difference (a lampshade on the bare bulb, a bedside light) were missing! Having said that, the bed was comfy and I slept very well. The breakfast room was surprisingly light and pleasant, but breakfast was unimpressive: Tesco cornflakes, concentrated orange juice, and scrambled/fried eggs with white toast.

I was looking for sth affordable but clean ! and nice, not too far from the hot spots. I payed abt 48 GBP per night inlc.breakfast. That was what I got: The room looked exact the way it did in the pics. Although it was in the basement, it had a window, a TV (4 major programms), a fridge, a chair and of course a bed. All was in working order and - for british standards - very clean. If you are german like me, don\u00c2\u00b4t look in the corners or put on your glasses. That\u00c2\u00b4s just London. Bathroom - en suite - small but fine. New interiors, nothing rotten or foul. Water was hot at any time of the day as long as you showered and powerful running (I\u00c2\u00b4ve experienced different in London ;-) ). It was cleaned daily, no hairs left in the bath! Since I\u00c2\u00b4ve a bad back, the mattrace was a challenge. It was more or less new, but not a high standart 7* one. I put the blanket and daybed underneath the linen and could sleep like an angel. Which you normally should do anyway after a whole day out in town. Sheperd\u00c2\u00b4s Bush is the perfect start with the tube in any direction. Station is abt 5 min walk away, busses to Hammersmith, Barnes, Richmond, etc. 2 min. (I even walked to Hamm.and Barnes - abt 20 min). Local shops, bars and restaurants (also fastfood) are around in a short walk, but far enough away not to desturb the quiet in the night. Well, quietness in an old house is one thing. The other is other travellers who throw the door ;-) But at night all was nice and slepping. Breakfast contained of eggs, toast, beans, jam, cornflakes. Orange juice,tea and coffee, too. I was always stuffed after it. If my hubby would have ordered some more. Small room, st you had to wait for a few min if you came in the \"rush hour\" at 8:15. Just get up a little earlier and have a room almost by yourself. Anyway you can have linen serviettes or cleenex. Here it is cleenex. You can have a suite or a small room just for the rest and a film in the evening. Here it is the latter. You choose what you like.
