I didn't want the city to bleed him dry, but as always, you get what you pay for. The area is nice, nothing to be afraid of, and the hotel was clean. But the rooms weren't great. The single room my uncle had was quite small and our larger double room was far from luxurious. Still, the showers worked and we had no real problems. Reception was kind and helpful. There was a working elevator and a convenient parking garage right next door. Overall, I wouldn't mind returning there if I was coming on my own for business and didn't want to shell out a lot of cash. But it'd be kind of a letdown for those who haven't been to Rome before and want to have a special experience. Also, for people who aren't seasoned walkers, it's a bit of a hike to the major historic sites -- an hour walk to the Vatican, at least a half hour or 40 minutes to the Colosseum. I overestimated my guest's ability to walk to the Colosseum and back on foot to this place, and he's in very good shape. We ended up taking a cab back, which is something I rarely have had to do while staying in Rome.

We loved the enthusiastic atmosphere in the hotel, as well as the location of the hotel. The hotel isn't at the very center of the city but we found that nearby were some awesome restaurants and food stores. Also the hotel is situated near the central railway station Termini. I recommend that - if you\u00b4re going to Embassy - you visit Via Collina nearby. The street locates one of the best ice cream bars in Rome - I Caruso. The ice cream was as good as we tasted in Florence two years ago at the Carraia Gelateria near the bridge Carraia. I chose Pistaccio with Chocolate which made perfect match - pistaccio with a bit of salty taste together with just-perfect sweetness of the chocolate. Nearby, also at the via Collina, locates the best cheese store we ever visited: Latticini. There we tasted the warm and self made mozzarella that really blew our minds. I recommend that you also try the Pecorino-cheese.

First impressions are not overwhelming; the hotel is tucked away on a side-street and shares a building with an array of other concerns - another hotel, a linguistics institute, some apartments etc. The lift to the rooms (described very negatively by the poster from North Yorkshire in his review) is a bit freaky in as much as it reminded us of the film \"Angel Heart\" with all the connotations of death, blood and damnation but actually, like much of the rest of Rome, after a short while it loses its weirdness and grows on you. The room we stayed in (451) was clean, very well heated and appointed with everything you need except maybe coffee-making facilities. Service was excellent (example, I walked the 3 floors down to Reception one night to ask for more toilet roll and by the time I'd travelled back to the room in the lift, staff had been and gone with the toilet roll. Its these little touches that mark a place out). Breakfast was all we needed; personally I don't need or want a big fried breakfast lying on my stomach when I'm going to be doing a lot of walking and sightseeing. The staff in the Embassy were all friendly and spoke English well. The location of the hotel was good too, just around the corner from Via XX Septembre where you can get the bus to just about anywhere, and in easy walking distance to the Trevi fountain and Spanish Steps. Our room was to the rear of the hotel so it was as quiet as possible; the only noise was from what were probably employees of the Agriculture Ministry chatting while having a smoke on the balcony of (what I think was) the ministry building. Only 2 real negatives: it would have been nice to have had just one tv channel in English (watching \"Joey\" dubbed into Italian or what appeared to be rather vain naval personnel presenting the weather forecast is initially amusing but the novelty fades very quickly...); and the guy at Reception offered to fix us up with a taxi to Fiumicino airport for the \"special\" price of \u20ac45 (okay, maybe he was just trying to be helpful, but I don't know...) and said we'd be waiting \"30 or 40 minutes\" at Termini to buy tickets for the airport express train. Not so: drag your cases to Via Septembre and get the bus to Termini, then get a Customer Service person (look for orange high-visibility vest) to use one of the fast-ticket machines for you.

But that, sadly, was the high point of this particular hotel. The common areas were adequate, but the room smelled heavily of mildew and was furnished mostly in what seemed to be thrift-store castoffs. The mildew smell could not be mitigated by fresh air, because the extreme street noise required us to keep the window tightly closed. The poorly ventilated bath exacerbated the problem because breathing while in the shower meant leaving the door open, which only filled the room with the steam that probably caused the mildew in the first place. I expected Via XX Settembre to be busy, but the street was much louder than expected. And although I was roughly familiar with the location -- a business/government area -- I had miscalculated and found that it was just far enough away to be inconvenient to tourist destinations as well as to the Termini (although if you are in the area, don't deny yourself a stop at Santa Maria della Vittoria and the National Museum nearby).
