The location is perhaps one of the best things about the hotel (metro station is less than 5 minutes walking distance, bus station is just around the corner, taxis are just opposite to the hotel). This way, you can go to most of the places very easily, and at the same time avoid staying in the fussy hotels of the always busy La rampla.

The room and the bathroom were small but very clean during our whole stay. The breakfast was simple, but always fresh and they serve Illy coffee/espresso. And the friendly staff was very helpful and committed. The location is wonderful. It is near Sagrada Familia and right in the neighbourhood of another UNESCO world heritage, the Hospital de Sant Pau. You have a very wonderful cafe/restaurant with fair prices next door that serves Tapas, Catalonian dishes and of course Chocolate con Churro. Also, you find a lot of other small joints, restaurants, bakeries, supermarkets, etc. And around the corner you have the bus station from where you can go to Parc G\u00fcell and the Catalunya Plaza (where the Ramblas start) for instance. And the metro station Sant Pau is only a short walk away and with the L5 you have direct connection to Barcelona Sants/Estacio Sants. One advice: Try booking directly on their homepage. They have great offers up to 15% discount sometimes which will not be mentioned by HRS or Expedia. All in all it's a great hotel for a Barclona vacation.
