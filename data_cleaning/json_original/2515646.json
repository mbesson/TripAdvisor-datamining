Add the words \u201cstylish\u201d and \u201cwell-appointed\u201d to the Courtyard San Diego Liberty Station. When it comes to my list of favorite hotels, this Courtyard would rank among them. There is an extensive lobby and bar, outdoor seating area, and pleasant pool scene. There is an on-site which restaurant which offers room service. The hotel is adjacent to a park, and there is a walking trail which follows the Liberty Station waterfront. The location is ideal for early morning flights from Lindbergh field and convenient to downtown and other attractions. The room d\u00e9cor is the latest generation design.

Finally, the hotel\u2019s CRM is quite impressive. When I arrived for my second visit, the front desk associate acknowledged my recent stay. The associate also noted that my upcoming stay was not booked in a water view room and asked if I would like to change room type.

This year, issues at a friend's house precluded us from staying in their guest bedroom, and thus we booked ourselves at the Marriott Liberty Station. We found the location to be ideal to get into downtown, just turn left from the hotel, follow harbor drive and you're there in no time, without even having to get on the freeway. Likewise to get into Ocean Beach, PB, or locations north; simply turn right out of the hotel to get to the beaches or head north on the 8 freeway to La Jolla. In short, we found the location of the Marriott to be ideally centered between the two areas of San Diego where we spend the most time. As they say, the three most important aspects are location, location, location. On top of the fantastic location, the staff at the Marriott could not have been nicer or more accommodating. They upgraded us on check in to a room overlooking the water, and handled our requests with ease. In the room, we found a flatscreen TV, a small fridge, and (most importantly) a Kuerig coffee maker. From the small balcony we could watch the sun set over the Pacific. Remind me again why we moved away from San Diego? Outside of the hotel, the liberty station area has almost every shop and restaurant that you could need, and others, like Target, In-n-out, and rubio's fish tacos, are just a mile or so east on Rosecrans st. Just across from the hotel in the parking lot is Sushi Ya, an amazing sushi restaurant in a town that has never blown me away with it's sushi selection. Also, a Starbucks, and a few other restaurants are within the same parking lot. If you are looking to explore San Diego, there are few locations as good as this one.

The rooms are excellent, spacious, well appointed with a flat screen tv, mini refrigerator, A/V hookups to watch videos if you have your camcorder or laptop with you and want to watch footage on the TV, cable including HBO, very spacious bathroom, granite counters, and even granite window sills. The staff is SUPER friendly, the lobby and main areas are immaculate, the fitness center has 24 hour access, unlike many hotels that limit access, the jacuzzi was awesome as was the pool, the location has the harbor to the rear, a huge open park and trails, plus a beach area, and it's in a very upscale looking neighborhood. The business center is free to use, ie free internet access and a printer, plus free wi-fi in the rooms.

The Courtyard is located behind a shopping area with some restaurants, so you can't see it from the street, but it isn't hard to find. Now and again you might hear a plane, but it wasn't an ongoing issue. The outside is plain-ish, but nice - typical Courtyeard. The rooms are well appointed and new.

There is a Keurig coffee maker and a fridge, as well as an iron, ironing board, and hair dryer. A microwave might have been nice. The bed was comfortable. Towels were big, but skimpy. Everyone on staff was nice, and the front desk helped me configure my laptop, which wasn't recognizing the wifi. Turns out it was the computer, and they showed me what to do. One downside was the breakfast was $12.50, and for a party of 2. It was not worth it to pay more for the room in order to get a \"free\" breakfast. Another issue was that there wasn't an ice machine on every floor. After a long day, it was not fun to get back to the room and have to go down the hall and up a flight of stairs to get ice. I paid just over $100/per night for a king size bed and sleeper-sofa, which would be great for small kids. A room with two queen beds would work for a family with older kids.

The location is great with the airport and Shelter Island within a 5 minute drive, and Cabrillo Monument, Ocean Beach and Mission Bay (Sea World) about 10-20 minutes away. I would suggest exploring the Liberty Station for your convenient needs like grocery stores, restaurants and shops. Finally I'm not sure if I could mention names so I'll keep it general... If you're looking for a great Sunday Morning brunch, there is a hawaiian style restaurant on Shelter Island that offers a great champagne brunch.

However if you are a light sleeper the parking lot side might be a better choice. The room although small was a nice set up with a mini sofa and tables. The keurig maker was a really nice touch. We did do the breakfast buffet two mornings and it was excellent. We also ended up having a light supper the last night there and it was very delicious. I was impressed as most chain hotels have mediocre food. The front desk though is very helpful with restaurant recommendations and they were excellent ones. The outdoor faciiities are nice and we had a very large patio with our room.

I believe I have high standards for hotels and this one met every one of them. The staff was phenomenal. Stephanie checked us in and helped us several times after that check in as well and she was fantastic, friendly, informative and helpful. She seemed to actually like her job. Every other staff member that we came into contact with was also great, Stephanie just stood out. The hotel was very clean. We always check for bed bugs at every hotel, no matter how nice the hotel and we did not find any. The bathroom was very clean, even the grout was nice and white with no mold. Housekeeping was great! There was ample parking and it is included in the price. The only thing that may have been nice would be for them to take license plate numbers for the hotel guests because we found a car with the lights on and there wasn't a way for the desk to find out whose car that was. We didn't think we would utilize the on site laundry, but after a day falling in the water at the tide pools, we needed to. The facilities were very clean and the soap and fabric softener is complimentary. We did not use the gym or the pool but we did look at them and I was very impressed with the quality of the gym equipment. It looked to be some really high quality gym equipment, there were ample numbers of treadmills. The pool and pool area looked very nice and I appreciated the no smoking signs because this area can become a smoking haven if allowed. There is a small restaurant on site, we did not use it. They do not have complimentary breakfast, but there is a starbucks within walking distance and it's probably the best starbucks that I have ever been to. They do usually have complimentary coffee/tea available. A very slight draw back is the TV, because of the set up, we couldn't channel surf, we needed to choose each channel by picking the number. It's just a slight inconvenience, no big deal really. I was a little concerned about the location of the hotel, it seemed from internet resources to be so close to the airport and not so close to the city, but in reality, it's nice that it's close to the airport and the planes are not annoying. The airport has a curfew because it is actually inside the city, so there are no take offs and landings at night. I would not consider this hotel outside the city at all, it was right where I would choose to be again. It is pretty close to the USS Midway, and some great restaurants. The city is pretty compact, so it was easy to drive to anything in the city from the hotel and there was easy access to the highways, too.

We booked the 2 room suite with a king bed. According the the front desk, there are only 3 of these types of rooms in the hotel. The hotel is very close to San Diego International Airport. The hotel provides a shuttle between the airport and hotel. While a bit disconnected from the rest of San Diego, the hotel is still conveniently located. Most major attractions are within a 20-25 minute drive. Our initial impression of the property came during the check in process. The lobby has a sit down restaurant, bar, and \"shop\" with snacks and sundries. Just off of the lobby, there is also a deli. The staff in the lobby were helpful during check in and checkout, however, when we were trying to check in at our guaranteed 4pm time, they indicated to us that their engineering team wanted to paint a portion of our ceiling and the room would not be available for another 2+ hours. After discussing it with them, I was able to convince them to move this maintenance item until after we checked out. We we got to the room, we couldn't even find the spot where they wanted to paint. The room was in excellent shape with a fold out sofa, chair, and desk in the \"living\" room. The bedroom was also quite spacious and open with a king size bed and 37in (I believe) television. Both the living room and bedroom had a mini fridge. We were unfortunately booked into a handicapped accessible room, which meant a open shower. This caused most of the floor to get soaking wet as the water drained out of the center of the bathroom. Not something we are used to, but clearly understandable need. The bed was comfortable but a bit firm for our taste. The soft pillows did make up for that, however. The bedroom had great blackout curtains, which allowed us to sleep in without having the sunshine wake us up too early. The down side to have the large suite was the lack of view. It was placed in an area of the hotel that blocked any kind of view. This wasn't important to us as we were out of the hotel room most of our trip, but good to note. One of the biggest selling points of this hotel was parking. Most of the downtown hotels have limited or no self parking. Those which did charge anywhere in the range of $25-$35. We were willing to drive a few extra minutes to our destinations to get the free and ample parking.

We noticed the planes the first day but tuned them out after that. I don`t thnk they fly at night, if they do we didn`t hear them. The hotel is walking distance to some local shops and restaurants but is a drive too downtown. We took the trolley tour that picked us up and dropped us back to the hotel and gave us an excellent hop on and hop off type tour.

We had a car so the ample free parking at the hotel was a bonus. As parking in the city can be tricky we did cab it one night at a price of 16 dollars each direction. Parking at Old Town in the various San Diego State Park parking lots (free) or on the street never gave us a problem.

The price is reasonable, accommodations clean and location central to everything. Some Highlights/Things to Know: *Free parking and plenty of it. Not the case in downtown yet you have such quick access to downtown and Seaport Village via N. Harbor Drive (for those not familiar with the area, many GPS will route you back to I-5 to get downtown, don\u2019t follow that, much quicker and prettier to drive back around the airport and bay front). *Free internet (wires and wireless), High Def Flat Screens, very workable desks with lots of plugs and lighting. *Great running/walking trails and parks right outside your door. *Well equipped exercise room (yes it\u2019s on the smaller side but they really make good use of the space and give you everything you need). *No in-room safe. *Not all rooms have balconies but all have opening windows, I would definitely try and get a balcony room, however, so you can sit out and enjoy the weather (albeit small, probably 2 people max). *Good common areas (especially the outdoor space). *A few restaurants in the immediate area (walking distance). A mix of options, nothing I would call a culinary sensation but good for families (i.e. Thai Place, Sports Bar/Restaurant, Sushi, Subway, Fast Food Mexican). Trader Joe\u2019s in the hood as well as a Von\u2019s (I would walk there but most would probably call it a 2-3 min drive). *My room seemed a little more wear and tear than I would expect for a newer hotel, however, this place is popular and the wear was fairly minor (i.e. some nicked furniture, a stain on the couch). *Housekeeping is good, place was clean and refreshed well. Bathrooms were especially kept very clean. *Pool and spa were well maintained and just the right temperatures. *Noise level \u2013 lots of reviewers speak of this, yes you are in the flight path but I never heard it inside and even outside, it was not disrupting to the peaceful feeling of the location. I only once heard a neighbor (and it was a full house) but for the most part never heard people in halls, or elevators opening, etc. *Self valet service so if you have lots of luggage, grab a luggage cart from the front desk. *The location is central with good access to all the places you probably want to see and the immediate area feels safe but as in any large city, you can go a short distance and be in a great area or a not-so-great one. You can always ask, however, as the staff is happy to help (we especially cared about this for long runs in the early AM and wanted to make sure we stayed in the better areas). *Hotel crowd seems to be mostly families or business /military folks, no groups of young partiers (like you see in Gaslamp or some of the Beach Areas). So for us, that\u2019s great. If you like the nightlife scene, consider Pacific Beach or Gaslamp.

This place is a crown jewel for the courtyard chain-- if you have never stayed at one this is the one to try. It has all the practical things you'd want including free internet and parking. The rooms are as always spacious and bright but it also helps that the facility is brand-new. Service is good but don't eat at the restaurant. The best thing about this hotel is its location next to the Liberty Station neighborhood-- a perfect example of urban renewal done right.There are bayside parks stretching in both directions inviting romantic walks. Liberty Station is a former naval facility and has anything from Panera and Vons Supermarket to an evangelical megachurch (\"The Rock\"). It is 5 minutes from downtown by car or taxi and 5 minutes from the airport by complimentary shuttle. You can walk or bicycle downtown through the bayside parks, too. Downside: Noise --but not really a problem. I was concerned about the proximity to the airport and airplane noise, but it was a minor nuisance since the hotel is not in the direct flight path. All of downtown San Diego including the Hotel Circle neighborhood, however, is in the flight path of the airport so you really can't get away from it. The noise from people in the outdoor hotel pool and hot tub was worse but stops when they close it. Ask for a room overlooking the parking lot if kids noises from the pool bother you.

If the amenities do not grab your attention the friendly staff most certainly will. Please do not let \"friendly\" be considered a loose term.

Every recommendation to every ridiculous request is spot on for everything I have ever needed. It is almost as if they cannot do enough to make sure your stay is wonderful. The food? Glad you asked! They have a wonderful array of options for breakfast, lunch (which i dine here for every day) and dinner. Outstanding steaks to half off happy hour appetizers to outstanding salads. I've even made absurd requests just as a test, which I do feel a little guilty for, and all have been met with a 5 star ending. Yes, five out of five. Oh, who likes hot tubs? I do! Nice glass of wine by the fireplace, ok, if you want to, it is available here. They even provide you with a ride to the surrounding areas for dining or entertainment and even to go shopping if you like.

I believe that the first and major measure of a hotel (above location and price) is cleanliness; this hotel was spotlessly clean; the bedrooms, pool area, restaurant and lobby were immaculate; the towels and bedding were crisp, clean and comfortable. we were given two interconnecting rooms on the second floor with a good view over the pool and bay. the rooms were spacious, airy and the bathrooms were a good size, with good toiletries and plenty of towels. the rooms were cleaned every day (apart from christmas day when just the bins were emptied). the hotel is a very close to the airport (at most a five minute drive) and there is a frequent free shuttle to the airport; we used this when we over nighted in vegas and on our return we contacted the hotel to send the shuttle to collect us; this worked brilliantly and the shuttle was waiting for us as we exited the terminal. the airport is much busier than I thought and there was some noise in our bedrooms from planes taking off and landing, but no real inconvenience or disturbance the hotel is on a modern complex, alongside a hilton,a number of restaurants, a starbucks and a massage spa ( Envy - $50 for a full hour long massage - brilliant); the only thing lacking was a convenience store on the site. however, there is a very small mini shop behind the reception in the hotel. there is loads of free parking (the internet is also free as is use of the desktop computers in the lobby where we printed our airline boarding cards). the hotel also accepted a couple of faxes on our behalf (again free of charge; I recall being charged $20 for a fax at the bellagio several years ago!) location of the hotel is good; a couple of minutes from the airport and maybe double that to down town san diego and the midway. the drive to the fantastic zoo (where my kids fed the giraffes; available every day between 12pm and 1 pm- unmissable) took 10 - 15 mins. the price of our stay at the hotel was ok - we paid maybe a little more than we expected, but when you add on free parking ( another hotel we considered down town wanted $30 per night to park) and the free internet, the price was about right. there are no safes in the room, but I used a safe box behind reception for the duration of our stay (although there wasn't much left to put into it towards the end of the holiday), and again this was free of charge. I don't get the impression that in the san diego we saw petty crime is a problem. we ate in the hotel a couple of nights; the restaurant had virtually shut down other than for breakfast over the holiday season, but the restricted menu and the food we chose from it and ate in the bar area were pretty good and reasonably priced a holiday in san diego in the winter is the epitome of cool, and the laid back friendly tone of this beautifully clean hotel means that we'll be more than happy to \"come home\" here again.", "Date": "January 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cRest and Relaxation for a Young Family - - and a GREAT LOCATION to boot!\u201d", "Author": "5877", "ReviewID": "UR92172592", "Content": "By far the BEST location and hotel experience for a young family like ours - - where proximately to all the great things in San Diego is important (Balboa Park, Seaport Village, etc.), but totally WITHOUT the hustle and bustle \"rat race\" of the city.

Hands down! Although our hotel room was no where near ready upon or arrival (as we had selected only one of the three suites on property, the day after New Years Eve celebrations at the hotel - - late check outs, etc), our love for the extra room in the suite with our new family was key. The mini-fridge, pull out couch/family room, and great view of the water at sunrise was a welcome touch. (And we loved the little Kuereg coffee machine to get us going in the morning.) But by far - - the ability to just get out and walk along the water, enjoy the history and patriotism of the Liberty Station naval training area, and sampling any number of the great food around the hotel was the perfect combination. One suggestion - - our personal vehicle was key, as this location is just far enough away from key locales, that having your own transportation was a must in our book. It worked out great, as the access to N Harbor Dr, Rosecrants, and the 5 & 8 freeways was a breeze.

This hotel was everything I expected and more. I was looking for a Marriott family hotel (Category 4 or lower) to redeem two free night certificates, and this hotel was a really good choice. It has been many years since I stayed at a Courtyard property, and I found the Courtyard Liberty Station to have a new, modern feel, which I really liked, and a lot more amenities than I would expect at a Courtyard. All the hotel personnel we interacted with were friendly, professional, and helpful. The location was great with direct access to a walking trail along the water, proximity to the airport, availability of several dining options at the hotel and within Liberty Station, and pretty easy access to the freeways for getting around the San Diego area. Rooms: I have Gold elite status in the Marriott Rewards program, but I\u2019m not someone who pushes or even asks for room upgrades. When I booked the room (by phone), the agent did ask for my room preferences, and they were met (two beds, higher floor, good view). We had a great view of the pool and the water/walking path. The room was well designed, attractive, and a good size. Furniture included two queen-size beds, a chair/lamp in a corner for reading or looking at the view, a desk/desk chair with a sliding table underneath it, and a dresser/credenza. The room was equipped with a single-brew Keurig coffee maker (coffee/tea were provided and replenished daily) and small refrigerator, nice flat screen TV, wired and wireless internet, and other electronic hookups. The bathroom had a single sink but a large vanity that was great for two women travelling together. Linens and towels seemed to be pretty good quality (nicer towels than some of the Marriott extended stay properties I have stayed this year). Staff/service: We (my sister and I) arrived separately. My sister, who is not a very experienced traveler, had an easy time getting to the hotel (using the hotel\u2019s complimentary shuttle from the San Diego airport) and having the hotel store her luggage (repeated on her departure day since she had a red eye flight and I left earlier to return to LAX with the rental car). Our room was cleaned in the morning while we were out for a walk. We were able to check in a little early, and we were able to get a slightly extended checkout. Front desk staff members were helpful and professional whenever we spoke to them. Property Amenities: The hotel had a nice outdoor seating area and a outdoor pool/jacuzzi (didn\u2019t use because of the weather), fitness room with Life Fitness equipment (multi-station weight machine and several pieces of cardio equipment), full service restaurant and snack bar/deli type place (didn\u2019t try either), three computers and a printer available for guest use, and probably other things that I didn\u2019t notice or use.

This area has retail shops, a Von\u2019s Grocery, a Trader Joe\u2019s, and restaurants too numerous to mention, including the fabulously fun Corvette Diner.

The location was central to downtown SD/harbor, Old Town, and Point Loma/Cabrillo. There was plenty to do, see, and eat near the hotel (Point Loma Seafood!), and most everything we wanted to visit was a quick jaunt in the car. It's a pretty recently redeveloped area and was completely safe and nice. We had a king room with a pullout bed for our 4-year-old and a pack-and-play for the baby, and it was tight but we fit. The room was not as spacious as some courtyards we've been in, but I would stay there again. The rooms are even smaller in the older hotels. It's still a new hotel and was very clean and pleasant. I used the guest laundry and the machine I chose happened to break on us and the front desk staff took a few minutes to figure out how to handle the problem, but my money was refunded and they gave us extra soap to run another load. The hotel is very near the airport which was initially a concern because my husband is a super light sleeper, but he slept through whatever flights there were (with the windows/balcony door closed), as did both kids. Airport noise was not a problem at all. As with most other Courtyards we've stayed at, the breakfast is a complete ripoff. We got the free breakfast rate and paid $10 extra per night to feed us and the kids, which is the only way to eat breakfast there. It's basically your free continental breakfast at any other hotel, plus some dude in a chef hat flipping you an omelet. That omelet was NOT worth $12 or whatever the menu lists it for.

The front desk staff acted like we were an inconvenience for them. We arrived at 3:00 PM and I said that we would wait to get a room with a nice view. A couple of weeks prior to our stay, I had talked with front desk staff and requested a room with a view of Liberty Park and/or bay. I am also a Marriott Reward Program member and have been for 30 years. On my rewards data, I have a permanent request for a high floor. Granted this hotel only has four floors. Well, it took us three rooms to get one with an acceptable view. First we were sent to a room on the second floor looking at a concrete roof and concrete wall of the next building. The next room, also second floor, all you saw when you looked out from the room was the high wall of the patio. The room was among their smallest, and it felt like you were in a dungeon. If you went out on the patio and looked over the top of the wall, you would see water. If you looked down, you saw roof. The third room was OK. We had to wait 30 minutes for it to be ready. Which was fine, and what we had said repeatedly when we first checked in. Third floor room, looked out over the roof of the portico at front of hotel, but did have a little view of distant hillside of Point Loma. We were tired by this time. Oh, the keys didn't work, so we had to go back to the front desk, again. We almost checked out on Saturday, but then decided to stay. I didn't sleep much at all the first night. The air conditioner sounded like a freight train was coming through the room, so every time it turned all, I would wake up. You would think that there would be better sound proofing in the newer hotels. People talking next door, doors banging, woke me at 1:00 AM.

Close to the zoo, Seaworld, Old Town, La Jolla, Mission Bay & the airport. The rooms are clean, nice and a good size. The pool area is very nice. The restaurant is great with a good breakfast buffet. The staff are nice and courteous. Both check in & out took 3 minutes!! The hotel is also right next to a plaza filled with restaurants & Starbucks. The restaurants might not be great, but it'll do for the first day you arrive. The hotel is also a 10min walk to another plaza with Vons, Trader Joes, and yes Starbucks! I actually have nothing negative to say!! Trust me this is a first. My tip to travelers is STAY AT THIS HOTEL. You will be surprised. Two other things that make this hotel a great deal: 1-FREE PARKING (some hotels were asking for $25/day) and room service until 10pm (we have stayed at expensive hotels with room service only between 5-8pm)", "Date": "July 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glendale, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cBetter than expected; staff adds charm.\u201d", "Author": "parlayjay", "ReviewID": "UR68747846", "Content": "This was my first trip to California.

I chose to hold out and wait for something closer to my liking. The agent helping me for my entire stay was Joe. He definitely did a good job and hopefully somebody from this Courtyard will recognize him for his efforts. (He checked us in, was there when we went out for dinner and checked us out the next morning!) Our waiting for a room was actually a good thing as we were able to see the nearby attractions like the USS Recruit. We also walked up and down the area looking over the bridge (Halsey Rd) and had our 5-year-old play at the Park at Beacon Point. When we did finally get into a room it fit our requests. The room was cozy and clean. Although I would recommend staying in a King suite as it has more room and a better view. Our view was slightly obstructed by palm trees but all-in-all it wasn't bad. The area around the hotel is clean and there are plenty of restaurants in the area too if you don't feel like eating hotel food. It's close to the San Diego Zoo/Seaport Village/Point Loma.

We did have a rental car which made it very convenient to get around. The hotel does NOT charge for parking which is a huge plus because many hotels do in the area. Check-in was easy and they allowed us to check in early around 1pm. It\u2019s a 5 minute drive from the airport so it was nice to get right to the hotel and unload after a long flight. The rooms were very nice and clean. We had two queen beds and a single sleeper which was perfect for our two boys (ages 3 and 5). Just allowed them to have their own beds at night. The bathroom was large, the TV was big and offered plenty of channels to watch. The room had a mini-fridge which was perfect to store milk, water, pop, etc. The room also had a Keurig coffee maker which was a very nice touch. Very convenient to make a cup of coffee and they offered plenty of coffee flavors. Our room did not have a balcony, but there are rooms that have them. I think because we got the room with the sleeper sofa meant there was not a balcony but we preferred the sleeper sofa option. Yes the hotel is near the airport but when you are in your room you don\u2019t really notice it. They built it in such a way that it blocks out the noise very well where it didn\u2019t bother us at all. Most of the flights are done by 10pm anyway. The kids loved the pool\u2026was heated and also had a hot tub area as well. Lots of outdoor patio space with a fire-pit but we never used much of that. The hotel is very conveniently location near restaurants, Starbucks, grocery store, etc. There is a walking path right outside the doors that leads to a great playground for the kids. The hotel had a restaurant, caf\u00e9, and bar as well. We never ate at the restaurant but it sure smelled good. The hotel does not offer a free breakfast so we just got items at the local grocery store and used our fridge in our room to cover the first meal of the day. There is a great pizza place nearby (Oggi\u2019s) and Subway as well but most of the time we were out and about around San Diego. Though the hotel was a Courtyard it felt more like a big hotel with all the amenities it offered. We were very pleased with our entire stay. We really felt this was one of the best hotels we have stayed at for the money. I hope they keep up what they are currently doing with this property because I will surely stay here again in the future. I also heard the property next door (Homewood Suites) is owned by the same owner so we would also look to stay there as well.

They were awesome. We had a room on the 4th floor that was overall quiet. The view was just fantastic. We could see the city, the water, the pool. The airport is close by so yes you do hear airplanes but that is one noise that has never bothered me too much. If you close the sliding glass door you don't hear much. The pool itself got pretty crowded but it is summer and that's the way it is in summer. The noise from the pool does tend to get kind of loud but it ends once the pool closes so it's not too bad. Housekeeping does tend to come later in the day but they clean your room every single day and they do a thorough job. The little deli downstairs is a nice added touch, the bar is small but sufficient, there are many seating areas outside; one with a fireplace and one with a firepit. There is a walking path by the water that will take you down to liberty station where there is a Starbucks, Panera bread that has some awesome pastries and sandwiches, a pizza place and a Von's to buy groceries. There is also a Subway, TCBY yogurt and a brewery within walking distance in the other direction. Parking was a challenge when the property was full but parking is free. I will def be back to this property. Point Loma seafood is close by and is one of the best sea food places I've ever eaten. Harbor Island and Shelter Island are close by and a must see just for the beauty and to sit and watch sailboats or take a walk or jog. Coronado is not too far...maybe 10 mins and Seaworld is not too far either. There is a free shuttle to the airport and the shuttle drivers are kind and courteous. We used the wireless internet in our room. That was a real plus. We ordered room service and the food was average hotel food and it took about an hour for our sandwich.

Although I only ate breakfast at the hotel one day, I will second what another reviewer said and say that the sevice was less than stellar. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't as good as expected. Downtown is close by and there is a grocery store and other places close by as well. I'm going to be staying here again for sure.", "Date": "October 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cFantastic property - Rivals boutique hotels\u201d", "Author": "luv2travelnescape", "ReviewID": "UR20171517", "Content": "LOVED the brand new facilities - lobby bar, outdoor patio with firepit and water views, and all the modern conveniences - business center, sundries shop, deli, on-site guest laundry.

Conveniently located, near new restaurants and shops, and less than 10 minutes away to Sea Word, airport, and Downtown. The NOT SO GOOD - I could hear planes take off from the airport in Room 158. This wasn't as bad as constantly hearing a door open and shut loudly to a service area nearby. Poor service in the restaurant - We weret tired of standing around waiting to be seated, then helped ourselves to breakast buffet. Half-way through our meal a server finally acknowledged us and offered drinks. Had breakfast again the following day and same poor service (two different servers on staff).

The good stuff: This hotel is brand new, and the facilities are gorgeous. It smells like new carpet when you walk into the loby (we're not used to that). All rooms have a small (very small) refrigerator, huge flat panel TV, a pretty cool coffee maker, a good amount of space, and a large bathroom. The rooms on one side of the hotel are waterfront. The swimming pool is a decent size and it is heated so that you can even swim at night in San Diego without freezing in the cool air. The hot tub was very hot and big enough for six adults. There are plenty of tables outside and it was easy to find a spot by the pool. The not-so good stuff: Many of the rooms do not have a view. The first room that we were given, which we were told by the front desk was a water front room, had a tiny balcony (maybe 18 inches wide) and it overlooked a terra cotta roof on the second floor -- no water view. We called the front desk and were immediately moved to a better room, with a view, and a much larger balcony. The bigger balcony had no furniture - which I found strange. We were there for four nights and our room was only cleaned by the maid only twice. One of the two times the maid came was because we asked the front desk that day to make sure that our room was cleaned. When the maid cleaned the room, the small bottles of shampoo were not refilled. The coffee cannisters that can make one cup each in the room were not replaced after they was used. We actually ran out of toilet tissue on one of the days without maid service. The hotel ran out of towels by the pool on three occasions during our stay. At checkout, I told management about our issues and no appologies were made. I was told by the manager that she had been \"off\" for the last few days. When I told her about the coffee she told me that the hotel may be out of the in-room coffee, but that complementary coffee is available to all guests in the loby and that I should have known that from reading information left in the room. Anyway, we did like the hotel, regardless of our small problems. The location is pretty central. We were able to get to Old Town for dinner in about 10 minutes, Ocean Beach is about 15 minutes away, and La Jolla Cove was about 25 minutes away. Our kids really enjoyed the pool and the firepit is a nice touch at night. I rated this hotel above average, because I think that the hotel has great potential and it opened for business only very recently.", "Date": "August 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow, PA", "Title": "\u201cLoved this hotel--highly recommend\u201d", "Author": "landr", "ReviewID": "UR18623859", "Content": "Fabulous NEW hotel--very modern amenities with beautiful furnishings.

This was our first time staying close to Gaslamp and we were a bit hesitant at first... WE LOVED IT!!!! this property faces a little bay that even though small is enough to make your early morning stroll relaxing and fresh. The hotel grounds are extremely well kept (brand new property) and the hotel staff was very friendly. The room was impeccable and spacious (we got a two queen bed room facing downtown and the bay), our only complaint was that the \"fancy\" coffee maker didn't work at all and they never took care of it even though we mentioned it the first morning. This didn't really affect our trip since Starbucks is on walking distance (on the same plaza). The pool looked big enough, the jacuzzi was tempting but didn't get to use it, and the outside fire pit was a great touch. We didn't use the breakfast buffet since we normally like to go grab breakfast somewhere else, but we walked around and were surprised by the selection.

Inside the room, a little stuffy, but gleaming new stuff as the hotel has been opened only two months. I was looking for the AC controls and could not fine them. I remember reading on the website some rooms don't have all the amenities, thinking I got shafted with the AC. Unpack and there were only three drawers, when other places have double the amount, closet was small, so a five day stay would pack the closet, but still doable. I walk back to the front desk, ask the lady, who was very polite about the AC. She says all the rooms have AC. I go back to the room, the controls are behind this fake mini plant. AC worked, a little loud, but cool the room quickly. There was a mini fridge which had two buttons, more of an energy saver type fridge. I asked, no microwave, none even to rent for your stay, still on order. There was a restaurant, lunch-deli-coffee stand and bar in the hotel, did not try any. Fitness center was small, but new and new machines, water cooler included. Pool looked nice, did not try. The elevator closest to the lobby was broken for the entire time of my stay, there was another elevator at the other end of the hotel, but stairs are fine for the second floor. I recommend the highest floor as you don't hear footsteps of three year olds running back and forth from the room top of you. All doors seem to slam shut kinda loud, even with door closers on them, may the closers need an adjustment. Housekeeping, I think I had one the first part of my stay, I could tell alot of details were not done like wiping down the shower, dusting, making the bed better. I still tipped daily. The third day, she leaves a note, thanking me for the tips. I'm thinking she's going on days off and yes, I could tell the next housekeeper was better. Free parking, I'd say 10 minutes max to the Gaslamp or Pacific Beach. Only weird thing is I entered the hotel address in my GPS and got lost in the Liberty Station complex as it was the old Navy Training Center. Best to enter off of Rosecrans or Pacific Highway and two minutes, you are right there. A supermarket about eight blocks away (very walkable) and a cluster of high end fast food and sit down restaurants two blocks away towards Pacific Highway within the complex. Oh, airport noise, you can hear planes take off, but it's nothing distracting, unless you are the type that wants to complain just about everything.

This hotel is a typical Courtyard, meaning you get exactly what you expect. It is still very new, in great condition and clean. The front desk staf bent over backwards to accomodate requests. We got a King room with a pullout couch for our 7 year old. Marriott beds and linens are excellent. The bathroom was fairly large, but there was a small leak in the elbow under the sink. They have the new K-cup coffee makers in the rooms which is great for coffee, but they did not provide tea. There was a fridge in the room which was very convenient. The room had the Connect feature which allows you to run your computer off the HD TV screen and to plug in your MP3 to play over the TV speakers. The room also had a small balcony. My daughter LOVED the pool which was outdoors, but heated. I loved the jacuzzi. The hotel cafe served breakfast and dinner for an additional fee, although we did not eat there. The hotel is within 10 minutes or less of Seaworld, the Zoo, Old Towne and the Gaslight areas. Parking is free and there is a free shuttle to and from the airport. Our only issue was we had a 5:00am shuttle scheduled and the driver was a good 15 minutes late (he must have slept in!). What made it worse, was they share the shuttle with the other hotel, I think it was a Hilton Garden Inn, and after we got on with 3 other people from the Courtyard we stopped at the HGI and there were 7 people that had the shuttle booked for the same time. There was no room for everyone and the people at the HGI had to wait for him to drop us off and return. Overall, a good predictable hotel although a bit pricey. I wish Courtyard would include a breakfast in the price.", "Date": "July 16, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Courtyard by Marriott San Diego Airport/Liberty Station", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60750-d1027494-Reviews-Courtyard_by_Marriott_San_Diego_Airport_Liberty_Station-San_Diego_California.html", "Price": "$182 - $226*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">2592 Laning Road</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">San Diego</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">92106</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2515646", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/29/6d/7f/courtyard-pool-at-night.jpg"}}
