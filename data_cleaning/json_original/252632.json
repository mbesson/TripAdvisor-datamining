{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Excellent for the price This was one of the lower priced hotels for an International Conference and stayed 6 days. I felt it was good value, clean rooms, comfortable, enough amenities and good buffet breakfast with fruit, juices, cereals, breads and hot dishes was included in price. It is close to two metro lines, and walking distance to Zocola, many local cafes in surrounding streets. It was quiet - yes some pipe noise but no worse than many places and wasn't a problem. I would definitely stay here again.

The outside of the hotel looks unassuming, but once you enter the front doors you quickly realize that this is a quality hotel: marble floors, spotless front desk, nice lobby furniture. This was a happy surprise because given how moderate the price of the room was, it could have been the opposite in terms of quality. The room itself was also nice:good solid-wood furniture, good quality bedsheets, pillows, and towels. The bathroom was large and had marble floors. If you are in Mexico City on business and you have a laptop, there is free wireless internet access in the rooms. I had breakfast at the hotel restaurant and the portions were generous. The hotel is only four blocks away from the Zocalo and one block away from the Palacio de Bellas Artes. There are numerous restaurants and shops nearby. You can walk to the Zona Rosa in just 15 minutes.", "Date": "Jun 13, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR179570948", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "AndeanTraveler"}, {"Content": "will serve the purpose We felt comfortable in this hotel. It was clean; we even had a bedspread looking just washed ( a rare thing). It is true the pipes are noisy; but earplugs took care of this.However, the wall were dirty, the furniture badly scuffed. The bathroom was in much better condition, however.The restaurant has enough for breakfast (buffet only) although at 60 pesos it is a bit steep if you eat light. But it is convenient and pleasing; and I did not find better nearby. Note: there was a tour from France one morning and they had French fare for breakfast (beef bourguignon).Conclusion: a decent, good enough address.", "Date": "Nov 30, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR809586170", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "carolina20"}, {"Content": "good choice We were supposed to stay at Hotel Roble, but our taxidriver would not recommend us to stay there, and he recommended Hotel Marlowe instead.
