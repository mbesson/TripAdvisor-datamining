The grounds and parking lot were clean, no litter or debris. The office was spotless. There are awards for quality from Super 8 corporate hanging on the wall behind the front desk. Check in was quick and easy. The room was on the first floor, so we heard a little noise from upstairs but they were quiet after 10 PM. The room was quite large (maybe because we were on the corner) and there was plenty of room for suitcases and hanging items. Large enough for my 10 year old to run in circles and do cartwheels, lol. The door was secure with a deadbolt as well as a chain lock. The carpet and bedding looked newer. The beds were quite comfortable, firm with no sagging, clean and the sheets were fresh. No signs of bedbugs on the mattresses or the surrounding area. AC/heater/fan worked well. The refridgerator, microwave and coffee maker (included in the standard room) worked well and were clean. The towels were soft and smelled fresh. Tub/shower combo and toilet in bathroom, seperate vanity outside the bathroom. Hair dryer by vanity. Adequate shampoo, hand soap, body soap, coffee etc. The ice machine worked well and we were actually able to fill our cooler as we left. We have stayed at a few places that actually charged for the ice, so this was a perk. The breakfast was a plentiful supply of fresh doughnuts and bagels with butter available, juice, coffee etc. No cream cheese, and no cereal or milk. But the doughnuts were delicious! As we were leaving to check out, we were able to look in most of the other rooms on the first floor as they were cleaning them and probably airing them out as it was kind of a cool day. All of the rooms we saw were just as updated and clean as the one we had been in. Some of them had a king bed instead of the two queens and there was a garden tub in the room, as opposed to just the tub/shower combo, so that may be something to ask about.

The only room available when I called was a smoking room but I took it. The person who took my reservation was very friendly and knowledgable. He also had a nice sense of humor and good manners. The clerk who greeted me when I arrived wasn't Raj, but he was equally friendly and helpful. I was afraid about the room smell, but was pleasantly surprised that the 'aroma' was very mild and unnoticeable within minutes. Even when I left the room for a a quick shopping trip, the smell was barely noticable when I returned. Not bad. There was no elevator but the motel is only 2 stories. For an overnight, not a problem. Adequate parking available near the room and out of the sun. No pool. Adequate ice machines and many near-by places to purchase dinner and/or snacks. Refrigerator in the room. Large room. Large bathroom. Large dressing room. Large bed. Nice sheets. More than adequate AC. HBO and the good cable channels. Continental breakfast included. Close to freeways and many San Fernando Valley attractions. I liked it. Very clean and quiet. This is only the second time I have stayed at a Motel for the night while driving since I was a kid.

This one LOOKS worse than it actually is. We booked here for two nights during a trip to SoCal planning to spend time at the beach and check out Griffith Observatory. We booked for value ($70 a night, or so) and sacrificed proximity to the beaches; with traffic it took often an hour and a half to drive to the coast. If you're in SoCal for the beaches, I would recommend booking a hotel closer to the coast and thereby saving yourself some gas money. It was a bit of false economy on our part to skimp on the hotel yet spend all that time commuting to the coast. Nevertheless, the room was very clean. It was spacious (for a budget motel), with a large tv and a hairdryer. The microwave and small fridge came in very handy because on the first night we ventured out for some Thai food and were able to store and reheat our leftovers for the next day's lunch. Our king size bed was very comfortable and everything seemed clean and in working order.

It's a clean property with clean rooms and a friendly and helpful staff. The free broadband internet service was drop dead easy to use. The shower head delivered wonderful water volume unlike those miserable water saver types at some places, AND it was installed high enough on the wall that tall people like myself don't have to hunch down to get under it - much appreciated. On the down side, the bed sheets were almost like plastic. I've never felt linens like that before. I suspect they were selected for their durability. The bathroom is roomy - large enough for wheelchair access. Oddly, the commode was positioned in this large bathroom so that only adults with long arms can reach the bathroom tissue on the opposite wall without getting up. Pastries were available in the office in the morning, but they obviously get them from one of the many local Mexican businesses because although they were attractive looking, they had a taste that only someone raised south of the border would appreciate. The worst thing though was the poor neighborhood. It's an area in decline - run down and seedy looking (which may explain the multitude of not so hidden security cameras). It made us feel uncomfortable. The Super 8, North Hollywood is a super value. Clean rooms at bargain prices. It's a shame really, because if it weren't for the location, we would give this motel high marks. Bottom Line Would we stay there again?
