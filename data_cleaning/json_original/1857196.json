The floorheating in the bathroom is a plus. The heating/cooling system in the rooms though did not work or we could not figure out how to have them set appropriate to our wishes. We noticed that our mobiles had no reception at all in the room but they worked fine as soon as we got out into the hall. There is a free bottle of water in each room. A small safe is available as well but no minibar. The mattresses we found too hard to sleep on. Checking out went smoothly and again friendly staff.

Or else just cross the street and walk into East's Penzlauer Berg to sit on one of the many terraces and have a drink, diner, lunch or brunch, and shop in all the nice design and vintage shops. Club Week-end is also around the corner. We did not use breakfast in hotel, as in Penzlauer Berg around the corner there are lots of cheap(er) breakfast places to find. NOTE: bed sheets are anti-allergic, which is good, but pillows and duvets are filled with down/feather instead of synthetic filling, so for some people that might be not anti-allergic at all.", "Date": "May 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat value, well finished hotel\u201d", "Author": "justsimplyme", "ReviewID": "UR106245256", "Content": "The concierge were well informed, helpful and could speak good English. Not too far from Alexandraplatz, albeit not as close as some hotels but not far enough to cause a problem. The room was very well maintained, as one would expect considering how modern and new the hotel is. Upon entering you are greeted with a fresh bottle of mineral water and your name appearing on the TV screen - a nice touch. The bed was fantastic and offered a great night sleep. The omission of a mini-bar was unfortunate as was the layout of the mirrors in the room as it was not possible to stand in front of the full length mirrors due to obstacles. However, this latter gripe may be limited to the design of our room specifically and may not be a reflection of all of the rooms in the hotel. The electronic user-controlled blinds were great at blocking out a good deal of sunlight. TV channels were good albeit fairly basic offering the usual CNN, BBC News etc. An excellent feature of the room is the sound loop between the TV in the bedroom and the bathroom which allows for listening to music whilst showering / shaving. The bathroom itself was very good. The shower was hot and powerful with plenty of room within the unit itself. There was also a heated floor with thermostat which could reach very warm temperatures. Unfortunately there was no heated towel rail. Perhaps the most off-putting thing about the bathroom was the door itself. There was only one door to the bathroom and toilet which was on a hinge that could either create an open plan bathroom and toilet area or a partition for a separate toilet area. This system didn't grant much privacy and the door was made out of frosted glass which, again, didn't grant much privacy. The towels were changed daily and the housekeeping service was generally very good, albeit quite hasty to gain access on the final day of our stay. The breakfast was very good with a diverse range of food on offer. Perhaps the staff could have done a slightly better job of cleaning down the tables faster and more thoroughly as, for example, the chair was slightly dirty when I came to sit down. Overall - excellent stay for a great price (obtained through a late deal via lastminute.com). Highly recommended.", "Date": "April 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "dublin", "Title": "\u201cVERY RESONABLY PRICED HOTEL\u201d", "Author": "DublinCarolk", "ReviewID": "UR101851882", "Content": "A very nice hotel, very good value, perfect for sight seeing in east Berlin, close to all attractions.
