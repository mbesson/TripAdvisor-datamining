The hotel is on the Potsdamer Strasse, which isn't such a great street per se, however, with a M85 bus right out front, that stops directly at the Brandenberg Gate, it really is a great location. And it's a short 10 minute walk directly to Potsdamer platz, which has a main train station. The rooms were very nice, clean, although we were on the 3rd floor, no elevator, but it was fine. The hostess was lovely and very friendly. Breakfast was great, typical european style, which i liked. Overall for a low cost stay, it is a gem!", "Date": "October 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cAbove average\u201d", "Author": "RegisToronto", "ReviewID": "UR1784757", "Content": "Stayed three nights at the Villa Amadeus during Easter. Found the hotel conveniently located, within walking distance of the city center and with easy access to Berlin's metro lines. My room was spacious and well furinished, with two single beds, armchair, desk, closet and colour TV with international chanels (CNN, BBC etc), but no mini bar unfortunately. Bathroom was equaly spacious and eqquiped with toiletries and hairdryer, but no bathtub. Room and hotel premises appeared very clean. Breakfest was served starting at 8 am in a buffet style and consisted of coffee, tea, juices, bread, butter, selection of cheeses, ham, salami, boiled eggs, confitures, mozzarela with tomatoes, and steamed sausages. I was impressed with the quality of items served. Staff is courteous for european standards of customer service. Paid 50 euros per night, inclusive of breakfest. Would definetely stay there again.", "Date": "April 14, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cHotel Villa Amadeus, quiet in the middle of the town\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR825969", "Content": "Hotel Villa Amadeus, quiet in middle of the town It's a romantic hotel on a very quiet place near the Potsdamerplatz.
