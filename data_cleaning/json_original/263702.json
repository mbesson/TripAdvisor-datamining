What suprised me in a good way was the location. The street is beautiful, and the neighborhood, not central which was a perfect excuse to explore another part of London. Even I walked to Knightsbridge from where the Hotel was, and loved it. Pass through Kessington. There are a bunch of nice places to hang out and dine at night, and a couple of mini supermarkets opened all night. The staff was very helpful, giving me directions and tube explanations.

At half the price it may have been acceptable, but believe me there are much better deals available for the prices quoted. Also be aware that on its website it says (and still does) \"Each room has it own private shower & toilet\" but actually when I got there, I was told this was not the case because my room was booked through an online agency - very misleading. Bathroom and toilet was up two sets of stairs. Lock on the cupboard-sized room had been modified so you could not lock it from the inside when you were asleep (see pics). Bait box for mice/rats found under the bed (see pic) Breakfast poor but seeing as it was seemingly only prepared from a cupboard in the hallway, that's of no real surprise. I was only there to sleep for one night but felt sorry for any tourists staying longer, who were needlessly paying over the odds for apathetic service and a spartan breakfast. In big letters behind the reception desk it says \"No refunds\"... You don't need to be a genius to work out why they have chosen to say that. To so openly say, whatever level of service or quality of room you get, we never give any refunds, should be enough to make you look elsewhere. By the way, I post lots of reviews and give feedback to hotels - this is the first where I've said things are anywhere this bad. Yes this isn't promoted as a top notch hotel, but for what you pay, you can reasonably expect more than this.

I travel to London frequently and had the benefit to visit all potential hotels for our stay. I visited Paddington, Victoria, Earls Court, Kennsington, Kings Cross & most of the inner city Travelodges. I chose the Sara Hotel because it was the cleanest, largest rooms, handy location to the tube, nice & quiet street, friendly and of course the price. The Sara was a stand out and when we stayed it exceeded our expections. As an airline pilot, I stay at a lot of high quality hotels around the world and have a fair idea of what makes a good hotel.

My husband, my father, my aunt and I booked this hotel through the internet, looking at the pictures on the net they didn't look too bad. We booked two single rooms and a double.

The smell in the room was of mould, old tobacco and dried urine. They had orange stripy, stained material on the floor instead of carpet. The walls were covered in dirty pink wallpaper with lots of holes filled in with unpainted polyfiller. We pulled back the throwover on the bed to reveal dirty brown stains on the sheets and throw. Thinking we wouldn't find another hotel this late we asked to be moved to another room. They moved us to another room, which was almost as bad. It wasn't as smelly, and at least this one had carpet! We removed the covers from the bed and laid out our towels beneath us and used our coats as covers. My father and aunt had arrived earlier by plane. Their rooms were just as bad with the smell and the filthy beds and shower. My aunt even found blood stains on the blankets. The showers were covered in mould. My room was opposite my aunts. I turned on the shower and a trickle of cold water came out. I went across to her room to check out her shower. I turned it on, the same cold trickle of water came out and the water in my room stopped when she turned hers on. On top af all this hassle, the workers were following us around demanding payment, probably afraid we wouldn't pay after such a bad experience. I asked to speak to the manager and I was told he will be waiting for me the next morning. The next morning not only was the manager not there but there was no receptionist either, we thought they must be all hiding.
