The location of the hotel ist perfect. Just a 1 minute walk and you are at the Zoo station which is perfect to catch trains, subways or buses. In the other direction it is a 1 minute walk and you are in the middle of Kurf\u00fcrstendamm, one of the main shopping areas in Berlin. Lots of restaurants are close by as well. There is free Wlan in the lobby and free Wlan in your room if you book breakfast, which I would recommend because it is a really good breakfast with a small but very good selection and really great coffee. The only thing I miss is a gym.

Stylistically the hotel looks fine and has been dressed very simply. In terms of location, there are a number of nice bars and restaurants within 10 minutes walk and the excellent trains are also easily accessible within 5 minutes. The journey from the airport was approximately 45 minutes from recollection. Breakfast wasn't included but I believe you could purchase a few things from behind the very small bar but we found a decent coffee shop along the road. The bar itself merged into the reception area and was very sparse in terms of furniture; I don't think it would take very long for all seating to be taken. Generally it was quite a cold atmosphere in the hotel and didn't feel that welcoming. My issue with the hotel was the service we received. On checking in we discovered we had been given a twin room rather than a double room. On explanation of this to staff they informed me that I should have specifically requested a double room on booking (needless to say a double room was selected on the internet booking form). We were informed as it was New Year's Eve and the hotel was full there were no other double rooms and that we could push the beds together. On asking to speak to the manager we were greeted with huffs of derision and a discussion between staff in German which were accompanied by looks in our direction and, although only speculating, it felt as though we were being ridiculed. A double room was found surprisingly easily to be honest although instead of a double duvet we were provided with two seperate blankets. This whole process took about 30 minutes and it felt as though we had to really press to get what we had booked and were made to feel as if we were in the wrong. The general demeanour of staff was generally quite poor, although we found one receptionist to be particularly helpful in terms of providing insight into trains and generally getting around Berlin. We may have been a little unfortunate in terms of staff not being overly happy with working over the new year period but I would have expected better and needless to say has put me off from using the Motel One brand, which is a pity because they appear to be quite plentiful, reasonably priced and appear quite neutral in their decor.", "Date": "September 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cConvenient, clean, pleasant and great value for money\u201d", "Author": "Busybee81", "ReviewID": "UR109040467", "Content": "An excellent hotel conveniently located to combine a business meeting with a little Berlin shopping.

This hotel has only two stars, but should have at least three in my opinion. Positive points: - Nice and trendy lobby - Nicely decorated rooms, with comfortable beds and a flat screen. Room was even bigger then I had anticipated. When booking the hotel, because it was only a two star, I was a bit fearfull that the rooms would be the size of a shoebox. However, this is not the case: rooms are a decent size: you easily can spend some time in them relaxing after a day of sightseeing and while preparing for dinner. - Modern, well-equiped bathrooms. - Cleaning was done very thoroughly. - Great breakfast: selection of various rolls and breads, croissant, cheese and cold cuts, boiled eggs. Very good orange juice and excellent latte machiato's. - Although the hotel is located next to the track, you will not hear a thing: great isolation. The rooms directly facing the track even have double windows (not double glazing, but really double windows) - They store your luggage on your last day if you have a late flight: it is kept in a locked room. - Maybe the most important thing: very nice staff, especially the manager who was on duty most of the time during our stay. Originally we were only supposed to stay for three nights. Unfortunately we ended up missing our flight to Brussels due to some problems with Deutsche Bahn (trains to Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport being cancelled, etc.) and we had to stay a full day extra as a result. So we asked the service desk at the airport to phone the hotel to confirm they had rooms avaiable. When we arrived back at the hotel in the city centre, after a gruelling trip with our luggage, the manager was very nice to us and gave us a free upgrade to a superior room. I will recommend this hotel to anyone going to Berlin (and the Motel One chain in general, as I understand they have hotels in various German cities) and when I return to Germany I will certainly choose it again. As for Berlin, it was my first time in this city and I did not know what to expect. I absolutely loved it though. It is a very beautiful city, very cultural, and the shopping is divine. You certainly have to visit the Sony Center at the Potzdamer Platz. Also, you can try to get a private tour of the Reichstag (German parliament): you can e-mail their visitors service and make a request for a tour. If your request gets honored (which is not sure, because the tours are in high demand) you get a ninety minutes free tour with a guide through parts of the Reichstag that are not open to other visitors. Afterwards you can visit the Dome without having to wait in line (which can take up to two hours). We got lucky and were allowed to take the tour and it was great. Furthermore, you should also visit the Neues Museum with the famous buste of Egyptian queen Nefertete. For restaurants, definitely try Tres, a great Spanish restaurant / tapasbar, we stumbled upon one evening. It is located at the Lychener Strasse in the Prenzlauer Berg district. It has the greatest tapas platter and main courses are also very good. I can also recommend Mr Hai at the Savignyplatz, a thai / vietnamese restaurant and Kuchi, in the Kantstrasse which indeed has great sushi.", "Date": "October 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Porto Alegre, RS", "Title": "\u201cBrand new, trendy hotel at an excelent location\u201d", "Author": "TravelBugBR", "ReviewID": "UR69795828", "Content": "Motel One is a low cost, design hotel chain.

The reception man was friendly, the bar/reception area and public corridors were very funky, modern and stylish and the whole place looked very new and clean. We were amazed by the size of the room as it was much bigger than we were expecting. Be warned though the standard rooms looked like they were about a third of the size (i.e. not much bigger than the bed) The bathroom was small but functional with very trendy wash basin and one of the best showers I've ever used in a European Hotel. Plasma screen on wall which also seemed to take DVDs which they don't mention on their site. Breakfast was fine. It was Continental with some cereal as well but mainly yoghurt, rolls and cold meat but for \u20ac6.50 per adult and free for the children it was great. They allowed us to check out late (1400) which meant we could leave our luggage whilst we went to the Zoo. It is only a maximum of 5 minutes walk from Zoo Station (seemed like a fairly safe area although we did go past some kind of sex shop and Museum. Not too obvious but my 9 year old daughter was definitely wondering what it was). However the proximity to the Station is this hotels undoing. There are trains stopping just outside the windows constantly. Every minute during the day and almost as frequent until midnight and from 0500. I presume at weekends it will be all night as the trains run through the night. Although they say the rooms are soundproofed I doubt this as the squealing wheels were quite clearly heard as well as some announcements. As all of the rooms seem to be on one side of the hotel I think they will all be affected by this to some degree. Some rooms will be near the end of the platform whilst others will be nearer the bridge but I suspect they will all hear trains rumbling past. Almost everything about this hotel was fantastic, especially for the price, but I am afraid none of this will ever save it from the chronic sound pollution and as such I would never be able to stay there again. Also seeing one of their other properties near Alexanderplatz Station I suspect a lot of their properties are the same and in a City where public transport sometimes runs for 24 hours I think this is a major issue. I accept the hotel is very reasonably priced and you can't expect luxury but the basic requirement of sleeping is very important whatever price you pay. Hope this helps someone.", "Date": "October 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cDelightful Stay - Excellent Service!\u201d", "Author": "SalimaTouchal", "ReviewID": "UR10186418", "Content": "The Motel One Berlin-Ku'Damm is a modern, beautiful and upbeat hotel, located only a few minutes by foot to the public transportation (Bahnhof Zoo), the famous shopping mile Kurf\u00fcstendamm, various interesting sights, touring bus stops and lots of great restaurants. We stayed at a good sized double room, which was clearly structured, very clean, light and offered a small but modern shower/toilet. The beds were very comfortable and air conditioning easily adjustable. We only stayed one night, so we didn\u2019t bother, that the room didn\u2019t offer a closet, but only an area where you can hang up your coats and clothes. Also there\u2019s neither a phone nor a safe deposit box in the room, which we didn\u2019t mind either. We experienced the hotel staff to be very friendly and helpful, focusing and responding to our requests at once. We were positively surprised about the big breakfast buffet, which offered coffee, tea, juice, various bred, croissants, and apart the classical bred toppings (butter, jam, honey) also cold cuts, cheese and cereal. On the downside, if you are not used to the city noises you might find it hard to fall asleep, as the hotel is located along the railroad tracks, so ask for a room on the back side facing the Theater. However, all in all a very pleasant and recommendable stay.", "Date": "October 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel. Shame about the Service\u201d", "Author": "dolles", "ReviewID": "UR10031485", "Content": "Stayed here for a three day break in Sept 07, Had a few issues with the hotel, The rooms are quite compact. We booked a double room but the the room we got had two separate single beds not very romantic for a couple. Service at reception was slow, Staff behind the desk spoke excellent english and were very helpful but waiting time was too long. There was no do not distrub signs in the room and the cleaners kept walking in on us in the morning time at least two or three times each morning from 9am onwards. Felt like we had to rush out of the room to let them get on with it. The corridoors were quite noisy early in the morning seemed to be a lot of doors banging. Also no safe in the room was a big dis-advantage. Not sure if we could use the safe behind reception but you had to wait so long to be served at reception it would have been too much hassle. There was no information booklet in the room to inform you of any of the services in the hotel. My biggest gripe with the hotel was one evening we decided to have a drink in the hotel bar. I queued at the bar while people in front of me got served then the night porter took my order but before he got the drinks together another person approached the bar and he served this person their drinks before me. Then another lady approached the bar and yet again he served this lady before me even though I was at the bar and he had taken my order before either of these two people. At that stage I walked away and told him to cancel the order that I had been waiting too long. The hotel is situated near the Kudamn which is a very up market street in west Berlin, Nice location if you want to spend time shopping for expensive designer labels but if you are more interested in seeing the city like I was. There is no real advantage in staying near the Ku'damn. In my personal experience I wasn't impressed with the restaurants around the area very much. And some of the bars were quite expensive plus didn't have much of a selection of bars. The hotel is situated very close to the Zoo Garten train station it is about 50m away, You can get direct train links to Sch\u00f6nefeld airport from this station which was very convenient. And Berlin Zoo is across the road from the station. Plus most of the main tourist sites are not too far on the S & U bahn systems. This does mean however that a train line runs past the hotel. The windows have very good sound proofing so it did not cause a problem. Could hear the train passing but sounded like it was in the distance when the window was closed. That said we were staying on the west side of the hotel and the line was situated on the East side of the hotel. Rooms have air-con which we didn't need to use, So I am not sure if there is any extra charge or not. Again this is where an information booklet on hotel services would have been handy. The whole hotel is impeccably clean and nicely decorated. Felt the hotel was more business orientated than tourist.", "Date": "October 2, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Motel One Berlin-Ku'damm", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d662528-Reviews-Motel_One_Berlin_Ku_damm-Berlin.html", "Price": "$91 - $137*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Kantstrasse 7-11a</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">10623</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "662528", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/bf/d2/bfd2cf1baa70f4528ed5f49aba2e4ad98large.jpg"}}
