{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Rude and Unhelpful When we arrived at the apartment, we were excited since the location was good and it was clean. I am pretty low key and this is all I generally require. However, as the day wore on and the room got colder, we called the office to have someone fix the heat. They did nothing and when we called back and told them that the heat was still not working, they blamed us. We called a third time and they said it was too late we should have called earlier. We had to stay in a freezing cold apartment, it was so cold in the middle of the night that we could see our breath. When we called the next morning, again they treated us like we broke it and or could not figure out how to work a thermostat. Finally, after three more phone calls they sent someone over. Finally, they admitted that it was broken and gave us a new room. When I asked them for a partial refund, they told me I had to email them. I emailed them over a week ago and they NEVER RESPONDED. Rude people, unwelcoming atmosphere.", "Date": "Dec 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR110999555", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "havemoneywilltravel1"}, {"Content": "GENIAL APPARTEMENT   showReview(22964915, 'full');", "Date": "Dec 23, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR781813739", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "gabounou"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d1190537-r22597586-Feel_Good_Ramblas_Apartments-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "HotelID": "1190537", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
