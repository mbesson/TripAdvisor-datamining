PROS: -Easy to find off of the Grande Raccorde Annualare (GRA) ring highway -There's a bus stop just outside the gates of the hotel that connects with the Metro line to access downtown Rome -Free parking -Decent breakfast, though sometimes not well restocked CONS: -On the far east side of Rome...roughly 30 minutes away from the Termini Metro stop -WiFi access for 1 euro per hour, not a very strong signal -Beds are ridiculously hard, sheets were not changed during our entire stay -Shower had some mold along the bottom edge -The room was so hot! No ability to adjust room temperature...be prepared to roast! The desk staff was friendly and spoke English, which was helpful when asking directions. We thought the breakfast was decent, with cereals, yogurt, some meat and juices. There were several times that the milk for cereal was room temperature and the juice was frequently out. All in all, I thought it was an okay hotel. It suited our needs fairly well, although the hotel could definitely stand to upgrade the mattresses and pillows. I felt like I was sleeping on a box springs!", "Date": "March 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cAdequate but be prepared to commute!\u201d", "Author": "Travellingkatieg", "ReviewID": "UR122615713", "Content": "This hotel was good value for money, despite the residential, slightly worn down area, this hotel is nice and modern and set back off the main road. Very secure with a pass code gate at the entrance. The room did have a very noisy radiator so we did have to turn it off. The hotel also double booked us, so we had to spend our first night at the alba, then we're transferred on our second night, then transferred back on our third! Slightly annoying however the hotel were very apologetic and paid for our taxis to the knew hotel, which was very nice and at no cost to us! You must be prepared to commute to the city! However it is very easy and very cheap and the hotel gave us a map and directions. Overall can't complain as the price is low! Wouldn't probably stay here again, as it's just a bit toot far out for me, but would still recommend for a cheap break.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Constanta, Romania", "Title": "\u201cnice hotel\u201d", "Author": "any-nadine", "ReviewID": "UR118840756", "Content": "We have just came back from a 3 days city break spent in Rome. Alba Hotel was really nice for the money paid ; it's true that's a little bit far from the city center, but at about 50 m from the hotel you find the bus station. Take bus 558 1 stop to Ciamarra Rizzieri, than bus 20 or 511 3 stops to the stop Anagnina and from here you have direct metro line till Vaticano or Termini, so is not so complicated as it seems. The location is very quiet, rooms are very, very big and clean. They have big bathrooms, towels are changed dialy, safe box in room, LCD TV(not so big). The only real problem are the very thin walls which provide very bad phonic isolation. Breakfast is tipical italian, with some cheese, ham, panini, cakes, cereals, milk, tea, coffee, really good to start the day. All in all was a good experience which I recommend to other peole visiting Rome.

The place was a danger zone: sockets hanging off walls, lights not working, etc. Being a Gas and Electrical engineer, if this was Britain I could have issued a notice to shut them down! The Breakfast was a total insult. On informing the gardener, come janitor, come receptionist that we were leaving, he informed us that, despite paying for 4 nights and only staying one, we would have to pay the city tax for the 4 nights. We refused and he threatened us with the police, which we gladly welcomed. He then changed his mind and told us to clear off. Very professional! As we were leaving, another couple were checking out and they told us that they had spent two nights, having booked for the week but that they couldn't suffer any more. I would like to point out that we maintained our dignity at all times (we are English after all ;) ) unlike this hyperventillating marrionette that fronted the desk.

But, after passing through the security gate and entering the hotels reception area, we were both very pleasantly surprised. The check in process was fairly quick and simple enough, with the staff being polite and very helpful. We took our luggage into the lift, and went up to our room on the first floor. We were immediately blown away by the size of the room! (After being in a cramped Parisian hotel room for a week, the new found space was luxury!) The room was well equipped and exactly as described. WiFi was 2 euros per hour (if I remember rightly) and prices for drinks from the mini bar were very reasonable. The breakfast was a basic, continental style ( bread, cheeses, yoghurt, cereals and coffee) but in plentiful supply. On occasion, we would hear some noise from other guests in the morning, but otherwise, the hotel was quiet. The rooms were kept clean and the bedding was changed every other day. As for location and getting into the city? The shop-come-bar-come-pizzeria over the road sells the 'metrebus' tickets for 1 euro each, and the bus stop is right outside the hotel. The bus goes through the urban area and stops at the metro station Subaugusta, which is on the main A line, that runs to Termini and sights such as the colosseum and through to the vatican city. All in all, getting the bus to the metro station and then getting the metro into the city takes less than an hour. It may be a bit too far out for some people, but for sightseeing on a budget it worked for me! And as value for money goes, I think that Alba Hotel takes the cake and it worked with my tiny budget perfectly! I would definitely return, despite the short commute.", "Date": "October 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Holland", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value for a Trip to Rome but be Prepared for Commute\u201d", "Author": "CityBreakCouple_9", "ReviewID": "UR78116082", "Content": "My partner had business in the area so he asked me to find a hotel on the eastern side of the city, I read so many terrible reviews of hotels in this area (which is a bit dodgy to be honest!) but the ones for Alba Hotel werent too bad so we went for it. The best thing about the hotel is the value for money that it offers, the reception and breakfast staff were also very good and friendly. All other factors were distinctly average but its important to say that the room was kept very clean.
