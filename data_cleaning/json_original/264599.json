To get to the room you had to descend a steep staircase, but it wasn't an issue for me. Wifi was included, but it was slow at times. Staff was very helpful and helped me plan some of my time. They sell tickets to the Van Gogh Museum, and it is highly recommended to purchase tickets for any of the museums to avoid the lines. They will also print out tix for you for the other museums.

The hotel is not very clean, hair on the sheets, dust on the surfaces, during the 4 days I was there they didnt change my sheets, when usualy you expect new sheets every 2 days (and I did ask them to do so on the 3rd day, but they didnt). The single rooms do not have bathroom, you have to share toilet and shower with other 2 rooms, which is very inconvenient, especially because they dont clean it every day, it seems that they only take the trash out, and thats it. There was a dirty towel from other guest that stayed on the floor of the shower for at least 2 days. Also no amenities, no soap, shampoo, etc. You dont even get a bath mat and the floor on the shower area is always very wet. Also staff is not friendly. Different from other small hotels I stayed during my trip, it seems they do not love what they do, but they do it only for the money. When you check in, the first thing they say is \" you have to pay for your stay in advance and there is a 20 euros deposit for the room key\" in instead of \"how was your trip?\" or something like that.. Also on my last night I asked for a plate with something to eat in the morning, since I was going to leave early and the breakfast starts only at 8:15 (breakfast is included). The lady at the front desk said \"ok, but you will have to wait until the end of my shift\" which was at 23:00, because thats when she was going to set up breakfast for the next morning. The thing is I had to wake up at 5:00, so I wanted to sleep early, I dont really get why she couldnt do it before, as she was not busy and it would take her 2 min to put some bread, cheese and ham on a plate. So I waited, and as if it was not enough, she didnt want to give me the kettle to boil water for coffe only because it was too hard to find, she didnt want to look for it.

Oh well, actually any touristic spot that was on my \"must-see\" list was in walking distance. Only took the tram once when it was raining really heavy. The hotel is cozy and clean. I heard from my friends who previously traveled to Amsterdam that budget hotels aren't too good there. But La Boheme exceeded my expectations. The room was big enough and it had all the essential. What I liked was kind of an \"anteroom\" - when you open the door with the key, you aren't immediately in the room itself. There's some space where you can leave coats, shoes, umbrellas (it was great to have that in humid January weather!) Then there's a second door that takes you to the room. I think it was also helpful to prevent any noise to be heard from the stairs. Kudos to the friendly hotel staff (including Mimi the cat!) When we arrived, we had a small problem with the shower. Even though it was Christmas eve, the hotel manager did everything she could to fix that asap. What else did I not cover yet... Oh yeah, breakfast was nice.

(I bought a replacement.) The breakfasts were superb (although I think I needed the stairs to work off the damage done by warm, fluffy croissants first thing in the morning.) Talking of warm and fluffy, I should also mention Mimi. Mimi, I'm sure, owns the hotel - everybody else is merely her staff. She's a very affectionate tabby cat and I must confess was the unique selling point that convinced me to stay here. No problems with the room either (room 12, third floor, fifty stairs.) The wardrobe built-in between the front door and the bedroom door, opposite the bathroom, is an ingenious way of maximising a small space.

However, hotels in Amsterdam are expensive, and La Boheme offers a lot of value and convenience at an affordable cost. You couldn't ask for a better location. It's right in the heart of the action, seconds away from the Leidseplein and minutes from Spuistraat, but the hotel off to the side a little, so it's quiet around the hotel. The stop for the airport bus is around the corner. The hotel offers a tasty organic breakfast every morning until 11 am, including cereals, hard boiled eggs, yogurt, breads, local cheeses and freshly brewed coffee. The staff is definitely helpful and informative, although we didn't find them as outgoing and friendly as other reviewers. We really appreciated the hotel's eco-conscious efforts, including the use of green energy and an internal recycling program. We stayed in a room on the top floor. No one's kidding about the hike up the narrow, twisty stairs to get to the rooms. We were tired on our arrival and after hauling our bags up to the room, we set out to explore the city. Unfortunately, we kept forgetting things we wanted to bring along, so we had to trek back up and down a couple of times. That was a good way to work off the Gouda we consumed. The room itself was airy, although it didn't have much storage space for luggage and clothes. The furnishings and decor were a touch drab. There was a small TV and a working phone. The bathroom was surprisingly large (almost half the size of the room), but the shower was tiny and the water pressure was inconsistent. One evening it suddenly spurted mid-shower and flooded the bathroom floor. One of us has visited Amsterdam several times in the past, including some business trips, and compared the hotel favorably to other hotels and B&B's in Amsterdam.

If you are interested in a weekend of sex, drugs and rock and roll I would say this hotel is not for you - they have a strict no smoking (cigarettes I think) and no drugs policy. I would say if this is what you're after then stay closer to the red light district. This policy suited us perfectly though. The pubs and clubs around the hotel are really cool- they are open late and have a lot of Dutch people in which gives you a bit more of an authentic experience and means prices of local drinks/beer are good value. We went to Melkweg nightclub and it was great, I'd recommend going and it is literally round the corner. I didn't notice any pub noise to be honest, just a bit of tram noise in the morning but it wasn't noisy at all especially for somewhere so central.

I'd emailed ahead that we were a 'mature' couple so a room on a lower floor would be appreciated, and we got a prompt reply back saying it was no problem, and the staff would help us getting the cases up the very steep stairs. The Hotel is very near to a main bus route from the airport - 197 I think, and as it only costs 4 Euros it's a lot cheaper than a Taxi. It takes about 30 minutes on the bus, and we used this route again at the end of our Cruise so we could get back into Amsterdam for some sightseeing, as our flight back to Manchester was quite late in the afternoon. The hotel's location is absolutely ideal, being in Leidseplien which has lots of bars, cafe's and shops. Everything of interest to us was within walking distance, and the Hotel has discounted tickets for the museums which allowed you to walk in without queueing, which I would highly reccomend. Both the Reiks Museum and the Van Goch Museum are within easy walking distance, as are canal boat tours and the Vondel Park. Bearing in mind the two star rating, the hotel was quite compact, however the staff went out of thier way to be helpful and informative. The room was quite small but had an en-suite (small) bathroom that was absolutely spotless with fresh towels each day. The beds were very comfortable but there is no air conditioning so we slept with the large window slightly ajar as it was extremely warm. Our room overlooked the front of the hotel, and the street outside was quite lively with passing pedestrians, but it was a Friday night so not unexpected. Breakfast was excellent buffet style so you could eat as much as you wanted. As we weren't due to board the ship till 1p.m., we left out luggage in reception for collection later. They gave us a security ticket to ensure no one else could take them, which I thought was a nice idea.

One thing I especially liked was that upon check-in Majel said \"no surprises\" in regards to pricing, and she was exactly right. Yes, the stairs are steep, that's common in Amsterdam - get over it. The location is especially great for Van Gogh, Reiks, and Vondelpark, that said; I walked the entire city (in flipflops) from this location without any problems. Though for older folks it might present a bit of a trek. My room was great for the price and the staff couldn't have been more helpful and polite. The only downsides (for me) would be distance from the RLD, and that the map at the desk was a bit odd in the sense that true North was askew, and the street names were slightly difficult to decipher.

The location is easy to get to from the station by tram (too far to walk) and perfect for visiting the major museums. Let's face it, hotels in Amsterdam are expensive and booked out way in advance (as we discovered some time back), so we had to pay a lot more for our accommodation here than in other large cities. La Boheme was perfectly acceptable but felt a bit like being in school camp when it came to the room and the facilities. We had to pay for the whole stay on arrival, before even seeing the room, and were then asked for a 20 euro key deposit (in cash). Hair dryers were given out on request by reception but had to be returned once you had finished with them. The beds were a bit saggy and had seen better days, same for the towels which were a bit ragged, and the decor was basic. The tiny old TV was missing its antenna so the reception was lousy.

Breakfast is very good. The hotel is clean, well-equipped and secure. It has a friendly vibe that's reminiscent of the best youth hostels out there. (Tiny) weak points: Despite the fact that we live in Europe and we're used to non-air-conditioned spaces, we found this hotel to be quite warm. We stayed in the uppermost room, and it was pretty hot for June, to be fair, but it was definitely uncomfortable. For non-summer months, obviously this isn't an issue, but if you're traveling in the summer, you might want to keep this in mind. Wifi access up there was spotty, too. The rooms are small - I'm a small person, and still found it pretty tight. Many people have mentioned the stairs. Considering the dimensions of a typical house in Amsterdam, I didn't find them to be *that* unusual, but if you're new to the city, you should be aware that they are quite steep. If you have mobility issues, or are a big person, you may want to book a room close to the ground floor. Overall, I recommend La Boheme.

Bike and pedalo (pedal boat) hire are just round the corner as is the Volkspark a beautiful place to spend an afternoon. There is also numerous bars/clubs/restaurants near by but not so close that you can hear them at night. There is a tram stop down the road to get you to the central station or further afield.The hotel offers a tasty breakfast, a bar and fresh towels/ bed linen daily.

It was very easy to catch trams and buses from this area, though it is quite a bit of getting used to when crossing the roads! I had stayed at Hotel Acro on a previous trip and expected that the rooms would be small and the stairs steep; this was certainly the case! The only issue we had with the room was that it was difficult to ventilate it when someone took a shower. Also, our room faced out the back of the hotel and there was some noise and cigarette smoke from the little shop below us. There are no screens in the windows, so you have to have them open to get any air in the room. The hotel staff (and the cat) were very friendly and helpful. :) The front desk even printed a train ticket for me free of charge. The free wifi was very reliable. The breakfast was pretty typical for Amsterdam and a little boring after a few days, but good to get you going. If you have to be somewhere early (before they start serving), be sure that you've picked up something the night before or have time to stop off at one of the bakeries for a sugary pastry, because nothing opens until around 9 or 10, not even McDonald's. This was my Dad's first overseas trip for pleasure and he was able to adjust to the different style of accommodation quite well, though I don't know that he'd volunteer to do it again! The steep, curvy stairs were tough for his knees (we asked for the lowest possible floor when we booked and this request was granted - the first floor is only single rooms with shared bathrooms).

But we were warmly welcomed by the staff who were extremely friendly and more than willing to offer advice about tours/, transport and sights. This made all the difference. Our room was okay but the carpet could have done with a good clean. The place was surprising quiet given its location, but one night i found it difficult to sleep with the wafts of smoke coming from a smoker in the room opposite (which gently wafted under our door towards me!) Breakfast was good, and there was no presssure to be out at the allocated time of 11am.

Amsterdam is a very expensive place to stay so we considered the rate at La Boheme of 100Euro/night including breakfast to be a decent deal. The hotel has a great location right near Leidsplein - it is very central and every major sight in Amsterdam is no more than a 25m walk and there is a tram system too. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The actual room (we had a twin room) was small and very basic, but clean and adequate. The bathroom is very small, but having a proper shower stall made it fine for us. It is important to note (and this was mentioned in many of the prior reviews) that the hotel has NO ELEVATOR and VERY STEEP AND NARROW STAIRS. Anyone planning to stay here needs to pack light and be able to haul their luggage up the stairs. This is NOT the place for the elderly or heavy travellers.

The location near Leidsplein was excellent, the bathroom clean with a nice hot shower and a cozy reception area to start the day with a breakfast of toast, cheese, deli meats, eggs, juice and tea.
