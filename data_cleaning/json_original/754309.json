That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the in-a-nutshell-summary for Pera Art Suites in Instanbul near Galata Tower. The place is a bit difficult to find when you first go there as most maps locate the address wrongly. Once you arrive, the team will be very friendly and helpful. However, when you are in need of some services, it will get difficult. The location is just perfect to explore Galata/Pera but also the metro and trams are just a few minutes away. I recommend this area over the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcold town\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 where you can just go for your sightseeing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Galata is the place to go out, have dinner and drinks. Rooms are relatively large and include a kitchenette but without any pots or pans, so you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use it. Breakfast is served in the rooms (upon your call in the morning) and is a sad plate of assorted bites. Furniture and bathroom are all modern and great. The lower the floor, the less light or let alone view you will get (as usual, but here this is even more true). Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect any service at Pera Suites. I had booked an (overpriced) transfer to the airport which was not there on time. They had required me to pay that in Euro but could not provide change in Euro (bills) so I refused \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just as they had refused to change back some of my remaining Turkish Lira in Euros. When I cancelled the cab based on all the inappropriate conditions, they starting yelling at me so I left (and would not go back).", "Date": "November 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cPera Suites a good idea, but a bit noisy\u201d", "Author": "SamWoodward", "ReviewID": "UR87217702", "Content": "Our Old Town hotel was not memorable, so I won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mention it.

The price was reasonable and the location excellent with restaurants, bars and clubs and small shops close by (Pera Suites are a block from the famous Pera Palace Hotel if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking on a map). The area is lively at night and even though the windows are double-paned, there is a hole in each for ventilation, so every word (and shout and late night song) rings clear. It helped to block the vent hole with pillows and to run the air con for white noise. The other challenge at Pera Suites is language (if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t speak Turkish). The staff are very friendly and want to be helpful, but they have limited English and aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t able to assist with directions or information or recommendations. But they try their best! We recommend the place, especially if you are noise-tolerant (or are usually out making noise).", "Date": "November 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mexico", "Title": "\u201cGood ratio confort/price\u201d", "Author": "Sergio19", "ReviewID": "UR82489368", "Content": "One blok far from Istiklal street.

It was like staying in someone's gorgeous one-bedroom apartment in a fun neighborhood of Istanbul. We seemed to get much better rates than others did (half the 310 that I'm seeing posted) -- not sure why our rate was so cheap. I usually don't spend much time in the hotel because I want to be out sightseeing, but this time I was happy to spend hours just relaxing in our suite. Most tourists would probably be happier staying in the Sultanahmet area, near all the tourist attractions, but we really liked being in an area with good restaurants (Soflaki 9, Galata House) and more of a nightlife. Walking to Sultanahmet took about half an hour, but we really like walking; for others, this might be exhausting. There also seems to be a lot of construction going on in the area, which was quite noisy.
