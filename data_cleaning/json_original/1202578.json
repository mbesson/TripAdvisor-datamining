The walls in the hostel are moldy, and the area which it is in is sketchy. The cost is extremely high for the quality you get. Be careful if you do want to live here, as the place has a tendency to add 103$ HKD if you bring in another person, though they will not give you another bed spot. They also like to give you the trashiest room possible, and will do anything to get people to stay in the room. There is no refunds. There are also many insects crawling on the walls and on the bed sheets. Definitely not a good place to stay, if not the worst. The pictures on the website is not what the rooms actually look like. This hostel is absolutely horrible and has completely ruined my stay in Hong Kong.", "Date": "August 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cAvoid\u201d", "Author": "Zeva2010", "ReviewID": "UR133594670", "Content": "We were looking for somewhere relatively cheap and central during a short stay here and to be honest, we wished we just paid more for somewhere more comfortable. Budgets were tight because of our other trips. But upon looking on trip advisor, the ratings for the Sky Dragon looked positive. Although, the reviews told us not to expect it to be stunning or whatever. The place is easy enough to find, but with about 4 exits at Jordan mtr station, it can get tricky. It is near a bakery called Bread Talk - which is literally next door to it when you come downstairs from the building where the hotel is. If I could give this review 1/2 a star or none, I would've have. How it got the star rating it has is beyond me. I did contact folks who gave reviews on the Sky Dragon before booking. I got one reply. I asked about the bathroom - whether it was shared or if it was en-suite so to speak. I just got a reply saying bathrooms were in each room. The photos looked alright so we weren't expecting anything like the places we stayed at the week previous, but we did expect it to be clean. The hotel is on the 7th floor in the building and we were greeted by the owners, who we think also live there. You have to give them 100 hkd deposit for the room keys, which is refundable upon check out. We made our way to the room and we were immediately greeted by a deep stench of mold. The room was absolutely tiny. Then we saw the bathroom - just a plastic sheet to give you privacy and a shower head was coming out of the walls. So where you go to the loo is where you shower too. No wonder they didn't have photos of the bathroom on the website. We wouldn't have booked the place otherwise. The photos of the rooms looked alright on the website, but in reality, it was small, and the bedding was dirty. Stained. Showering in the situation we were in was not convenient either, you had no space to move about and it was all very odd. Although, I am told this is quite the norm. It is all down to preference I guess. In some countries you have toilets which are holes in the the ground of the proper cistern. Again, if we show photos of the bathroom, we would have chosen somewhere else to stay. What's more I got tick/bed bug bites from my short stay here. Absolutely disgusting! We ended up checking out early. I sought medical help and the doctor confirmed it was tick bites and I had a pretty bad allergic reaction to the bites. For the amount of money spent on medication and seeing the doctor in HK, we could've stayed at the other place I had in mind! This was the first time staying in a hotel whilst in HK and it was terrible, it ruined the rest of the trip. If you don't mind sharing your bed with ticks and bed bugs this is somewhere to consider. I cringe when admitting that I have stayed here, but thought it was important to share my experience so people can make an informed decision!", "Date": "July 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cAffordable and safe place\u201d", "Author": "lovetravel1627", "ReviewID": "UR125794829", "Content": "Me and my husband with our baby stayed for 3 nights.
