Located in the nice Prenzlauer Berg district with a lot of small shops, cafes and restaurants in the neighbourhood. Kastanienalle is just around the corner, and you can easily reach different parts of the city by u-bahn or trams. The ubahnhof (metrostation) Eberzwalderstrasse is at your front door (line U2, which takes you to Aleanderplatx in three stops and goes through the city to Potzdamer Platz and Zoologisher Garten), and so are three different trams stops (M1 to Hackesher Markt and the Museum Island, M10 to East Side Gallery, 12 to Nordbahnhof and Museum Island). An area you should not miss is the Helmholzplatz very close by. Just pass a couple of quiet streets, and you come to a square with a lot of really nice bars and restaurants - some of the nicest we saw in all of Berlin, actually. Another good thing in the neighbourhood is the market on Kollwitzplatz on Saturdays (also a nice area with cafes) and the flee market in the Mauerpark on Sundays. The hotel itself was a bit disappointing compared to the pictures on the website - it is a bit run down. The reception is a little room on the front street, and you walk into the backyard for the rooms. There is no bar or lobby area. The good thing is the size of the rooms (although smaller than it looks on the website) and the balcony outside your room which faces a quiet Berlin backyard (especially if you travel with children and want somewhere to sit down after they go to bed) The hotel breakfast is very expensive for Berlin (11 euro). In all the nearby cafes you can get a really nice breakfast for half the price. Berlin is famous for its breakfasts (which often are served until 5pm because you can also have them as lunch). A good tip is to book a stay without breakfast, because then you can go and get a new experience every day! A good alternative if you want to stay in this area is the more homely hotel Freiraum (corner cafe with rooms to let) in a quiet street nearby, very close to Helmholzplatz.", "Date": "October 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Athens, Greece", "Title": "\u201cPERFECT LOCATION-AVERAGE HOTEL\u201d", "Author": "XRISTINA77", "ReviewID": "UR118442210", "Content": "I stayed in this hotel for 8 nights this September. The hotel is in Prenzlauerberg , the hottest spot of Berlin these days. It is also just opposite a metro station (u-bahn). For sure the location is excellent since the neighbourhood is truly vivid, with restaurants, bars, cafes, and people in the streets until early in the morning. Also in the area there is a perfect connection with metro, trams and busses. As far as the hotel itself is concerned, I must admit that it is an average 3 star hotel. The hotel has renovated bathrooms and big rooms. Also it is daily cleaned. Still I have to say that our sheets were not changed not even once during the whole week we stayed. Also the room is covered with a carpet which is dusty and smells. Not to mention the out dated furniture and posters of the room. Overall if you can book it for 80 Euros per night, then is a fair deal. If it costs more you can find better hotel room in an other area. Still if you are determined to stay in Prenzlauer then is your only choice as the rest of the hotels in the area are hostels or 2 star hotels.", "Date": "September 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampere, Finland", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location, but it's missing proper locks and a fridge\u201d", "Author": "PyynikinParoni", "ReviewID": "UR115222794", "Content": "Me and my spouse absolutely love Prenzlauer berg as a neighborhood and this was the first time we stayed there. Zarenhof is a nice place to stay. Not your typical hotel, our room was within a normal apartment house! So there were locals who actually lived in the building that said hi to us in the hallway. Kind of nice, but then again not what you would expect... Breakfast was excellent with warm croissants, nice sausages and a very nice home made cereal (looked like a classy dessert, then again tasted that way also). Room and bathroom were nice, but no air condition. Also the lock were killing me. You had to try to find the correct way to turn key and you had to turn around and round many times to lock it or unlock it. A small matter but I found it quite frustrating! Plus there were two of those, our room lock and a lock on the door to the hallway. Also would have really enjoyed a fridge for some cold drinks! Wireless internet was free of charge but it wasn't very reliable. Service was friendly and the Eberswalder strasse U-bahn is just in front of the hotel.

They set me up for one night at Hotel Apartmenthaus Zarenhof in the Prenzlauer Berg district. I liked the hotel and district so much that I stayed for 7 nights. It really made my stay in Berlin memorable. My large room was on the top floor, serviced by an elevator, and had been recently renovated. It was perfect in every way, especially for the price. The wifi signal was free, strong and secure. The U-Bahn station is directly outside the hotel so the entire city is easy to access. The staff was friendly and went the extra mile to make my time in Berlin enjoyable--I really used their expertise. I can't say enough about their impact on my stay, especially Manuel Sanchez, who showed me how to use the public transportation and was available for all of my questions. Breakfast has good choices and with the nice weather I sat out in the courtyard amongst the flowers and greenery. There was even a harp player on the weekends. The whole atmosphere was peaceful and pleasant. The Hotel Zarehnof is a charming oasis within a lively, energetic area of the city.

The hotel was great. Reception very friendly. As the entrance to the apartments is separate from reception, we didn't talk to the staff very much, but they were very helpful on checkin and I'm sure would have been great if we had needed them. The room was large, new, very clean and warm (!!) with a kitchenette that we only used for cups of tea, a couch, large flat screen TV (only German channels), free wireless internet and a very satisfactory bathroom. We were very comfortable there. The buffet breakfast was great with a selection of hot items as well as the typical German breakfast foods. It was set up in an attractive room and the food and drinks were good. One of the best things about the hotel was its location less than a minute's walk from the Eberwalderstr. underground station - so convenient. Lots of good and reasonably-priced restaurants in the area. We really liked the Indian restaurant just a couple of doors away.

There is no internet computer in the lobby and no sports facilities (though a small gym seems to be under construction). They don't offer dinner though the breakfast is a good spread of continental hot and cold dishes including some quite exotic things like blinis, smoked salmon and delicious cakes. Locally there are lots of restaurants for dinner - and indeed breakfast if you forego the hotel's 11 euro offer. The location is good, very close to Eberswalderstr. on the U2 line which takes you through the eastern and (eventually!) the western centres directly. It is also on the tram. 5 mins' taxi from Alexanderplatz. The apartments occupy the rear courtyard of a massive twin-courtyard complex from the late 19th century so don't have road noise. The small lobby is on the street so is easy to find. Staff were very helpful in the instance when my door electronic card stopped working (twice...). It is very new and the standard and cleanliness of decor is extremely high. We had a large twin / triple (the sofa doubles as a bed and is not badly sized) which was about 300 sq ft in total. The beds are comfortable but in twin configuration are very narrow - definitely under 3 feet wide. A shame since the room is definitely big enough to take a larger pair of beds. A small and functional kitchenette (2 hobs, sink, fridge, crockery, cutlery) is provided but we didn't use it. Also a 26\" approx. LCD TV with about 40 channels.
