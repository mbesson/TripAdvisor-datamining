The room was spacious with 2 queen beds and all the usual room items (small fridge, hot water pot, iron, hair dryer ect.). Good cleaning and helpful professional staff all the way around. The breakfast buffet was very nice with a wide variety of Asian, western and European selections. Lunch buffet I was not as impressed (We'd just arrived and too tired to go out) and had the Easter dinner buffet which was fab. Again, staff were helpful, prompt and professional. There is a lovely small outside pool. Great after a hot sweaty day sightseeing to cool off. It was plenty big for the kids to romp and play getting some energy out. There are lounge chairs for mom. There are a variety of resturants near by, and you can get most places in a reasonable time by taxi. There is a mall a few blocks away, short walk, with a food court and a Kenny Rogers resturant. You don't go to Singapore for fast food, but sometimes with kids you do what is easy! We did the double decker hop on hop off tour bus. It was a lot of fun, cooler temp on the top, a/c inside, and great way to see the whole city. It was interesting for the kids too. Over all we had a very nice stay and would recommend to anyone.

Buses are working superbly, were never crowded and they are many enough not to have long waiting times. There are a bunch of bus station around this hotel. Bus can also be used to get you to the bus station. From a cheap transfer from and to airport, you can take the mrt to Outram Park station (East-West Line) and there you can find a taxi station. Taxi to hotel will charge you under 5 SGD due to the short distance. This hotel looks impressive, especially in the lobby, which is wide, with wonderful flower and with 6 exterior elevators.

In-room dining staff are very courteous, and the food selection is great although a bit on the pricey side. We weren't able to try out the hotel amenities as we were usually outside most of the time to enjoy the New Year atmosphere of Singapore.

The nearest SMRT station is Outram Park, but you still need a cab ride to go to the hotel (around 1.5km).

The outlook of the hotel doesn't look that old but overall atmosphere of the hotel looks a bit old fashioned (Bed, Bathroom, Carpet, Lobby). Breakfast buffer was not bad and room kept alway clean. You can use internet (wifi) but it costs some money. Service level in the front was so so. Although Singapore is a quite small country and you can go anywhere with a short ride of taxi or MRT, this hotel is a bit away from City centre or any tourist attractions. There is nothing to have fun nearby hotel - Only one night club across the street for the local. I tried to walk to the nearest MRT station and it took about 20minutes on foot. So, if you want to move around then just take a taxi. The location was the most disappointed factor for me.", "Date": "January 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Delhi, India", "Title": "\u201c2nd Home Singapore\u201d", "Author": "Foxysardar", "ReviewID": "UR123906173", "Content": "I believe this is hotel is an interesting choice as the location is quite decent and rooms are fairly spacioud .I have stayed here 3 times now and I am priority club member.Checking and Checkout are fairly quick and they allowed me to check in at around 11:30 AM as i am priority Gold member.

Couples on a budget might want to take note of this. -Architecture is beautiful, especially on the inside. Everything's circular and the lifts are fascinating. Very futuristic and yet not cold. I loved staying in the lobby and just staring up at the ceiling, or watching the lifts move! -Very friendly staff -Free shuttle to go to an MRT station or to Orchard road -There were dancers for Chinese New Year and everyone got chocolate coins. Fun! -All cab drivers seem to know where it is Cons: -No shuttle to and from the airport -Not located close to any train station. The closest is Otram Park which is still a good 15-20 minutes away if you walk, and it's easy to get lost -No free internet in your room. This is probably the biggest con for me since I regularly check my e-mail for work. There's a business center in the lobby but there are only two computers. You have to pay to connect to their wireless internet from your room, which costs a whopping 25 dollars per day. This is 2012; the fact that they still charge for that service is blasphemy, especially for such an expensive hotel! -Their hotel room key cards are faulty and lose their properties easily.

For us the real attraction of the place is the friendly and helpful staff. Despite it being about 6 months since our last stay various members of staff remembered us and were again incredibly welcoming and friendly. This makes it feel like a home from home rather than somewhere you are just staying for the night which is not something you get in a lot of hotels of a similar size in my experience.

We also stayed at the hotel at the conclusion of our cruise. The Holiday Inn was cheaper and more accommodating than the other hotels we were considering with three of us, two adults and one child, staying in one room. Service was outstanding from start to finish. We reserved a room with a king sized bed and were not charged for a rollaway bed for our son. Hotel staff were exceptionally polite, prompt, and courteous. Our room was fully stocked with amenities such as coffee maker, blow dryer, mini-bar, slippers, even toothbrushes and toothpaste. The bed was very comfortable and the room was so quiet that sleep came very easily. Our room had a high definition flat screen television, closet-safe, complimentary bottled water, and a very nice view of the city. I\u2019ve stayed at a lot of Holiday Inns and I have to say this was probably the nicest one yet. We ordered room service twice and received our meals in about fifteen minutes. The food was very good but fairly expensive. On the other hand we found that food prices were more expensive all over the city, not just in the hotel. The 6th floor of the hotel has a lovely pool deck and fitness room. The pool was clean and refreshing. The terrace is decorated with palms, bougainvillea, and tropical plants and there are lounge chairs and umbrellas as well as a children\u2019s wading pool. Adjoining the hotel is shopping center where you can get a cheap massage or pedicure, buy beer and snacks, and pick up last minute souvenirs. There are no wi-fi hotspots in the hotel, but they do offer free internet access on two computers in the business center next to the reception desk as well as complimentary newspapers. In the morning they also set out free juice and pastry in the lobby in case you feel like skipping the $30 breakfast buffet. The hotel is short walking distance to the Singapore River and Clarke Quay, but you can also easily take a taxi from the hotel. Fare to the airport is about twenty five Sing dollars and to Chinatown about ten Sing dollars. We discovered that it is very hard to catch a taxi from Little India, or between the hours of nine and eleven at night. It\u2019s a good idea to figure out where you are going to catch a return cab back to the hotel before you go out at night or you may find yourself walking many blocks until you can flag one down. The Holiday Inn has a very good buffet but it is pretty expensive. If you can get a deal where it is included with your room you\u2019ll come out ahead. If not, there are many good restaurants on the Singapore River . For the most part the Holiday Inn Atrium is an excellent hotel providing quality lodging and first rate service. We saw a few minor areas where maintenance was needed, but nothing negative enough to give us a bad impression. For the rates we paid it was a very nice hotel and we will definitely be back.", "Date": "January 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Western Australia", "Title": "\u201cWouldn't change a thing!\u201d", "Author": "Steph055", "ReviewID": "UR123002738", "Content": "We have just returned after spending 11 days in Singapore with 7 close friends and we all enjoyed every minute!

This hotel, is a bit out in one direction, between downtown Harbor area and places farther out like Chinatown, which was about a 10 minute or less taxi ride. I would stay there again, depending on the rate. One last thing. The main concierge was the best we ever had. The most friendly and helpful. I wish I could remember his name!

Its a hotel right? Its suppose to make an impression when you enter. Likewise, its public facilities are suppose to be up to scratch. That's what your paying for-right? And the more you pay, the more you expect- simple economics. The Atrium Holiday Inn Singapore, has a very nice lobby. It has acceptable public spaces. It has a nice pool and gym area- it even serves a reasonable breakfast, brought to your table by attentive, smiling employees. I spent 3-nighs at the hotel on business recently and its the room quality that is beginning to lack at this property. This hotel isn't new if you compare it to the monoliths of glass and concrete that dot the surrounding Singapore sky. I had a room on the 24th floor that was in painful need of a face-lift. Now I know that all 'parents' think their children are perfect and beautiful. Unblemished by circumstance. However, as we all know that isn't always correct. Note to 'hotel management 'parents' - as with children- hotel rooms can also let you down. Stepping into the room, I was transported back in time (and not in a good way). Not for me did the room evoke monumental moments in history or romantic nostalgia. No, hotel management have decided that the 1970's is \"where its still at.\" This in itself is a very curious historical anomaly by hotel management. Given that there is no concept in the, City-State of Singapore of modernity whatsoever! Why choose the '70's? Nothing happened in the 1970's, except the invention of sueded and flairs. While on TV we had to endure the, \"Brady Bunch\". I hardly think these achievement warrant an entire hotel complex in South East Asia dedicated in their collective honour? But back to the time machine. The room to put it simple was brown. Brown carpet, with heavy old brown furniture and fittings. The bed was a granite-block camouflaged with a white sheet. So don't go bouncing on it unexpectedly (you've been warned). The bathroom is, even by the most charitable definition- tired and in real need of a make over. A shower curtain drapes supine over an old bath. I had great difficulty accessing the internet in my room ( which is free) but perhaps that was more the result of my own inane I.T. skills than anything the hotel did. If you love food then you will love Singapore! The only meal I ate in the hotel was breakfast- which was very good. The hotel is only a 10-15min walk from China town or any other of a myriad of food locations, where they always serve it, fresh, frequent, and fiery. Singaporeans' are extremely affable, and will engage with you, if you make a bit of an effort and push a little outside your comfort zone. The bill for my stay was I think around 800 ( Singapore dollars). As somebody else was picking up the tab, I didn't pay too much attention. I did however look up for a moment as I was signing my departure documents. Just in that flash, that moment, I was sure I saw Greg and Marsha walking through the lobby.", "Date": "November 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Almaty", "Title": "\u201cThe best service for best price.\u201d", "Author": "Yonex99", "ReviewID": "UR121175348", "Content": "I spent couple of month to find good hotel in Singapore with applicable price.

I ended up staying only one night and left! The service is truly appalling. It is possibly one of my worse hotel experiences. Upon check in, I was greeted by door staff who opened my cab door. Wonderful? Then he simply turned around and left, and I was left alone to open the cab trunk and took out my own luggage! So I took my luggage into the hotel and checked in. Check-in was smooth, but the reception staff did not know how to process a credit card payment (this was really puzzling to me). It took a manager to figure it out. No problem: simply a 2-minute delay. Perhaps the staff was new to the job. I passed my luggage to one of the staff and was told that it will be well taken care of, so I was off to my room. I went straight to my room. It was old and badly needed renovation. But everything was clean though. I went to the gym for a short workout. When I got back 30 minutes later, my luggage still did not arrive! So I called reception, and finally it came. Then, I wanted to send some shirts for dry cleaning. A laundry staff came to pick up my shirts. But he did not speak English!!! So I told him to wait at the door while I call up housekeeping to clarify. Guess what? While I was on the phone, the laundry staff simply walked into my room and helped himself to the laundry bag from my luggage!! No privacy respected whatsoever: He simply walked in and helped himself to my belongings without permission! I was left speechless... Next, I tried to connect to the hotel's internet service. There was some confusion about the pricing plan, because when I connected, it did not specify in advance about how much I had to pay. So, I called reception. Reception did not know how to deal with the question and transferred me to concierge. Concierge put me on hold for 5 minutes, and then back to reception. After 10 minutes, I finally got to speak to someone again, and was told that she would get back to me. And nobody got back to me for one hour!!! So I called back, and the same person picked up the phone. She apologized and asked to put me on hold (again). But she actually hung up the phone on me! Okay, fine. Maybe it was an honest mistake. So I called back again. She did not even apologize for hanging up the phone on me. At this point, I was getting a little annoyed. Especially since the internet issue was still unresolved after over an hour. Finally, a manager called me back (this is 1.5 hours after my first phone call) and said I should be aware that as long as I am connected to the hotel's internet, I will have to pay for it. This is regardless of me not even given any notice about charge rates, internet plans or anything like that! It was beyond belief how the staff has handled the matter. At this point, I had more than enough. I decided to cut my stay short. So I called up reception to let them know I'm checking out the next morning. I did not even bother to complain about the poor service standards, but simply said I decided to move out the next day. Staff then said okay. 10 minutes later, staff called back and said I would now have to pay a higher room rate because I got a discount rate from my long stay (8 days). I said, okay, but how much more. He quoted me something that was like 60% higher than the rate I booked for. So I said, please let me speak to the manager. Staff said, sorry, the manager is not around. He would have to get the manager to call me back. After 5 minutes, manager did call me back. And I basically told him about my unpleasant experience so far and asked if he could do anything to give me a more reasonable room rate for one day. I also said I was going to move to the other Holiday Inn hotel (which I did). He said there is nothing he can do, even if I move to another Holiday Inn, because they are completely different entities. Then, he hung up the phone on me (again!!!). This was getting on my nerves. By the time I called back (this time, manager did apologize for hanging up). He eventually offered a room rate which was still 30% higher. I was simply too tired to argue with him anymore. I had checked in for a few hours and basically I had not a single good experience. I was going to be late for my meeting. I just wanted to get out of that hotel. The only positive note is actually breakfast next morning. The waitering staff was prompt and efficient. But it was too little too late.

The room was good with the size of 30 m2 but the layout is a bit uncomfortable for me. When u open the door the first thing you see is the bed. Meaning that any noise you make it can be easily heard from outside. Still prefer the small walkway with the bathroom on your right before reaching you reach your bed in all other hotels i stayed. The king bed in the room is the super king type so it's good enough for up to three adults. The mini fridge is packed with drinks meaning that u won't be having much space to put other stuffs you've bought unless u took them all out. Supplies of towels and toiletries are inconsistent. The first day, there was three bath towels in the room but only two in the second day. There's only one dental kit on the first day but they stocked it two the next day. U have to call the housekeeping for your shaver. One gentle reminder is that you make sure to have the \"do not disturb\" sign on as they don't have \"please clean up the room\" sign. The housekeeping guy will knock on your door around 9 am in the morning. He knocked twice as I was a little bit late to open the door and somehow i had a feeling that he might open the door if i don't open the door. Made enquiry to the hotel lobby and they said it was their standard practice to knock on the guest's room. However, the attitude from the receptionist wasn't great and it seems that it was my responsibility as a customer to inform the housekeeping not to disturb me in the morning. About the location, it does not sit above any mrt station but there are bus stations around the hotel. They do provide shuttle bus from the hotel to orchard road/clarke quay daily as well as to financial center on weekdays. The last bus from orchard is around 830pm. Do check local transportation website or google maps for the bus numbers serving from the hotel to your point of interest. It's not that hard to get a bus or even a taxi. Although the stay does not come with breakfast but i managed to look at the restaurant on my way down on the lift. It doesn't seems to have a lot of people eating there and they don't seems to have a wide variety of selection. Not much food around the area unless u walk 5-10 mins to nearby area to have your breakfast.

I was very apprehensive at first about staying in a \"hotel chain\" after a few bad experience but Holiday Inn changed my mind. Just a few months before, we were in Singapore and we booked into a one of those modern boutique hotels near Clarke Quay. Thinking that we were getting good value and great service seeing that it was a small, we were so wrong. On our return to Singapore, i looked around online for another hotel to stay and read reviews on Tripadvisor and this is where i found Holiday Inn Atrium. Two things that caught my attention was that guests said that the beds were big (king size) and that there was free shuttle to the city. Seeing that the hotel rates were reasonable, we booked one room for 2 nights. We arrived from an early morning flight and took the train from the airport to Outram Park (this is the nearest station from the hotel but not walking distances). From there it was a short taxi ride to the hotel. Befitting their name, there was indeed a beautiful atrium within the hotel itself when you enter. Check-in at the front desk was fast and efficient. As we entered our room, we were pleased about the room size and the layout. The bed size was indeed large and was comfortable (yes, they have a pillow menu but ones we already had were good). We had a good and pleasant two nights of sleep especially after all the sightseeing/shopping we did all day. There was also a flat screen TV with good amount of channels, tea and coffee making facilities, a safe and bathroom amenities. I think what made our stay enjoyable was the high level of service from all the staff. The overall staff of the hotel was great while their concierge was very friendly and attentive. Not forgetting is the housekeeping staff which must deserve a mention as one of the nights we spilled some tea on the duvet and within minutes of calling, one of their housekeepers promptly came and change the sheets all in a matter of minutes. He even offered us an extra blanket and said that he will leave it in the room if we need it just in case. Other than that, do make use of their free shuttle and grab a copy of the daily schedule from concierge. We sat on a few rides to and fro Orchard Road in a comfortable tour bus like shuttle which is parked at the side entrance of the hotel. Do remember that you will need to call front desk or concierge to book you seats earlier. Also, taxis are easily available outside the hotel lobby itself where the doormen will hail one for you. If you are looking for a place nearby to eat or hangout, we were recommended by the hotel to visit Great World City Mall which is just a 10 minute walk but we still took a taxi anyway. It was a good mall with plenty of eating options and shops to browse. Overall, Holiday Inn Atrium was a great value for our money.

For one, the location is not perfect. It's far from an MRT station, you pretty much have to rely on a cab to go anywhere. The rooms have a bad choice of dark brown carpet, maybe to cover up any stains. The walls/ceiling between rooms/floors are paper thin. When someone in another room uses the bathroom, it's like they're in the same room as you. I was lucky, the 1st 2 nights were not too bad, other than the occasional bathroom noise. But the 3rd night, the room above me made an almighty noise at 2:30 am. Can't believe someone can be so inconsiderate. I suppose it reflects what kind of guests stay at this hotel, since anyone should know you shouldn't be making so much noise early in the morning. The cheap rates (S150 on weekends) makes staying at this hotel one of the attractions. I like to have as many choices of hotels in Singapore, so I can add this hotel to it.

It was! I booked a room on the executive floor, which included free snacks, wifi and free drinks from 7pm in the executive lounge on the top floor with a great view of the city. On arrival a very charming and most efficient young lady checked us in and informed us we had been upgraded to a one bedroom suite. The room was huge, with its own separate large size bedroom. There were 2 bathrooms and the most excellent views of Singapore city from the windows. The hotel itself is large but still feels \u201ccosy\u201d. The staff could not have been any more helpful or efficient; they were to a woman and man just perfect. On the day of our Anniversary, there was a knock at the door of our room. It was the same lovely lady that checked us in but this time holding a very large well presented basket flower arrangement comprising of Roses and Orchids with the compliments of the hotel on the occasion of our anniversary. This was way beyond normal good service. Cleanliness in the hotel was always good, the rooms were left spotless every day. I am a smoker but always book a non-smoking room because I don\u2019t like stale smoke smells. If I want to smoke there is a perfectly good smoking area just outside the hotel front doors with a long bench and ashtrays. Inside the hotel lobby, restaurants, public and private rooms I never once encountered any odours connected with smoking. The food we ate at the hotel was always good quality and plentiful, we loved the buffet breakfast. The pool although small was perfectly adequate in size and was a wonderful way of relaxing after a long hot day of sightseeing. Snacks and drinks could be ordered by the pool and again here the staff were very pleasant and attentive. Although we did not use it, there is a free shuttle to take guests to the local transportation hubs, but a few minutes of walking takes one there anyway. This hotel is not a \u201ccheap\u201d hotel but it is far less expensive than most hotels in Singapore of a similar or in most cases lower standard. We are at present in Bangkok working voluntarily at an orphanage and have rented a small apartment for our extended stay. We are trying to keep our costs down here in Bangkok, (although we did splurge a little bit on the Chatrium Suites in Bangkok for our first 8 nights, which compares very favourably to the Holiday Inn Atrium in terms of quality and service.,) because we loved the Holiday Inn so much that we are planning to return for the final 5 days of our SE Asia trip at the beginning of April before flying back to the UK, if there is enough cash left in the bank!!!! I would recommend the Holiday Inn Atrium to any visitor to Singapore and am sure they will be treated as honoured guests and made to feel extremely welcome. Thank you to all the staff from the managers to the cleaners, the receptionists, waiters, chefs, bell boys and all who make the Holiday Inn Atrium a very pleasant place to stay.

There was nothing overly bad with the hotel, just a few little bits and pieces: - The staff are relatively cold - few smiles, few words during check-in/check out, and otherwise seem to be absent.

The first two rooms we were shown were very dated and smelt very damp. My partner has asthma therefore not ideal. We finally accepted the third room - however as were getting to bed the AC broke (!) so we had to move to another room at about midnight. Again the room we were moved smelt very damp and dusty (staff agreed it smelt) but we were so tired we accepted it on the condition that we would be moved the next day. Anyway, come the next day the room we were told we would get had been allocated to someone else so again we were given a old, musty room. At this point we were really annoyed and spoke to the manager - who then upgraded us to a suite. The suite was fine however we didn't want the upgrade - we just wanted a clean standart holiday inn room! It seems the higher up the floors you go the better the rooms are. My advice - aim for floor 18 and above. I have to say though that the staff were pleasant and helpful during the who process. In terms of location - its about a 20 min walk to Outram Park station - and from there it is a few stops to Orchard road etc. Beware of the surcharges applied by the cab drivers - we were told it was 35% but the cab driver had picked it up by 50%!

Its next to some luxury car dealerships which can make for some interesting window shopping if you are into that sort of thing. What we liked best were the laundry facilities where you don\u2019t pay per item but rather per load [self-service]. So its S$1 for the washer, $1 for the dryer, $1 for the detergent for a total of S$3 for over a dozen items which can\u2019t be beat at most 4 or 5 * hotels in the city. You\u2019ll need to get coins from the lobby/front desk since the common laundry room is on the 3rd floor at the same level as the gym & pool. It would be nicer if we could either use our room keycards to pay for the laundry or have a change machine near the laundry room itself. The basement has a bunch of little shops that offer all kinds of reflexology treatments that avg out to around S$0.50/min compared to $1/min elsewhere in the city [e.g., orchard road]. You can also get prepaid SIM cards in the basement which is useful for foreign guests. The lobby looks fantastic in the photos [read as 5 * level] but is a bit grungy in reality [4 * quality] with none of the \u2019gloss or sheen\u2019 in the images. So don\u2019t be mislead by how nice the lobby looks! Many rooms do NOT include the buffet breakfast which we totally misunderstood at check-in. The person at the front desk mumbled something like \u2019you are welcome to the daily breakfast till 10am\u2019. When I clarified if it \u2019came with the room\u2019, they confirmed. We should have rechecked since we assumed he meant it was included in the cost. Only at check-out we got a shock at being billed for the breakfast which we would run for @ 9.55am since we were still a bit jet lagged. Had we known it was additional, we could have calmly slept in and gone for a nice meal nearby instead. It was S$20 [approx Rs. 680] per person + taxes in 2008 but you should expect over $25pp++ by the time you visit. The glass elevators are a good test for your vertigo!

Breakfast is very nice and I have to say one of the better ones for a Holiday Inn that I have experienced (and I do stay 40-50 nights/year with ichotel group). The only downside for breakfast is if you arrive after 0900 you will have to wait for a while before getting seated as they run out of seats very quickly. The room service menu is good and price worthy. The hotel staff are very service minded and will go out of their way to assist you. The hotel is within walking distance from China town and also Clark Quay and if you follow the river towards Clark Quay you will pass several wonderful restaurants and bars. Personally I prefer taking a taxi rather than the metro and in Singapore taxis are very cheap. Regardless if you want to go to Orchard Road, Sentosa, Marina Bay you are not looking at paying more than around 5-8 dollars from the hotel. There are always taxis waiting outside the hotel and if not the hotel wil quickly call them for you. Taxi to the airport is around 20-25 dollars and the ride takes about 20-30 minutes depending on traffic.

Lovely food courts and a delicious meal only costs 5 SGD per person. Also, opposite the hotel is a small malay/ indian restaurant.

The Hotel also has its shuttle service but the frequency is quite less and atleast for us, it didn't helped at all. The rooms are quite large and escalators are eye catching.

The pool (no overcharge) was very clean and a nice retreat after a day in the city. The price we paid was very good for Singapore, around 170 SGD. The only downside was, as other fellow travellers reported, the location a little bit off the center. But it's about a 15-20 min. walk to orchard road, which by my standard is fine.

The pros first: the hotel is well-located in terms of proximity to bus stops, train station (Outram Park MRT) and the happening hangouts like Orchard Road and Clarke Quay. The staff are helpful and help out on queries on getting around in the city and special requests like early check-in. The place is efficient enough without dazzling you in any way. The gym and pool are small but serviceable - we found it empty on most days that we went there. The cons now - The first impression of the exterior and lobby of the hotel is dull and dowdy, the place doesnt have a vibrant feel to it. The rooms are pretty basic for the SG$160 per night price tag, the bathroom is smallish. The TV lacks hugely in terms of channels -so many local language channels that I ended up watching the Singapore tourism Channel whenever I was in the room. The breakfast menu is the SAME everyday, which can get monotonous if you are a leisure traveller and not a one-night business traveller. The hotel has only 1 restaurant in addition to the Coffee Shop, so your options for room service are limited. The one time we ordered room service, we got the order an hour late after 2 reminders and food was nothing to write home about. Overall, I think the Holiday Inn has a great brand recall and dependable customer base in the face of rising competition but needs to pull up its socks to keep the momentum going.

The room was smaller than I expected -- actually, I don't think you could swing a cat in it -- but this is Southeast Asia after all. The bathroom was a typical sink-tub combo. The ceiling leaked thanks to a bad seal on the tub above. Every couple of hours a waterfall would pour through the ceiling and onto the floor. I kept a ready supply of towels handy for the purpose. The furnishings were a bit dated, but I didn't spend that much time in the room, thanks to the long cab drive to the airport for the show. After sweating it out on the tarmac all day, a bed is a bed, and a shower is a shower. Breakfast was great at the restaurant downstairs. It was a European - Asian mix buffet. Unfortunately, I was given the \"3rd Degree\" every morning by the staff. I hadn't paid for breakfast when I checked in, so I had the usual Singaporean inquisition: \"Did you pay?!\" \"What is your room number?\" \"Are you a guest?\" \"We have to confirm you are a guest here!\" Etc...Etc...Etc.

Additional snacks were provided during the coffee breaks we had and the little goodies were quite innovative snacks. The buffet lunch at the 'Melting Pot' was large with a wide range of choice to suit all palates - Indian, Chinese, Japanese & Continental. The bar downstairs was a good place to relax and unwind in the evenings. The little shops in the lobby provided the necessities and the best part was one could enjoy a good 'massage' to take away the tiredness after a long day if required.

The only drawback was that internet was not provided free of cost even though the hotel charge was quite steep; close to 300 Sing $ a day.

I went to sleep and awoke the next morning totally congested with itchy eyes. Apparently I was allergic to the smell. The next day I explained the situation to the front desk, asking we could change rooms. One of the staff accompanied me to my room to check it out. She sniffed around, and quickly explained that this was a room fragrance that the hotel staff routinely sprays after cleaning. She offered to have someone from housekeeping open the locked window, and that she would instruct the staff not to spray the fragrance.

We did not use any of the breakfast facilities but opted instead taking a 5 minute walk down the road to catch breakfast at a foodhall at Great World City. As you can see on the maps this hotel is not located in the heart of everything but remember its only a short taxi ride away from all that Singapore has to offer. The only thing that slightly bugged me was the refundable $100.00 deposit they take out of your credit card which after currency conversion fees and fluctuations in currencies means you are actually charged for the privellage of letting them keep $100.00 of your money over night.

Quite enjoyable with family (including young child). We booked through priceline and bf was not included - big problem as we soon realized. This hotel is located away from the center of the city and there are not many eating places nearby. However, there is a small Indian restaurant just opposite where you get tasty ethnic food all through. Another option is to walk to the Great World City mall, around 10 min walking distance. We started doing this from the second day onwards because eating at the hotel's pricey restaurants all days is just that - pricey! The Chinese restaurant at the hotel is pretty good. Rooms were very nice - well done and very clean. I would definitely recommend the Chinese restaurant at the Four Season's Hotel which was outstanding! The hotel has its own free tansportation but one has to catch the bus at specific times only to go to Orchard road. It is a nice place to walk around with children (but so is the rest of Singapore). Since the hotel is a bit far from the city center, we had to catch taxis (not always easy to do so as we found out especially in peak times) or walk to the Outram park station, around 15 min away - nice walk but problem is that in Singapore, it suddenly rains and you need to duck for cover - so, not totally convenient! In future, I would probably look for a place nearer or in and around Orchard road. Only negative point about this hotel is its odd location but probably that is why the price is a little less compared to the ones located near the city center!

We sat down on the beds and started to settle in for the night. My lordy I may aswell have asked to sleep out at the lobby on the concrete steps. This is not a joke. The beds were extremely hard with no spring in them at all. We then ordered room service as we could not be bothered going out to find something, we had just arrived. First time ordering we received 3 dish's. 2 out of the 3 were correct and the other we did not order (a vegetarian pizza that they thought we said vegetarian platter....huh it wasn't even on the menu). With me making a call we were bought the vegetarian pizza (puree tomato base and grilled cheese, took one bite and threw the rest out). Second time we ordered it was also wrong but rather than complain we just sucked it up and left it to the side. We also requested no one enter our room whilst we were out and could they please make our room the next day at approx 10:30am. We asked this as the wife was a little uneasy the first day. We put the \"do not disturb\" sign out and went out for the day. We got back and the room was the same. We then took the sign off, went out for half hour, got back and they had cleaned it when we specifically asked no one to enter until 10:30am the next morning, not happy. The windows are SCREWED shut and you have to get the assistant manager to arrange for them to be unscrewed and opened. Problem is trying to get a hold of someone who knows what's going on and signing some forms to get it done, A safety aspect that the hotel is good on but it's a bit annoying, especially when they ask for a reason to have them opened. AH it's a SMOKING room and the windows are screwed shut..... right. The \"RED EARTH\" hygeine products replaced in our room every day was nice. No ATM inside for money and we had to walk across the road in rain to get money, also another down side. I do recommend the BBQ Buffet, garlic prawns which were huge, crab, pork belly, steak with mushroom, etc, etc. All in all we arrived in Phuket stressed,sore from the beds and out of pocket for a dismal hotel.

The room / bathroom was very clean and again well stocked as regards soap, shampoo, towels, face cloths etc. The only dissapointment was that the shower was over the bath and not separate but hey...... Instant hot water every time, no waiting. Staff were very helpful at any time. We stayed for 18 days but only ate in the hotel six/seven times all but one was for breakfast which was Buffet style and very adaquate offering local dishes as well as full English for S$17.00 ( 3 $ to English Pound) We did dinner only once which was a meat and fish BBQ and a good selection of salads, pasta's, various veg and again local dishes. I think that was in the region of S$30.00. The bar on the gound floor was never packed or rowdy and there was live music every night..

This time I got the Holiday Inn. The location isn't as great as the hotels on Orchard (no walking distance to anywhere special), but it is a quick cabdrive to Clarke Quay and there are malls nearby. I didn't mind, as I was there only to work all week. The breakfast at the Melting Pot Cafe can be considered average - there is the full Western and Eastern selection, plenty of fruit, fresh coffee and cappucino (a plus). Lunch Buffet is tedious, because it is the same every day of the week - being there for a seminar a whole week, I had gotten the buffet booked too. After three days I started going to a food court nearby. The health club is very minimal, the pool is fine, clean, simple but in better shape than for example the Hilton on Orchard. Rooms are standard 4*, nothing special, bathrooms are a bit old, but clean and functional, minibar stocked with beer and soft drinks - fine for me. Staff are very friendly and helpful, from the reception to the room maids. There is a sleazy nightclub on 5th floor for the lonely business travelers, but a nice bar in the lobby with very attentive staff. Around 9is until midnight a trio plays awful music, and this is what really bothered me. Even after reaching my room on the 20th floor and closing the door, I could still hear the music loud and clear, as the rooms are all set up around an atrium. Calling the reception solved the problem, but I had to do it every night of the week, which was a real pain in the butt.

We grabbed some bargain airfares on Tiger Air out of Perth, so went for an extra long week-end (cheaper than flying East in Australia!) I booked a King Deluxe non-smoking room via the hotels web site, and asked for a roll out bed for our daughter. On arrival at 4am (we had paid for that night as didn't fancy sitting in the lobby at that time of the morning with no room available), we found there was no bed for our daughter made up in the room. Too tired to complain we thought we'd deal with it when we got up again later that day. To our surprise, our king bed was so big, we decided not to worry about the roll out bed as it would only clutter up the room. The bed was a little hard at first, but we all found it very comfortable once we got used to it. Plenty of pillows too as we found extra in the wardrobe. The room was pretty typical of Asia. Dark wood, and a little musty on the nose (soon got used to that too) Tea & coffee making facilities were available, and those little long life milks (we bought our own milk once out and about as the small ones were never enough). Fridge was empty, which was great as you can stack it with what ever you like. There was a list of mini bar drinks that are available if you wanted to buy it from the hotel. Also, complimentary bottled water was re-stocked each day. (Singapore tap water is safe to drink - we did and we're still alive!) There were bathrobes & slipper - if you're into that sort of thing. Ours didn't get used at all except for our daughter playing dress-ups. Bathroom was OK. It was clean and well stocked with nice toiletries. Shower in ours was over the bath. It had great water pressure and an adjustable shower head (eg: jet stream) View from our room was not towards the river. We looked over the Furama Hotel, some parkland and highrise housing. (We were on the 17th floor) Breakfast was served each morning, (between 6 and 10.30, I think) on the 4th floor. The choice was very good. The usual western foods like bacon, eggs, sausages, hash browns, tomatoes, etc... Plus a nice selection of local foods, eg: rice, curry, noodles, etc. There was also cereals, pastries, pancakes, a selection of breads, cheeses, cold meats, salads, fruit juices, yoghurts and more. We left there very well fed each morning. We only had to wait one morning for a table, and I think it was only for a few minutes. The hotel was full that week-end as there was some major Singapore horse race on. The pool was on the 6th floor, next to the gym. Pool area was relaxing after being out and about fighting the crowds. There were only about 10 or so sun beds, so if you timed it bad, you missed out. On saying that though, Singapore is not a place people go to lay by a pool, so it was never crowded. Most people would arrive, have a dip and leave. We didn't see any staff at the pool area, but I think there was a phone if you wanted to ring for food or drinks? We took our own drinks when we went for a swim, and saw other's doing it too. Whilst there it was my husbands birthday. After a long day out we arrived back to our room to a lovely surprise of a bottle of wine, chocolates and fruit. It was a very nice thought from the hotel. One night we got in late from a day out, and none of us could be bothered heading out again for dinner. We ordered room service. Prices were expensive compared to what we'd been spending on the streets. (Chicken curry & rice S$15 + + +) Food was tasty though. Location wise, we had no complaints at all. We've been to Singapore on a few occasions and stayed in various areas of the city. We walked along the River & Clarke Quay one day and ended up at Raffles Landing. It was a pleasant, if not warm wander. Like other people have mentioned, taxis are so cheap, it's better to just grab one so you get from A to B with out getting too hot & sticky. We used the MRT once. You pay a price for your ticket, and then when you arrive at your destination, you put your ticket back into the machine for a refund. Great idea as it saves on littering. Close to the hotel there is a petrol station where you can buy drinks and other supplies. Also, about 10 minutes walk up Zion Road; there is a Hawkers Centre (not sure if that's what the locals call them?) Where there's a great selection of local foods at fantastic prices. Most dishes were around the five dollar mark or cheaper. You can even get a large Tiger beer for S$5.00. Just opposite that is a Shopping Mall called Great World City. All in all, we found no fault at all with the hotel. Staff members were all very efficient and polite. We even requested a late check out with no problems at all. If you want a mid range hotel, and don\u2019t fancy paying top dollar, you can\u2019t go wrong with staying here.", "Date": "May 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Basel, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cImpressive atrium\u201d", "Author": "luke.traveller", "ReviewID": "UR7389129", "Content": "The atrium is absolutely stunning!

I found the service to be of a very high standard, such as concierge and restaurant staff, and the breakfasts were the best I've ever had, the variety of foods was amazing!!! The rooms were quite large, standard furnishings, but clean and very suitable. Most places were quite close by taxi from the hotel, but it is a bit of a walk to public transport if you prefer this option. It was very easy to organise tours and get tourist information from their tourist desk. Convenient that there is an Internet cafe and shop in the hotel lobby but these are a bit pricey. Overall I had a very enjoyable stay here, and would return.", "Date": "June 1, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bangalore, India", "Title": "\u201cSmall and standard\u201d", "Author": "Lallitha", "ReviewID": "UR5044299", "Content": "Here is the latest bit on the Holiday inn Atrium where we, my husband, our two year old son and me stayed from April 26-30, 2006. It was quite a comfortable stay for us. Having got a room on the 26th floor (of the 27 floors), the view was quite beautiful, especially when you open the curtains to see Singapore at night. The minute you give the hotel's address to the taxi drivers, you would be asked whether it is 'Old Glass hotel', or 'The concorde hotel' etc. That's because these were the old names of the current Atrium. The outside glass panels sporting a brown-black colour does look a little old, but the inside makes up for it with its beautiful trasparent lifts, which is even more beautiful in the night when it is fully lighted up. Although we had asked for a superior room with king sized bed, one was not available when we arrived at the hotel. But they made arrangements for us to get our preferred room soon and in the meantime accomodated us into another room. The room sizes are small and compact, even in the executive suites, where we stayed. The executive room comes with a mini bar/fridge, iron board and iron, and a safe. Service is quite quick and decent, whether it was food we ordered, or the bell service or when we wanted an international three pin plug, one was provided within 5 minutes, of course a fee of Sg $ 5 was charged. Daily housekeeping replenishes sheets, towels and tea and coffee for use. Morning breakfast was quite a standard affair, with a good mix of continental and Chinese. The shopping arcade on the ground floor takes care of all basic needs. If you want to try the reflexology foot massage that's available down in the shopping arcade, please take care to mention whether you would prefer hard or soft massage. (A note of caution: the hard masssage is quite painful, although in retrospect no visible damage is seen.:-)) All in all the hotel was a comfortable stay for us.
