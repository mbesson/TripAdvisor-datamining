That is until the food arrives. I had high expectations, but was beyond let down. I've eaten all around the world at a variety of fine dining establishments covering numerous cuisines. The College Hotel's offering was way below average; in fact it was inedible and awful in places. To start was a fish carpaccio that was so, so, so overseasoned I couldn't eat it. I like salted food, but this was like a condensed pretzel with a hint of tuna fish flavour. My words of complaint fell on deaf ears as the waiters didn't seem remotely bothered. The main course of duck was accompanied by tasty potatoes and cabbage (though, again, the vegetables were overseasoned)... but the meat was overcooked and, well, bland. The skin wasn't crispy, instead rubbery, and failed to deliver at any level. With hopes that desert could save proceedings I was taken to new lows. Presented with a cinnamon bread and butter pudding I have to say it was, without doubt, among the worst desserts I've ever tasted. It was worse than a microwave job from the supermarket - and that's no exaggeration. Far too much cinnamon was fierce on the palette, but ignoring this inbalance it was the horrid, flabby texture of the pudding itself that was just inedible. Overall I ate very little of this three course set. Most disappointing.

Indeed, a former school very nicely redecorated into a boutique hotel, even if a bit too dark to our taste. MAin drawback: the place is not run by professional hotel-staff!

Three girls, more busy to pick up the phone: \"how can I help you?\", then helping the clients standing right before them. Friendly, yes, but not at all useful. CHeck in took long, the rooms were not ready, the simple questions which metro to take, lead to confusion etc. Only after four (!) times asking, it turned out that indeed they do sell public transport cards. The rooms: yes, they have been designed nicely in boutique style, but they need to maintain them! Is it normal that lights don't work anymore, that a curtain is really half-torn down, that beds are hard as wood, and you hear a lot of street-noise? Breakfast was nice, but here again, an experienced hand who oversees it all was lacking: it is it too much to have to ask for sugar with your coffee?, for salt with your eggs? - which anyhow finally came when were basically finished. A mystery to us why breakfast should costs 24,50 EURO pp. for what is a very minimalist buffet, compared to any other place where we have been.

First impression on coming into the hotel was that the building has been refurbished very stylishly and with attention to detail however it seemed quite dark coming in off the street (a theme that will recur) and it took me a little while to work out where to go to find the reception area (there were no obvious signs). On approaching the reception the girl behind the desk seemed quite unsure of herself but was quickly joined by a more experienced colleague who guided her through the check-in process which was pretty painless. Wasn't asked any questions about room preferences or similar. The inexperienced receptionist then accompanied me to my room, offering to take my bag but I suspect she wouldn't have been able to carry it as it was a little heavy! My room was on the first floor and on leaving the lift I was told it was quite a long walk so was a bit surprised to find that the room was within about 10m of the lift! The hotel building design is lots of dark panels, exposed brickwork and discreet lighting (mostly uplighters). Nice effect but it does tend to make the place a bit dark even in the middle of the day. I caught my colleague later squinting at doors trying to read the room numbers to find his room such is the level of gloom! The room itself was nice, with large windows (although there was little light coming in as they had big heavy drapes and a blind lowered down over most of the window. Lighting in the room was again subtle and whilst creating a nice atmosphere for a romantic night in, I was here for business meetings and would really have preferred a nice desk with a lamp I could work by - instead I got a thin occasional table masquerading as a desk and a little table lamp in place of a desk lamp. The ultimate annoyance however was the wifi internet access - I had to ring down for a code which someone promptly brought to my room but try as I might I couldn't connect to the wifi network. When I called down to reception for help I was told I needed to turn off my firewall - something I wasn't able to do as my laptop is work-supplied and locked down tighter than a (fill in your own metaphor). When I pointed this out and also that I'd not had the same problem at any other hotel in the world I was told that it was a common problem and they couldn't do anything about it and I wouldn't be able to connect. I was later told that it is also impossible to connect a Mac to the wifi! Overall I liked the hotel and would consider it if I was on visiting with my wife for a weekend but for business trips, I'm heading back to the Pulitzer where you get the great character and working business facilities! The location is ok if you need to be in the South of Amsterdam (tram stop outside with 10 minute ride to WTC/Zuid station) and some nice restaurants towards the concert hall.

I had some last-minute misgivings about this hotel when I browsed some of the online reviews, but kept my fingers crossed that all would be OK for our stay if we were patient with the 'Fifteen' style social enterprise aspect. In the event, The College delivered exactly what I wanted. I specifically asked for room 123, as recommended by two reviewers, and was rewarded with the most impressive hotel room I've ever been lucky enough to stay in. This room, on the first floor, is at the end of a projecting wing and features monumental 19th century schoolroom windows on three sides (think London Queen Anne Revival from the 1880's). The split-level interior has been cleverly and sympathetically decorated in a black lacquer and taupe colour scheme that in this context looks much more 'aesthetic movement' than Kelly Hoppen. And the shower was huge and torrential. Brilliant. As some other bloggers have noted, the excellent interior design is occasionally let down by minor wear and tear, and the service is what you'd expect from teenagers; slightly hesitant and a bit gauche. Breakfast was expensive and the light switches in the room were just too clever to be usable. Don't let any of that put you off, though. In high summer, with the Centrum sweltering and full of gawping backpackers, The College is an air-conditioned oasis of style and poise. Located just beyond the tourist areas, but still around the corner from the boho Pijp district and the delights of Albert Cuyp Markt, it's a great base to explore contemporary Amsterdam.

BUT... you have to wait half an hour for that cocktail, the room might not be made up, someone might come into your room while you're sleeping to stock up the fridge and carry on doing so after seeing you (it happened to us!), you won't get the Mr and Mrs Smith Pastry Box if you booked with them, it might take a while to sort your bill... We went knowing all this because it's a school for those in hotel/tourism training - but it seems as if they haven't had any lessons yet! If you go with an open mind and can get over the service being patchy (some we had was excellent) - stay here. Amsterdam hotels are expensive even if you're in 2*/3* and I thought this was pretty good value at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac200 per night. Plus will you be lounging around the hotel all the time?

The hotel itself was fantastic very boutique and modern. I am in my 20's and with my boyfriend and it suited us perfectly. We booked last minute so were unsure as to whether we would get a decent room. We arrived at the hotel early but our room was ready which was great. The hotel has only 40 rooms spread between the first and second floor. We were on the second floor in room 210 which was around the side of the building. The room was fantastic. It had high ceilings with exposed wooden beams and a bath to die for.Every evening staff arrived at the room with a bottle of cold water and chocolates just what you need after a day of sightseeing. They service the room whenever you like and turn down the beds each evening. The only downside to the hotel is the road noise which is due to the original wooden windows. It is not a very busy road its probably just because i am a light sleeper. The oher down side is the room was quite dark there are only lamps to light the rooms and corridors with downlighters in the bathroom, this made it difficult to have a shower as you were practically in darkness. The location of the hotel was what i was most worried about, i thought it was going to be miles away from the centre. Its actually 5-8 minutes walk from the museum centre where the rembrant, van gough museums are. It is a 10 minute tram ride to Dam Square which is probably the furthest you need to go as everything else is inbetween. I would recommend Leisplein for a few drinks on a night, very safe and some good bars and restaurants. Trams run from directly outside of the hotel and you can get the 5 or 24 to central station and it stops at all of the main attractions on the way. We never waited more than 5 minutes for a tram to arrive which was great as you don't want to spend your break waiting for transport. Staff at the hotel were not brilliant but we expected that before we went, they are students after all. The ones on reception were great but the waiters and chefs at breakfast in the hotel were useless. One day our breakfast order was incorrect 3 times so we just gave up and ate what we were given. Toast was served 20 minutes after the scrambled egg so it was cold. It was little thing s like that which were annoying as it was nothing to do with there ability it was common sense. When we checked out of the hotel we asked to leave our bags as we wanted to go sightseeing this was done without issue. However when we went to settle our bill they tried to charge us 70 euro for room service which we had not had. This took a while to sort out but eventually they realsied that we were not going to pay. All in all a fantastic hotel but if you are expecting 5* service think again.

Readers should note that there is a large variety of rooms at this hotel. The photos may not represent the exact room you are assigned. We booked a \"deluxe\" room which was on the third (top) floor. Being so close to the roof meant our room was an unusal triangle shape with very little head room on one side. However the very high ceilings on the other side made it feel spacious. The only window was a skylight that was too high to see out of but did let in a lot of light (and fortunately had a good shade). The bathroom in our room did not have a shower, only a large bath tub with the handheld shower nozzle. The tub was great for baths (big enough for two) but if you at all taller than normal height you cannot stand up due to the sloping wall in the tub area. It certainly made for adventurous showers. And a word of caution, the bathroom door is a sliding pocket door that meets in the middle. When you pull it closed careful to not let it smash your fingers as happened the first time I tried it (thinking it would close to one side)! There were a few issues with the service but not as many as you might expect from a training hotel. The first was the awful service in the bar downstairs. Very slow to say the least, even when it was not that busy. The second issue was a problem with a dinner reservation not being properly made and therefore we were not able to eat where we hoped. They did make up for this with a nice complimentary bottle of wine though. And to their credit they did make an excellent recommadation for dinner on another night. For some people the hotel might be a little far from the city center but we did not find this the case. The public trams run right by the hotel and there are two lines that bring you straight past all the main tourist spots (all in a 10-15 minute ride).

I read other reviews on tripadvisor and thought it sounded unusual and worth a try, and I would recommend it definitely. I really hope the hotel works out some of it's \"kinks\" though, and I warn you - you may encounter some odd things. The hotel is walkable to vondelpark and museumplein, but not convenient to the red light district or the city centre - about a 40 minute walk or a tram ride. I personally thought the location was terrific, the city centre and red light areas are very very frantic, full of high tourists. This is a great escape from all that and all those tourists. Even if you are a high tourist, do you really want to be in that area all the time? I think the location is terrific, a good convenient area, but not too crazy. The room: the shower is European style, meaning handheld, which is unfortunate. The tub is very large, but the shower is handheld. The bed is very comfortable, probably one of the best I've slept in in Europe. The pillows are gigantic and comfy. Restaurant and bar were above average. Don't know what was up with the TV, but full blast I could barely hear it. I have to assume something was wrong with the one in my room, because it was basically inaudible at full volume. Now...our freaky problem...while we were there apparently rooms 115 and 117 had a phone switcheroo. When we checked out I mentioned we had some issues and the front desk showed me a note for the staff that the phone lines were swapped, so this is probably a freak issue that you won't have. But everything room 117 ordered came to us...a taxi order, a 5:30 wake up call, a bus order, a phone call, another taxi, a laundry pickup...about 7 different things. Be sure to specify your room number if you call the front desk!!! It was amusing but redundant when the person on the phone did not believe I was in room 115 instead of 117 over and over. Anyway, I would stay there again, the building itself is worth it. There're some kinks to work out, but the staff there is most friendly and they seem sincere in wanting you to enjoy your stay.

Both reception, housekeeping and the bar staff offered excellent service... with a smile! And it's worth mentioning that their English skills are absolutely flawless. On our last night, when we wanted to go out and have a real \"Amsterdam\" night out, the concierge was very helpful and discreet! Big thumbs up! The rooms were well-appointed, if not a little small - but we were booked into just a standard double room. The bed was SO comfortable, although the \"double bed\" was in fact two single beds pushed together which was in no way ideal! But the pillows were huge and fluffy and the sheets were crisp and clean, the beds were made every day and we were always left fresh water, biscuits and marzipan fruit. Every day without fail! The bathroom was absolutely spotless and clean, and the shower was amazing - a huge shower head with plently of hot water and the temperature was very easy to regulate. My only complaint would be the lighting - I found it difficult to find good make-up lighting! Just a word of warning for the girls. The lighting in the elevators was quite stark and I seriously considered doing my make-up in there! With regards to the location, yes it is a little out of the city, but it's only a ten minute walk to the Rijksmuseum and it's very close to excellent bars, restaurants and cafes. I actually enjoyed being outside of the city... downtown Amsterdam is full-on at the best of times! All in all, an excellent hotel! I would highly recommend it and would definitely stay there again, but I would probably book a larger room... myself and my travelling partner went a little stir-crazy at times but that was a great opportunity to go out and explore the city.

It is an odd mixture - many parts are good to very good, other aspects are curious. The building itself is a very smart conversion and the bedroom had many \"designer\" touches. We had room 211, in the attic, ostensibly a de luxe room. However the attic walls sloped inwards, the small windows were high on the walls and all we could see outside was the sky - even this view was limted as one window was largely obscured by the exposed beams which ran right down the middle of the window. The bathroom was again odd, very smart, gleaming chrome fitments, a very large and very deep bath, big enough for two - BUT no grabs rails, nothing to hold on to at all as you scarmbled over the high side. The shower was a hand held device a little like a hairbrush so you had to stand in the bath as no means of securing the shower head to anything, but no non slip surface to the bath and again - no grab rails. We thought the service charming - the receptionists and the waiting staff really sweet, ddesparately anxious to please but not absolutely confident about what they should do or say. We had dinner in the dining room on our first night - it took over 3 hours fo a 4 course meal. The student chefs had, I imagine, been set tasks in devising the menu - what about herring ice cream for a starter? Fortunately immediately across the road a good Bistro in La Falote (Roelof Hartstraat 26) which served excellent food, reasonabky quickly. At the end of a pleasant evening the chef entertained us on his accordion - well played. All in all I found this Hotel, despite its oddities, much better value than the Pulitzer where we stayed on our last visit to Amsterdam.", "Date": "May 2, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, UK", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Hotel with really friendly staff\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5026901", "Content": "This hotel is simply amazing.

This is the third time I have stayed in the hotel simply because of its sheer beauty as a boutique hotel. It is contemporary with a nod to the classical, very comfortable and incredibly relaxing. Just to give you an insight I have stayed in the Radisson, The American, NH City Amsterdam, Sofitel Demure Grand and The Pulitzer and can easily say The College Hotel is much more intimate, personalized and enjoyable than any of the above. The Location is great, close to great shops and good tram links right outside. If you like museums then they are just a short walk away but probably be better to get a map from the tourist info as the hotel only has really small ones with no road names on, what's that all about? When I arrived at the hotel (9am) understandably our room was not ready as check-in is 3pm, no worries we dumped the cases and wandered over to Cafe Luxemburg on Spui which does great breakfast overlooking a small square and great place to people watch! After some good shopping and lunch at Cafe PC (on PC Hoofstraat which is just fab but may need to book) we headed back to the Hotel for about 3.30pm. We got to reception and they advised our cases were already in the room so they led us to our room on the second floor (205). On entering it was like a shoebox, I explained to the girl who was pretty sullen and almost never smiled that I booked a room that was 33-39 sq metres she said that she would go back to reception and look into it. I booked this room directly with the hotel so not sure why they got it wrong but hey. After about 10 minutes still nothing so I went down to reception to find out what was going on. They apologised and said that they had put us in the wrong room and led us to a room I had booked. Back in the lift onto the 1st floor to a room that had twin beds, again not what I booked so back down to reception to see the Reception Manager. She then took us to a third room which hadn't even been cleaned, at this point we are at 4pm and not happy at all! We were finally taken to room 107 which was ready and had a double bed and was much bigger as booked, finally they brought our cases and we were able to settle in. Not the best way of dealing with it but she was the only manager in at the time. Be warned though not all rooms have a shower, they have a bath with a hand held shower attached to the tap, strange eh, and some rooms only have a shower cubicle. Down to the bar, the last time I went (6 months ago) the bar staff were useless you would wait about half an hour for a drink but this time they were much more slick, quick service, smiles and regularly changing nibbles! It is a great artmosphere in the bar with cool Fashionistas and most of the Dutch Glitterati. The staff lack finess with service though as one guy literally spilt candle wax all over his suit when changing the candles. The restaurant is however very different. Continental breakfast (\u00e2\u201a\u00ac17.00) is pretty dire with banana milkshakes in a thimble like glass, very thin pieces of apple in sherbet, some smoked salmon, tiny pastries and a very small selection of cerials, all looks pretty but only good if you have a very small apetite in a morning. We went for the cooked breakfast option at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac21.50 my partner had smoked salmon and scrambled egg, v nice apparently and came pretty quickly, I ordered blueberry pancakes with maple syrup which came 10 minutes after my partner had finished their breakfast! Apparently the chef had burnt 2 lots, worth waiting for? - not really, would always go out for breakfast in future, Cafe Luxemburg to the rescue! This was really the icing on the cake I asked to see the Hotel Manager who was apprently on the phone but would come out asap, so we waited in the lobby with the beautiful silk walls, comfy chairs and roaring fire which flickered in time with the array of scented candles as the chill out music was playing. The Hotel Manager arrives, very pleasant and at last A SMILE!! I explained the situation fully and straight away the breakfast was taken of our bill along with a discount to our room rate for both the nights due to the inconvenience. Result. Would I go back to the hotel? Yes I would, I can see that the bar has improved since last time so I am hoping that everything will follow suit now the new manager is from the Blakes Hotel Amsterdam. Just remember to book a good sized room, request a shower or bath whichever you prefer, dont take breakfast there and any problems make your feelings known because they definately listen to them.", "Date": "April 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "N Ireland", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4721720", "Content": "Hotel Location: Excellent... its near the posh shops and all the big Museums.

You arrive to find plenty of staff, but nobody knowing what they should be doing, no smiles have you had a good journey etc when you check in, then you are taken to your room, where you have to spend an hour trying to work out how the lights work. We had no remote control for the TV, and when we rang to reception they insisted that there was one in the room, after explaining yet again there was not one, the receptionist (who needed to go to charm school) said someone would come up with one, which took another phone call and finally arrived 15 mins later. Breakfast I would agree was a complete joke, it took 30 ins for our 'cooked' breakfast to arrive, ( the restaurant was very quiet too!) when it arrived it was cold and quite revolting, to be honest a motorway service station could do better, our tea and coffe were cold too, we had to ask 3 times for milk but they insisted on giving us cream. As with the rest of the whole hotel there were plenty of staff, all just standing around and not being helpful at all. Surley if it is a training hotel, somebody should be training them!!

I stayed there for a total of about 20 nights over the past year (work took me to Amsterdam frequently) and have grown to really really love the place. You can read the other reviews for all the positives: beautiful (albeit cozy) rooms and lovely public areas, excellent food at the restaurant, etc. I, however, would like to address three common concerns people have expressed in other reviews. First, the hotel's location. It's totally true that the hotel is not smack dab in Dam Square or the Leidseplein amongst all the tourist hubbub. In all honesty, unless you're 19 and in Amsterdam for the first time, the scene gets pretty old pretty quick. It's fun to visit the tourist areas and fun to hang out there, but it's also nice to get away from it after you're done enjoying yourself there -- maybe I'm just getting old. To be fair, the hotel is about a 5 minute walk from the Concertgebouw, 10 minute walk from the Van Gogh museum, 15 minute walk from the Rijksmuseum and a 20 minute walk from the Leidseplein. Wanna go closer to the center? Take the #5 tram which runs outside the hotel about every 10 minutes. Or take a cab -- you can go all the way to Centraal Station for about 15 euro. Or better yet, rent bikes. Amsterdam is a small city anyway (it's really just a big village) so getting anywhere is pretty fast and cheap. Second, the hotel's service. Okay. The hotel's service is definitely quirky. No question about it. The \"interns\" get a bit confused and flustered sometimes, and they will make a little mistake here and there, but overall it's just totally not a big deal. Another reviewer commented that it's even a bit endearing, which I agree with. Some things to consider, they're young, they're learning, and they're Dutch -- I'm not treading any new ground by noting that Nederlanders (Amsterdammers, in particular) are not exactly known for wildly competent or cheery customer service, that's just the way it is. It's not a bad or onerous thing, you just get used to it. I really can't complain about the service at the hotel. I think they double-charged me for a mini-bar Coke once. OH MY GOD!!! Third, to the people who are disappointed by the hotel's value for money...are you kidding? Seriously? You can generally get rates under 200 euro per night on their website (always go to their own website for the best deals). The rate sometimes even includes breakfast. For that price, this hotel is a real gem in Amsterdam. The only other hotel that's this unique and luxurious in the whole city (in my opinion) is the Dylan where rooms start around 450 euro per night. Wonderful place -- for more than double the price. The hotel offers some some very special touches, too...a selection of marzipan candies in your room on arrival...complementary bottled water in the room...luxury toiletries...a personalised note from the manager on arrival...the ubiquitous chocolate on the pillow during turndown...the list goes on. So to sum up...if you're a chill person looking for a fantastic, unique, luxurious boutique hotel in Amsterdam that represents excellent value for money and you can handle minor, inconsequential potential hiccups, the College Hotel is the hotel for you. Chill people will be blown away by this place, as I was and still am. (And no, they didn't pay me to write this review!
