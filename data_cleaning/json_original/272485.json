And while some things were great, other things not so much. Let me explain: Good: The staff at this hotel was excellent. I can't state this enough because if it weren't for them, this would have been a 1 or 2 star review. Christian, Andrea, and Anna all made the stay better than it would have been. They were helpful with local attractions, with the language and customs and Christian even had a pizza delivered to my room. Anna called several places for us over a period of what must have been several hours, way above and beyond the call of duty. Again, great staff! Okay: The locations is ... busy. Just below the bedroom window was a crowded street. Its kind of like getting a hotel room in a Mall. If this is your thing, then move this up to the good column. Personally, I didn't care for it. Although the windows were a nice noise supressor. As for the proximity to things, sure its close to the Spanish Steps and Trevi Fountain and maybe the Pantheon if you are up to it. But the big things (Colloseum, Vatican, Catacombs) you still need to drive and Del Corso is toward the north part of Rome so the drive will be a little longer. And the room was small but I am keeping this here because most rooms in Rome and Italy for that matter are. Bad: Ok, now for the bad stuff and it is really a shame because this could have been a great experience. The pillows were incredibly thin and uncomfortable. The fridge/cash bar was broken. There were no instructions for the safe. The shower was INCREDIBLY small. Now I am a big guy (6') so adjust for your height but I had difficulty bending over without either hitting my head on the wall or backing into the temperature handle. Scalding or freezing water to follow. This could have been remedied somewhat if they put in a $5 soap tray attached to something. The walls were paper thin and I woke up in the middle of the night to a neighbors snoring. No joke. There was what might have been either a dead bug or a feather on the panel above the bed. There were pubic hairs in the bidet when we checked in. Thankfully cleaned the next day. We were just outside the breakfast area which became very noisy in the morning. Keep this in mind. The included what looked like a 18-inch \"TV\" high up in the corner of the room. about the same size as the screen on my laptop. And finally, the thing that bothered me the most was the \"free internet\" that was on maybe 20% of the time and always dropped out at the worst times. So there is my experience in a nutshell. If hotel management addressed those problems, I might go back. If they let go of the people, I definitely won't.

The location of this hotel is fantastic and you are so central for all the attractions in Rome. We had a room at the front which overlooks one of the main shopping streets in Rome which was great for people watching at all hours of the day and night. The room was spacious and airy. Everything in it you need. The Hotel is really close to the Spanish steps if you fancy a wee hour sitting in the sun. Restaurants surround the hotel and there is lots and lots of choice, so your not wasting any time looking for somewhere to eat. The staff at the hotel were all lovely, all very friendly and professional. Were always happy to help. The girl in the breakfast room was especially nice, even when she was rushed off her feet. The breakfast in the morning was great and had lots of choice bacon, wee sausages, boiled eggs, croissants, rolls, fruit, cheese and cold ham - everything you could really ask for. Now, if you have been to Rome a few times and done most of the touristy parts and would like a chill i would strongly suggest that you take a few hours of your day to spend on the rooftop terrace. Why? There is a music school somewhere in the streets behind the hotel and every day you can hear the opera singers practising, trumpets, saxophones, pianos being played - it is one of the most wonderful entertaining things i have ever experienced whilst sitting in gorgeous surroundings. I hope you do choose this hotel if you are going to Rome it is definitely one of the BEST.", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leicestershire", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel, excellent location, great staff\u201d", "Author": "Peter K", "ReviewID": "UR127469833", "Content": "The hotel is in an excellent central location, on one of the main shopping streets, not far from the Spanish steps.

The roof top balcony was also beautiful and quiet, when we were the there the jasmin was in bloom and the smell was incredible. Right outside our hotel is a beautiful church where we went to mass on Sunday. The location is perfect for shopping, restaurants and centraly located for all the site seeing.

This was the fifth European hotel that we stayed at and it was horrible. I can honestly say that it is worse than staying at a motel in the US. But there were two things going for the hotel: the staff were extremely friendly and the location was perfect. The stay was so bad that we had a different room every night we stayed there. For the first night, we stayed in room 308. The room was so small that we didn't even have room to put down our luggage. The shower was so moldy that even the shower curtain was almost black. I started to have asthma attacks from the mold (which is why we asked for a new room). Also, it was as though the room was split into two with a door separating the two rooms. I know that there are hotel rooms that have a separating door but this was ridiculous....we would even hear our next door neighbors sneeze and cough as thought they were in the same exact room as us!!! Also, the window is a window to the hall so you cannot even open the drapes for some sunshine without having other guests walk right by your room. For the second night, we stayed in room 106. This room was a lot better than the previous room but the AC didn't work at first. We had privacy for once but the window situation was the same. Instead of a bath tub we had an extremely small shower stall but, at least, it was free of mold. Also, there was gum on the phone, our phone didn't work, and we actually had to ask for toilet paper as the housekeeper did not replenish our supply. We ended up leaving this room only because our AC did end up breaking and we sweated it out for early part of the night (it was ~34 degrees Celsius in Rome). For the third night, we stayed in room 302. Because it was in the middle of the night that we had to ask for the room, we ended up getting a small bed since the room was for 1 person. Believe it or not, this room was actually nicer than the first two. None of the rooms we stayed at looked anything like the pictures they had advertised. Neither my husband or I have ever stayed at any hotel that looked like this place. It was dark, dingy, dirty and musky-smelling. The hotel was so cheap that every single light only had 1 bulb instead of both bulbs in them....so our rooms always looked dim and dingy.

Yes the breakfast is basic consisting of cereal and lovely fresh pastries but what more do you want. I have to thank the desk staff who helped us out Sunday morning when our booked transport did not arrive, making 2 phone calls and then booking a taxi for us to the airport. If you are an early riser I would recommend going for an early morning walk. We forgot about the time change and consequently were ready an hour early.

I was initially very impressed with their courtesy and prompt replies to my emails. I informed them that we would not have a cell phone with us; however, we would contact them via a payphone if we were unable to find the driver at the airport. As it turned out, Rome was fogged in when we arrived, and would not allow planes to land for 2 hours, so we had to fly to Milan to refuel. which added another 80 minutes to the trip. When we arrived at the airport, the driver was nowhere to be found. My husband purchased a 20 Euro phone card and called the hotel. The receptionist said that the driver went to the airport, waited for a few minutes then left. He said he would send another driver. We waited over an hour...no one showed. We called the hotel again, were put on hold and were told the driver was on his way. The hotel had given us strict instructions not to talk to any of the drivers in the airport because they would rip us off, but we were at our wits end having waited for the hotel's driver for over 2 hours! Some of the drivers at the airport quoted us 90 Euro, since it was a holiday... I finally went to the airport's information desk. The attendant called the Hotel del Corso and was told that the driver was not coming! I called the Hotel del Corso once gain and the receptionist said, \"Just take a taxi!\" I said that the drivers were charging 90 Euros....then the 20 Euro phone card ran out! I have never been more aggravated in my entire life! After a heated discussion, we decided to attempt taking the subway to the hotel. On our way to the subway's escalator, we were stopped by a driver who said he would charge us 40 euro for a ride to the hotel...he claimed it would be cheaper than the subway.... We took him up on his offer...ended up saving 9 Euro off the Hotel del Corso's car service. I was fearful that there would be some sort of timeshare offer or other trap... since the Hotel del Corso had warned us that these drivers were all thieves... but totally gave up because I couldn't take any more. Thankfully, there was no trap. In a nutshell....it is inexcusable that a hotel in the \"elite\" part of town (del Corso) would abandon their clients. Since Rome is near water, it is safe to assume that it often is fogged in. Consequently, a hotel or car service should contact the airport to check on the conditions/flight time and not leave their clients stranded. Despite the transportation woes, the hotel itself is in a very convenient area. Other staff members we encountered were pleasant, and the email correspondence with the hotel was pleasant/efficient. The appearance of our room was true to the pictures on tripadvisor.com and other websites and was clean. It was certainly in a very convenient part of the city. If it weren't for our disasterous car accommodation incident and no apology from the receptionist once we arrived (nor were we informed about breakfast), I would have given the Hotel del Corso a decent review, since they are in an excellent area, the room was clean, but the walls were a bit banged up. We would consider staying there again, since the hotel is in such a convenient location, but would arrange for our own transport to the hotel through the airport shuttle service, which is cheaper and, in our case, more reliable.", "Date": "July 18, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Falkirk, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cSuper small hotel\u201d", "Author": "travelguru", "ReviewID": "UR3662643", "Content": "This lovely 3 star hotel is ideally located near the Spanish Steps and within walking distance of most of Rome's tourist attractions.

Just a note to look for 'air conditioning' and not 'temperature controlled' if you're sourcing hotel rooms. Temperature controlled usually means a fan.
