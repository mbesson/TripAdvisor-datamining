But, Adelante responded to my request immediately and provided a good rate for my entire 4-day stay. Location is great off Torstrasse in a lovely Mitte section. It's a quiet residential street/area, but 5-10 minute walk to the Hackescher Market area (fun shops and restaurants) and Friedrichstrasse (main subway connection I used). There's also markets around to stock up on water, etc. For this, I consider the hotel a somewhat \"hidden (no frills) gem.\" Rooms are large enough, and nice showers. Hotel overall is kept very clean. Quiet too, as I slept with windows open. Breakfast is a feast: eggs, sausage, smoked salmon, veggies, fruits, yoghurt, breads. there's a \"lounge\" in the basement that seemed nice - though, I never stopped in for a drink. Though Adelante advertises a \"4-star\" hotel - it's more of a 3 - 3.5 star. I give this rating because the internet didn't quite work/very slow connection in my room, and when I arrived, towels on the bathroom sink seemed damp. I was able to use a computer in the lobby, and they did call for a taxi (that accepts credit cards) on departure. Adelante seemed more accustomed to German business stays, rather than tourists as I sometimes had diifuculty communicating with the front desk about directions and services, etc. (I don't speak German.) Don't expect them to coordinate any tours for you - it's mainly a self-service. I've stayed in similar and nice 3-stars (no shame in that). For a short tourist stay (and if you're confident where your going) or business, Adelante is a good place.", "Date": "June 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Prague, Czech Republic", "Title": "\u201cVery nice and modern\u201d", "Author": "abbiati", "ReviewID": "UR91539462", "Content": "Very nice and modern hotel.

The hotel is in a newbuilt building so everything still has that newbuilt glossy shine and and the rooms have air conditioning, solid walls and sound proof windows which makes for a good nights sleep without being disturbed by heat, neighbors or traffic noise. The room was clean, spacious and had everything you\u00b4d expect in a good standard class hotel room (tv, minibar, Ipod dock, new furnishings, good beds and so on) and the bathroom was big and spotless. Breakfast was a great buffet with both cold continental and hot english on offer. The staff were really helpful.
