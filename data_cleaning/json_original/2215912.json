But we had trouble with the taxi driver not knowing where it is when we first came. But check in was fast, rooms is spacious - compared to Hongkong hotels with the $120 price tag. Beds are not 5 star, a bit hard but it's alright. A word of warning for family travelers, the bathroom and bedroom are separated by a hazy glass only - so you can almost see through (about 20% visibility). Breakfast is lousy though, I ended up skipping almost all of it.", "Date": "August 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Macau", "Title": "\u201cReasonably priced\u201d", "Author": "KanMacau", "ReviewID": "UR131514941", "Content": "Spent a saturday night in this hotel with my wife. It is in Causeway Bay and 8 minutes walk to Times Square, one of the landmarks in HK Island. Around there, you find lots of interest and good for shopping. There are numerous shops and big sales chains. There is also a underground station for MTR. The hotel also offers breakfast, lunch and dinner at relatively good price when compared to restaurants in this area. The room is not fancy but that is what I expect. Clean and the bed is very comfortable with free wifi in room. Location-wise, it is OK. In terms of room rate, it is reasonable when you are in Hong Kong!", "Date": "June 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tang Xia China", "Title": "\u201cPack your ear plugs.\u201d", "Author": "AdrianinChina", "ReviewID": "UR123085551", "Content": "This hotel is trying to be chic, but somewhat failing. Its a bit of a hike from the Causeway Metro station, (exit A). Check in was slow, but the two chaps did not really look like they knew what they were doing or looked as if they cared for that matter. Reception is small and dingy, due to the darkened glass, which makes everything look dull and uninviting. I booked this on Agoda, at short notice, and it was no surprise to pay over the top for a room at this late notice. The room rate was circa 140 pounds sterling (room only), which for the standard of this room was far too much. As I am a regular visitor to Hong Kong, I have stayed in bundles of different hotels and I know what is available else where and what is value and what is not. Inside the room, the flooring is wood, which unfortunately looks dirty and tired already. The bathroom was okay, again a modern effect which is not really working and the bed was very low, with very poor quality pillows. On my side of the bed, there was no bedside cabinet either? The room view was good, overlooking Happy Valley Race Course, but as we were on the 6th floor we were very close to the flyover a couple of floors below and the noise level was pretty intense, until we pooped in our ear plugs and all was well in the world. It will take you about 15 minutes to walk to Wan Chai.", "Date": "January 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore", "Title": "\u201cGood service, spacious, clean and good view\u201d", "Author": "Vuvie", "ReviewID": "UR122202831", "Content": "My room is the one facing the racecourse. Someone here states that the rooms on this side gets a lot of noise from highway but maybe I got so used to the hustle and bustle of Hong Kong by the time I checked in here, I didn't quite notice. I must admit, the outside and lobby is nothing much to look at so I was very apprehensive at first. The service is great. I had a massive headache in the middle of the night and called the front desk, before long, he came with the staff supply of paracetamol. Great service. The room is European standard: spacious, nice little kitchenette with microwave, kettle, etc. Fully equipped, I do really like it here. The staff don't speak much English though, so I guess that's why some of the reviews here are bad. I speak Cantonese and I find the staff very very helpful. The room is so big, you can sleep 4 people there. The only thing I didn't like was the bathroom. It is full glass walls with very little frosting. We travelled together with friends so the guys have to go out when the girls were showering.", "Date": "December 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cAWFUL place to stay in Causeway Bay\u201d", "Author": "babydarl", "ReviewID": "UR121808165", "Content": "Stayed here for four days. Room appeared to be modern, but awful experience for the following reason: 1.) Very unwelcoming fronk desk staffs - didn't bother to greet you when you arrive and continued on looking at their computers as though you don't exist, even though we were the only guests standing in front of them waiting to check in. Everytime you past the front door, they don't bother to say hi. 2.) Poor service - Asked for an adaptor when I checked in - waited two hours after having made two calls to front desk an hour apart. Eventually had to go downstairs myself to front desk to get an adaptor. Also needed remote control batteries, made a call to front desk. No delivery made still after 3 hours!! 3.) Woke up with at least 10 bug bites on both of my legs!!! Was itching each night I spent there. What made it even worse is that I notified the Manager who did not even bother to apologize or followup with me on the incident. No offer of any compensation - ruined my honeymoon!! 3.) Rooms are SMALL!! Good for only one person. 4.) Somewhat convenient to metro (few blocks) but very hard to find by Taxi. Don't bother staying here at all.", "Date": "December 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bergamo, Italy", "Title": "\u201cPoor value.
