In front of the bed there was a flatscreen TV. The room had carpet, I personally don't like carpet so I never walked barefoot in the room. From the room we had a view on a window of an office. You can not ask for a stunning view for this price! I was glad we didn't face a brick wall or alley with carbage cans. The marble bathroom is very big! There is a seperate shower and a bathtub. There were towels and slippers available for our use. Lots of boutique hotels are very noisy, this one was not! We slept on the third floor. There is an elevator to bring you to your floor. The hotel is located in a quiet street, although very central. We didn't have breakfast because there are numerous places in town to eat. Starbucks is around every corner. Around the corner, on one side is Grand Central Terminal. Go the other way and you will cross Bryant park and the library. Across the hotel you can take the subway. More subways stop at GCT, so thats a good option too. It takes a ten minute walk to get to Times Square. To get to the Brooklyn Bridge, Battery park, Ground zero, etc. you better take the subway. Overall I loved the hotel we stayed in because it was cheap, had a GREAT location and it was VERY clean, quiet and comfortable.", "Date": "August 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ocean View Nj", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Byant Park location\u201d", "Author": "Suesuesayshi", "ReviewID": "UR115914639", "Content": "This is a small,terrific hotel that has a terrific central locations.Rooms are comfortable, clean and a nice style..Would stay again.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "belfast", "Title": "\u201cNot what we expected but nice\u201d", "Author": "jonandsueBelfast", "ReviewID": "UR115798005", "Content": "We booked this Hotel as they say they are on 5th Ave, they are not, they are on the next Ave, ok no biggy but if your a tourist you expect to stay where it is advertised.

And we had an incredible time there! As far the hotel is concerned I have to say that compared to other more expensive hotels it was worth it, its a crystal clear value for money option for those who wish to have a safe, comfortable stay in a great location and not spend a fortune. For me, when I travel to places were I just spent the night in the room cause all the other hours of the day I am out, I need a good hotel just like this. Things to help you: its 1 min. away from grand central station (trains, metro etc.), it has a restaurant in the ground foor were celebrities go for steaks (very good ) and it also serves breakfast. For something cheaper almost next to the hotel there is a Starbucks and at the first corner of 5th Avenue there is a Devon & Blakely coffee and Deli that will satisfy even the most difficult demand. The hotel is 2 min. walk to 5th Avenue and all its shops, 1 min. walk from Madison and 3 min. walk to the public library (where Carrie almost got married) and at the back of the library you will find a great park called Bryant park. From there another 2 min. walk and you are in Times Square. Also, it is 4 min. walk from the Empire State Building and the Rockfeller tower. I mean I have travelled a lot, this hotel had the greatest location ever! Moreover, its 5 min. walk to the port authority bus terminal where you can get a bus to go to Woodbury common outlet and shop till you drop all the brands you can imagine in prices that will make your heart stop! We walked everyday to Central park , it is 15 min. maximum walk on foot and especially on the weekends with a good weather its a must! Don't leave NY without eating in Burger Joint (its inside the hotel Le parker Meridien, but its not formal at all, its behind some red curtains, very unformal, u will have a good laugh and the best burger ever!). Take the metro and go to West Village and Soho, have a simple yellow cupcake with pink icing or a slice of the coconut cake at Amy's bread in Bleecker Street (i tried the Magnolias Bakery also but Amy won..). We also ate at Benjamin Steakhouse at the hotel, the price is approximately 40 $ each but I think its worth it even once. The room has two double beds so the remaining space was ok before shopping. After shopping we kind of climbed over piles of bags in order to go to the other side. The hotel offers driving you to the airport you like (maybe also pick you up) at a good price and for anything we wanted they assisted us with professionalism. There was only one point I didnt enjoy. Though it has free Wifi the signal was on and off every 5 minutes and that became a bit irritating after a while when we searched for a place to go or visit or information in our laptop or iphone. But, they do have a computer in the lobby with Internet that you can use for free as much as you want.

All the mid-town go-sees are within walking distance, Times Square, Central Park, Top of the Rock, Empire State and for the subway Grand Central is minutes away. We had a few scratch your head moments. In the bathroom were the usual 'towels on the floor get washed - put your towel on the towel rail to save fifty dolphins. Em there wasn't a towel rail. Great coffee machine with yummy looking coffee. Nowhere even remotely close to plug it in. Why are there coat hooks on the roof of both the lifts? All in all no major complaints, very few minor ones.

I assumed that the price I was quoted on the net would have a zillion percent uplift for taxes but it was almost to the dime of the final bill.

Ideal base for a sightseeing trip. The hotel does not have a breakfast service so you can use the bar next door - which is in fact part of the hotel building so I didn't really get that. The breakfast was a tad expensive but a fair selection, although we didn't find the staff overly welcoming. (For the same price I recommend you walk around the corner, opposite Grand Central Station Pershing Square, a fabulous place for a real New York Breakfast, the buzz in there is great.)

Three caveats I want to mention. The shower doesn't have a door and half of it is completely open. It presents two challenges: first, it's impossible to turn water on without getting into a shower, so you need to turn it on and jump away; second, everything around you gets wet. Second caveat is that shower is quite complicated to operate - my wife couldn't figure it out on her own and called me to help her. The third little problem is that our room was on the \"inside\" wall. Windows do not open and there are heavy drapes on the windows. It's hard to tell whether it's day or night outside. I figured we'd wake up on our own and didn't set the alarm clock.

This queen bedroom package included breakfast, a complimentary upgrade if possible on check in, complimentary Internet, and a bottle of wine. Pretty decent deal for Midtown Manhattan, just one block from Grand Central Station and the NY Airport Service bus stop. When I checked in, the welcome was warm enough. Nobody explained whether I was receiving an upgrade or not - I don't think I did. I got the breakfast vouchers and the bottle of wine (a run-of-the-mill cabernet sauvignon) was delivered. The room was pretty decent, though it was too hot and with no visible means to control the heat. I've had the windows open throughout my stay including the night just to keep the temperature comfortable. I've also had to have the curtains drawn closed the entire time I was in the room because the window looked out across to an office block. For a modern hotel, it was somewhat strange that the lamps had to be switched on individually and not through the wall switch. Some of the phone speed dial buttons didn't work. Housekeeping kept using far too shallow plastic trash bin liners that meant that you could hardly put anything into the trash can, less than half its actual capacity. I get how some people are upset by the lack of shelf space in the bathroom. It is somewhat strange that there really is no place to put a toilet kit. Yet another example of how designers often think only about looks and not about the needs of the guest. Housekeeping wasn't very good about replenishing toiletry supplies. I had to call down for some soap and ran out of shampoo before a new vial appeared. The chemistry theme is cute but there's no attempt in the room to explain the reasons behind it. The Internet worked fine, though at a few times service was weak. Room service (from Benjamin's Steakhouse) was good, but way too expensive - I could order the same food for delivery to my room for maybe half the price using seamlessweb.com. The fitness center is too small and cramped - and frankly a little smelly. I wondered about the security of the hotel, given that restaurant delivery people could just go straight up to the room to bring me my orders. The safe in the room is great - large enough to keep a laptop. Guest services guy on the phone was sometimes nice, sometimes rather short and cold. The buffet breakfast is not worth paying for. It all seems like an afterthought on the hotel's part. There's no effort to make the buffet any better than a school cafeteria spread - cheese singles???? chafing dishes that don't keep food hot????? Stale bread and old baked goods????? Please! The restaurant itself needs to be fixed up. It has all the charm of the refectory of a seminary. On the whole, this was a good hotel to stay in for the price I paid. Would I stay here if I were to pay peak season prices - say, USD250 or USD300?

It is really fairly basic accomodations, but for the price in New York it was more than adequate. This is a list of what I experienced. -Good location, very convenient to public transportation -Staff was friendly -Small room but clean and comfortable -Fairly quiet for a hotel in the city (I was on the 8th floor) -Not a lot of restaurants in the immediate area, but enough As mentioned in earlier reviews, the lighting is a little dim, the heat does not seemed to be controlled in the room (although it was fine in my room), and the bathroom is interesting with the lack of shelf space. Many things like this can be expected in older facilities and I probably wouldn't have even noticed if I hadn't read some of these reviews. So if you are looking for a 4 Star experience, you should go somewhere else.

I later learned that they had in fact sold out of the room type I had booked and given me a smaller one instead - when I complained, they put me in a room of similiar size with a jacuzzi. This practice is really irritating - I would have appreciated the room I booked or a discount for taking something smaller. The staff were at least up front in explaining the problem. Since the hotel was full, this was in fact a way of raising their rates. I'm sure they charged the guy in my room more than I was paying. The rooms, though tiny, were okay, but it took two calls to engineering to get things working. The television was not connected to the wall and the high speed internet was not working. The hotel claims it has wireless and may in fact have it on some floors, but not on the 16th floor or in the restaurant. The engineer explained to me that this was because the building was old and the signals don't go through the walls. I didn't laugh at him, but my computer was receiving signals from two other wireless networks from offices nearby. He must be new to his job. Housekeeping was okay, but they had the most annoying desire to restock the minibar at 10 am on weekends, even with the \"do not disturb\" sign. Maybe they're new to hotels, but I'm not sure 10 AM is a good time to restock minibars. The drinks downstairs are okay, the food is only mediocre though.

I have stayed in several hotels in Manhattan, for business & pleasure, and thought the Dylan was average. If you get a good rate here, it might be worth it. But don't expect comfy duvets or a special stay. (See pics.) We stayed in a standard room, which was the usual small size for NYC. Our 11th floor room had a window, but not a view. There were three adults in our room, which seemed snug. With no overhead lighting, only bedside lamps, the room was poorly lit. The bathroom was slightly odd. There was no place to set your personal toiletries (see pics), and it was nearly impossible to wash your face in the sink. There are no towel rails, and only one hook. The shower also had poor water pressure, and once even stopped working in the middle of my shower. (It returned quickly after.) The free internet was a bonus. The wireless was intermittent. I was told that the old building was interferring with the signal. (?) Front desk brought me an ethernet cable. The Chemistry Club was usually quiet. (Don't expect The Royalton.) Even on Super Bowl Sunday, and at the start of NY Fashion Week (which all happens on the Dylan's doorstep at Bryant Park), the bar was empty. The hotel staff were fairly average as well. Front desk ordered a cab for us to JFK, which never came. We ended up hailing a cab, and were fine. Many of the average reviews here are spot on. All is true about the good location, but otherwise I wasn't blown away.

Stayed at the Dylan for 3 nights and have mixed feelings about this hotel. To start, considering the insane rates for a decent midtown hotel this past weekend, we got a fair rate. So with regards to the price tag, we were happy. Having read prior reviews, I was prepared for this hotel to not be \"service oriented\", nor friendly. Well your reviews were dead on. Upon checking in, the \"clerk\" did not even lift his eyes from whatever he was doing, as he greeted us with \"Can I help you?\" I thought he was talking to his computer. It was a complete joke. It is as if this hotel goes out of its way to train their staff to be unfriendly! However, Chad was nice. The next night, when my friend called down to ask the conceirge a question, he barked at her, telling her he is too swamped to answer her right now (funny, considering, I never saw another sole in the hotel during our 3 day stay!) It just seems that a hotel should pride itself on customer sevice, hospitality and friendliness, and this hotel certainly does not. Apart from the staff though, our room was decent, bed comfortable(but not the pillows), room was quiet,only 2 elevators, but we never had to wait for one, and the location was great. Yet, with the hundreds of hotels to chose from in Manhattan, I will try some place else upon my next visit.", "Date": "November 21, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cDisappointing\u201d", "Author": "1806", "ReviewID": "UR4089166", "Content": "First the good news, good location & very competitve price for Oct/Nov .

Tried to leave a wake up call with the automated system, it didn't work. Tried the operator at 11:00PM, no answer. Left the wake up call with the front desk.

I travel frequently to NY and have stayed in all different type of hotels from boutique to large chain in the city and I haven't been this disappointed in a hotel in quite a long time. First the positive: 1. Location. It is steps away from Grand Central, and better yet, to the express bus stops to all three NYC airports, with buses that run every 30 minutes from 4 am to 1 am or so. No need for an expensive cab or subway to train transfers. I used the bus ($13) to make a Newark airport flight - left at 3:15 and arrived at 4:20. 2. Size of Room. I booked an executive King and got a rate of $349. Being mid-October, this was about one of the best rates I could get for an upgraded room at a decent hotel. It was on the 15th floor and was definitely commodious. There was no view, but I was high enough to get some view of the sky. The windows opened, which was a plus. 3. Internet. Complementary laptop access through ethernet. There was a wireless network, but I could not get a network address assigned -- I have a brand spanking new PC and never have any problems elsewhere, so I suspect there is something wrong with the wireless network. I didn't bother calling down, since I was fine with the ethernet cable. Now the partly negative. 1. Staff. I had read the recent reviews about the staff and I usually read these with some level of cynicism, as I have witnessed my share of rude and unreasonable customer scenes. But I think there may be some truth to the criticisms I have read here. My experience checking in was fairly negative. The front desk person was not rude, but he certainly was not friendly or welcoming. I guess I don't expect the staff to be subservient or ingratiating, but a \"Good Morning, Welcome to the Dylan Hotel!\" and a smile might have been nice. I received neither. When I went up to the desk and told them I was checking in, all I got was a cold, sighing, \"What is your name?\" \"I'll need your VISA card.\" The desk person just seemed bored and aloof, and not particularly happy about his job. Bad way to start the stay. I should say that it was only the front desk person on that Saturday morning that behaved that way. The other times I had dealings at the front desk, it was decent. The bellhops, doormen and maids were wonderful, however. 2. Common Areas. Having stayed at the Hudson and even the smaller hotel in the same group as the Dylan, the Time, I was disappointed with the common areas. The lobby area is small and nicely furnished, but the waiting area directly accross the reception desk is small, basically a couple couches. There's no lounge area or bar or library or places to hang out that you would normally find in a boutique hotel. In fact the Dylan had far less amenities in that way than even a high-quality chain hotel. Basically, the Dylan reminded me more of a dormitory than a boutique hotel. The photos on the websites really make the hotel look far more \"hip\" and modern than it really is. 3. Room. Wasnt as nicely furnished as it appeared in the photos. The room I had was on the interior light well. Though the windows opened to let fresh air in, there was a huge ventilation fan going the whole time. Furnishings okay, big King bed was comfortable. 4. Heating/AirConditioning. I was there in mid October. The weather was in the mid 70s. I arrived to a room that had the heat going. I tried to get the air conditioner to work, but was told by the desk that their HVAC could only do heat or aircon, and that they had already converted it to heat for the season. Therefore, the only thing to do was to turn off the unit. I had to open the windows and prop open the door to cool off the room. It wasn't so bad, but I feel sorry for the person who is there during an unseasonal cold snap or heat wave! *** Overall, I would say that if you can get a cheap rate for this place, its probably a good value. It was not worth the $350 what I paid. If location is key and you want the small hotel experience , the Library Hotel is up the street from the Dylan. I have stayed at the Library before, and it has smaller rooms, but being on the corner, better chance for views, as well as a great lounge areas and a well-trained service-oriented staff. Or if you don't care about boutique and don't mind big, the Grand Hyatt at Grand Central, which is right next to (on top of?) the terminal is a fine high-quality choice.", "Date": "October 18, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat Little Boutique Hotel near Everything\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3933092", "Content": "The Dylan is a little modern gem near Grand Central, only steps away from the Empire State, a few blocks from Times Square and everyhting that New York has to offer.

Location great if you want to be near Grand Central and the New York Public Library. Not near any interesting night life at all in New York and located on a pretty inocuous cross street a bit too far east. Not much interesting going on in this neighborhood in the way of restaurants, nightlife or shopping. Theatre district is not too far away and can be reached within a 15 minute walk. Hotel restaurant and bar were closed and have been for ages (make that years). They keep saying a restaurant will be opening soon but don't believe them until it does as they've been saying this ever since Brittany Spears restaurant Nayla was shut down shortly after it opened. The standard rooms are really small and only have small showers and no tub. Strongly recommend you book the executive rooms that are like junior suites and have great high tech equipment. For the price, there are far better and more interesting options available in NYC that are closer to nightlife, shopping and local sites. Staff appears to be confused and unable to resolve minor problems. Lastly, Alchemy suite is the only one like it in the hotel and it looks far more impressive in the photos than in person. If you are looking for a romantic getaway and still feel compelled to stay here that would be my first choice as at least it has a funky charm to it rather than the not particularly interesting minimalism reflected in the rest of the rooms. The only time this hotel is ever booked up is when NYC is completely sold out or during fashion week due to its proximity to Bryant Park. Doing a bit of research I find there are many better options for a quick getaway in NYC. How much fun can it be to stay in a hotel with no restaurant and no bar. Concierge services...someone ought to tell the hotel exactly what this means and at least have one with some contacts who actually knows the best, the most fun and the hot restaurants in tow so they not only can recommend then abd the best clubs has a few contacts to actually get you in.
