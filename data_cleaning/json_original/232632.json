It is a decent hotel with minimal frills, but very comfortable, straightforward rooms, good bathrooms, an excellent breakfast, and staff who couldn't be more helpful. In addition, the walk to the Old Opera Square, with some very nice restaurants, was only 15 minutes. Recommended if you want something unpretentious and relatively inexpensive in a town full of overpriced and bad hotels.", "Date": "Sep 27, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR411624374", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Gaffeur"}, {"Content": "Very disappointing I stayed two nights and did not enjoy the experience. It's about a 10 minute walk to the main shopping area, which is fine. My room and bathroom were very good - large, well equipped and very clean.But:No restaurant in the hotel so you have to go out for food. There's a little restaurant next door which is good and very friendly but basic. And the staff were unfriendly and not very helpful. It was very perfunctory. I wouldn't stay there again on my own and I should think that for the price there are better hotels with friendlier staff.", "Date": "Nov 1, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR375611481", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "Alscot"}, {"Content": "Fantastic! 1st Class! I spent 5 nights here during a trip with work and was very pleased with what was on offer. Check in was smooth and the staff very helpful. My room (one of the single rooms) was clean and comfortable with a huge balcony - lovely for sitting on with a cold beer at the end of the day! The furniture looked lke it'd been chosen with care rather than the usual bulk buying boring-ness! Breakfast time was normally very busy but the staff worked hard to make sure things ran smoothly - I never had to wait for a table. It's approx 10 mins walk from Franfurt Messe and a 2 minute walk to the U Bahn (underground) where the city centre is just 2 stops and less than 2 Euros away! Ideal! Will definitely stay again net time I'm in Frankfut. PS. You must try the Apple Wine Kir Royal from the local restaurant next door!", "Date": "May 22, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR207952620", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "You get what you pay for, or a little less Hotels in Frankfurt can be expensive, so the Palmenhof can be an economical option in a good location. However, it is not cheap. Reception desk staff are extremely unfriendly at times and inefficient at others. The rooms are OK but small; the bathrooms are fine but the supply of toiletries is stingy. If you have heavy luggage you'll want to know that there are many steps to negotiate from street to lift, and from lift to some rooms, with minimal help from staff. You should also note that the hotel has no air-conditioning, and the top floor rooms right beneath the slate roof get very hot indeed in summer. Personally, I think some of the slightly more expensive hotels offer better value overall.", "Date": "Jun 28, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR694609614", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "plagist"}, {"Content": "Der Palmenhof ist ein Super Hotel zum weiterempfehlen   showReview(12660020, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR709088832", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Bibi1511"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187337-d232632-r17947650-Palmenhof_Hotel-Frankfurt_Hesse.html", "HotelID": "232632", "Price": "$288"}}
