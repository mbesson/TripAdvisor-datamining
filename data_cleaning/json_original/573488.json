However, having now settled in the experience has gone downhill. The surrounding area of the hotel is unexciting and the metro station is a fair distance from the center of town - according to the receptionist a 45 minute journey. As we only just landed we felt like relaxing and exploring the amenities in the hotel of which there are very little. The restaurant is closed which after reading other reviews seems to be a common occurrence and the our conservatory is more of a gym then the \"health club\" that has been advertised. The room is warm and comfortable but the walls are covered in markings and a lack of cleaning has left the room full of dust. Turn up with no expectations and you'll be pleasantly surprised - otherwise if you are looking for a hotel with a variety of amenities and activities within the hotel than this is not the one.

The lobby of the hotel was perfectly acceptable. The room however is very dated and in need of updating and also showing lots of signs of wear and tear. The other major point is that this is a ghost town. The entire area seems to be a bit of a ghost estate, a relic of the spanish property boom. I did find one really good restaurant near the Las Tablas Metro stop. Restaurant Muus was great and I will write a full review when it is added.

I must add though, contrary to the hotel's details, the hotel is not 5 minutes by car from the airport, more like 20 minutes and that was with a clear road, and the free shuttle - which was excellent especially when you have a 6am pick-up time - only picks up/drops off at the airport, nowhere else. The metro station is about a 5-10 minute walk - good - and there are a few restaurants about 3 minutes walk away - which you wouldn't know if you didn't ask!
