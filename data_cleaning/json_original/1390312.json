The only thing I found bad was the business center that is not good but as a replacement lobby is great. I stayed there in October 2011 and going again on March 8, 2011. I am doing software development from Pakistan for some USA clients and they come for the meeting in Dubai every year and stay at 5 star hotels, I ask them that why they spent this much of money while there are other hotels where we can stay good as we have to do meeting all day in the lobby/business center and then go out to malls and then come back to room to sleep, he asked me to select a hotel and I selected City Seasons hotel Dubai just by reading info from the internet and you know what my client said he will always stay at this hotel. City Seasons hotel has great room honestly if you compare the room with a 5 star hotel\u2019s you will find no big difference. The washroom is excellent with all accessories, beds are awesome, LCD big screen TV, 24 hours free of cost internet both wired and wireless in the room (5 star charge you a lot for internet and they give wireless only in the lobby). The hotel is well situated very near to the airport a 3 minutes\u2019 walk and you are at the metro station and city center mall, behind the hotel there are other great mall, a 4 minutes\u2019 walk and you have Garry\u2019s Danata office if you are an emirates traveler and need something. Food is excellent and the dinner/lunch buffet charges are very low but the food is excellent both in taste portion. Gym is good swimming pool is small but acceptable. Lobby is excellent and 24 hours room service is on the top. Above all the staff, I felt that I am the president of this hotel when the staff talked to me. You will love the staff for how they talk and care for you. I say that City Seasons hotel is the best place to stay if you have a business trip to Dubai or even you are coming with your family for vacations. This is an alcohol free hotel and the hotel surrounding is great you will not see any bad stuff around the hotel which you see around other 3 and 4 star hotels in Dubai like pimps and prostitutes. City seasons hotel is great from every aspect and from every point of view.", "Date": "January 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tehran, Iran", "Title": "\u201cterrible hotel i ever seen\u201d", "Author": "navid_shakourian", "ReviewID": "UR122076127", "Content": "we were stayed there from 19 DEC 2011 till 22 DEC 2011. this hotel is full of strangers that are not guests . reception is usually angry and didn't like to answered us. worst of all : one morning at 4.15 AM we heard someone screaming . we woke up and ran out. and saw a girl lay down behind the one of rooms and just scream... and no one was there to help.. after 5 or 6 min the security (a thin small man) come and couldn't do anything to make her quiet . the girl was still screaming. terrible terrible terrible.

Within walking distance, (about .05 miles) is the City Center Mall which also has a Carrefour where a vast array of everything from fresh fruits to inexpensive Arabic style clothing and household goods to electronics can be found. Also, if needed, there was always a taxi around to take you wherever you want to go. My only criticism is that the location does not lend itself to some of the beautiful views from other hotels but who wants to stay in the hotel and look out the window when there is an exciting city out there to experience! I will stay here again and would recommend The City Seasons Hotel to friends. As an added note: While I was traveling to Dubai I twisted my knee and had to use crutches.

I\u2019ve only been here for four hours so far but here goes. There is supposedly \u201cvalet parking\u201d but you would have to drive up two levels of curbs and bust through some poles to get to the door, instead you have to park your car yourself (fine) but then the guy inside offers to go and repark it for you\u2026 for what purpose? Check in was fine but the room smelt like wet dogs have been living here for the past week. Was too tired to change rooms, in retrospect I should have because it only got worse. My room had no room service menu, no internet cable, and a dresser which hadn\u2019t been wiped down from the last guest who had clearly eaten off it. Strawberry jam, it seems. All of the TV channels are listed incorrectly compared to whats actually on the TV, the only channels on the list which I know are vaguely entertaining were nowhere to be found on the telly. The time on the clock in the room was also wrong. Called to request the room service menu and the internet cable and followed up twice over the next hour, finally I issued a ten minute ultimatum before I would leave the hotel. The menu turned up straight away but not the internet cable. Still with no internet and no television I have decided to calm my frustration with a glass of wine from the mini-bar. No alcohol. In the entire hotel, apparently. Have finally ordered room service, they apparently couldn\u2019t manage a baked potato, only mashed potato which makes me wonder what the mash will be made of\u2026 room service arrived and was fabulous, great steak. I\u2019m shocked. Noted spyhole cover is broken. The bathroom is a disabled bathroom with safety bars everywhere which gives me that queasy feeling of being in a hospital. There\u2019s no toilet lid, and it stinks! Perhaps that\u2019s handy for the thirsty wet dogs of last week, but I don\u2019t like a gaping toilet and had to cover it with the shoe basket while I had a shower. The plughole doesn\u2019t work so the bath fills up while you shower and the curtain is too short so water got all over the floor. If there had been any wine in the fridge I would have easily slipped over and ended up needing the safety bars after all. There is a loud band playing even though its now after 10pm on a school night, internet guy turned up 4 hours late to \u201ccheck\u201d that I honestly didn\u2019t have a cable, reeking of cigarette smoke so badly it mingled with the dog smell and lingered in the room, he then took another 20 minutes to return with the cable itself. The cable is only long enough to reach from the back of the telly (where the port is) to the front of the telly so I have to sit awkwardly right in front of the television to do any work. The room might be bigger than a normal 4 star hotel and it\u2019s a fairly good price I guess, still, these are really basic, annoying faults which ruin your stay and would be so easy for them to have sorted out. I haven't even gone to bed yet, god knows what else will go wrong!
