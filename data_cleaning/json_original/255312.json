I took the \"lounge\" room, right at the top, with seaview terrace. The decor is lovely, rustic, there are no windows in this big room though. There was a kitchenette, but I had to ask for a fridge, which was taken from another room, the aircon wasn't that effective in cooling the room, probably because the palapa roof isn't providing insulation. The bathroom door kept jamming and required brutal force to be opened. The worst thing was the stench in the bathroom: a permanent smell of sewage coming from the pipes: yuk! Continental breakfast was quite a joke: a thermos of watery coffee and 2 slices of bread with strawberry jam or... strawberry jam. No juice, no fruit, nothing else than bread and coffee. There's free internet, but it's not accessible from the rooms, only from the lobby and the restaurant. The staff was lovely, the room clean, location just perfect if you go to Playa to enjoy the nightlife.", "Date": "May 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cJust okay\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5438647", "Content": "The rooms were clean and the housekeeping made us beautiful towel swans each day. The front desk staff were friendly and we were close to the center of town with easy access to many restaurants and attractions. However, the bar/restaurant downstairs that is attached to the hotel plays very loud music until late each night, which even the sound of your air conditioner will not completely drown out if you are on the second floor. Also, it seems the hotel could take some fairly easy and inexpensive steps to greatly improve security. For example, our room had a security bar on the door but our room key didn't work on it. When we asked for the key, the staff told us that \"another guest had lost it and they didn't have another one.\" Likewise, the \"security box\" in our room had no key or even keyhole, so we couldn't use it. It also appeared that someone could slide open the windows to our room in the hallway without much difficulty and get into the room. However, we had no problems with break-ins while we were there. The view we had was of a brick wall, but the higher-floor rooms may be better. The windows were frosted so the lack of view didn't really affect the aesthetic quality of the room, which looked tranquil and pretty. There was a TV and air conditioner in the room and a nice window-seat area for reading. The shower was spacious and there was always plenty of hot water. For $55 a night, it was a farily good value, but we probably wouldn't stay there again due to the noise issues and lack of security.", "Date": "July 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, Texas", "Title": "\u201cLoved Cohiba!\u201d", "Author": "Bigskychick", "ReviewID": "UR5415204", "Content": "I stayed at the Cohiba for my 35th birthday......and had a great time.

To make matters worse, we talked to the owner of the hotel, and he would do nothing for us and did not even apologize, but he sure did try to charge us $300.00 dollars for the safe deposit box that was stolen!
