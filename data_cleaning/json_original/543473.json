We are a couple in our 20's and have travelled many places across the world but I really do mean it when I say that this was one of the best hotels we have stayed at. The hotel inside was chic and lovely and throughout our entire stay it was always kept clean. The room was perfect for us and as we spent most of our time sightseeing, it was great having a cosy bed to sleep in at night (especially important as I sometimes suffer with backache). We decided to pay for the all you can eat breakfast buffet and at 7 euros per person it was excellent value. The breakfast selection was fantastic and their cappacino's heavenly. It is a great idea to have breakfast there before you start your day and it gave us the opportunity to go over our plans in the morning. The location of the hotel is wonderful. Trastevere is just outside the centre and you can get a tram from outside the hotel into the city centre. The hotel was able to give us a map which showed us where the tram stopped and how to get to the various sights which was only a very short walk away. However be sure to visit the square of Trastevere as it is lovely place and the restaurants around the area are not only fantastic but also a little cheaper than the city centre. There is also a lovely Basilica in the centre which is worth visiting. One of the main attractions to this hotel was the friendliness of the staff. They were all so polite and nothing ever seemed to be a problem. Splendora on reception was lovely - always so kind to us despite us frequently losing the map or asking for advice. The staff had some of the best tips of where to go in Rome and how to get there. Another delight of this hotel is the roof garden. Although the weather was a little cold at night we still enjoyed a bottle of wine whilst sitting on the roof top, and it was lovely overlooking Rome at night. You may have to wrap up weather dependent but it is worth it. The bar staff were very helpful and ensured we were taken care of. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Rome.", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "mattapoisett, ma", "Title": "\u201cThe Porta Portese apartment is great for families\u201d", "Author": "debbythec", "ReviewID": "UR128188432", "Content": "We recently stayed at the apartment owned by the Trilussa Palace called the Porta Portese.

You can charge your laptops in the room but things like cell phones or curling irons are best done in the bathroom. The hotel has adapters they can lend to you for your labtops but consider walking with a CONVERTER if you have multiple things you would like to charge at the same time (i.e. I-Pods, cameras, cell phones, and etc). The staff was excellent! Very helpful and friendly throughout our stay. God only knows how lost we would have been if they did not help us out!! Location is great -- it's near a tram stop that can take you to the city center where you can tour and shop. The only complaint I would have is that our room was cold. Rome was rather cold and rainy when we went and having our room be 68 F to 69 F just didn't cut it. I'm not sure what was the issue with turning up the heat a bit. I would and intend to stay there again when I return to Rome and I would recommend this to others.

The hotel is nice, but the service is fantastic. Max and others at the hotel made our stay very comfortable, they solved all of our needs and even gave my youngest daughter a birthday present while we were there on her 16th birthday. When we did not want to go back out to a restaurant for dinner, they handled ordering pizza, which was superb, and served the pizzas to us as though we were at a restaurant. They assisted us with finding our way around Rome (our first time there). The bartender provided us with the typical apetizers but also cut fresh fruit for us as well. These are just a few examples of the friendliness and service we had. We did not partake in the Spa, but it looked really nice. The foot massage probably would have been the thing to get. As I mentioned, there is a bar on site and there is a garden on top of the building that has a bar as well (check for when the roof bar is open). Also, they provide a free breakfast that included scrambled eggs, bacon, meats, cheeses, pastries, cakes, fresh fruit, toast and breads, juices, and coffees. Some key things to note, there is a tobacco shop next to the hotel where you can buy tram/bus tickets. The hotel has an information sheet that shows you how to get to key attractions. The Tram stop is right in front of the tobacco shop. We always used the IP gas station sign to flag where we needed to get off coming back. The Tram takes you to what is called Area Sacra which is not far from the Pantheon and Piazza Navona. Grab one of their cards from the front desk that has the address on it because not all of the taxi's know where it is at. The hotel offers different types of pillows and has memory foam mattresses in some of the rooms. This was helpful for my wife who has a bad back.

I'd read the reviews on Trip Advisor and wasn't disappointed. When I booked only the ground floor economy rooms were available - I was delighted when I arrived and we'd been upgraded. The room was ok size wise. The decor (inc. darkened curtains, bedding, lighting etc) & facilities (e.g. aircon, shower, mini bar, pillow menus) were just perfect for our cosy, romantic stay. Nothing I'd need to change although tea/ coffee facilities might have been useful. The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful - nothing was too much trouble e.g. advice on how to get the most out of the tourism aspect, transport. Definately go for the breakfast at the hotel - only 7 euros pp (probably the cheapest you'll find but also really good choice / quality). You'll probably find you're in the centre of Rome for lunch but I'd definately recommend coming back the area around the hotel for dinner as this was definately where we got the best food and service (city centre was average to good and you paid more - not unexpected). The hotel recommended restaurants within walking distance - my favourites were Le Fate, Alle Fratte Di Trastevere and the one next door to this (sorry didn't get name). NB the hotel doesn't provide dinner or lunch menus. Do however make sure you grab a drink (or several) on the hotel's roof terrace - it is really lovely with lovely views. We booked treatments (reflexology and massage) at the Spa with Helene - highly recommend, especially if you are doing the tourist walks! Spa' looks' gorgeous but this must be such an under used asset of the hotel - in my opinion. It can only be used if booked privately which for only the 2 of us would be too expensive!

What I didn't know when I was booking this hotel is that they apparently have a brand new spa (called Moon Spa) that just opened at the beginning of the month. We were traveling with one other family and wanted to figure out something to do for the kids to have fun together while we can relax with the other parents and all have a good time. Once we saw the spa we immediately knew this would be perfect to be able to supervise the kids while we sat back, relaxed, and even joined in on the fun every once in a while ourselves. So when we first walked into the spa, you see a huge jacuzzi that's almost as big as a pool (and the pool/jacuzzi has lounge beds BUILT IN to the seats) and for on the wall above the pool/jacuzzi you can select different music videos to play on the speakers and the image projects onto the wall which the kids loved because there is a built in iPad with a selection of different music videos and if you have an iPhone, you can dock your phone to play your own music which the kids had a blast with. On that same wall if you don't want the image to show, you can also choose to have water streaming down the wall like a waterfall built into the wall. I suppose this is for a more romantic setting which we didn't get to take advantage of on this trip, but we will be sure to for the next trip. There is also a steam room where you can also customize the music and lighting inside there as well. Outside of the steam room there are lounge chairs where we were able to relax and talk while the kids were playing in the pool/jacuzzi and the staff even put a chilled bottle of champagne on ice for us. We couldn't believe how modern and accommodating the spa and the staff was. The best part about this whole experience is you make private reservations so the entire spa is yours for as long as you want the reservation to be.

We opted to have breakfast in the hotel as we were pressed for time, but it was v. poor indeed - watery juice, tinned fruit, awful croissants, etc. Getting good croissants in Rome would be easier than getting bad ones, I would have thought.

You felt like you were emerssed in the Roman culture. We used it's pickup service from the airport which is a nice alternative to the taxi (which can runup the euros in a hurry) or the bus/tram route. We didn't really want to have to figure out the transit system hauling luggage after an overnight flight. Our room was ready upon arrival at 9:30 a.m. which was a bonus. A bottle of Prosecco and a nice not congratulating us on our anniversary awaited us - a nice and thoughtful gesture. The room was one of the cleanest hotel rooms we had aver been and was always nicely cleaned everyday. Our room was on the street side of Trastevere but whenever heard street noise over 10 days. The staff exceeded our expectations from the reviews, always cheerful and willing to answer questions, give directions,make restaurant reservations and recommendations. Breakfast was good with a nice selection. The location is right by a tram and bus stop so transportation is easy to sites (just make sure to understand the bus route schedule), but we walked a lot. We especially loved the Trastevere area. There are so many excellent restaurantes, trattorias, and pizzerias finding places to eat are no problem.

After a lot of research before our trip we booked 3 nights at Ponte Sisto hotel (pre-cruise) and 1 night (post cruise) at the Trilussa. My sister is a wheelchair user and we try to make sure that a hotel room is going to be suitable for her needs. We have stayed at many hotels worldwide and I can safely say this was the worst experience in all our travels. We asked for a wheelchair accessible triple room - this turned out to be a ground floor room and was very dark , unwelcoming and slightly depressing. The worst part was the bathroom - although a wheelchair could get access to the bathroom - you could not get the wheelchair anywhere near the shower door which meant that my sister had to transfer from her wheelchair to the toilet , then transfer to the bidet and finally transfer to the stool (which I had to ask reception twice for) in the shower There were no grab rails in the shower or the bathroom. The lift within the hotel was dirty and although the rooftop terrace could have been very nice it was let down by the badly stained cushions on the furniture . The breakfast was very poor - there was no scrambled egg or bacon left and we had to ask for cutlery from an extremely surly waitress. I have seen many reviews regarding the friendliness and helpfulness of the hotel staff but I can only assume they all had a day off during our trip. I think it is normally good practice when the management of a hotel takes the time to read reviews on trip advisor and respond to any concerns that are raised however the management at this hotel would be far better using this time to actually speak to the guests when they are staying at the hotel. I had asked the reception about suitability of the trams for a wheelchair and they did not tell me that there was a scheduled strike the next day. A notice in the reception would have been sufficient to avoid the chaos we endured going into and returning from the centre of Rome. We tried the Orange restaurant which is nearby and the waiter was breathtakingly rude and the food was inedible. We did not try the food at the Chinese restaurant next door as the waiter was so rude and obnoxious that we did not stay. I am not sure if this was because of the fact that we were women on our own or the wheelchair but it was not a very nice experience. Also the area does not feel very safe at night for women travelling on their own. It was a very disappointing end to a wonderful holiday. If you want to have a more positive experience in Rome - I would definitely recommend hotel Ponte Sisto.", "Date": "September 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wicklow, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cgood but pricey\u201d", "Author": "ItalianFan", "ReviewID": "UR118211241", "Content": "I stayed here for a two night stay for a business trip in August 2011.

We also spent one night walking along the Lungo il Tevere (one of the stops on the bus) and LOVED it, there were lots of spots to shop! Since we traveled in August, a lot of the stores/restaurants by our hotel weren't open, but we stumbled upon some amazing restaurants near the Trevi fountain (Il Chianti, try the lasagna, it was amazing!) and Piazza di Trilussa (Il Duca, it was one of our best meals and least expensive too, we dined with a lot of locals). The one thing I would recommend is to travel with the Hotel's business card in your pocket. One of our cab drivers dropped us off at PIazza di Trilussa, which was a 40 minute walk back to our hotel, after that night we showed all of the cab drivers the address of the hotel so they knew where they were going.

I was part of the north eastern hurricane Irene and as result all airports were completely shutdown. I booked my first ever trip to Rome with so much excitement and heavily relied on the reviews of trip advisor and so I post my feedback. For 4 full days since my cancellation, we tried to reachTrilussa for some type of reconsideration of scheduling to no avail. According to the front desk mgmt was not available and we were asked over and over to call again. When we finally got someone on the phone line, we were told that there would be no issue in rescheduling the dates for another time only to be told less than 24hrs later that this would not be possible. Again, I was not looking to be refunded but was more so looking for a resolution of rescheduling of dates (to say that I'm beyond tears at this point is an understatement). What has affected me most, is that this hotel had no consideration and response time in dealing with an foreseen and unexpected circumstance. Even the airlines accommodated 100% with no issue or insurance to back it up. I base all my travels on the customer service experience. This is what gives a business reliability and credibility. A small extension of attention and accommodation would impact any repeated business for any customer. I guess that what drove me to write this is that I was promised at 3am my time that the front desk would try to talk to mgmt to try to reverse the decision and the rep confirmed that I would receive an email. No communication was sent and no follow up. As a result, I'm only hoping that my experience will help so that no one relives my emotional nightmare.

If we had known better we would have got tram/bus passes from the start of our trip and used them more, but as it was we walked a lot (and have the blisters to prove it!).

Not keen on the coffee machine coffee though, you can't beat the real thing, and hey, it is Italy, we should expect better coffee :) There are restaurants near the hotel ( orange was very good but service extremely slow) but the mail Trastevere restaurant area is closer to the river.

The front desk was extremely warm, welcoming, friendly, and knowledgeable, especially Splendora. Whatever we needed, we knew we could count on Splendora, she was professional and helped with everything we needed. The breakfast was absolutely wonderful and abundant, there was free internet including wireless which is hard to find in Rome, they gave us a free round of champagne at the bar, the rooftop garden is a beautiful outlook over the city, and the rooms are larger than a typical European hotel. It is common to find a box for a room in Europe, but the rooms were quite comfortable. The decor is beautiful and gives a good name to the boutique hotel industry. We used their car services from the airport to the hotel and the hotel to the port of Civitaveccia, and both were reliable, efficient, and capable of a capacity of 8 large Americans. They also have a spa which we did not partake in. On the way back, we made the mistake of using the cruise line to get our last night in Rome and were sorely disappointed with the Cicerone which was more expensive and had zero amenities. The location of the Trilussa is also perfect. You are located right next to the BEST place to find good food for a reasonable price, the Trastavere. If you want to go to the main highlights of Rome, it is within walking distance or you can pay one euro a person and take the train which comes every 2-3 minutes and is located right in front of the hotel. You are far enough away to have quite nights, with a great view, without having long distances to travel to get to the heart of Rome. We travel a lot and have traveled all over the world from China and Russia, all over Europe, and all over North America and we highly recommend the Trilussa Palace in Rome.

The hotel is west of River Tevere and a brisk 15 minute walk from the trendy bar & restaurant night spot of Trastevere, which we often frequented. The hotel picked us up at the airport for a nominal fee that was well worth the cost and convenience - even more so if you have 2+ people traveling with luggage. The staff at the hotel were incredibly helpful, always ready with friendly greetings, jokes and an endless supply of take-away maps to share restaurants choices, directions and how to best get to where you were going via public transit. Furniture seems a bit dated but the rooms were clean, spacious for European standards and comfortable with marble bathrooms and upscale shower stalls. Small older style TV which we never had time to watch but the room did feature an in-room safe and writing desk. We did not get a chance to sit at the bar or have dinner at the hotel since we were always out somewhere within the city but breakfast was decent and plentiful. Next to the hotel is a pretty good Asian restaurant and a handful of caf\u00e9s, tavernas and snack shops with quaint outdoor seating. We booked online directly with the hotel and took advantage of their spa package which was a terrific value. There is nothing better than coming back to the hotel after a long day of sightseeing and being able to soak in a hot tub, relax in the sauna or get a massage. Although scheduling in advance is required, the staff were extremely accommodating in preparing your arrival within an hour if the spa wasn\u2019t already booked. This prep time may sound odd at first, but each guest books the spa as a \u201cprivate retreat\u2019 \u2013 you are the only ones allowed in the spa during your one hour session and you lock the door! The space is romantically decorated with lit candles and relaxing muted lighting while the hot tub, which looks more like a small pool, is very inviting as it gently bubbles. The hotel provides bathrobes and slippers in your room and it\u2019s a quick zip down the elevator to the spa. It\u2019s a wonderful treat. Rome central is smaller than it appears on a map and it\u2019s easy to get around by foot, bus or metro. We did not feel inconvenienced at all by our location on the other side of the River Tevere. The Roma Pass www.romapass.it can be purchased at the Fiumicino airport, among other kiosk locations, but does not include airport transportation and is only worthwhile if you plan on taking advantage of the museum entry fee discounts. Don\u2019t forget to check when museums are open and their hours of business. There is so much to see and do in Rome at no cost, and since the Vatican Museum Sistine Chapel was the only one we were particularly interested in as a \u201cmust-see\u201d, we purchased a daily bus pass for 5e from a little shop near the hotel instead and ended up with a better value. Other than exploring the meandering cobblestone streets of Trastevere, we also walked along the river Tevere at night where we\u2019d stop for a drink, listen to music and browse the vendors. If you are interested in visiting Vatican City, it is advisable to purchase your entrance ticket or guided tours online at www.vatican.va before you depart as it gets booked well in advance. We were actually late for our scheduled time but they still honoured our tickets and we avoided miles of lineups that wrapped around the exterior walls of Vatican City \u2013 no exaggeration! Some folks waited in line for 3 hours but the museum closed before they made it to the front door while we simply walked past the lineup and headed directly to the entrance without any wait whatsoever \u2013 although we experienced plenty of envious and bewildered stares. They also offer audio tours with headphones once you get inside if you were unable to commit to a scheduled guided tour. Vatican City is large and the entrance to the Vatican Museum and Sistine Chapel is on Viale Vaticano , the north side of the city while St Peter\u2019s Basilica is on the South East. Overall a nice hotel, away from the sounds of Trastevere, but close enough to enjoy its offerings by foot or bus and the spa is an extra bonus that we greatly utilized.

I'm sure alot of the main sights in Rome could be within walking distance (a long walk), but we did so much walking once we got to them that we used public transportation whenever possible!! Breakfast each morning was very good with a little bit of everything. The neighborhood directly surrounding the hotel seemed fine, but it's about a 15-20 minute walk to get to the main piazza in Trastevere or it's an easy tram ride.

We also found a great local restaurant one tram stop up. It was a great retreat at the end of long days out walking. Beautiful rooms, and though the showers were quite small and the drainage a bit slow, they had steam units, drenching rain shower heads, hand held shower heads, back jet streams, a radio and a seat to sit through it all. The roof garden restaurant view was gorgeous and the food good, though the menu was very limited. I will definitely be coming back to Trilussa Congress and Spa and referring it to others!

The tram stop outside the hotel is perfect, never waited more than 5 minutes for a tram and they are very cheap (most Romans seemed not to pay or swipe a card at all). The tram takes you right into the centre of the City, within a few minutes of the Pantheon. If you prefer to walk, it took us 40 mins to walk to the Vatican and about the same to the city centre. We didn't eat in the hotel as Trastavere has too many osterias/trattorias to choose from, and the atmosphere eating outside in one of the small Piazzas is much better. The breakfast in Trilussa was fine - standard continental style. One complaint.. the showers are simply not big enough to shower in! They have a seat that prevents you standing up, and you can't even sit on it as your knees then bang against the shower screen. Not good after a day walking around the city! If you can cope with that then the hotel is otherwise perfect for the price. I used the gym, it has a running machine, rower, a multigym weights machine that I couldn't figure out, and 2 small dumbells, so not massive but fine for a workout.

Lovely roof terrace, reasonably priced for drinks compared with in town prices.

Shower in room nice though with steam facility and jets. No bath though. Breakfast was nice, juice always very sour but lots of choice and a beautiful breakfast room. We had a spa deal included in price, having the spa (plunge pool, jacuzzi, steam room, sauna etc) to the two of us for an hour plus massages, this was amazing and would recommend doing this if you are staying there. Free internet in lobby and we also got welcome drink on arrival. If you look on hotel website you can get deals and prices that include all these things. They even provided shower area in the spa for us to freshen up on our last day when we went back to collect our bags several hours after checking out, which was nice of them.

The staff were fantastic, so helpful, nothing was too much trouble, they always had a smile and went out of their way to help.Breakfasts were brilliant, loads of choice - cereals, yogurt, scrambled eggs, bacon, cheeses, ham, vast array of cakes and pastries and a selection of bread and rolls and all sorts of coffees and teas and juices available. The location of the hotel is great, we particularly wanted to stay near Trastevere and we weren't disappointed. Central Trastevere is easily reached on foot in 15 minutes, or in 5 minutes by bus or tram from the stops outside the hotel, it has a huge charm with its cobbled streets, great cafes, restaurants and shops and of course the beautiful church of Santa Maria de Trastevere. Our favourite restaurants in the immediate vicinity were La Fate which is only about 600 metres from the hotel and Sale e Pepe which is a little further on. La Fate had a wonderful ambiance, and fantastic food. The chef Andrea runs cookery classes which we did and what a great day it was, we were a group of 8, and learned to cook all sorts of things we had never done before, then all sat down to devour them with a selection of wonderful wines to complement each course, - highly recommended!

We stayed in a Junior Suite (519) and we were very impressed. From some of the reviews i had read on here previous to our trip i wes expecting the room to be small but it was perfect for us. We had a Super King size bed and the mattress was so comfy it ensured every night we had a great nights sleep. The room was very clean and decorated very well. There was also a large sofa (which converted to a bed) and a good size bathroom. We even had a small balcony.Towels and bedding were changed everday, the only minor issue we had was we found the room to be very warm (there was air con in room which we could not get to work but we did not bother asking reception but if we did i am sure they would have been very helpful.) Breakfast was fine with yoghurts, fruits, cereals, pastries and some hot food such as eggs and bacon. Whenever we asked any of the staff help with directions, transport or excursions they were extremly helpful and their English was also very good. The number 8 tram which stops outside the hotel takes you straight to Largo di torre Argentina which is fairly central and from there we walked to Pantheon, Trevi fountain, Spanish Steps and Piazza Navona. We also decided to walk from Largo di Argentina to Vatican City which was very straight forward and took about 20min. From outside the hotel we also took the number 3 bus to right outside the collosseum. We paid 16 Euros each to enter Colloseum and this was entrance fee, audio guide and skipping most of the que. We did eat lunch in Piazza Navona in a restaurant called Dolce Vita and had just a Pizza each and a large bottle of Water. This came to about 30 Euros but it was very very good. In the evenings we stayed in the Trastevere area to eat we never went out to eat before 9pm but there are so many little alleys with restaurants you are spoilt for choice. We had a fantastic starter and Pasta each at a little restaurant that i think was called De Otello and i had a litre of House wine for 8 Euros i would highly reccomend this restaurant Great food, Great atmosphere and Great prices. The restaurants in the Trastevere area seem to be much cheaper than elsewhere. On our last night we went to a Place called la Scala the food was great however that night my boyfriend was violently sick all night and we put it down to the beef as that was the only thing he ate that i did not and i was fine. He was that ill that if it was not for our little boy back home we would have paid to stay an extra night and paid for flights later in the week when he was better. I had never seen him so sick and 2 days later he is still recovering!!! Tip If you go to St Peters Basillica and climb the dome be aware you have a choice of paying 7Euros and getting a lift then climbing around 321 steps or paying 5Euros and climbing 550. With my boyfriend being such a fitness freak he decided we should climb them all. After about 300 steps it starts to become very very narrow and quite claustrophobic. As you get higher up the dome the walls start to slant to the side so as you are climbing the stairs you are not even upright you are leaning to the right and using the wall as guidance as it is not very well lit. As you get nearer the top because most people who are ahead of you are tired you can end up walking up the stairs at a very slow pace, some people actually realised they did not want to carry on and stopped on the stairs but it is that narrow you can barely get passed. The last bit of the climb is up a very narrow spiral staircase which has a rope down the middle for you to hold on to but once you eventually get there you will see the views are totally worth it.", "Date": "February 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "kent", "Title": "\u201cExcellent small hotel.\u201d", "Author": "marlinKent", "ReviewID": "UR56508724", "Content": "Perfect hotel, ideally located, friendly staff, immaculate rooms - definitely would recommend.", "Date": "February 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rome", "Title": "\u201cFriendly service, excellent location, good breakfast - room a bit small\u201d", "Author": "AndreaNathan", "ReviewID": "UR55954652", "Content": "We stayed here one night - my wife and I with our two week old son.

If you want to stay next to the Colosseum or Vatican then expect to pay more for the hotel, and eating out. There is a tram stop (number 8), and bus (number 3) that stops just outside the hotel so we found it very convenient, easy and incredibly cheap to get around - especially if you get a 3 day pass (11 euros) from the small shop a couple of blocks to the left of the hotel. Most sights are within walking distance from the end of the tram line. The highlight of our 3 day stay was a visit to the spa in the hotel which included private use of the spa itself for an hour (whirlpool, steam room, sauna), a bottle of processo and 2 x 50 minute massages - all of which were excellent and a great way to end our trip. Upon arrival we were greated by the Paulo who was very friendly and helped us plan our stay. We were also able to check in at 11am which was great after our early morning flight. The breakfast buffet was good (not excellent) but had good coffee and is generally on a par with what you will get in most European hotels. The hotel IS a 4 star by European standards, but don't expect the rooms to be as large as what you will find in America or outside most of Europe. If on a budget - don't sit down in bars/cafe's that serve food as it's cheaper to eat/drink standing by the counter. We found that a lot of places that sold great panini's didn't serve good pasta if you sat down to eat it (we heard a microwave being used so didn't eat like that ever again). The prices of drinks and food vary a great deal, with the most expensive cappuccino being 7.50 euros near the Spanish Steps (in Babbington's tea rooms). It's always cheaper to drink house wine by the quarter/half/litre than a bottle, and it tastes really good too. The best places we found to eat were in Trastevere by Santa Maria. Tip - getting to and from the airport is easy and much cheaper by train than taxi. If you're coming in from FCO then go to the train station (follow signs from the arrivals lounge) and get a train to Trastevere. Then get the number 8 tram just outside the train station (direction Argentina) for a few stops to the hotel.

Both stopped directly outside the hotel. a 1 euro ticket could be purchased from reception which would give you 75 minutes travel on the tram or buses. Your 75 minutes would start when you first used the ticket. We then bought a three day ticket (11 Euros per person) covering all forms of transport in Rome ( Trams, Buses and the Metro) Word of warning, This is for three calender days. So if you first used the ticket and 10pm on say Monday, the ticket would expire Wednesday at midnight. In effect only two days. The number 8 tram would take you to the Piazza Argentina (End of the line) From there it was a short walk (5 mins) to the Pantheon. The number three bus would drop you off at the Colosseum. If you plan on visiting the Vatican City or the Colosseum then book your tickets online before you start you holiday. You can often find the tickets at a discounted rate, saving yourself some of your hard earned cash. we did this for the Colosseum and walked straight past the never ending queue, went to the reserved counter and picked up the tickets. We must have saved ourselves a good hours wait. We ate out every evening and Trestevera (get off the tram just before the bridge over the river Tiber. Then walk down the side streets on you left.

We used the voucher to empty our fridge (according to instructions from their staff). However when we wanted to pay, nobody claimed responsiblity for us emptying the fridge and they wanted us to make a list of things including the prices of these drinks that we have taken. Since there was an incomplete price list on the fridge, we were unable to do that. Manager / staff had no idea how to deal with the voucher, no idea what to tell us nor what to do. Our first and last impresion were ruined by the bad service of the hotel. Rule of thumb: don\u00b4t issue a voucher for which you have no idea how to use! Besides the breakfast was way below average for a 4-star hotel. No warm food, only the usual cold ham and cheese and ammenities. I would never go back to this hotel again.

The hotel was lovely and the rooms were nicely decorated and spotless but really very small for two people. Ideally situated thought for all the tourist attractions. Even to take a taxi costs no more than about 10 euros. Beware of bogus taxi drivers at the bus station. Do not go with anyone aking you if you want a taxi when you ask them what it costs all they say is \"it will be on the meter.\" On no account take those taxis unless they agree before hand a price.

We stayed two nights at Trilussa. The hotel was lovely. From the outside I didn't expect much, but upon entering we found it was much more than we had originally anticipated. The hotel was in a great location, a bit difficult to find, but I'm terrible with directions to begin with. The rooms were amazing and the staff were fantastic, save for one bartender. Around midnight on our second night in Rome, the bartender on the Trilussa's rooftop bar pushed me against the elevator doors and kissed me as the bar was closing. I was shocked, but managed to get away and into the safety of my room, where I breathed a huge sigh of relief. A few minutes after turning the lights off and climbing into bed, I heard a knock at my door. I froze. My parents were sound asleep on the 4th floor, so I knew it wasn't them. Then it hit me; I had charged my drinks to my room so the bartender knew my room number. I didn't dare breathe. He knocked again, louder this time. When he got no response, he actually TRIED THE DOORKNOB! I didn't know what kind of person he was and was terrified that he was going to come back with a room key and let himself in. Thankfully he didn't, but needless to say, I didn't get any sleep that night as I hid under the covers, waiting, just in case he should return. Now to be fair, I can't say for sure that it was the bartender who knocked on my door, since I didn't want to make noise by going to look. It wasn't my parents, or any other hotel staff. So I can only assume it was he. So ladies, let this be a lesson to you; and keep your wits about you. Other than that, the rest of the stay was wonderful.

A Roman friend suggested the Trastevere area - a suburb, if you will, of Rome, with easy access to public transportation (across the street from a bus station), a safe neighborhood for evening strolls, and MUCH more affordable than the touristy 'downtown Rome' area. Everyone at Trilussa, from the reservations staff pre-vacation, to the desk staff, and lounge staff (hi, Alex!), was friendly, accomodating, and knowledgeable - they made us feel like family (and EVERYONE spoke English and probably several other languages as well!). It has the look of a very high-end establishment (both common areas, spa and rooms), without the price or high-end snob staff attitude.

They're usually overpriced with poor service, horrible beds, and no water pressure. After carefully reading the reviews on this website, Trilussa seemed like a safe bet. When booking accomodation the two most important attributes to me are location and a comfy bed. No matter how great everything else is, you won't get the most out of your trip if your hotel is difficult to get to and your exhausted from a poor night's sleep. THE LOCATION With that being said, Trilussa far exceeded expectations in both areas. As mentioned in other reviews the tram and bus stop are right outside the hotel. The no.8 tram took you practically to the doorstep of the Pantheon. The stop before the river took you to the heart of Trastevere where there are amazing shops and excellent restaurants. 'Friends' bar near the Piazza Trilussa has happy hour with delicious complementary appetizers. For dinner close to the hotel I recommend 'Sale & Pepe' and 'Le Fate' (ask the owner's son for recommendations-he's the cheerful fellow). THE ROOM Hard wood floors, marble bathroom, and nicely decorated; the beds have memory foam - need I say more? We stayed in room 718 at the back of the hotel on the seventh floor (two twin beds). This was THE quietest room I have ever stayed in all of my travels. Of course it was small compared to North American standards, but for two adults how much space do you really need? The shower was luxurious to say the least with excellent water pressure. I highly recommend the 'Cascade' setting to rinse your exhaustion down the drain. Tip: If you plan to use other settings make sure you turn the dial and let the warm water flow through each setting before getting in the shower. Otherwise you'll get a quick blast from the cold water still left in the pipes. Because the rooms are soundproof I doubt anyone heard me scream. THE STAFF Andrea was my favorite. He's at the front desk in the morning and during the day. He's sweet, friendly, gives excellent detailed instructions, and takes that extra step. It was nice starting out the day with a warm happy 'buon giorno' from him. Housekeeping was also great. The only negatives are no wash cloths (common in Europe) and runny mass-produced eggs for breakfast. However, there are plenty of other protein options. TIPS FOR ROME Don't eat at restaurants that have people outside grabbing customers. Great restaurants don't need to do this. If the price isn't advertised, ask before ordering. Ask the waiter for a recommendation. They know what the best dishes are. Tell the cab driver you want the most direct route to your destination. Before calling a cab find out the starting rate. We didn't realize the cab charges extra after hours. At a start rate of 9 euros at 10pm, I believe we got ripped off. Use the subway when you can. Take a trip to the grocery store. It's fun to see the different everyday items they use. If you have trouble deciding anything just remember...when in Rome, do as the Romans do.", "Date": "March 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "dublin", "Title": "\u201conly hotel you need in Rome\u201d", "Author": "posh-bird35", "ReviewID": "UR14382963", "Content": "We are 2 couples whp spent 4 lovely nights in the Trilussa in January.

Although it is not directly in Trastevere area in is only 5 blocks away or a short Tram ride. Since this was our first trip to Rome I'll include lots of info that I wish I would have had. Hotel: It is very clean...and classic European type hotel. Small room, but clean and the staff is excellent. Sergio RULEZ! Thanks! He knows the city well and will try to accomodate anything you ask. Location: A cool are of Rome across the river that's less touristy but has some of the best restaurants there. Prices are lower since it's not so touristy. A nice to be for nightlife and houses a peacefull piazza. St. Marie de trastevere church. It's a cool place to get capucinno and gellati. Which we had EVERYDAY. Also nice is a grocery store a couple blocks down where you can get water and stuff instead of getting it in restaurants. Saves a lot of money. .50 Euro compared to 2-3 euro. Trasporation: Rome is relatively SMALL compared to any US city. If you like walking you can pretty much walk anywhere. We walked a TON. But there is a tram that is right in front of the hotel. So what is the tram? It's like an electric car on rails...that just goes down one street and takes you into the city area. From there you can walk anywhere. You can buy a tranportation card but from what I noticed no one even checks tickets in rome. So you could theoretically go through the city without having to pay a dime. But we bought the week pass to be legit. To the hotel is REALLY easy and cheap. 11 Euro gets you two tickets using the FR1 train to Roma Trastevere stop. Then take the tram two stops and you're at the hotel. Directions on their website helps. To Do: The Vatican Museo was by far the best. Get a tour guide definitely. We chose Presto tours which was awesome. They guy knew everything and it made the Vatican was more interesting. Plus you get to avoid the HUGE line. Although Feb had less tourists and since the Euro was so high...there still was a TON of people. I would also recommend a tour for Foro Romona and Coliseum. We didn't get one but probably would have made it more intersting. Food: Pizza is good ANYWHERE. Just varies in price depending where you are. The house wines are excellent and cheap. They charge your for bread so sometime if you don't want it tell them. Otherwise it's like 2 euro's for bread. That's something we couldnt' get used to...since it comes with the meal in the U.S. There was an excellent restaurant called L'orange right next to the hotel so that was nice. Also a restuarant called Le Fate. The waiter could speak Enlgish so that helped. The seafood is not so good in Rome but maybe that's just us. They salt the fish and the shrimp is tiny. We just stuck with Pasta. Itialians eat multiple courses so on the menu the first course is the pasta dish and the second course is the meat dish. We normally just got appetizer and pasta...otherwise it would get too expensive. Also they eat SUPER late like 9-10 PM is when the restuarants start getting crowded. Well that's it. Rome is an cool place! We loved it. Trilussa Palace hotel is a really cool place to stay if you like to be adventurous and be part of the culuture it's the place to be.

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Trilussa Palace Hotel. As a woman traveling alone I\u2019m always cautious with my choices and so I\u2019d read all the reviews before booking. I arrived there with high expectations based on the reviews and I was not disappointed. I must say that my actual stay at the Trilussa far exceeded those high expectations and I was extremely satisfied with my whole experience. This is a FANTASTIC hotel! Room \u2013 Yes, my room was small by North American standards but it was perfectly \u2018normal\u2019 for a hotel in Italy and/or Europe. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom well- appointed and my room well sound-proofed for a quiet, restful sleep. The much written about shower was excellent, easy to use and provided a wonderful relaxing experience at the end of a long day of meetings or sightseeing. Everything was spotlessly clean. The internet access in my room (which is very important to me) was easy to use, was fast and reasonably priced. Location \u2013 In my opinion, the location of the hotel is EXCELLENT! It\u2019s away from the hustle & bustle of the touristy area of central Roma where it\u2019s crowded, food and drink prices are high and you\u2019ll be around more tourists than locals. Simply walk out of the door of the hotel and you\u2019re right at the tram stop that, after a short comfortable ride, takes you into the heart of old Roma. From there you can walk or take buses anywhere in Roma that you so desire. I found though, like many before me, that the best way to see Roma is on foot so that you can fully experience all the sights, sounds, aromas and ambience. Food - Trastevere is a wonderful area with lots of little restaurants and wine bars. It is well frequented by locals so the prices are reasonable, with good quality food and authentic menus. I was particularly fond of Sale e Pepe which is a short walk from the hotel. If you walk a little further on, take a left onto Via S. Francesco and explore it and the alleys running around it for some wonderful, small and charming restaurants which offer lots of great food, fun and atmosphere. Another good choice is the Chinese restaurant right next door to the hotel. It is family run and the food is fresh, healthy and reasonably priced. A good choice if you\u2019re not up for a walk after a long day of sightseeing. The buffet breakfast provided by the hotel is excellent and well worth any additional fee if not included in your room price. There are lots of choices of juices, cereals, fruits, cheeses, meats, pastries, breads, etc. The selection provided easily competes with breakfasts that I\u2019ve had provided elsewhere in Europe at much more pricey hotels. The breakfast room is bright, airy and spotless. The attendant is always there to provide you with any specific requests for special coffees or teas, etc. Transportation \u2013 I made arrangements with the hotel to have a driver pick me up at FCO and it worked without a hitch. The driver was there and waiting with a sign when I exited the baggage area. He carried my bags and opened doors for me. His vehicle was clean and nicely appointed. He drove reasonably, I arrived safely at exactly my anticipated time at the Trilussa and the cost was exactly as I had been quoted. A really painless way to get from the airport to the hotel! I couldn\u2019t have asked for more! As my first experience was such a good one, I asked the hotel to make arrangements for a car to take me from the hotel to my cruise ship in Civitavecchia at the end of my stay. This went without a hitch as well. A different driver was there exactly as booked, he carried my bags, opened doors for me and his vehicle was just as clean and nicely appointed. He drove reasonably, I arrived safely at my ship at exactly my anticipated time and the cost was exactly as I had been quoted. Again, I couldn\u2019t have asked for more! As far as getting around Roma goes as stated above the tram works well from the hotel. It\u2019s definitely worth investing in a tram/bus pass if you\u2019re going to be staying a few days or more. Taxis in Roma are metered and reasonably priced so don\u2019t hesitate if you get tired or lost to take one. Do be aware though that taxis are almost impossible to flag down so it\u2019s best to have the hotel order you one if you\u2019re leaving from the hotel or if you\u2019re out and about, walk to the nearest taxi stand to get one. Taxi stands are well marked and close to all major piazzas and sites. Service \u2013 From the moment I first arrived and each and every time I entered the elegant lobby of the hotel I was greeted by one or more of the very attentive front desk staff. This staff (Gian Marco, Paulo, Edoardo, and Sergio to name a few) were absolutely professional and most helpful in each and every encounter I had with them. Whether I was asking for directions to a particular place, asking them to book me a taxi, or requesting suggestions for where to go to dinner or something else, I was treated with the utmost respect, and experienced the graciousness that I\u2019ve come to expect as the norm in high end establishments in Europe. The staff of the Trilussa is right up there with the best of them! Now if all of the above wasn\u2019t already enough to make me a very happy and extremely satisfied guest\u2026.the icing on the cake for me was that the Trilussa Palace is 100% NON-SMOKING! Imagine not experiencing that smell of stale smoke in the hallways or in your room that you encounter so much in the older hotels in Europe! I loved it! The Trilussa Palace Hotel gets 5 stars in my book and I will not hesitate to stay there again.

The Spa was a bonus, albeit a little on the expensive side for massages etc but nevertheless was a great way to end our holiday as we booked it for private use and massage on our last day - we also received a discount for use which was good. Breakfast was included in our stay and was plentiful and well organised. The only real criticism was the size of the shower cubicle which housed the turkish bath - it was a little on the small side ! However, it was very enjoyable. Getting into the city itself was very easy with a tram stop directly opposite the hotel with very frequent trams running - very cheap way of travelling. No restaurant at the actual hotel, but a few reasonable ones within easy walking distance. Overall, this hotel is excellent value and we would not hesitate to stay there again.

We arrived early on a Sunday morning and were told that we could store our luggage and enjoy the rooftop garden or the Porta Portense market as our room was still occupied. They took our luggage and were very helpful orienting us with maps, transit tickets and made suggestions as to how we could spend these few hours. The hotel was very nicely appointed, very clean and the bathroom downright luxurious. The bed had a memory foam mattress - divine! The best sleep we got on our whole vacation! The hotel is on a main street, but the windows did not let the bustle of the street penetrate, so we had quiet nights, but the ability to open our door to a small balcony to watch the spectacles of the street. A generaous breakfast was included and served in the dining room as a buffet. Remember to ask the wait staff for your morning cappuccino, otherwise brewed coffee is available in an urn. However, what made the hotel outstanding was the very professional and attentive staff that served us throughout the hotel. They were very friendly, and always made eye contact when you came through the door. It truly felt like coming home.

You book it by the hour and it is yours only for that hour. It is bliss and very reasonable. It makes you feel so pampered. The jaccuzzi is huge and place is spotless, soft soothing music is piped in, pretty candles dotted about. Perfect for a girlie afternoon or romantic for couples. A must do if you are staying there. We also treated ourselves to the massage and got a very good rate. Location is ideal as a short walk away to main attractions or jump on a tram. Do get the sight seeing bus as it is a 24 hour ticket so we were able to make use of it the following morning too. The only thing to mar our fantastic weekend was that we booked our taxi via the hotel to take us to the airport for our return journey.

My only complaint regarding the room is the bizarre shower - honestly, it is the strangest thing I have ever seen. I never could get the temperature right. The breakfast offered plenty of choices - meat, cheese, pastry items, juices, cereals, etc. Again, a large buffet for a Eurpoean hotel. If you are not a breakfast person, save some euros and skip this service. It you are a hard core traveller, use the breakfast as a good start to a long day of touring. The #8 tram is just outside the front door and makes a trip into the city so simple and easy. I found the guest services depended on the staff person. Some staff members seemed to be much more helpful than others but they all spoke English. The hotel location is decent. It is on the edge of a boho chic neighborhood which means turn left as you walk out of the hotel and all is fine... turn right as you walk out of the hotel and the neighborhood is not that great.

We had a Junior Suite Room and paid approx. \u00a3250 per night including Continental Breakfast. The room was more than adequate for all of us, although it was a scramble to make breakfact in the morning with only one bathroom.The shower is an experience when you can manage to work out all the functions, best to send the kids in first and then they can explain how it all works.Breakfast was continental and quite limited in choice and was ok, however you can order hot food from the menu at an extra charge. The onsite Spa facilities were fantastic and you can book this for 1 to 2 hours for your own private use (60 Euro for 2 for 1 hour). We bought a 3 day ticket for the tram and metro and found this to be good value. The no. 8 tram stops right outside the hotel and takes 10 minutes to get into the city centre. From there you can reach most of the sites to visit on foot (good pair of walking shoes recommended). Another good way to see the sites is to buy tickets for the tour buses, we bought our tickets from the Hotel(16 Euro for adults / 8 Euro for kids, however i wont recommend this company as we waited from 1/2 an hour to over an hour at the stops on a bus. The best tour buses appeared to be Christian Roma who seemed to have loads of buses on the road. Its best to get on the tour bus from the first day and stay on for the full round trip and then get your bearings as to where all the sites are. The Vatican Museum and Sistine Chapel was the pick of the bunch and i would defy anyone not to be moved by its beauty and colour. Closely followed by the Colloseum which is incredible, i would recommend just strolling around this without any tour guides and letting your imagination do it's own job (and 11 Euro better off in your pocket). We never had to queue any longer than 30 minutes to get in to the major sites, although i can imagine that this would be a very different story in the middle of summer. Weather was sunny and around 60-70 degrees every day and just perfect for site seeing.We found a nice place to eat near the Trevi Fountain called the Suggestum Cafe, food was excellent and good value.

I agree with other reviewers that staff here really stand out--pleasant, eager to help (except for one tall guy, but maybe he was having a bad couple days) and knowledgeable about everything you need to know as a first time or seasoned visitor to Rome. You won't be blown away by the outside of the hotel, but inside the rooms are lovely, quiet, & nicely appointed (I didn't have trouble with the \"Star Trek\" showers, and I'm 6' and not exactly thin. Fiddle with the shower's sauna control and you get your own \"mini-spa\" thing going on). We also made advance reservations for a 30 min. \"conventional\" massage (a little tame by massage standards, but great after a long day walking around) and 30 min. foot reflexology thing in the truly lovely spa and gym area on the basement level. I only got a back massage for my 30 mins., but my traveling companion got front and back for the same time period--might want to specify. Make use of the front desk staff--they pointed us to good restaurants (enjoyed Le Fate for casual dining down the street, and had a truly wonderful meal at Antico Arco, just up the hill in the Giancolo District--make reservations & take a taxi) and helped with all sorts of obscure questions (i.e. \"Where can I buy stamps for a stamp collector in the city?\") For a gorgeous and free view of some of the best parts of the city, climb the steps to the Vittorio Emmanuele monument--\"the wedding cake\"--and budget time to wander around the Campo di Fiori market area. If you have kids on the youngish side make a special trip to the Rome Children's Museum near the Flaminio Metro Stop--one of the best I've seen, and I've seen a few. Definitely pay for a guide to see the Vatican Museum (the lines must have been a half-mile long--scary long)--we had Angel Tours which was fine (maybe a \"6\" on a scale of 1-10)--and worth every penny of the 45 Euros just to skip the line and get a little info. besides. (Our guide was very nice but if she talked about Michelangelo and his \"posse\" one more time I thought I was going to have to intervene.) Eat gnocchi on Thursdays (old Roman tradition) and get coffee beans to take home from Tazzo d'Oro coffee store--they even have branches in the Fiumicino airport. FYI, budget MORE than two hours to catch that internat'l flight home--huge lines and a long way to walk to the gates meant I only had 5 mins. to spend extra Euros and buy all the little gifts I forgot to get before at all the great airport shops.

I've stayed in Austiran / German hotels were the breakfasts included were amazing, champagne, brie, various meats, cheeses and fresh crossants and this one did not compare. The roof top bar / terrace is very nice, drinks are expensive, about $10 US each. They say they serve light fare on the terrace, though I never saw a menu, nor was ever asked. The front desk staff is very nice and helpful with directions. We stayed 6 nights and the maid never changed the sheets. I know because there was a pen mark on my side of the bed on day one and it was there the last day too.

I thought I would share my tips and expereiences with fellow travellers. Arriving from the airport The hotel was easily reached by getting the train to Trastevere and then the number 8 tram or number 3 bus (right outside train station) for a couple of stops. The tram and bus both stop right outside the hotel. On arrival at reception the very helpful and friendly staff gave us a map and marked on the tram and bus routes and the main sites. The staff really are helpful and speak excellent English. The Room We stayed in a twin room on the 5th floor. The room was lovely - good climate control, very comfy beds, fluffy towels, nice big wardrobe with internal lights, little balcony, bar fridge.The only complaint would be lack of storage space - not one drawer in the room which was a little frustrating. The shower is amazing - different settings and steam jets and radio (but not great for any slightly larger persons as it is a tight space!). Tip for the shower - to use the steam jets or radio you need to switch on the swich next to bathroom light. Breakfast There is a massive choice of croissants - all delicious. Try the wholemeal ones - they are yummy! Nice coffee and then the usual bread, toast, cold meats, cheese, cereal and fruit (apples, plums, kiwis and peaches). You can also pay a little extra to get eggs etc. Room Terrace The roof terrace is lovely in an evening - comfy chairs and a little swing seat. Cocktails are very nice and there are lovely views over Rome. Definately worth a visit. Spa The spa is very nice and can be hired out by the hour privately or used in the day along with other guests for about 15 Euros each. There was a deal on in August for two people to hire out the spa for private use for an hour for 30 Euros, normally 50 to 60. A lovely way to relax after a busy day walking around Rome. Getting Around Walking - it takes about 20-30 mins to walk from the hotel to Piazza Navone or the Colleseum and another 5 mins or so for St Peters. You really can walk to all the main sites very easily. - Tram and Buses - The number 8 tram goes from hotel to Argentine - which is very near to Piazza Navone. You can then get the number 62 bus to St Peter's - but it is only 5 - 10 mins walk. The number 3 bus goes from hotel to the Colleseum. I'd recommend a day pass (4 Euro) or a 3 day pass (11 Euro) as this covers all the buses and trams and metro. Transport is very good. What to do We stayed for 5 nights, which was a perfect length to see the sites.and relax a little. My personal recommendations for a 3 day visit would be:- Day 1 - the Vatican Museums (need 2-3 hours). get there early (9am ish) as it closes mid afternoon and there are big queues. About 13 Euros - St Peters (an hour) - free Day 2 - The Forum (1-2 hours) - free - Piazza del Campidoglio and Altare della Patria (the big white monument for Vittoria Emmanuele) this has amazing views over Rome inc Colleseum and the pretty cafe does a lovely salad. - The Palatine if you have time (an extra hour but could spend longer as its very peaceful) - you have to pay but the 12ish Euro price includes entry to the Coloseum and if you go here first it saves you the queue at the Colosseum ticket office!). - Colosseum Day 3 -Castel Sant Angelo (The castle) - 7 Euros - An hour to two hours. try the pretty cafe for a drink (food not great). Fantastic panoramic views od Rome inc bridges and St Peters. -Piazza Navona - sit and have a drink on the square - v expensive but very atmospheric to people watch. The cafes around the little streets are cheaper for food. -Pantheon (free) - half an hour -Trevi Fountain - half an hour In the evening - Campo de Fiori and Piazza Navona are both really nice at night- each 5 mins walk ish from each other. Also see the Trevi Fountain and Pantheon and St Peter's at night. I would NOT recommend the green Rome tour buses - they dont go to many main sites and the commentary on the headsets is ru bbish - very little information, lots of rubbish music and you see much more just walking around. The number 110 red tour bus seems to stop at more sites but we didnt try this so not sure if its any better. I would definately recommend the hotel - it is nice, clean and has lovely staff and its so easy to get everywhere from.

The Trilussa Palace Hotel is one of those hotels where you feel that the staff and management are really proud of what they're offering. Everything from the moment we checked in to our final day of leaving was excellent, the service and knowledge of the staff was amazing, especially Paolo. Location wise, as noted in previous reviews, the hotel is in the Trastevere area of Rome - great for restrauants, but on the other side of the Tiber River. Our favourite was La Fate (only a few blocks down from the hotel), a great recommendation from the hotel, a family run restrauant where food was excellent and the wine was all sourced from the local area. Connections into the main area of Rome (where the majority of tourist sights lie) are easily reachable by either tram or bus (both stop right outside the front of the hotel). No more than a 10 - 15 ride to anywhere (and cheap too \u20ac1 per ride). I was a little concerned about the 'remoteness' of the location of the hotel but after experiencing how easy it is to travel around Rome, the location is definitely not an issue, and definitely a plus if you like to be away from the crowds. The rooms themselves were small but clean and well appointed. Beds were extremely comfortable. The shower we found was a bit over the top with all its nozzles and extra settings but nothing to detract from the whole experience of the stay. Did have a problem with the hot water though, it took a while for things to get hot enough. Overall, I loved this hotel and will definitely come back for a return visit.

Balcony was a big plus. The area is fine, not very scenic except for some views across ugly apartment buildings toward the sights across the river. But it's a short walk up the street to great restaurants of Trastevere, and there is a trolley/train that stops right in front of the hotel which takes you to a major bus hub at Argentina. The front desk staff was hit-and-miss-helpful but sometimes off-putting, as when I stood in front of a guy who was on the phone for several minutes and he never acknowledged my presence, not even eye contact; then when I gave up and went back to room received a call within minutes and he ended up recommending a fantastic restaurant--Hosteria Glass--with pickup and dropoff service by taxi (and the driver refused to take a tip). On a different afternoon, the woman at the desk opened the indoor bar early so I could get a beer to take to my room after a long hot day of walking, and she was very friendly and joking in a good way about American accents. We never saw the rooftop place for drinks/snacks open, though I can't say for sure that we checked during posted hours each night. Also it seemed that even though we had little interaction with the staff, they seemed to know very well when we came and went, as there was always evidence of someone having come into our room to \"tidy up\" when we got back from some excursion. Maybe that is what makes this hotel \"four-star\", I just wasn't expecting it. Overall I would recommend this place, very comfortable, especially the bed, but this was not my first choice and I wouldn't pay the posted rate (found a better rate via internet).

The neighborhood is working-class residential and there were numerous basic shops and low-end restaurants. It was about a 15-20 minute walk into the nicer parts of Rome across the Tiber River. (Ask for good directions, though.) My basic room was small and recently renovated. High-tech light switches and an ethernet outlet next to the small desk. (The hotel advertises WiFi in the rooms, but my room had zero signal, but at least they had the foresight to put in the ethernet cable -- 10 euros per day.) The view from the room was of a courtyard and apartment buildings. The window was small, but it opened, and the light fixtures made the room seem bright and airy. The mini-bar had a very limited selection, but the prices were reasonable. (1.50 euros for a half-litre bottle of water.) The TV had BBC and CNN, but a very small choice of pay-per-view movies. Maybe 20 movies total, with about half in English. The bed, however, was a big disappointment. Two small (*very* small) twin beds set next to each other, each comprised of a 5 inch think (12 centimeters) foam pad on top of a hard plywood base. Not very comfortable and not what you expect in a top rated hotel. The bathroom was small, but they managed to fit in everything, including a bidet. The high-tech shower, however, was another disappointment. It was a fully self-contained steam shower, body massager, and multi-shower unit, with a built in seat. But it was extremely small. You could not sit on the seat without your knees pressing against the glass door. The five different shower settings spit out an unsatisfying combination of water streams pointed in various directions, some intentional and some un-intentional due to poor installation of the fixtures. Other rooms might have better showers, but the shower in room 318 was a disaster! I didn't experience the food, but all the staff I met were friendly and efficient. The lobby area was moderate in size and well lit, but a bit too grandma in style for my tastes. The roof-top terrace was nice -- a great place for a beer and a view of some of Rome's landmarks.

This is a very good, modern, well maintained hotel. A short word on transportation. It really is easiest to get from Fiumicino airport to the hotel by taking the local train and getting off at the Trastevere Station. It costs about half the price of taking the Leonardo Express and you avoid arriving at Roma Termini, Rome's main train station, where the Leonardo Express ends. Roma Termini is across the city from the hotel. Getting off the local at Trastevere Station allows you to ride the No. 8 tram (streetcar) only about 2 stops to get to the hotel. Its tram stop is Plaza Ippolito Nievo, about a half block from the hotel. When you get on the tram, you need only drop a 1 Euro coin in the fare box inside. My problem, however, was that I arrived at Fiumicino about 10 p.m. The stations along the local train route were not lighted, so it was hard to tell in the darkness what station you were at or even see which side of the train to exit on. It all worked out well for me, but had I known how hard it would be, I would have taken the Leonardo Express and caught a cab to the hotel. As noted, the No. 8 tram runs in front of the hotel and takes you into the main part of the city, ending at Largo di Torre Argentina. This tram comes by very often--every 5 minutes or less and so is quite convenient. An alternative is the H bus, which stops about a block from the hotel on the far side of the street and goes to Roma Termini.

The hotel is very easy to find too, just get the bus H from Termini station and get off at Piazza Ippolito Nievo (stop 7), the hotel is about 20metres ahead on the same side of the road. The 3 day, 11euro transport passes are extremely good value for money. Bearing in mind that the city is over 2000 years old and that the many attractions are therefore not beside each other, we found the location to be very convenient. The No. 8 tram stop is just outside the door, and it is 5mins by tram (or 15mins on foot) to Trastevere and 10mins by tram to Torre D'Argentina, where you can get bus 62 or 64 to the Vatican. A 15 minute walk will get you from Torre D'Argentina to the Trevi fountain, Spanish steps or Pantheon in one direction or Piazza Venezia, Colusseum and forum in another and a 5 minute walk in yet another direction gets you to the Piazza Navona.

The hotel itself doesn't have a restaurant, but there is a Chinese restaurant next door and the very pleasant Enotecta \"Orange\" two doors up the road, for snacks, lunch or drinks for the lazy. However, with Trastevere only a 15 minute walk up the road there really isn't an excuse not to venture out for dinner.

Likewise, the benefit of staying in this area, flush with nice restaurants and bars, far outweighs the downsides of not waking up and seeing the Panthenon or the Vatican from your bedroom window.

Small Rooms, but clean, recently (and sumptuously) decorated. Great Bathrooms. Front desk staff - great. Restaurant Staff. OK. Kitchen Staff - dubious! We saw food that had been uneaten and left on tables re-emerging from the kitchen, and put back on the buffet. When we objected to this, the woman who ran the kitchen became screamingly abusive and management gave a shrug and pretended not to talk English. We therefore reccommend: 1. Getting down to breakfast early, because they do NOT order enough pastries, and the other foods get low, so people wanting breakfast after 8.45 - 9.00ish have very little choices. 2. If you don't eat all you take - MASH UP what's left, so they don't put it back on the buffet. This is obviously not a hotel policy, but a kitchen habit. Don't let them do it! It's unhygenic and disgusting. 3. Be aware that your breakfast can include omelette, scrambled or boiled eggs. ASK IF YOU WANT ANY OF THESE - because it won't be offered by the restaurant staff.. However, apart from the rather disgusting kitchen habits, this hotel is good, and we'd stay again - following steps 1, 2 and 3. It's right opposite a Tram stop, so it is easy and fast to catch no 8 Tram to Argentina. From there you can get other places using buses or Trams, or the Taxi Rank. Most places (Trevi, Vatican, Colliseum, Parthenon, Thermal Baths, etc) only ever cost 5 or 6 euros by taxi. For your return you can find a tram or bus stop, and if it lists Aregentina on the board,, get tram back and repeat the process. We also endorse using the restaurant someone else has mentioned - turn right coming out of hotel, walk down on other side of road, then turn left at the bank. It's a pizzeria-restaurant on the left down that road. Ask them to explain the meat courses, or they'll try to fob you off with their lassagne - which is good, but so are many other things. Also, right out of the hotel, walk up a block, past the chinese/pizzeria (oh yes!) and you'll see a gelato bar on your left. It serves really nice food, day and evening. Good prices. One fairly undiscovered \"wonder\" of Rome is the Church of St. Ignatius of Loyola. It's a Trompe L'oeil church! Most of the painting inside was created hundreds of years ago to create a central Dome that doesn't exist and high vaulted ceilings, that aren't !! Absolutely amazing. Even Argentine itself is rathr nice, because the centre of the square is a large sunken garden area, (a drop of about 20 feet) which is railed off, and contains the ruins of 4 ancient temples PLUS scores of cats! It's their official and legal home - unwanted cats are neutered, vaccinated, and fed by a charity, and spend their lives basking in the old temples and on the grass. Only in Rome! BE AWARE that viewing the Sistine chapel is not as simple as it sounds - you cannot just see the chapel - you need to walk through many other galleries and down passageways - at least an hours walking - before you get to the Sistine Chapel. Even in December it was packed, and some of the corridors are narrow, as are some of the stairs, so you get jostled and pushed around all the way. It's not leisurely or peaceful! If you have trouble walking, (arthritic hips for instance) think twice and carry a stout walking stick! Back to the Trilussa Palace - it's opposite another of the wonders of Rome - every Sunday the most enormous Flea Market sets up opposite and it really is worth a visit. It seems to go on for miles. Silk scarves, Gucci Handbags, Brass and Bronze antique cherubs, carriage clocks, handmade Arabic jewellery, horn gramaphones, you name it and you'll find it on offer, and always BARTER! Because it works. To be honest, we'd go back to the Trilussa just to visit this fabulous flea market again - it leaves Cliquancourt in Paris for dead.

Not a Palace. The staff were pleasant enough on check in, and our luggage was carried up to our tiny room. Deluxe? Not sure why, other than having a fancy complicated peculiar jet shower (which we gave up on and used the ordinary one,) and a small balcony which overlooked a sixties style ugly building, not very Roman! Also on check in you are given a free drink voucher for the rooftop terrace. How nice. But when is a free drink not a free drink! We asked for a G&T and a beer. No. You can only have red wine, white wine or a soft drink. How ungracious, If you're gonna offer something do it properly, it would hardly have broken the bank. Breakfast. The air conditioning meant the dining room was freezing, and usually I find hotels too warm. The decor was very nice, lovely table cloths, but all top show as it was a lousy buffet style breakfast, fine if you wanted to fill yourself with sugar. There was nothing warm to eat, the milk to put in the coffee was cold, the croissants were cold even though they were in a heater which they wouldnt switch on. You could order eggs at an extra cost.! The waitress (who didnt serve you) asked our room number every morning although there were only half a dozen people in there, irritating. No robes or slippers provided which were in the description, small details again, and the air con in the room made it uncomfortably cool which the reception seemed unable to fix.

The neighborhood is interesting, definitely quite different than that where the major (and much more expensive) hotels are found. There are all kinds of outdoor markets around, which time did not permit us to explore, but which looked interesting. The one downside is graffiti, which covers the entire neighborhood and really most of Rome. We asked the cab driver whether this stuff was created by gangs and were told it wasn't. Perhaps all Romans consider themselves Michaelangelos. But the graffiti wasn't even good, like some you see in New York City, for example. It uglified what is essentially the most beautiful city in the world (in our opinion). The hotel has a rooftop bar from which you get a stunning view of the city. You can go up there and enjoy the view without buying a drink, if you like. There was a telescope there the night we went up. I don't know if it was a permanent fixture or not.

Although none of the major sights are within easy walking distance (forum was 25 min walk in 37 deg summer heat!) Trastevere is very well connected to the rest of the city by speedy and regular buses and the no. 8 tram. The stops are just 100 yards from the hotel. Also the area is not packed with tourists and felt safe day and night. There are an increasing number of restaurants as you head up Via Trastevere but a great one not far from the hotel is Le Fate \u2013 small and friendly with great tasty food. The Porta Portese market brings Trastevere alive from early on a Sunday morning and is an experience not to miss if your stay allows. The hotel itself is pleasant, very clean with elegant d\u00e9cor. The staff were all helpful and particularly friendly were the bell boy and the waitress on the roof terrace. The roof terrace itself is a real treat \u2013 no famous sights to see just great views of the rooftops of the city and an excellent drinks menu. I booked a twin superior and was expecting a slightly larger room to be honest but it was comfortable enough for a short stay. The shower, with all its different settings, was great, the air-con was good as was the sound-proofing (never heard a fellow guest and could barely hear the shower from the bedroom). Only criticisms are that there is no iron in the room or available from reception so take your own (or be prepared to stump up hotel prices to have it done for you) and lacked in storage - drawers and better hanging space for long skirts/dresses would\u2019ve been good. Had the chance to see a Junior suite and if your budget allows I would recommend stretching to this for the extra space (room for 2 chairs and a table), larger wardrobe and two windows. Breakfast was included and was very good value with a self-service selection of yoghurts, fruit, juices, teas, meats, cheeses, pastries and cake. For a small extra charge you could order omelettes etc. Service (to serve tea, clear tables etc) could\u2019ve been a little speedier but on the other hand I didn\u2019t feel rushed out the door in the morning. The spa was a bit of an indulgence at 40 euros for 2 people for an hour but you do get the place to yourself and it was very relaxing. There\u2019s a large Jacuzzi pool with waterfall, a steam room, sauna and walk-in shower with various settings. There are also loungers to rest on and slippers, bathrobes and water are provided which is a nice touch. I didn\u2019t try the beauty treatments as they were a luxury too far \u2013 rather pricey. On the whole my stay was very pleasant and good value at 150 euros per night bed & breakfast (though I wouldn\u2019t pay more). I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a good location without the bustle of the heart of the city and something a bit more than a basic bed for the night.", "Date": "July 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newark, UK", "Title": "\u201cWould Recommend\u201d", "Author": "SarahNewark", "ReviewID": "UR5478955", "Content": "I would definately recommend this hotel for all the reasons stated by other travellers.

I don't think the chap at reception even said hello, he just looked at us blankly as if to say \"what the hell do you want?\". Not a good start. The deluxe room we payed extra for was small and we could hear all the street noises through our sound proof window, and considering the Roman drivers use their horns every few seconds thinking maybe this would make the lights go green, it was noisy. We had arrived in the evening so instead of going out to look for a place to eat we ate in the hotel. Once again we went down to reception to ask if we needed to book a table but were confrunted with the another miserable employee who couldn't crack a smile. the food in the hotel was expensive and of limited quality. Now this brings me on to the breakfasts. Very poor quality, limited choice and when they say a selection of fresh fruit they mean a fruit bowel with whole apples and oranges. The fruit juice is squash and not very nice squash at that. I have no idea why a 4 star hotel does not serve fresh fruit juice, we payed enough to stay in the hotel. And the breakfast staff looked down their noses at us, once again not cracking a smile. Is it a hotel policy for the staff to be miserable? (although one waiter was very nice to us, happy and polite, but he was the only one). There is a fight for the yoghout's and the staff seem to only bring out the unflavoued ones so you have to ask for something a little more exciting. The chocolate coissants are made with nutella so taste very cheap. Sometimes the waitress's did not even come to our table for 20 minutes, just stood around talking to eachother. We hired the spa one day. Although it was nice it cost about 50 euro's for 1 hour which is far too much. As I said before the deluxe rooms are small and cramped, I can't imagine what the non deluxe rooms are like. The TV has only italian TV stations and the in room entertainment was not working. The turkish bath is far too small to wash your self properly. All in all the staff in the hotel are unhappy and unhelpful and when you ask for some help they do their best to make you feel stupid.

We arrived early in the morning, but our room wasn't ready, so the hotel stored our luggage and we went off to explore. We returned a few hours later to find our room ready. We had a Jr. Suite-well, Jr is correct, it was very small! There was room for a bed, desk and chair, 2 chairs at the end of the room. The armoire for clothes storage was awkwardly placed in the entrance to the room. The bathroom was also small. However, everything was very clean, from the marble bathroom with nice quality towels to the hardwood floors. The shower(as expected) did remind us of the Orgasmatron from the Woody Allen movie \"Sleeper\", but we had fun trying to figure it out. My husband (who is a big guy), had no problem fitting in and showering. The air-conditioning in the room was terrific and the beds and pillows so comfortable. Very important after wandering around very warm Rome. The staff at the front desk was extremely helpful in getting us around the city. We took Tram 8 to \"Tango Argentina\" (as we called it) and from there, could get anywhere in the city. We loved walking around the Trastavere area at night-we ate at a different restaurant every night-all good. We also found great gelato. One night the trams weren't running because of a demonstration and we had to walk back from the bus and it was a great 30 minute walk. We were also catching a cruise from the port of Civitaveccia. We took the tram to the Trastavere station for 5 minutes (instead of having to go all the way to Termini the main train terminal) and then purchased a ticket to the Port for 6 Euros each.

Next we noticed that the walls appeared to be dirty. They were covered with a cloth material, probably expensive, but hard to maintain. There were streaks and marks all over the walls. One area had a large water mark. Overall, it gave the room a rather skeevy feel. It was not clean under the bed and I found a lipstick within easy reach from a previous guest. I had read that this was a fairly new hotel, but our room already needed to be redone. The shower was ridiculously small. If you dropped the soap, you had to open the doors to have enough room to bend down to get it. A shower seat took up most of the room. There were many water jets and I think it was actually meant to be a luxurious shower with the seat and water jet options, but it was so cramped that taking a shower became an extremely frustrating event. I think it's important to note that we are thin people. The bathroom was so narrow, that if one person was at the sink, they had to step out of the room to let the other one by. The size of the shower and bathroom are the main reasons I would not recommend this hotel. We ran out of soap one day and toilet paper another. Once after cleaning the room, they only left one bath towel and one hand towel. We had to keep calling for various supplies, but they did bring them up speedily and with a smile. On a brighter note, the bed and pillows were super comfortable. Three out of the four front desk staff that we met, were very friendly and more than happy to answer all questions and offer any help. The fourth wasn't too happy to help, had a bit of a smirk, and we felt that we were troubling him with the few quick questions we had. Breakfast was okay. No eggs were included, as they were at the other hotels during our trip. The same choice of food was offered every day. The marble cake and some sort of tart did not seem as fresh as they could have been. They offered a nice variety of yogurt flavors, including lemon and coconut. The breakfast room was pretty. The rooftop garden was beautiful and our favorite part of the hotel. You can order drinks there in the evening and they offer a few complimentary hors d'oeuvres. The hotel was located out of the way, yet it was still pretty easy to get to the sights because there is a tram stop directly across the street. A lot of the sights you then have to transfer to a bus, but the hotel was helpful in giving directions and sold tickets for the tram, bus and metro at the front desk. It is close to the great restaurants in the Trastevere neighborhood. After dinner, it was nice to be close to the hotel.

Paid about \u00a3200 a night for a Junior Suite, which included breakfast and an hour in the spa. For this amount of money, I expected an awful lot which the hotel didn't quite deliver. First the good points: Location: Near to excellent, good price restaurants (30 euros for two, four courses, wine, wate & coffee). Near to tram stop and bus routes, excellent to get anywhere. Not too bad to get to Vatican (get there early, before 9, unless you want to queue 4 hours, Pegasus tours, who do Colliseum Tours too, were excellent). Nice and quiet. Sunday flea market across road. Staff: Always helpful, could recommend areas to go to eat and how to get around city. (Didn't know much about how to get to Ciampino however). Spa: Excellent, relaxing, worth the money if you had to pay extra, should be 40 euro per hour for two people if I remember correctly (but see below). Below average (not bad, just not up to expectations): Breakfast: Cheap fruit juice, little choice one day, more choice the next (but stlll not much, felt very budget). Said that they would do drinks other than coffee, but this was never offered. Spa: Booked spa 24 hours in advance, wasn't ready at booked time, Never managed to get Sauna hot in the hour that we had. Shower in spa wasn't warm enough to use. Nice to have the spa to yourself. Rooftop Bar: Said it was open from 5 weather permitting. Went up, but was told it was closed because it was too cold, didn't feel cold to me...but I guess I am from the UK! Shower: Looked good, but electronic controls/radio did not work, so several of the settings weren't much use. Also, turned shower to highest temperature and still was only just warm enough. Shampoo not replaced after first night. Room: Slightly worn in areas (curtain tie-back broken), no instructions with TV, or whether any of the services (internet on TV etc.) were chargeable or not.

If you are looking for a friendly, clean and comfortable hotel then the Trilussa is a perfect option - there are definitely grander 4 star options but the hospitality and extras at the Trilussa (such as the private use sauna and turkish bath room and wonderful roof garden) far outweigh the slightly lackluster outside fa\u00e7ade and lobby area. Location: The hotel is 5 to 10 minutes walk from the central Trastevere area but in our opinion this was perfect (I think to be in the central restaurant area would be pretty noisy). The walk is really pleasant in the evening. Everywhere is so accessible in Rome and with the frequent trams the location is not a problem and we loved walking everywhere anyway. I definitely recommend walking and taking time to soak in the scenery in Rome as much as possible as this is the most wonderful thing about the city. We will really miss sitting outside and watching the world go by! Having walked all over Rome this area would still be my choice of where to stay. The roof garden is such a treasure of this hotel - it\u2019s such a peaceful place to go to after you come back from an evening out. You can look out at local life and Italians sitting out on their balconies enjoying a glass of wine. Rooms: We had a standard double room. The normal size for one of these at the hotel is about 14 sq metre which in my opinion is far too small (we have stayed in many small European rooms but that\u2019s too small) - particularly if you are paying the full price like we were and I don't think for us this would have been acceptable and our overall rating may have gone down a notch. However, I voiced my concern to Eduardo at the hotel a couple of weeks ago and he went out of his way to find us a slightly larger standard room (about 20 sq metre) and so this was fine. I don't think this can be guaranteed but the staff's willingness to go out of their way to make your stay a good one is quite rare. The room was also nicely decorated and very clean and the bathroom was big. Hospitality: The staff were all so friendly and helpful. The lady at breakfast was incredibly welcoming, the staff at reception always willing to help and the bellboy saw us having a nosy round the sauna area on the first day and gave us a lovely enthusiastic, un-salesy tour which persuaded us to book the sauna and turkish bath for an hour in the early evening of our second day - highly recommended, its better than most five star hotels. (I know some don't agree with using saunas etc when in cities like Rome but after lots of walking its so nice to refresh yourselves for the evening and also, you come away with your partner or family to relax and spend time together as well as see the sights). Food: A simple, continental breakfast was 5 euros which we thought was fine. Tips for eating in Trastevere - look out for where the Italians are queuing and go down the side streets away from the squares, also look for restaurants which have fire burning ovens for making their pizzas (everywhere sells the same type of foods but the quality varies enormously). Two wonderful restaurants recommended by locals are: Alle Fratte di Trastevere (on Via di Trastevere, for great oven baked pizzas) and La Tana di Noantri (on Via de Paglia, really good fish and Sardinian dishes). If you are someone for whom the height of luxury is very important - there are other 4 or 5 star hotels in the centre which may be more to your taste. But for a hotel which has charm, great service, has pleasant, clean and attractive rooms and a few lovely added extra facilities this is a great option.

The hotel location is a little out of the way from the main city sites, as it is across the Tiber. However, the tram line stops right in front of the hotel and is a very efficient way to get into the heart of the city. (One comment- there is no need to waste time buying tram tickets- think of the tram as a free service because the Romans certainly do!) The immediate area around the hotel is not particularly attractive, but the Trastevere area close to the Tiber is very interesting and worth the walk. There is a major outdoor market on Saturday mornings that starts across the street from the Trilussa and seems to extend forever, or at least further than I cared to stroll through it. Very interesting to see ordinary Romans shopping. The hotel itself is modern, and the decoration is attractive although a little sparse. The breakfast room is OK, but I wouldn't recommend having dinner at the hotel with the thousands of other more interesting choices just a short walk or tram ride away. My room was small, but well equipped, and the steam shower in the bathroom was a first for me. I think the Trilussa is rated a 3 star, and I would say that is about right in terms of facilities. The best thing about the hotel, in my opinion, is the quality of the staff, particularly the 2 men who work the front desk. They were always helpful and patient, and made the experience really enjoyable. They arranged a very good guided tour for me, recommended good restaurants instead of the usual tourist places one is steered to, helped me understand the public transport system, and several other things, always in a friendly and respectful manner. As one who has experienced his share of arrogant and unhelpful \"service\" workers in Italy, it was very much appreciated.

However, breakfast costs an extra 10 euro per person. Also, if you are in Rome to see the sites, why would you bother with a spa or gym visit? 3. The rooms and bathrooms seem to be brand new and state of the art (check out the high end shower-massage), but the hotel has all the charm of a Best Western. Am I in Rome or Kansas? You wouldn't know it until you stepped outside. Also, there is nowhere to unpack your clothes other than a small closet. Don't get me wrong.

The tram stop is right in front of the hotel, and takes you to Argentina which is close to many of the major Rome sights. Restaurants in Trastevere can't be beat. Just take the tram up the street a few stops, get out right before the Tiber River, and wander around in the back alleys and streets. You'll find numerous restaurants, you can't go wrong. Great food and a non-touristy atmosphere....the grafitti seems to blend in with the buildings after a while and become part of the atmosphere. We had a room in the rear of the hotel, and it was beautifully quiet. The beds are very comfortable. The staff was tremendous, anticipated our needs and accomodated us with special requests (we wanted to watch the NFL playoffs at 2am, they arranged to have the tv in the bar carry the game for us). The breakfasts are great, lots to choose from, and our hostess (I'm sorry, I don't remember her name) always greeted us with a very warm smile. The front desk staff arranged a tour to Pompeii for us, and a car to take us back to the airport, which was a huge help since we were leaving so early in the morning. The bartender (again, don't remember his name) was great, having us try different drinks and always being there with a great smile and great attitude. I think the more nights we stayed there, the more it felt like home. We liked the flea market that happens across the street on Sunday, we liked watching the clean-up after the flea market that much more. Was quite a sight! The hotel is very clean, the housekeeping staff does a great job. Rooms are a bit small by American standards, but by European standards they are superb. Loved the shower!

But its enough to keep you going. (If your not a big breakfast person). Staff in the breakfast room could improve as it took them a time to replace foods that had run out, When asked for hot water for tea they were very slow to respond, So maybe for a 4 star they could brush up in that department. Booked the Jacuzzi, steam/sauna package was very clean well taken care of just lovely all round. All in all a great little gem of a place. Will certainly recommend this hotel without hesitation.

I booked the hotel because of its location which was as good as I expected you just cross the road to your tram stop,Trastevere is a really lovely area and much cheaper to eat and drink in than the real touristy piazzas in the centre. We had beautiful meals in Ivo's which is a great pizzeria on San francesco also on the same street a fantastic Indian called Jaipur a lovely touch in the jaipur a welcome free glass of wine,I can also recommend highly Taverna Delia Sciala on Delia Sciala and finally a couple of doors from the Trilussa a wine bar called L'Orange beautiful food and wine. The Trilussa hotel Has some superb good points great location , a fantastic shower even as has previously been said its not the biggest shower but after a day of non stop sight seeing its something to look forward to, the room is'nt that big but spotlessly cleaned every day and everything changed bed clothes and towels, you have a room safe and the mini bar is really well priced, but I found it frustrating having no drawers in the room so storage is a slight problem, the roof top bar is closed but it has a great view so in the summer would be beautiful,also the movies on tv do'nt work,the brekfast could be alot better even for a continental one the staff were all very helpful especially Andrea who gave us a map and marked all the places we wanted to go and which buses to catch.So all in all we were pleased with the Trilussa and Rome is without a doubt the nicest city I have ever been in, word of warning I wasnt expecting it to be as cold, sunny but very cold so wrap up warm if you're going in the winter months, but we had no long queues for all the sights which made up for the cold ,looking forward to going back already", "Date": "January 13, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bishops Stortford, England", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel and service\u201d", "Author": "MelBBishopsStortford", "ReviewID": "UR4349777", "Content": "My mother-in-law, niece and I stayed at the hotel for 3 days/2 nights in early January.
