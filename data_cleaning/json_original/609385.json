I have to say though during my recent stay the hotel seems to be going downhill. The staff was very unfriendly, and even downright rude. The hotel has taken away some amenities and is charging more for basic necessities. The staff was unwilling to help out with any request. This was very surprising as the staff has been great each time I've stayed in the past.", "Date": "December 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rome, Italy", "Title": "\u201cCheap and clean\u201d", "Author": "ultraviolet77", "ReviewID": "UR118412355", "Content": "Right in the centre, few minutes walking from Zocalo, Azores is a good cheap hotel, with clean rooms and private bathroom.

The hotel is only about two blocks from the Zocalo, so you can easily get to a number of downtown attractions (Zocalo area, Bellas Artes, the Alameda, etc) and the subway. The rooms are clean and have TVs, a closet, and a programmable safe. The hotel restaurant is also decent and pretty inexpensive. There are only two minor downsides to this hotel: a) in the morning it gets kind of noisy, as lots of families with children seem to stay here, and b) after about 9pm the area around the hotel clears out and can get a bit sketchy (though the Zocalo is often still full of people), so I wouldn't recommend wandering back to the hotel too late, at least not with any valuables on hand.", "Date": "March 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cCheap, clean but very noisy!\u201d", "Author": "FizioUK", "ReviewID": "UR52501957", "Content": "This hotel has a very good location. Literally 30 seconds from the Zocalo. It's clean, modern and well runned but the rooms are around a central courtyard that brings all the noise from the hall to the rooms upstairs. We were at the fourth floor but we could hear noise, shoutings and laughings from the hall. Also there is some noise from the roof where some engine (probably fans for the airconditioning) are always on. The room was very clean and each room comes with a security box (very helpful!!). The service was fine, no complains. Apparently the hot water is discontinuous, morning and late evening. But it's not a problem if you are a tourist all day visiting the city and coming back late. About the staff, only one person was able to speak very good english, the others speaking only spanish. We do not reccomand the restaurant, both for breakfast and meals. You can find good other places around Mexico City. In the end we reccomend this hotel to young people that want a cheap but clean hotel for few nights.", "Date": "January 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Henley-on-Thames, England", "Title": "\u201ca dump\u201d", "Author": "Justinevw71", "ReviewID": "UR15067699", "Content": "we arrived at 9pm and despite having a reservation we had to wait 30 mins as they cleaned our room.

We were going to stayed in the Hostel Catedral (of Hostelling International) which is just at the edge of the Zocalo (the main square) but they didn't have a private room available, so my husband strolled down a couple of blocks and stumbled across Hotel Azores. It looks very classy as you walk in; marble floors and walls, a little restaurant, nice reception area, and we were convinced that it would be out of our price-range (as the staff at the hostel had assured us there were no cheap hotels nearby). It turned out that it only cost $29 a night (10 dollars cheaper than a private room at the hostel) and it also had it's own private bathroom. The room and bathroom themselves were quite small, and the TV only showed the local channels, but we weren't there to watch TV anyway! It was clean and comfortable, and although there was no fan or air-conditioning, we really didn't find them necessary anyway, as the room remained at quite a comfortable temperature. There aren't really windows as such, just a large frosted window across one side of the room to allow in some light, and anyway outside there is only a view of the hotel's courtyard. The room could get a little stuffy at times, but just leave the door open for a little bit each time you go in and it's fine. The location is excellent, right in the centre of town with easy access to the metro and taxis all around (but get the hotel to order you a taxi, for security reasons). The staff were friendly, and helped us when we needed it. They were rather relaxed when we checked in and we had to wait about 20 minutes while they prepared the room, but given that we'd just turned up without booking, this was probably to be expected. The restaurant downstairs serves nice food, a variety, and is reasonably priced. The waiters are friendly too. If you're on a budget, I'd recommend this hotel anytime, as it's more comfortable and cheaper than staying in a hostel if you're a couple.", "Date": "September 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cSmall, clean, convenient\u201d", "Author": "viajero5", "ReviewID": "UR7348463", "Content": "The location of the Hotel Azores is great. It is just a short walk from the Zocalo and close to the Allende metro station (as well as the Zocalo metro station). We were able to walk to everything that we wanted to see in the historic district. We stayed in a King bed room and later in a double. Both rooms were fairly small. They were a little bit stuffy but one had a ceiling fan and the other a window to the street so the temperature was fine. The rooms are nothing spectacular but it is a good budget choice (we paid about $26.00 for the double and about 30 for the king). We felt the room was clean and fairly comfortable (but small). We felt safe. THe lobby and common areas are pleasant enough.
