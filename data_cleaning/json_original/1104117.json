My room and bathroom were sparkling clean. My room and bathroom each had a large window which opened up so I could have fresh air which is important in a hotel so the room smells fresh and clean. My room faced out to a courtyard so was very quiet and I slept well. The S-bahn station is across the street which is very convenient and it is only about 15 minutes to the Brandenberg Tor stop. The neighborhood was cute with restaurants, cafes and pastry shops. The supermarket below was perfect for picking up a snack. For people that like to run/walk, there is a wonderful path alongside a river which was about 6 minutes from the Pension. I would highly recommend this place.", "Date": "November 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chapel Hill, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cGreat value and convenience\u201d", "Author": "Bob C", "ReviewID": "UR120756332", "Content": "We stayed three nights. Michael was very helpful and easy going. For e75 we had a large room, good access to the S-Bahn and all of Berlin, and nearby food.

No one could be nicer or more helpful. Hotel is old and three floors up but many of the rooms have been recently (nicely) renovated and ours was great. Certainly roomy enough, especially for a pension. Bed/mattress was new and a refrigerator was included. Completely new bath room, new paint, carpet, and electrical/lighting. There is a small desk. There are a few steps up to the first floor, then a small elevator is useful if you are older or need help with getting luggage upstairs. Breakfast is extra but we had it for 3 mornings. The usual German rolls with coffee or tea, jellies, and a tray of sliced meats and cheese. Good and plenty to eat. It is convenient to the public transit system; a train stop across the street ties into all of Berlin's train, bus lines, and underground system. If you want to get to Tegel by Taxi, it was $23 Euros for us. Also within a few steps is a grocery store (adjacent) and a pharmacy (across the street). There are a few good restaurants within easy walking distance. I highly recommend this hotel.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth", "Title": "\u201cExcellent value in all respects\u201d", "Author": "elmolincoln", "ReviewID": "UR115900758", "Content": "Our room was bright and spacious.

Very close to a city train station (Botanical Garten). Nearby there are many amenities and great places to eat and drink. Despite its green and calm location, however, the hotel is not far away from city center (20 minutes by car, 15 by city train). It is primarily set up for tourist travelers I would say with good facilities and nice rooms to relax, nevertheless also convenient for business people with a desk and internet in the room. The hotel is within a very impressive old building. The reception is tiny with very open minded, friendly & helpful staff. The breakfast room is not the biggest either but the quality of the breakfast was superb. The room was very spacious and very clean with plentiful storage space, the bed was one of the best ever experienced. Bathroom, however, was rather small but also immaculately clean as the rest of the entire hotel.

We love it! It is quiet and comfortable, with the Old World charm that modern hotels lack. All the rooms are different but each is light and airy. Importantly, the Enzian is within easy walking distance of several great restaurants as well as Bus M48, and the S-Bahn stop is literally across the street. Best of all are the breakfasts, served in the hotel's breakfast room by friendly and personable manager Michael, who has native speaker fluency in German, French and English as well as Polish and Russian and no doubt other languages of which I'm unaware. The Enzian is also spotlessly clean. We wouldn't stay anywhere else.

The rates were cheap and for an additional $5 we enjoyed a traditional German breakfast with bottomless coffee or tea in the breakfast room (the patio table is the best). The manager spoke English, Polish, and German quite well and helped our group get taxis, train maps, and printed boarding passes for our group. Since there were refrigerators in some rooms the grocery on the first floor was a handy option for snacks. There are several restaurants, little shops, and bakeries within walking distance.
