I can honestly say I was a little worried about staying here because of the low rates they were offering, to say I was pleasantly surprised is an understatement! I can't thank the staff enough, awesome job! We were continously greeted and asked if we needed anything the entire weekend. Quick check-in and out, the girls at the front desk were very efficient and able to answer all of our questions. Since we were taking the train into the city, they held our luggage till our rooms were ready and on Sunday when we checked out they held our luggage again till evening. Both rooms were nice size, very comfortable beds, and spotless, housekeeping even placed my daughters recently purchased stuffed animal on the corner of the bed so it \"greeted' her when we returned. Phillip and Donte did a great job helping us everytime we were in and out with cabs, luggage, strollers, packages, directions. Both gentlemen were amazing and take customer service to the next level! Due to location we were able to walk to most of the places we were wanting to go and it was just a short cab ride to the Field Museum and Union Station. There are only three negatives I can think to say. One is the free bottled water is one per room and we had two adults and a child in each room, the second one is, one room we had was a king room with the fold out couch and there wasn't an extra blanket in the room, the third being the hot tub temperature was too hot to enjoy.

My experience is based off of business travel so although the location was great, I booked the room for the added perks of breakfast and internet included in my room rate through my corporate travel company. I traveled with a colleague and her booking was supposed to be exactly the same as mine. When we checked \u00e2\u20ac\u201cin, my reservation did not include the breakfast and my fellow traveler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reservation did. When I inquired with the Front Desk Supervisor, she offered no explanation other than, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153you have different room types\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. I asked her the price difference with the thought that if it a reasonable amount, I would just pay the extra fee and not worry about it. But she refused to even tell me the amount. She refused to acknowledge the issue I was facing and told me that I had to speak to the Sales Manager in the morning at 9 AM. I was there for business so obviously settling an issue the following morning regarding breakfast was not appropriate. At this point, I was not so concerned with my reservation booking or issue with breakfast; I was concerned with the demeanor of the Front Desk Supervisor. I immediately called American Express Travel and had them deal with the situation on my behalf. The following morning, AMEX was able to get my issue resolved and left me a voice message explaining that I could pick up my vouchers for breakfast at the front desk. When I arrived at the front desk after working the entire day, I was told by the same Front Desk Manager that she had no idea what I was referring to. I literally had to play the voice message that was left to me by the AMEX travel agent in order for her to simply take keys out of her pocket and hand me some generic cards for breakfast. All this fuss and she had the power to make the decision from the very beginning. My entire experience at this hotel was marred by the surly attitude of this desk manager. I will never stay here again due to the poor customer service I received. If this the type of service a Manager gives I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m afraid of what a regular associate is trained to give.

It's not brand new, but it's not old, either. It's located on Rush Street, one block from the middle of Michigan Avenue. While not the most luxurious hotel, this Four Points Sheraton is a very clean, convenient option with friendly service. The Pros: - Location. Close to all restaurants, shopping, museums and attractions. You can walk to most anything from here in a reasonable amount of time. Also, on the same block, there's a Starbucks and a Trader Joe's (quality food, great wine, low, low prices). - Close to a subway station. Coming from either O'Hare or Midway, you'll have to change trains at some point (either from the Blue or Orange line to the Red line). Once on the Red line, the hotel is about 3-4 blocks of walking distance from the Grand Red line station. - Rooms are large, clean and the beds are comfortable. Usually you can tell the wear and tear in a room first in the bathroom - grout, tile and fixtures usually take quite a beating. But in this hotel, they have managed to keep everything in tip top shape. You also will have a microwave and small refrigerator - save some money by buying snacks, water and wine at Trader Joe's! - Hotel size - it's not that big. So you can conveniently get up and down the elevators quickly, and in and out of the hotel without crowds. - Value - You can get some incredible prices at this location, especially on off weekends when there isn't a big event in town. I paid $106 a night over New Year's weekend. The Cons: - As mentioned, this isn't a luxury hotel. Furnishings are simple and modest. But they aren't worn and ugly, either. There aren't a lot of services in the hotel, no restaurant (but plenty nearby) - WiFi was a challenge on my Apple devices. I had to spend quite a bit of time on the phone with customer service to connect my devices. They admitted that they aren't configured to easily connect to iPads, iPhones and Macs. So this was kind of a pain, but we figured out a very manual fix. The bonus is that WiFi at Four Points Sheraton is FREE! - This isn't a hotel with any views. I had a view of a white wall to the condo tower next door. Overall, it you're just looking for a nice, clean place to sleep and store your stuff while you explore this great city, this is definitely an option you should consider.

We were left to sleep in bliss on their comfortable beds for each of the four nights we were there, until the morning we were to depart. At 7:30 in the morning(!) we have housekeeping knocking on the door. A warning: Put the DO NOT DISTURB sign on your door the last day you're here. We acquired a do not disturb sign and put it on the door. It must have fallen off because 45 minutes later we have a rather rude housekeeper banging again, \"You ARE leaving today, right?\" Parking is a mixed bag - the lot is attached to the hotel and is uber-expensive ($50 a night) but you have in and out, so if you're going to use the car, it may end up being a bargain. Otherwise, I highly recommend checking http://chicago.bestparking.com/ for lots that are a block or two away if you're leaving the car untouched for more than 24 hours.", "Date": "September 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat price for a nice hotel!\u201d", "Author": "1970amy1970", "ReviewID": "UR118212188", "Content": "When we walked in the reception area was a bit cold....personality not weather....but once we checked in we were treated very nicely.

Upon check-in, we received a $13 gift card for Eleven, a cafe around the corner. Although we ate breakfast at the Grand Luxe Cafe (yuM!), did stop in the cafe and grabbed a dozen bagels for the road. Had it not been for the GLC being so close and too good to pass up, we would have grabbed a nice breakfast at Eleven w/ the gift card. Also, there is an indoor pool, although my group didn't take advantage of this, it is a nice amenity. I received a special corporate rate for the hotel, so we paid $149 for the room plus $40 for each car (we had 3 cars total). There is a parking garage attached to the hotel, which is very convenient. I just saw a Travel Zoo special for this hotel today for select dates @ $119/night or $140/night with parking. I feel like there are a lot of good deals to be had. Will definitely consider this hotel again for my next stay in Chicago. Can't be the location, and the atmosphere is quite nice. Staff great too.

I booked a weekend trip to Four Points by Sheraton Chicago Downtown on North Rush Street. It is a great location, but there are many hotels in the area. When looking to book, I called to ask about the use 1000 Star points and get \u00c2\u00bd off. I was booking for 2 nights and the going rate online was around $189 per night at this hotel. When I called, I was told it would be less than $180, and I even asked to clarify if that was both nights, and confirmed it was. I also questioned that it was only 1000 points, and told that it was. I was very excited, and my friend and I booked our flights later that week. Had I been told the hotel would be $177.50+tax PER NIGHT, we would not have booked flights. I went back through my spam filter and did find a confirmation email, and at the very bottom it says $177.50 per night, and shame on me for trusting a person and not reading my email. I think it is very misleading when discussing travel to not quote the total. I called the SPG customer service line after we got the bill from the hotel to discuss this, and was told it would be researched and I would be called back within 72hours. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been 4 days, and no one has called me back. I would have at least appreciated a call back that my concerns had been heard. During our stay, we had MANY issues. We got to the hotel before noon, and our room wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ready, as I expected. We checked our bags and got 5 claim tickets. When we returned to the hotel in the afternoon to check in, I counted the 5 tickets and handed them over. We were brought some but not all. We eventually got all, but the clerk claimed I had only handed him 4 tickets. I insisted, and he did go and came back with the 5th (a laptop bag), but did not even hint at apologizing for the hassle. We got up to the room, and went out for the night. When we got back, my friend jumped in the shower and came back out saying it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t drain. I also took a shower without it draining, and I attempted to flush the toilet, which would not flush. We called down and they sent a man up to the room at around 12:30am. When I opened the door, he asked if I was going to plunge the toilet, and was annoyed when I said no. He wasn't able to do the shower. In the morning, the toilet was still iffy, so we used the lobby bathroom and told the front desk on our way out. When we came back that night, the drain was put back and the shower worked, so we knew someone had been there and assumed all was fixed. My friend got up in the night, and without using the toilet attempted to flush it and it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. She went to the lobby in her pajamas. I went back to the front desk in the morning, and we were checking out. I expressed my frustration to the front desk that we had to come down to the lobby bathroom, and she only questioned why I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t call them back up again in the middle of the night. No apologies. I had spent over 30 minutes on the phone about the billing already that morning, so it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t surprising to me that there was no customer care. I left the hotel at the point of tears I was so frustrated. We had a great time in Chicago, but this was a horrible hotel. And certainly not worth $400 for 2 nights. We went over to the Hyatt for 3 nights for business. We blew the fuse to our room having two hair dryers going at the same time, which was our fault. They sent a friendly man up immediately that corrected the problem. The front desk called to check with 30 minutes to make sure we were taken care of. They also sent an apology letter with a coupon for a free bakery item, free parking or drink in the hotel, which was completely above and beyond as the issue was our fault. The entire experience at the hotel was great. Friendly service, friendly people, and for about the same price as the Four Points. Our toilet even worked in the room without the embarrassment of walking into the lobby in pajamas. There are other options, and I would check those out.", "Date": "July 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario, Canada", "Title": "\u201cgirls weekend! we'll be back!\u201d", "Author": "Ontario_Canada_11", "ReviewID": "UR115573787", "Content": "We had a wonderful stay.

Vegas was on the radar, as well as other places, or just staying home. The wonderful folks here did not disappoint! Originally booked my flight to arrive late on a Friday night and, knowing how the hotel might be busy then, I emailed Mary Orlando (the hotel's GM who often interacts with TA guests) to alert. Also as I was staying for 4 nights, I wanted to see if a king-bed room on a higher floor (quieter) might be available...if not, I totally understand during a holiday weekend. Mary was very gracious and gave me a wonderful room beyond my expectations; the late checkin was moot as my airline opened up earlier flights the day before. New info about the rooms: this hotel truly thinks about everything logistically regarding guests' comfort in an uncomplicated way -- and it's not just an advertising saying. Yes the fridge, microwave, and free water are really great touches. But even how the proximity of the wall plugs and the way they're pointed (for a guest with multiple electronic devices like cell phone, computer, camera charger etc) you can tell has been thought out to every last detail (I just stayed in a 4-star hotel a couple weeks ago and no plugs were available by the bed). Regarding everything else, the bed was exceptionally comfy (while I was there, beds were being replaced, which says how serious the hotel is about keeping the extra comfort that way). The bathroom was well-appointed, the shower had great pressure (again, there's that comfort theme in reality). Loved the great in-room wifi and also the biz center (for printer boarding passes, restaurant info, transit schedules). My other review details my love for this great hotel, I dunno what more I can say! As far as the staff, on a scale from 1 to 10, they're probably approaching the \"20\" mark, let's put it that way. Ms. Orlando, i really appreciate your extra and gracious efforts in assuring that I'd have a comfy room even if I checked in late on a holiday weekend -- thank you so much. When I bumped into the \"Amazing Phillip,\" the hotel's long-time doorman who is known for his extraordinary efforts on behalf of guests, he was so gracious. I was just saying \"hey\" as I had met him in 2010 and he asked if I had written a really nice TA review that mentioned him by name -- and he expressed his appreciation (Phillip, trust me, I think when people do good or great as in your case, I think we sometimes take that for granted and don't praise enough). The front desk deserves accolades as well. Just very pleasant, very friendly (I observed some fellow guests who weren't so pleasant and the front desk folks were so gracious). Also very responsive -- I noticed a young child (maybe 10 years old) unsupervised in the biz center and alerted them and they immediately took action. My only \"glitch\" occurred because my neighboring guests decided that, once bar time ended, karaoke time could begin at 430 a.m. As someone who hates to call the front desk and complain about frivolous things, I did call (couldnt sleep) and Jeremy had things taken care of within 5 minutes. Kudos Jeremy! And finally, three words: location, location, location (I mean, what's not in a 2-3-block radius?!). It cannot be beat for any traveler type regarding Chicago. You will never go wrong staying at this wonderful hotel.

The lobby is super small and always packed every time you walk through it. And the ladies at the front desk are short of polite. The only person who went above and beyond like most Four Points was Dante, the bell hop. He was exceptional. The rest of the staff could use a lesson from him. He literally ran down the street to fetch our large group a van taxi and didn't stop until he found it. Fantastic and polite gentleman. I booked the room via Hotels.com so I knew I wasn't going to see any SPG rewards on the stay but asked the ladies at the front desk if I could add my member card # irregardless for ammenities / parking expenses to earn points and it just seemed like such a hassle to them that they didn't even bother. Parking = $40/day. Yikes. But I guess that is pretty average. Would stay at again if I was in Chicago but not if I wanted to impress anyone exceptionally or expect to see Four Points type style/class. Free WiFi. No mini bars in room. Free bottles of water each day (2). Workout facility/pool onsite. Hope this helps.

A big bonus - there's a Trader Joe's grocery store in the ground floor of the hotel, a great place to pick up snacks and drinks. (My room came equipped with a fridge and microwave; if I hadn't been there for a conference, I could've eaten very cheaply and relatively healthfully if needed.) The staff members that handled our conference meals and gatherings were attentive and professional. Only small negative, the downstairs lobby is small and tends to be crowded and noisy. (I was able to check in quickly, though.) Also, the elevators are slow; my advice: if you're fit, get a low floor and find the stairs. They're carpeted, and accessible with a key card, so I felt safe.

We drove to Chicago but did not utilize their parking which was $40/day. Instead, I used Park Whiz to find a spot for the weekend that was a 10-15 min. walk from the hotel and it worked out perfectly. On our arrival, it was pouring rain. We decided to drop off our luggage at the hotel before we parked the car for the weekend. The staff was very accommodating and allowed us to park outside the hotel to check in and drop off the luggage. We checked in around noon and were assigned a room on the 6th floor. It was a very quiet floor, never heard a peep during the night. We had a king sized bed which was comfortable but the pillows were horribly flat. They could definitely improve on the quality of pillows. The location of the Four Points was fantastic. Very close to most tourist attractions - a 10-15 minute walk from Millenium Park and one street away from the Mag. Mile. It was also close to the subway and bus lines which made it a great home base for exploring the city. As mentioned in previous reviews, the Trader Joe's attached to the hotel was a great spot for picking up a few snacks, breakfast food and beer/wine. The free wifi was a bit inconsistent. We had problems logging in on the first night. A call to front desk produced an explanation that they had been having issues with it all day. The speed of the wifi also wasn't great but it was good enough to check a few emails from our room which was convenient. We used the hot tub and pool area and although not luxurious by any means, it was still nice to have a soak after a long day of walking. Our room included a small fridge and microwave which was good for storing a few cold drinks. The Four Points also offers one small complimentary bottle of water which was appreciated but we wished we could have had 2 bottles of water (one per person). We also liked that this hotel was 100% smoke free.

Perfect Chicago Hotel in Perfect Location and with Guests' Comfort in Mind\u201d", "Author": "FairmindedTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR100727298", "Content": "This is a belated but very well-deserved review. If you are looking at this hotel as a potential first-time guest, the breakdown (as of today) of the 300+ reviews says all you need to know -- 265 of 301 reviews give the top two ratings and only 12 of 301 give the bottom two dissatisfied ratings. That is unheard of in ANY business..heck if a fastfood restaurant were rated similarly by its customers, I bet more than 12 of 301 would be upset that their double-cheeseburgers didn't have pretty wrapping paper or arrive on fine china or had too many pickles or something like that. Another comforting factor (to you potential guests) is how hotel management graciously responds to and welcomes TripAdvisor feedback -- obviously they really care and it shows! I had a wonderful stay all the way around. Booked the hotel through a 3rd-party discount site which is technically opaque (you learn of the exact hotel after paying), but I'm one of \"those\" savvy travelers who can narrow down to within an 80-90% chance of what hotel I will receive (Priceline, Hotwire). When I knew I was likely to get the Sheraton Four Points, I jumped at the chance. The trip was part of my 2nd-ever venture to Chicago and 1st-ever trip to Wrigley Field (Opening Day no less!). Check-in was a breeze, got a room with two beds (convention/event had booked up all the one-bed rooms) on a higher-floor with some quiet as i requested, which was fine as I was traveling alone. Well-appointed room, nicer than most 3-star hotels -- extremely comfy beds (that's what you're there for, right), new flatscreen TV, microwave/refrigerator, complimentary bottled water, free highspeed internet (wired worked constantly and very fast -- wireless didn't work for me but no biggie as downtown concrete buildings can have occasional blind spots), and a very roomy (especially by Chicago standards) room. Further, the hotel's in a perfect location near lots of shopping and eateries near the Mag Mile, near transportation options (Chicago's bus system is exceptional, don't just do the subway/L), has an indoor pool/hottub in an enclosed courtyard (perfect if so-so weather and also private to the hotel) and a complimentary business center (great for travel adjustments, boarding passes, or web-browsing if you didn't bring a computer). From a customer-service standpoint, the staff from front desk/lobby to housekeeping all genuinely seemed to really care about guests and seemed to like each other and their jobs (always a pleasant and genuine \"hello\" or \"do you need anything\" in passing). I met the infamous Phillip, the doorman that everyone raved about in reviews, and true to form, he was going \"the extra mile\" for a guest when I said hello. If you're considering this hotel vs. others, ask yourself what's important to you -- to me, it's exceptional comfort, customer service, and many convenient free amenities in a tremendous location with a small-hotel feel. Personally, having stayed at the Intercontinental (a wonderful stay) and having the opportunity to stay at the Hyatt Regency or Palmer House Hilton for my next stay, I was like Pavlovs Dog to jump at the opportunity to again stay at my first and only Chicago choice, the Four Points Sheraton Magnificent Mile, in late April 2011. (Vegas was on the radar for the same dates, but Chicago at this hotel was the deciding factor!) In fact, when I knew that through my um \"magical\" travel-booking powers it would be possible, I changed my flight so I could spend 4 nights (instead of 3) at this absolutely wonderful hotel.

Anything over $100 would be too much for me, based on the pros/cons here and other options along Michigan Ave. Front desk staff missed my early wakeup call one morning, which is normally a death blow for me and hotels. But the manager quickly contacted me that morning, apologized and offered a Starwood points bonus to compensate. I appreciated the gift, and the manager's effort.

TV is amazing; there is also an empty fridge which is convenient for baby food and drinks. 2) staff: although clearly under economic pressure, they are all very polite and try to help most of the time. 3) location: simply amazing. Lots of shopping and restaurants around. We had several meals at California Pizza Kitchen and also Silver Spoon, both just outside the hotel. The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own Japanese restaurant is quite nice as well but a tad more expensive. 4) the gym is good says the husband. 5) There is a washing machine and a drier on 8th floor ($1 each). 6) we were allowed to checkout slightly later and it was really helpful. **** The bad points: 1) Breakfast: There was no indication, at the time I booked (\"best rate with breakfast\"), that breakfast was not onsite. This hotel does not have its own breakfast room. They just give you a mean $10 voucher per person to go to a local deli. We complained to the manager that this web practice was border illegal. 2) Pool: The pool is terribly cold and they use far too much bleach. The jacuzzi (as they call it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the Spa\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) is shabby. 3) Room: On arrival they first tried to allocate us a horrible room on 8th floor and we asked to change. I am glad we did. Then we had to call to get many basic things: robes, towels, proper glasses, sheets for the sofa, water bottles, hangers, and so on. Windows are not sound proof and the noise from outside is a problem. The air conditioning is too old - working well but quite noisy. Furniture falls into pieces (the front bit of the desk). Carpets are disgusting. My son walked 10 minutes in the room, and his socks had turned black. The room was never done before 1:00pm. It was really annoying. Room service should accommodate the guests needs, not the contrary. The room was never replenished \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we had to phone every single day to get new toiletries, coffee, water etc. What a hassle.

Ironically my cab dropped me at the Sheraton Chicago Towers before this place, but realised they had not taken me to the Four Points. What a shame that that mistake was realised byt he cab driver (as I had got to the lobby of the Sheraton Chicago Towers and that looked one hell of a lot better). My room was very plain indeed, and had that distinct feeling of uncleanliness. Nylon duvet cover and lying in bed I got that kind of itchy feeling you get from a bed that isn't really clean. Air conditioner in my room was the size of a fridge and unsurprisingly was really noisy throughout the night. Came down for breakfast to find out hotel doen't have a breakfast room, but shows guests through to a very poor diner immediately next door. My friends travelling with me had cooked breakfast which was greasy and even made me feel ill (and I wasn't eating it).

Taking a walk down the corridors is not a walk that fills you with optimism about the room waiting for you at the other end. I simply can't believe the other reviews for this hotel, I've stayed in many places, good and bad and I certainly know which end of the scale this one is. I was travelling with 3 other colleagues and they all had a similar view - breakfast the following morning was one of shared hoorro stories. Paying $275 for the privelege (without breakfast) is unbelievable. I can get a very nice hotel room in practically any city in the world for that, and the ugly and distinctly grubby room and public areas in this hotel do not warrant that kind of money.", "Date": "July 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nashville, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location and Great Service\u201d", "Author": "thoakley", "ReviewID": "UR72928959", "Content": "The location is great.

Jenise at the front desk was so very personable and suggested Grand Lux for our lunch - we were not disappointed in that choice! She also offered us maps and explained the ammenities in the hotel. Every time we came back to the hotel during our stay, we were greeted with a friendly hello and asked how our day was. We purchased tickets for the Architectural boat tour right at the front desk, and were also given a coupon for $10 off at Dos Diablos, which is a great Mexican restaurant nearby. The room was very clean, and when we called to request extra towels and pillows, they arrived in less than 10 minutes. As many have said, the location of the hotel could not be better. We were a nice walk or a short cab ride from everywhere we wanted to go. I am sure there are fancier hotels, but for a girls' trip to Chicago, this place fit the bill perfectly.

From the moment you walk in you are made to feel special. We were welcomed by a very informative and friendly member of staff at front desk and provided with maps and local area information. Our room was located on the top floor; which required a room key to access; making our room feel much more secure. The room was huge and the bathroom was again a very comfortable size. Free bottles of water were provided on a daily basis, along with a daily maid service and coffee (Seattle's Best brand) again offered daily. Towels / Bedding could be changed daily unless you chose not to. The TV had all the major channels you would expect; though during our trip the weather channel was the main one watched. The beds very large and very comfortable - offering a great nights sleep. Oddly enough the one thing missing from the room that I did expect was a safe to keep our valuables in. There was an ethernet connection; and free high speed wireless internet avaliable, and my iPad had no issues connecting to it. In addition there was a business center that allowed me to print my boarding cards for the return journey, very useful. The swimming pool on the 4th floor was not the biggest but perfect for a quick cool down after a busy day before heading out at night, and the whirlpool provided extra relaxation. The pool was open until 10pm daily, so plenty of time to use it. There was also an outside sun deck, and a gym - we didn't use these, but it was a nice extra to have. On exit and entry, unless a member of staff was busy assisting a customer we were always greeted, and the doorman was additionally helpful in informing us of taxi prices and storing our luggage on the last day. The hotel was one block from the mile, and two from a red line station; making it a very good place to use as a base as the red line is 24 hours. The Loop was a 15 minute walk, or a 5 minute red line trip. Overall this hotel is beyond fantastic in my opinion and I would not hesitate to return.

We booked a room with two double beds and realized it also included a pull-out sofa, so there are actually 3 beds. The hotel has the entire 8th (top) floor set aside for Starwood Preferred Guest members. Rooms are plain but spacious and clean, and include family friendly features: small refrigerator, microwave, and coffee maker for mom and dad. Included in your room rate is free wireless internet (and wired, too \u00e2\u20ac\u201c though the wire in our room was frayed and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to work), and 2 free bottled waters every day (hang tags around the bottle necks said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s water.

There is an outdoor terrace adjacent to the pool area (not so useful in January, though I saw a few smokers out there). Also in that same area is the gym (didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get to use but saw treadmills, bikes, and some weights), as well as a lounge area with flat screen TV, and rest rooms (nice to have near the pool area). We had a great Travelzoo rate that included parking, but noticed that overnight parking at $38 does seem to be a bit less than some other downtown hotels where we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed. Parking access is right in the building, which is very convenient. Saw other reviews that said there were no restaurants nearby but we saw at least 3 right on the same block without even really looking: sushi and breakfast/lunch place both accessible through the hotel, and a Mexican place we could see out our window. Everyone we ran into on staff is personable and helpful . Most notable was Philip, at the front door, who offered helpful sightseeing tips and other information, and general cheer all weekend.

We were happy with our choice and would stay there again. To be clear, if you are looking for luxury or a trendy spot, this is not the place for you. The Four Points is a simple, functional kind of place. The room was clean and crisp, with a mini refrigerator (no mini bar), a microwave and a coffee maker, which was really great to have. The TV was old-fashioned (not flat screen), but worked fine, and the hotel offered about 30 stations (including two HBOs). The bed was comfortable, and the furnishings (easy chair, desk, desk chair) were functional and in pretty good shape. The bathroom was clean. The heat came from a heat/AC unit by the window, but it worked great. Another great feature was free wired and wireless Internet. (Although, to be honest, I couldn't get the wireless to work on my old iPod Touch, but I didn't try that hard, nor did I seek technical support.)

We also didn't eat at the hotel (breakfast was served from 7-10, and it was not included in our rate), nor did we order from room service. When we checked in, we requested non-feather pillows, and someone from housekeeping was in our room with the new pillows in less than five minutes. Probably the fastest service we've ever gotten from a hotel. The location is very good (if you are seeking a Miracle Mile stay). The hotel is a block from N. Michigan Avenue, and it was only a four-block walk to the subway (red line). Even in the harsh cold, we were able to walk to the Art Institute and the Oriental Theater, both south of the river.

I had researched many of the hotels in the city and preferred to be near Mag Mile shops and especially walking distance to American Girl store. When my husband and I travel we prefer the higher end locations with nice decor and outstanding service and amenities. This time my main concern was location and a reasonable rate. The Four Points was a pleasant surprise and all the reviews about great customer service are true. The concierge/doorman (Darron) was so outgoing and friendly and really made us feel welcome and at home. We got to know him as we went on our adventures every day. Not like some other hotels where they make you feel like you're a bother. The foyer was very nicely decorated with Chahuly (sp) prints and glass art around, and the kids were thrilled to find a candy dish that was stocked regularly while we were there. They also had an American Girl doll on display with a drawing for a free doll or discount of some kind. The parking garage (attached) was tight to get into with our Yukon, but once inside was fine. I think it was $38/night for guests. Inside the parking elevator to the hotel, it was nice to find complimentary coffee made. Also, there is a Trader Joe's and Starbuck's, not off the lobby, but inside the same building on the next corner over. There's plenty of Chicago deep dish pizza in walking distance for even little legs. (Pizzaria Due is across the street, Gino's East on Superior just up Michigan, and our favorite, Giordano's up the street on Rush & Superior.) For finer dining there's the Laury's steak house right across the street as well. For shopping you are literally 1 block off Michigan Avenue, so shop till you drop! This hotel while maybe not that impressive by the pictures, and being an 8-story building instead of a skyscraper, is still perfect for a quick weekend with the kids. I was so glad we didn't pay for the Park Hyatt, or Drake because we really had everything we needed without the stuffy attitudes. They have an indoor pool (a little chilly) and elevated hot tub, and also have a nice/small workout room with individual TV screens in front of each machine with fresh earpeice covers and free bottled water. Regarding the room, we booked a Queen/Queen room and it ended up having a sofa sleeper also in the room which was unexpected. If you need that you should probably request to be sure you get it. I was left regretting I didn't invite my mom to go with us! The room is a little tight like most hotel rooms, but we were not in the room that much, only to drop off our goodies. They have an MP3 speaker player for iPods, a hard wire internet connection/port, and mini frig, microwave and coffee maker. It was nice to have the frig for leftover pizza! Bathroom was nothing fancy but clean and adequate. Pictures were tasteful and pillows were quite comfy. The bed was a little firm for me but my husband loved it. The staff was great, and when my husband went down to the desk to request more towels, they said to please not worry about a thing and in the future just call down and they would send up whatever we needed. It seems they have a great training program regarding customer service, because every time you passed anyone in the hotel that worked there, they stopped what they were doing, looked you in the eye and said hello or even started a conversation. Great mid-western friendly feel! As you can tell we highly recommend 4 Points!

We paid extra for the American Girl package and I have to tell you the girls LOVED it! When we arrived the check-in went pretty smoothly (except we had booked 3 rooms over the phone and only 2 were waiting for us...they quickly got us a 3rd room for the same price and fairly close to the other 2), the bellman was very helpful. The girls were thrilled to get in our room with the GIGANTIC chocolate chip cookies and milk. The cookies were the best I've ever tasted! The girls also each got a pink fold up foam bed for their dolls It turns into a bed or folds into a chair). I was actually rather impressed. We had originally only been able to get 2 American Girl packages, but as soon as we got there we paid extra for a 3rd one. The beds were authentic American Girl brand and came with a cute blanket. We had a hard time finding the American Girl movie on the TV, but finally figured out that the channel they told us was the wrong one (the people at the front desk had no idea what the channel was either). Since we had 3 rooms, I'll just explain the one I stayed in. We had 2 large beds and a pullout couch. I had my 3 girls and we all fit very comfortably! There was a great view from our room, the room was very clean and pleasant. We got our rooms (with the American Girl Doll package) for less than $150/night. The pool was nice, but not very deep or large...however my girls LOVED it! There was a very nice exercise room and a hot tub. The area around the pool was pretty large. The bellman was able to tell us directions, hail us cabs (there were 10 of us total and he didn't miss a beat finding something big enough for everyone) and help us with all of our many bags. The lobby was really rather nice and I found the rooms, hallways and all the other areas to be updated (I'm not sure why another reviewer who was there at the same time would think it was outdated...it wasn't). We did have breakfast at the hotel for one morning. I wasn't terribly impressed with the breakfast, but it worked well since it was so close to our room. They had cereal, muffins, eggs, sausage and waffle makers (which is what my girls loved). I would definetly stay at this hotel again with my family.

There was brown scum in the bubbles. Never went more than once because of this. Also, no change room by the pool. * The front desk did not want to be there, and it showed. I felt like such an inconvenience whenever I asked a question. * Location: I actually prefer to stay in the Loop area. Magnificent Mile area is too busy and over-priced. We wanted a deep dish pizza one night on the weekend, and every deep dish restaurant had a line outside. Didn't have this problem in the Loop area. And note to shoppers - there is more variety and better deals at stores in the Loop area (e.g. Macy's on State St. is better than Macy's at Magnificant Mile; Filene's Basement on State St. is much better than the one on Magnificent Mile, and same with Nordstrom and Marshalls on State St.) * Too many families with kids & strollers staying at this hotel for my liking. This might explain the pee smell on our sofa. There were some positive points to this hotel: * Value. Paid only $800 Canadian for a package deal consisting of four nights at this hotel (over Easter Weekend) and round trip flights from Toronto (for two people). * The Bellmen were extremely nice, unlike the desk workers. * The rooms were quite spacious. I think we may have been upgraded without requesting it. * The business center came in handy, as we needed to print something. * There is free coffee on the 3rd floor. * The hotel did keep our luggage in storage, since our flight was many hours after our check-out time. * I did like the smell of apple cider in the lobby, as noted by a previous review.

My wife and I had booked the Four Points with the $100/night deal and $1/night parking. Due to an illness we almost had to postpone the trip. Long story short, we made it to the hotel for our first night close to midnight. Our check in was great and we were upgraded since they had sold out of the room we booked. Due to our late arrival, we wanted to extend our stay 1 night to fit everything in we wanted to do (Auto Show, shopping, and restaurant/bar hopping). We were informed the hotel was sold out for that night and we should call back to see if anyone cancels. Sure enough, someone must have cancelled but they said it would be over $200/night for our suite we were upgraded to on our arrival. I told them thanks but no thanks and was surprised to have them say we could keep our room for the extra night (Sat. night no less) for the $100/night deal we had originally booked!! Our 4 night stay was fabulous and the staff remembered us every time we came back from shopping, eating, etc...all of which are close. We were ready to leave impressed with the service from the maids (who brought new complementary bottled waters every morning) to the doorman. Well, we hit a snag when our car's battery died and thought we would have to call AAA to get us started. We told the front desk who immediately said they had an extra set of jumper cables if we could find a good samaritan. That good samaritan happened to be the doorman who came out with the jumper cables and jumped it with his personal car!! Now that is what I call service!! On top of everything they gave us free parking for the entire stay. Yeah, its 4 bucks with our deal, but it's this kind of thing that really makes a difference. Even though you are not staying at a 4-star hotel, you are getting 4-star service, which some of the best hotels in the area can't say.

They said that his room would be a Jr. suite of some sort. Having his wife, 3 yr old son, and a baby sitting niece travelling with him, he agreed to the price. Upon my arrival at the Hotel, we were greeted by the doorman and bell hop. Very, very courteous! The staff behind the counter checking us in were also very nice and helpful. They gave us our room key and had the bell hop bring up the bags. Our room was on the top (8th?) floor. There was a sign that stated this was a Starwood Floor (some members floor). Anyway, our room was HUGE with a King size bed. The room was spotless also. We couldn't be happier! For the price and size of the room, I could not complain in the least. Surprised by the size and cleanliness of the room, i text messaged the great news my friend who was arriving in the morning. When he and his family arrived, he called me accusing me of being sarcastic. Being the constant joker he is, my wife and I went to meet him at his room on another floor. His room was so small that my wife and I would have been completely uncomfortable in there. Because of the extra people in his room, he also had a roll away bed in the room. You could not even walk in his room. Remember, he paid for the \"bigger\" room. We then invited him up to our room. He was very upset to say the least. I was paying approx. $40 less than he was with a room that could've fit his room in our bathroom. He immediately went down to the front desk and asked for a new room advising them about the size and price difference. The front desk stated that our room was the same as his and that the hotel was completely booked, \"sorry\". When the hotel refused to change his room, my wife and I offered to change rooms with them. He declined and stayed cramped all weekend. I guess this review can go both ways. It really can be a hit or miss with this hotel. My wife and I really did enjoy it.

My wife secured the booking online for about USD 100 per night plus taxes, but because of very strong occupancy (RSNA conference) we had to pay USD 225 for last unarranged night. I thought this was very reasonable for a central Chicago hotel (compared to Sydney prices this was BRILLIANT value!!) and the weak USD helps us too. We were upgraded to a suite (I suspect due to us being SPG members) and it was great. Sure, there was no view but we focus more on the ability to sleep at night (ie no noise) and comfortable bed (which was great). We were on level 6 of the 8 level building. Big plus was the free WiFi broadband internet. Free coffee for the perculator also provided. I am not sure if it is the hotel's fault as to what TV services they subscribe to but what programs came out of the box in the evening was of very poor quality. Hotel is many have said is in a great position - Trader Joes very handy for all those bits and pieces you need and great value too. My wife was attending two conferences ahead of the RSNA one (she is still in Chicago but at a different hotel which had already been booked with another lady). So I walked everywhere as it was that handy - to the Chicago History museum in the north to Millenium Park in the South (take a bow Chicagoeans - you have done a wonderful job in creating this - something to be remembered as being created at the turn of the century). Thanksgiving Day it snowed in the morning so I was a happy chappy coming from 30 degree celcius Brisbane heat!!). We also recommend attending the Piano Bar - sat right next to the piano player from about 10pm to just after midnight - absolutely brilliant (pity people have to smoke though!!). This hotel will certainly be our first option when returning to Chicago - I cannot understand why others need to pay USD300 plus to get a little more.

We were able to walk or take a short cab ride to all our restaurants. We met up with the Guest Services Manager, Eric, actually while making a complaint about the music in the lobby. We were trying to make a cell phone call and couldn't hear over the music. He was so polite, we just starting asking him questions about where to go and what to do. He helped us with a bus route to Second City Improv and advised us the best way to get where we wanted to go. He advised us on where to eat and even made our reservations at a wonderful steak house called \"Kinzie's Chop House\" (400 N. Wells). He also turned us on to Timothy O'Toole's who offer $5 roundtrip bus rides to Soldier Field. The other staff members were all very polite and friendly. They all bent over backwards to assist us in any way they could. They recommended two very good places to eat breakfast (West Egg on Ontario & Fairbanks & Tempo Cafe on Chestnut)--both within walking distance to the hotel. We did have a couple of complaints, though. The walls are paper thin between rooms. We were able to hear our neighbor's phone ringing and their conversations. The bed wasn't the most comfortable and like other reviews, we did not have a view. Also, I thought it was strange that because I made the reservation, I had to produce a credit card with my name on it for the room charges. The hotel would not accept my travel partner's credit card. Not sure if this is for security reasons, or what. Just a note about what we liked and didn't like about our time in Chicago. Definitely take the double decker bus or trolley tour of the city. You are allowed to hop on and hop off all day long for $25. We were able to enjoy the places we wanted to see and then have transportation to the next stop. They stop at 13 areas and learn much about Chicago's history and architecture. We figured out places we wanted to spend more time at and also saw so much of the city. Take a Lake Michigan/Chicago River Tour and try to take in the Chicago Art Institute. Didn't care for Giordano's restaurant - the service was terrible.

This hotel is new, construction is still evident in a few areas. It is located less than a block off Michigan Ave, the ideal launching place for shopping, restaurants, sightseeing. The building holds a Trader Joes, a parking garage, and a restaurant is being built. At present, room service is from across the street (Lawry's Prime Rib). There are dozens of restaurants in the neighborhood. There is a continental pay-as-you-go breakfast buffet in the hotel. The lobby is small but nice. The front drive doormen are very friendly but not very experienced. They were too casual about our cart of suitcases sitting in the middle of the sidewalk with people streaming past - - I had to seek out a bellman to at least take it inside the lobby. The indoor pool and whirlpool is very nice, better than most of the other established hotels in the neighborhood (Radisson / Homewood Suites, Wyndham). The hotel was full when we stayed there, giving the staff a good test - the maids did not get to our room till about 4 pm. The service was fast and friendly. It seemed like everyone was competent, and new to the business - not overly efficient or tip-hungry. There was a maintenance problem in our room, and it was fixed in 3 minutes. The junior suite was actually a large single room, which was big enough for 2 adults and 3 children. There was a nice refrigerator, free bottled water, a microwave, free internet and coffee in the room. The bathrooms are small, but adequate. The common areas are new, and tastefully done. The exercise room is tiny, with about 7 machines (with flat panel TVs and headphones) and some free weights. There were a few items to mention on the downside. The hotel is locked in, and I can't see how any rooms would have nice views. There were some housekeeping glitches, some debris on the floor from the last guests, and I'm not sure that the sheets on the fold-out couch were fresh. The pool deck is way too slippery -- I guarantee someone will break their hip there one of these days. The worst part of the stay was the parking garage self-park. If you have a large vehicle, you are in big trouble. You could park a full sized SUV on the fourth floor of the garage, but in many of the parking spaces, you wouldn't be able to get out of the door. I put a scratch on my passenger side door handle just trying to park. Next, the parking ticket used to get out of the garage wouldn't work correctly in the machine at the exit. Try to explain that to the neurotic local Trader Joe's customers who have parked in the garage and are trying to exit behind you - locked into a narrow one-way ramp. During the course of the visit, it seemed everyone was having trouble with this. One woman, in the lobby, was yelling on the cellphone with her husband who was apparently trapped at the exit gate pushing the \"assistance button\" and not getting a response. My advice would be for the guests, and the hotel, to bag the self park idea and just go to valet service like everyone else in the neighborhood. Overall, this hotel is comparable in value to other local mid-priced choices, but it is newer, cleaner, and a bit less expensive. For the price, you can't beat the location.

That was a nice and convenient option for us as we went to the Shedd Aquarium and Field Museum.

Their lunch specials also extend to 5PM which we ordered for our dinner.

I fully expect to see more recommendations on the Chicago Forum for this hotel as it becomes more familiar to all. It's fairly new. The room was excellant, and the location on N. Rush at the NW corner of Ontario is also excellant. I really think expectations figure in when discussing this hotel.

If your looking for a nice room with a coffee pot, a fridge, a microwave, a color tv, new decor, new bathrooms, and a very comfortable bed, now your talking this hotel. I have to add, what I really was thrilled about was the self-parking. The parking entrance is on N. Rush just north of Ontario next to the hotel's entrance. It's soooo convenient. Guests have access to their cars, from the hotel. I really thought that was a huge benefit to staying here IF you drive a car in. They do offer valet service too. There is some remodeling going on in the lobby but it didn't affect us on our recent visit. They have a pay as you go continental breakfast. the dining area looked very nice. The pool area and an enclosed courtyard looked very nice to me. We tried the Primehouse restaurant for full breakfast across the street, in the James Hotel and that was delicious. There is alot of choices in hotels for the Mag mile and that area. I was real curious what I was going to find when I got here and ended up really enjoying it.

We booked a Jr. suite which basically was one room with two double beds and a pull-out couch. The beds where very comfy and the pull-out couch was better than most I've experienced. The frig and microwave in the room were very welcome touches. On the fifth floor there is a small work-out room (3 or 4 treadmills and a rack of dumbells), a pool & a jacuzzi. Like the work-out room, the pool & jacuzzi area is small but the kids loved it and there was never a crowd the week we stayed (despite the heat wave going on outside). Security is very good. You need your room key to access the elevator as well as the pool and fitness areas. Maid service was very flexible. Because we stayed for a week we \"got motivated\" at different times every day and they left us alone until we were gone and the room was always in tip-top shape upon our return. There is a temporary set up for breakfast and evening happy hour (neither of which I used) but they are currently adding on a bar/restaraunt to the property. The reason I did not frequent the hotel amenities was because there was soooo many good places within a block and I would never waste a dining experience in Chicago on room service (it would truly be a sin). The best feature of this hotel is location!!!! One block from Michigan Ave and there are plenty of great eating choices minutes away. Great shopping to be had everywhere, a few grocery stores a couple blocks away; again, the location is perfect.

Overall presentation and cleanliness of common areas - excellent Cons: Price - This hotel is too expensive for the accommodations. I received the military rate of $149/night. Had it not been for that I would have went somewhere else. Cleaning - When we first checked in I noticed the bath tub was not as clean as it should have been (hair) nor were all of the amenties in the bathroom (shower cap, etc) or complimentary water. Upon reporting, the supervisor came to my room, apologized and got everything I needed. I left a $2 tip each day for the housekeeper and she made sure eveything was cleaned and replaced. Restaurant - Do not use the hotel for breakfast. The hot buffet is $11.95 and terrible. The continental buffet was $9.95. The eggs were terrible and the fruit was overly ripe. Instead go to the West Egg Cafe (about 3 blocks up Ontario after your cross Michigan Ave) or go to the Grand Lux across the street (wonderful food...especially dinner) If you are going to be in Chicago for a few days, be sure and get a CTA pass to have unlimited access to the train and bus system. Don't be afraid to use. Chicago locals take care of their tourist. This is the mid-west. They are very friendly (for the most part) and very helpful. At no time did I feel unsafe anywhere. We went to the fireworks down on the lake during Taste of Chicago. There were 1 million people down there. The police didn't allow folks to get out of hand. It was crowded, but never felt afraid for our safety. As hotels go, this is a great hotel for families. It's quiet and with it having suites, it will be easy for the kids to stay in the same room with their parents. Now if you are looking for a luxury experience, I would suggest the Intercontinental Hotel on Michigan Ave. Very nice and only about $20-$30 difference. Historic tower rooms are small, but really nice! Because I like more of a luxury experience, I would not stay here again but I have no problem whatsoever recommending to families.", "Date": "July 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington Sate", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Location/Staff/Hotel\u201d", "Author": "WashingtonAL", "ReviewID": "UR5413403", "Content": "After a couple weeks in Ireland we were jumping for joy at this wonderful hotel. It had a pretty spacious lobby& desk/door staff were soooo friendly too. The rooms were new and roomy as hotel rooms go, nice big TV (after 13\" TVs in Ireland) frig (free water bottle each day) and microwave too.Comfy soft beds. Big bath with full tub/shower and all the goodies you need to stay clean and moisturized. Even a nice laundry room on 8th floor - only 50 cents to wash and 50 cents to dry - that is a bargin. Went to the desk at 4:30 am to ask for change (only had eruos and couldn't sleep with the 6 hours time change) and was given quarters with a smile. Amazing! Our room (6th floor) looked out on other buildings and the street scene of Rush Ave. Nothing spectacular but not much traffic noise either. Had trouble with our A/C at 10:00 pm and the engineer came up within 5 minutes - determined the thermostat battery was dead, replaced it and left within a couple minutes. Fantastic service - also decided to get a roll-away for our daughter (after 2 weeks in B&B's we wanted to spread out...) about 10:30 pm and it was there with a smile in less than 5 minutes. Ate across the street at Grand Lux Cafe - really good - a lot like Cheese Cake Factory. Aslo ate at the Mexican place across the street - not great service and the food was very bland. After 2 weeks of Irish food we really wanted good Mexican...it was a dissapointment. Starbucks 1-1/2 blocks, building a Trader Joes next door.Giordanos Pizza 4 blocks away - outstanding. I booked thru the hotel and paid $230. Considering it was one block off the Michigan Ave where all the groovey stores are it was a bargin. Took a cab from O'hare for $35 and did the hop-on hop-off bus and walked everywhere else. Nice neighborhood, beautiful flowers and nice wide sidewalks.", "Date": "June 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ohio", "Title": "\u201cSuperb service, quality and location at 4 Points Sheraton\u201d", "Author": "Gonecuttinghair", "ReviewID": "UR5333605", "Content": "We stayed at the 4 Points Sheraton Chicago downtown as my daughter and I were celebrating her high school graduation with a shopping trip to Chicago the end of May. We were impressed with it's location to all the shops on Michigan Ave. We found our hotel very accomidating from the moment we arrived. Prompt greetings from the doorman (Phillip, what a GREAT guy) to the front desk. The hotel is very safe as you need your room key to use the elevator. We were on the 6th floor. Great quiet part of the hotel, never heard a peep all night long. The room was tastefully decorated and the beds mattress, linens and many pillows wispered luxury. We slept like babies in our beds...Sheraton's signature mattresses were true to their word. Rooms had microwave, refrigerator and a coffee pot (+ one compllimentary bottle of water per day). Really liked the extended shower curtain and bathrrom decor as well. Pool was very small, but hot tub was nice and both clean. Business center was very nice on the 4th floor. Nice sitting area right outside of the business area with a nice fireplace and large plasma where they had an assortment of wooden board games for guests to play. The breakfast was okay, nothing to brag about. We had to make our own waffle and it was something we felt should have been made by the staff as everyone struggled with spraying and pouring the batter in the iron. The egg quiche was aweful, no flavor and tasted like a fake egg peice of pie with no seasoning. Bottom line, for $12. we could have went somewhere nice and had a real breakfast. On a positve note, the Tazo tea was a nice treat. The hotel itself was wonderul and we would definately stay here again the next time we are in Chicago.", "Date": "June 12, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, great value\u201d", "Author": "dec-ben", "ReviewID": "UR5048791", "Content": "I stayed here with my husband and two year old.

I've stayed in many hotels in Chicago and this was certainly one of the best experiences. We stayed at the Four Points right after it first opened in July of 2005.

Many Chicago attractions are close by or a quick train ride away. We were in town for a Cubs game and had no trouble finding the red-line and getting to and from the stadium.
