Add three people with three bits of luggage and you have one very squeezey room. The bathroom is badly designed in that the shower door opens out into the main bathroom but doesn't have a clearly level high enough to get over the bath mat. Therefore the mat is far away and the floor is slippery when you step out and even after the first person warned the other two, both found the floor very dangerous.

We booked a Superior room and were allocated a room on the 14th floor with expansive city views. The airconditioner worked well, the bed was comfortable, the linen good quality and the room was well serviced daily, including linen change. There was an in-room safety box, two complimentary bottles of water daily along with the usual tea and coffee supplies. The fridge was handy for fruit supplies etc. We stored our suitcases on the ledge beneath the bay window; I think that's what the ledge is for. The bathroom was fine although the size of the shower could be a problem for very large people but there was plenty of hot water and adequate shelf space for toiletries. As others have said, the room is small but for just the two of us we found it big enough as we were out all day sightseeing and really only used the hotel for sleeping and we certainly slept well each night. There were no delays when we checked in/out and whenever we dealt with reception, we were served promptly and efficiently. The lobby was busy at times, but that didn't worry us as we had no need to linger there. Occasionally the lifts were very busy but mostly didn't bother us. As I said, we were out all day so didn't need to ride the lifts very often. Wi-fi was not included in our room rate so instead of paying $10SGD per day to use our own computer, we chose to pay $4 for 30minutes on one of the 3 computers near reception, just to check our emails etc. We did not use the pool but it looked very attractive and quite large for a hotel pool. We found the location of the hotel to be ideal, directly above Lavender MRT station. We caught the MRT from Changi airport on arrival and also back to Changi on departure. Every day we travelled on the MRT at some stage, either for sightseeing, shopping or for evening meals. There are always taxis available outside the hotel lobby which we utilised to get to the zoo and bird park. We did not try the hotel breakfast but instead bought some breakfast supplies from a supermarket at Bugis Junction, just one MRT stop away. There is a fruit store across the road from the hotel and a couple bakeries and other food outlets beside the hotel.

So I would write a resume so the next guests will know what to expect from this Hotel. a. If you are traveling using MRT, this hotel is the best choice. Located exactly on the top of Lavender MRT, there is no other hotel can beat the easiness of strolling your luggages from Airport to a hotel. b. Lavender MRT itself only a few stops away from the city center. So it will take you only 10 minutes to the Orchard Road or even shorter (3 minutes) to City Hall. c. Large number of other guests in the lobby is to be expected. Since the hotel has 888 rooms, it is considerably normal. Luckily there are at least 5 check-in staffs who are ready to help you, and they usually work fast! And they are very flexible. If you are checking in early, as long as there are free rooms, they won't let you wait until 2pm to enter the room. d. During busy hours (8am-2pm), prepare to wait minimal 10 minutes to use the elevators. (remember: 888 rooms and only 6 elevators, one of them is a fireman's elevator) e. Rooms are tinier than most 3 stars hotel rooms in Singapore. The shower is also tiny, the warm water wasn't stable, sometimes it gets hotter for a few seconds then goes back to normal. f. Most of twin and double rooms have a view to the other side of hotel's building. Which literally you are looking for the other guests' rooms! But it also not comfortable to close the curtain all the time. So: try to get a room at either south or north side of the building. Not in the middle. g. Cold swimming pool with a lot of winds. Tiny fitness room, no wellness area. h. Never tried the breakfast during my stays.. so I can't give any review. i. Kopitiam just around the corner. Open 24hours. Easy but not very tasty. j. Best value goes to a Nasi Lemak stall in just beside the lobby, Only 1,5 $ a portion. What a bargain! but if you go for western food, better go to City Hall or Vivo City. k. Never tried the room service. j. Not to forget: thin room doors.. means you will hear your neighbors slamming the door, Luckily that was usually happened around 8-9pm.", "Date": "April 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubai, United Arab Emirates", "Title": "\u201cLocation and Unexpected Luxury\u201d", "Author": "twisted_bratinella", "ReviewID": "UR127118806", "Content": "You guessed it right. Main thing we loved about V Hotel Lavender was its Location! Right on top of the Lavender Station which is on the same line as the Airport Station. Made moving around the city so much easier, plus the 24-hour dine-in on the ground floor Kopitiam was a HUGE help as well; we never got hungry! (*wink!*) Other than the Location, V Hotel is actually a relatively new hotel and admittedly the rates are a bit pricier than the average. The thing is it was our first time together in Singapore (me and my husband I mean) and we really did not want to take our chance in any of the Geylang hotels coz all the reviews I've read were Hit and Miss! So we both decided that it would be worth it to pay a bit extra for guaranteed cleanliness and comfort (which we got, 100%). The lobby was a bit busy when we checked in but we're not really the fussy primadonna types of travellers plus we were actually coming from another SG hotel (Asphodel Inn, which I've also done a Review on) so we were not tired at all and could afford to be a bit more patient. Anyway despite the tons of guests checking in and out, there were at least 5 Concierge and the one who checked us in was quite fast, Express if you call it, which was a plus. I'm gonna give you a really USEFUL ROOM TIP. We were initially checked into the 13th Floord (13-75) which was ok for the size and all, but it was right in the middle facing the other Hotel building and you could see right through the other guests' hote room! This was a BIG NO-NO for me, how uncomfortable was that??! I did not want to have to close the curtains the whole time! I don't know if that was the case for most rooms as well, but I corteously asked the same staff at the lobby to pls transfer us to a room where it would be more conspicous at least. And he put us on the Topmost floor (15th) at the farthest end room (15-50), which offered spectacular views of the city. :) So there you go. GET A ROOM AT THE FARTHEST END OF THE HALLWAY IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE SOME SORT OF FREAK SHOW OR AT LEAST FEEL LIKE A PEEPING TOM TO THE OTHER GUESTS. ;) So I knew we were paying for comfort and cleanliness, which we happily got, but what we did not expect was LUXURY! V Hotel Lavender rooms are yes a bit small compared to the general hotel room sizes all over the world (but I would assume that the room size is standard to Singapore hotels), but trust me when I say it was a beautiful and well-kept room. Everything was up to standards: the flat TV, the dark wood furnishings, the huge comfortable bed, the bathroom, the toiletries... It was definitely worth our money. Though the shower stall might be a bit too revealing if you are not staying with your partner (glass doors ;)) but you can always just close the main bathroom door right? We also got to use the hotel pool, the gym was not exactly a gym; just a couple of equipments but good enough... All in all, V Hotel Lavender is a great place to stay at if you are willing to pay a bit more. Definitely WORTH IT. I won't hesitate coming back to this hotel.", "Date": "April 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baguio, Philippines", "Title": "\u201cHotel is conveniently located, modern, clean, with friendly staff.\u201d", "Author": "TheIgorotTourist", "ReviewID": "UR126994674", "Content": "For a first time visitor who's read a lot of reviews, it's difficult to look for a room to suit a family with kids.

It is an easy 3-4 minutes walk from the MRT lavender station (with children and senior citizen in tow). They say it is a budget hotel, but the services are 4star for my standards. The superior room is just right for a family of two adults and one child (at no extra cost). Complimentary bottled water, coffee and tea are supplied everyday.Wifi is also free, just ask for the username and password from the front desk staff.

The location of the hotel is the main reason why we chose this hotel. The hotel is right on the top of Lavender MRT. From Changi Airport to Lavender MRT only cost S$3.00 per person. We struggled for few days on whether to book this hotel or not, as some comments emphised that the hotel room is terrible small. So, by the day we arrived, we were sort of anticipated that hotel room would not be big. For the price we paid, we were quite happy for the size of the room. Room size - small, hardly find space to place our luggages. The bath room is tiny but enough for me. Like most of the travelers, we didn't stay in the hotel room for long time. All we need is a clean place to stay and sleep. In terms of this, the room size is OK. What do you expect for this price?! Location - I wil give 5 stars. We relied on MRT a lot when we stayed in Singapore. There are a 24/7 food centre right at the ground floor of the Lavender MRT. The foods are good and the price is resonable. Service - Good. The hotel staff does the housekeepting every day. It is good enough for me. Enviroment - We lived at the 9th floor, couldn't hear any nosie at all. However, if your room is close to the lift, you might hear the nosie of the guests. Facility - We didn't try the hotel restaurant, so no comments on this. The swimming pool is better than we expenced. It is a 1.5m dept out door pool. It is even better than the swimming pool of Royal Plaze on Scotts which is a five stars hotel. The only downside is the Wifi is not free! It costs S$10.00 a day to use the Wifi, even in the lobby area, Wifi is not free. Overall, it worths the price.

I stayed here for 7 nights in February/March 2012 and found it to be excellent! I arrived at 4.15am, was greeted by happy smiling young faces and was promptly given a room on the 10th floor. However, it smelled of smoke (and the bathroom reeked of curry - I like curry BUT not smelling it continually) so asked for another room which was non problematic. Front Desk member, a lovely girl named Isa came with me to make sure I was okay with the next room on the 8th floor (after she had a sniff of the room on the 10th floor and apologised repeatedly for the bad smells) and sent someone up to clean the bathroom (as it also smelled like curry - weird!) which thankfully did not smell of smoke and eventually the bathroom smelled lovely. The staff have no problems with you complaining, they are there to make you happy which they did. BUT I always ask politely which is why we have no troubles on our travels (well, except for 2 hotels in the USA but they were rude to many). I read many reviews on this hotel with people complaining that the staff werent friendly or polite - well, they were to me! Mind you, Im friendly & polite to the staff so thats probably why I had no problems with the customer service. Remember, its a 2-way street and as a traveller, we should show good manners which I must admit, I saw rarely from guests. However, I saw staff respond to rudeness very politely & efficiently. You have to realise that this is a HUGE hotel (888 rooms!!!) so with the 1000s of people that go through the doors daily, the staff arent going to remember every person that comes in to the hotel! BUT the staff are polite, efficient & helpful. BE POLITE, I am sick of seeing rude tourists who feel they have every right to treat staff like rubbish and feel that they are privileged so can be rude (NO!!) - we are embarassed by the behaviour of many. Room - clean, new, great view of the Kallang River, quiet (apart from the person above me scraping his chair on the floor every night at 11.30pm for an hour!), far away from the lift. Bed was hard but I have a firm bed at home so I was fine. Bathroom was clean & showers had excellent pressure. Aircon was just right. Location - excellent! Right on top of the awesomely clean & efficient MRT - only 2 stops from City Hall and it only took me 27mins to get to the airport (took me 20+mins in a taxi at 4am which cost $25). Close enough to the city BUT far enough away from busy areas to be quiet. Right over a food hall (the Kopitiam where I didnt eat as I couldnt quite understand what the food was - Im a vegetarian - but it smelled great & was open 24hours and was always busy) but a Wendy's and bakeries, fruit n vegie store etc were here/nearby too. Pool area - spotless & gorgeous!!! A pool where you can actually do laps for fitness - it was at least 25m long. Gym - small BUT efficient for keeping the fitness up.

The MRT beside the hotel will bring you to the airport, just transfer at Tana Merah. And if your flight back home is still in the afternoon (and check out is at 11), you can leave your bags with the concierge.", "Date": "March 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hobart, Australia", "Title": "\u201cUse for 1 night stopover only\u201d", "Author": "Greg P", "ReviewID": "UR125536446", "Content": "We stayed at V Lavender on transit to Ho Chi Minh.

They gave us free wi-fi (4 codes to use for 2 nights) but not sure if its cause we mentioned it was our honeymoon. They looked after our bags for us while we spent the last day touring Singapore before our 8:30pm flight home. The food court outside the hotel at the station was good and cheap but almost NO vegetarian food (hard to find anywhere in Singapore) Did not go to the restaurant because by looking at the menu it was a total ripoff!!!

We bought the breakfast, which I thought was very good and had a wide selection. The room service was also good and well priced, with quick service. A few complaints however; firstly that the housekeeping cleans rooms far too late, often they would not come until 5pm by which time we had returned to get ready for the evening. Also, I was disappointed that they refused to sent a porter up to my room to help me with my luggage even though I had an injury, they said I had to pay which I thought was a bit weird for a hotel which claims it is 4*. Thirdly, I think a lot of tourist groups use this hotel, which meant that at check out times, everything was totally hectic, with luggage everywhere, and the staff being unable to cope. And lastly, although there was internet near the lobby, I thought it was very overpriced. Overall, the hotel is in a good location (Lavender MRT), and it was a comfortable stay.

Check in was chaotic. Although we arrived at the hotel around 4:00 p.m. we were told that our room was not ready as it had to be cleaned. We were asked to wait in an overcrowded lobby for half an hour.

The hotel was over crowded.. it is a large hotel that seems to have more guests than its staff can manage!! The lobby was always overflowing with people and luggage and the lifts full! Our room was very small and the bathroom too... its a good thing my partner and I are small people.. I dread to think how uncomfortable if would have been for a larger couple! When we arrived in our room on our first night we were greeted by a cockroach on the wall next to the bed!! We killed it but then during the early hours of the morning I went to the bathroom and found another one!! We found it difficult to get to sleep because of the noise from a bar across the street that was having some kind of karaoke music night playing very loud music! We were then woken up at 3am by the room phone ringing, reception made a mistake dialing the room number for an early morning wake up call!! Great, thanks!.. It wouldn't have been so bad if the phone was by the bed, but its not.. it was the other side of the room which meant I had to get out of bed to answer it!! Our room was right next to the elevators so we heard everyone on our floor come and go at all hours.. in addition to this the corridors had tiled floors so any noise anyone made in the corridor just echoed loudly!! Its a good thing I had brought ear plugs with us!! The bathroom in our room was not only tiny but smelly and not very well cleaned when we arrived... the extractor in the bathroom didn't seem to work so that after showering the steam just lingered in the room for hours making it smell damp and musty! nothing dried in there.. the tiles, mirror and towels were still wet 5 hours after we had showered!! There is clearly a problem with the ventilation! Although the staff did come and make our moderately comfortable bed they unfortunately did not clean our tiny bathroom during our 3 night stay.. but we did get clean towels once! On the second morning I went to the bathroom and a 3rd cockroach fell on me!! It then ran about the bathroom, in the shower and vanished through a crack in the tiles!! Not the best way to start the day!! The air conditioning in the room was great when we wanted the room to be 23 degree's... but when I went to change the temperature I found that I couldn't ... it was set at 23 degree's so I could either switch it on or turn the fan up!! Annoying! Just outside our room there had obviously been a leak or a problem with the corridor ceiling, the hotel had covered up the large hole in the ceiling with a black plastic bag... from this hole came some nasty smells and from the air conditioning unit next to the elevators on floor 5... not nice!! The breakfast was an odd buffet mix.. of which only the baked beans were worth eating, everything else was vile!! The fruit juice was watered down and the milk had ice in it which diluted it! It was also very busy at breakfast...we went at different times on the 3 separate mornings and it still felt over crowded... the staff were not great at quickly refilling the empty buffet serving trays either! Don't drink the coffee.. it tastes like watered down mud and to buy a coffee a the bar during breakfast cost $10!! We were upset that we had to pay $10 for 24 hours of wifi internet.. when we have stayed in much cheaper hotels and wifi has been free... we also found that we could only use the wifi password they gave us after paying on just one devise... so if you sign on to the wifi with your i phone... you can not later sign on with you laptop!! Stupid!! Our check out was confusing....we had stayed for 3 nights but had originally booked for 4 ... the hotel wanted to still charge us for the one night we weren't there.. that just didn't seem right!! Im still waiting for them to e mail with a copy of the invoice after discussing it with them... its been 3 days and still nothing!! Surprise surprise!! The toilets near the hotels lobby are discussing too... they hadn't been cleaned all day and had urine all over the floor... you had to pay $0.10 for a piece of toilet paper even if you were a guest at the hotel!! Thats just wrong!! We will NOT be staying there again!!! We had the impression that this hotel only cared about making money and did not care about their guests!!

My room is a family room and is facing the Kallang river which is good if you would like to see some sceneries. Room and bath room is small but enough for us as we are not big size. Overall room layout is ok except for there is no mirror in the room. And imagine for the ladies they have to go to bathroom to do their makeup, hairdo and etc which is not convenient at all. They do provide a safe box, hair dryer, water boiler for you to make some tea. About the hotel lobby, I noticed there is always a huge crowd and sometimes I might get some unsafe feelings as I am not really sure whether they are a valid hotel guest. The elevators are near to the main entarnce which makes it easy for them to sneak around the hotel and just follow you up. Another plus point for the hotel is the convenience to eating shops, money changer, ATM machines.

The shower was great, good water pressure and very warm. We had a small fridge (no mini bar), a kettle and a good TV. The air-con also worked well. The beds were very comfortable. It is a massive hotel and despite there being 5 lifts, you always had to wait up to 10 minutes to get one which got very annoying and they were always completely full. The service wasn't anything to write home about, and staff at the desk didn't seem overly friendly or helpful. The restaurant is very expensive ($5Singapore for a can of drink) but we didn't have a meal there so can't comment on the quality of the meals.

I stayed here for the second time, this time got a better room (view outside, not inside towards the other tower) so I did had quite a nice view. And I paid really little for the room, Singapore is very expensive and a hotel at such a good location for only around 120S$ is quite a deal. The hotel can be reached from the MRT station through a small food stall area, 2 minutes, with the MRT itself being the one from the airport, so it's really convenient. It's 5 minutes towards the city centre with the MRT, and the location itself is just next to Little India (but not in Little India itself, so not so loud and noisy) Both checkin and checkout were efficent. Elevators weren't that much of an issue this time - either they improved them, or we were just lucky. Swimming pool simply is great, nice design between the two towers, not for sun bathing, but perfect for swimming, it's quite long, so if you want to do some laps, it's really a good way. The fitness center is smallish and at the end of the pool, but ok if you want to do some running. Don't expect anything fancy. The room is offering a fair size for the costs, however the shower/bathroom could have been done a bit better. It's just slightly too small. But still ok, and modern. For 1 person definitely no problem, and for a couple it's ok too I guess, just if you're two people not in a relationship travelling together it might be a little bit too small. Bed is comfortable, good pillow and blankets. Really nothing to complain about. Worst thing in this hotel is clearly that they went a bit too cheap on isolation. You can hear other guests, especially on the hallway (not the rooms.. weirdly it seems the isolation is only cheap towards the hallway, not between the levels or rooms or windows.. so there is hope it can be fixed) Wanted to sleep out a bit longer in the morning, and even though it was Chinese New Year just about to start and they were really full, they granted me 2 hours more (1pm instead of 11am) which I really appreciated. So their service level certainly improved since my first stay, probably they just get better with all kind of arrangements and simply after half a year of running things get easier once you get the experience. I suggest - unless you somehow get it for free - not to use their breakfast buffet. I didn't tried it out myself but heard it was average and not really worth the extra money, and there is plenty of food places right next to the hotel, which do offer enough food to stuff yourself for less than 5S$.. So, I'm happy with the hotel, get a room towards the end of the hallways and towards the \"outside\" with the window, and you should be absolutely fine and get decent value for money.

Overall, we found it a convenient, well-run hotel and reasonable value for money in expensive Singapore, but the rooms and corridors are a bit dark and dreary. On the positive side, the hotel is located around the corner from the Lavender MRT, which makes it an easy 15 minute-trip to Orchard Road, 5 minutes to City Hall and about 30 minutes to and from the airport. This is a great way to beat the heat and humidity and get around the city inexpensively and in comfort as even a short walk on the street in Singapore leaves you dripping with sweat. Everything was quite efficient with our check-in, and the staff at the hotel were polite and helpful when we wanted to change our room because of the slightly weird smell in the first room we were given. The breakfast is adequate but some dishes are a bit odd (e.g. cornbeef mash on top of mashed potatoes, chicken ham). I suppose it's meant to cater to the tastes of people from different countries. However, the only bread is in loaves and you have to toast it yourself. Since the breakfast area gets quite busy, It would be nicer and more efficient to have some bread rolls that people could eat without toasting. The breakfast tables are in a pleasant, breezy, open area, but watch out for the bird poo on the chairs! Toiletries given in the room are very small, barely enough for one person per night. We ended up buying a bottle of shower cream to get us through the trip. The shower is also designed to be almost parallel to the floor with a loosely fitted glass door so that the bathroom floor always gets quite wet (I suppose this design is meant to make it easier for people with limited mobility but surely there must be a better way). You can also compare this hotel to the Ibis on Bencoolen, which is the same standard of hotel and slightly more expensive. The Ibis is a brisk 10-minute walk to the MTR but has much cheerier, fresher, better-designed rooms, a nice restaurant, and an overall nicer feeling to the hotel.

It is not a problem for us as we want to go our anyway. The issue was our luggage was kept along with a huge amount of other luggages by the elevator. When we came back to collect it in the afternoon, nobody was there and we can just take the bags without even presenting the card. This is a major security issue! Upon coming in to the room, there was a heavy residue smell of smoke, which I think was left by the prvious guest and was not aired out properly. As we did not smoke,it was quite disgusting.

Basic amenities were provided including shower gel, lotion, shampoo, toothbrush, showercap and bedroom slippers! Sheets were crisp and new, pillows were soft as well as the fluffy white bath towels. One comment though is that there were no hand towels provided and no soap too! I think the hotel should provide soap because not all guests like to use shower gels! At the fourth floor, there was a swimming pool, a gym and a resto. Location of the hotel was perfect because you just need to step outside to ride the train (lavender mrt station) or ride the bus. They also have a 24-hr convenience store, 24-hr food court, bakery,food stalls and Wendy's!

My brother who a day earlier complained about not being able to sleep as the room is too warm. Not thinking much about it, I went up to the room and indeed, it felt like sahara desert.

The premier room, was better but we soon discovered another problem. Cleanliness. The sheets were stained with some silver grey substance, goodness knows what and the pillow sheets to our horror, were stained with dirt. We discovered it at 3 am and kept on ringing reception but they hung up on us. Another general problem with the rooms would be that the floor is incredibly slippery, I almost fell head down coming out from the shower. Not recommended for kids or elderly people. Service was minimal and ineffective, rooms were slippery be it in or outside the bathroom, minimal ventilation, cleanliness frowned upon, and in general, the hotel was packed with group tours and is constantly very noisy.

And V Hotel stands right on top of the Lavender MRT station making commuting very convenient. Also, it has a food joint just under the hotel so grabbing a meal isnt too tough. My first impression of the room as soon as i opened the door was that of ' God, this room ended even before it started!' .. the place may seem reasonable for a couple that is travelling light and dont care much about the luxury of the hotel. The bathroom is small again but nothing that is unacceptable. the room has basics like a LCD, water kettle, safe locker, cupboard, mini fridge. All this makes the deal quite good as u dont really find anything really missing in the room except from the size.

And they don't have a system to manage the luggages, one of our friend couldn't find the luggage when we back to hotel for airport, and the LEONG was there to manage the luggages, so we asked him to find the luggage, he is not helpful that told my friend to find it himself!!!

First I was given room without any window (there is a window--with the view: facing wall), yes, I did check-in late (5pm), but for the price they charged (S$160/night) I kind of expected more, because the price doesn't even include breakfast. The thing is, the queen-sized-bed room was very small, probably 9 sqm--that already included the very mini bathroom. I thought the wireless internet was going to make it up, but alas, the wifi turned out to be S$10/day. So what I got is S$170 very small room with wifi, no window, and no breakfast. What a deal. But hey, at least they gave basic amenities (towel, shampoo, bath gel, body lotion, slippers) and mineral water. What bothered me more was that the hotel didn't even bother to provide some general information sheet/folder in the room. If you check out their website, actually they didn't even reveal much. It was very misleading, as several online booking sites mentioned this hotel as having free wifi. Did I sleep well? Imagine this, the room is weirdly lit (they only have neon lamps to lit the room), with noises coming from the corridor--the wall is very thin. It was fortunate for me that I was super exhausted so that I could sleep eventually.

The was however no bell boy to help us to the room and we managed on our own. The lift is a very tricky part and one could often find themselves waiting for 15 minutes for the lift to arrive. The room itself is SMALL. That is the most striking thing about the room. But look closely and you will realize that though it is small, it is very ergonomic and makes good use of space. Though on this case it would look overly judicious of them especially with the rates they charge per room. The bathroom is similarly small. However the rooms were decently furnished and stocked. It was very clean and spotless. The bed was big and comfortable. The view from the window was very nice and the stay was comfortable and getting adjusted to the small size was painless. Breakfast is usually included with the room and served pool side. The dining area of the hotel was on a side terrace of the building and the view was spectacular. Breakfast was a mix of continental and local specialities. Quality of food was easily 5 star.You also have a decent sized pool and gym on the same floor. The hotel has very good aesthetic taste and the designs are rich in quality if not quantity. This maybe a unique difference from other 4 star properties that people maybe accustomed to. Overall it was a pleasant stay, but not the kind which would attract me for a second stay if I can help it.", "Date": "November 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mumbai (Bombay), India", "Title": "\u201cBudget Hotel for the Business Person\u201d", "Author": "WillyFernandes", "ReviewID": "UR120151898", "Content": "This was a very good value for money hotel.

The positives: The hotel is in an excellent location, right on top of the lavender mrt and on the line for the air port which is very cheap , safe and simple to navigate. There are many resterants and some are 24 hours or open early and close late and one station away at bugis there are a plethora of food choices. The hotel lobby is clean though there always seemed to be racks of bags in the lobby obviously of people waiting to check in or out. The rooms are clean but this is where the positives end... The negatives: The hotel staff are unhelpful and as the hotel is extremely busy, the staff barely have time to assist with additional enquries. When we arrived our tv remote didn't work and it took a few hours and 2 phone calls to have it replaced. The rooms are very small and the shower is barely big enough for one person. For some reason the hotel provides shampoo, conditioner, body liquid but no soap for hand washing!? There is no iron or hair dryer available and the rooms are very basic. The breakfast is not very appetizing and often it takes the staff some time to replace certain items when they run out. The elevators are very slow and busy , we often found that by the time it arrived there was a group of 15 people waiting to get in.

They didn't explain this though, and stood typing tings into the computer for ages without speaking to us. I looked to my friends who were checking in next to us and they were having the same problem. We didn't book on the same day but both booked through Ebookers. No idea what the problem was due to the lack of communication from them but we got a key eventually! The room was, as we expected from the reviews, small. This didn't bother us at all as there was a large ledge running the length of the window where we could put our luggage- what more space did we need?! They provided tea and coffee and two bottles of water. The room was smart looking. We overlooked the other wing and down to the swimming pool. We couldn't work out if people in the rooms opposite could see in, we think they could which meant closing the curtains more than normal which made the room feel smaller. Breakfast wasn't included so we went to the outlets they mentioned on their website. These are in the passage way between the hotel and the station so very close but not really suitable for a western breakfast. We ended up getting some pastries in the 7/11 near the Lavender Food Court one day, and ate in Wendy's in the passageway on the other. Neither memorable breakfasts! We sat out by the pool one night, there was a nice wicker \"snug\" which was nice for 6 of us to chill out in. Didn't use the pool but it looked nice. Major disappointment was that on the second day we came back to get changed at 4.30pm and the room still hadn't been cleaned. This meant no water or tea re-fills and when we asked they said they would charge!! They did eventually replace these free of charge when they did clean, although I have no idea what time they eventually came! There was also no wifi and they said there would be a charge. I've just checked and there is no mention of a charge on their website. A friend booked the same price room through a different website and their confirmation said the room included wifi, ours didn't mention at all so couldn't argue really.

However in hindsight I should have gone for a better hotel and suck up the extra cost, since I was travelling with my partner. The pros of this hotel is no doubt reflected in just about every review on Tripadvisor - its location and its price - but the cons far exceeds any benefits you would otherwise receive if you are travelling for a relaxing holiday. Here's just a short list: - TINY rooms, even smaller bathrooms - Awful unattentive uncaring staff (who are probably overworked and underpaid) - Worst bed I have slept in, and linen is hard and scratchy, very uncomfortable - Work desk is cluttered with junk, such as the oversized kettle base - No sound insulation, can hear other rooms and the corridor as if the door was open - Aircon was too cold, even on low setting and highest temperature - TV is almost all Bahasa and Hindi language channels (guess that's the intended market of the hotel) - Slow internet using buggy login style system that logs you out randomly The thing that annoyed me the most, which put me into a negative mindset regarding the hotel from the first day, I was demanded by the porter to tip for delivering my bags!!! Now don't get me wrong, I'm happy to tip the porter, however it just came as a shock to me as I'm not used to having to give tips for baggage delivery (no, I never been to USA). Not only that, the porter insisted at the lobby to take my bags, when I would've been happy to do it myself. Upon arriving in my room, he just throws my backpack onto the work desk, which promptly rolls off and hits the ground, along with all $3000 worth of camera gear in it, to which he just shrugs off. He then nonchalantly says to me \"one, two, three bags, three dollars\", and sticks his hand out in front of me. No \"please\", no \"thank you\", just stands there with his hand out while I'm in shock at 1. my camera gear, 2. this surprise \"fee\", and 3. his attitude. I handed him $3 as I didn't want to lose my temper and ruin my holiday, but this really made me feel bitter at the service of the hotel. Of course, at check out, I just took my bags down myself, didn't bother calling for the porter just in case I was slugged with some more surprise \"fees\". I definitely won't choose this hotel again if I'm taking my partner or going for pleasure.

When looking at google map to find our way from the Lavender MRT station to the hotel, the impression was that we had to walk a little bit. When we finally arrived we were pleasantly surprised as the hotel was literally situated above the MRT station which took us about 2-3 minutes to get to after we got off the train. Getting around is not a problem at all with Singapore's excellent MRT system. We got checked in rather quickly and got to our room in no time. Everything in the room is still rather new since it's only less than 3 months old. The bed and pillows are comfortable!! The sheets are nice luxurious hotel standard ones. However when I inspected our towels, I found a strand of hair stuck on one of the towels and it also had a black stain. The safe was also locked and we couldn't use it. We left for lunch and told the reception on our way out to change the towel and also reset the safe. When we got back, the towel was already replaced and the safe was open. In terms of service, I would say it's not bad at all. The only thing I could fault this hotel really is that cleanliness seems to be an issue and you can kind of foresee that it will only deteriorate further in time. The entire hall walkway are tiled with no carpets at all (which means it can get rather noisy when you have a bunch of people talking and laughing loudly in the hallway). I saw a bunch of hair on the floor right outside our room upon checking in and it was still there when we checked out.

I booked directly on their website which offered free internet & was worried that it was no longer free especially since my booking did not specify it. I e-mailed a week before my trip & got a quick reply confirming it was indeed free. Thanks to previous TA reviews I knew exactly what to ask for upon check-in: A room farthest away from the elevator to avoid the noise, room facing towards the street, higher floors, safe, etc. Reception was more than happy to grant my requests & check-in, check-out was a breeze. Room size didn't matter as I was by myself & plan to be out all day anyway. I already brought my own soap coz I know they didn't provide it. Room gets very cold so I brought warm pajamas. Bathroom size not an issue, I've had smaller bathrooms in some European hotels. Bottom line I knew what to expect so I've come prepared. No glitch in room key either. Location indeed saved me a lot of money. Didn't have to take a taxi from the airport, used MRT to all places I had to go which is very cheap. 24 hr Kopitam sold inexpensive & delicious food. A lot of the locals go there too so I met several who recommended things to do & places to go. Didn't have time to use the pool but the area was a nice place to just relax.

Given the high hotel room rates in Singapore and the normal practice of charging 50 to 60% for an extra bed in a double room, this hotel offers great value and the positives outweight the negatives.

We lacked of space for our suitcases, so we had to store them by the bedroom's window (by the way we never found a bellboy?). There was no bed lamp, only an hidden neon in the ceiling, which we disliked. The bathroom was also small with only an italian shower, but it did not bother us so much. Overall we cannot complain about the cleanliness. There is no restaurant on the premises but that was not a problem because as you come out of the lobby, there is a dozen of good hawkers of all kinds, as well as a 24hr kopitiam (food court) waiting for you on the way to the MRT. We enjoyed the swimming pool on the third floor which is big and outdoors, even if there was no heated water (it was so hot outside it felt good!). We could easily find fresh towels.

We had a baby with us so a little more than ideal luggage and a stroller so it was a tight fit. 2) Tiny bathroom - new and nicely appointed by the smallest shower area ever.

Rooms have huge windows so it's not that clusterphobic. If you are travelling in groups of 2 or more, take a taxi which i think is cheaper than MRT and less hassle.

We had booked the room about a month before and was quite apprehensive due to the several bad feedback regarding this hotel. Fortunately, we were pleasantly surprised that most of the bad feedback were not true in our case. We arrived at the hotel at around 10:45 a.m. The lobby was not big and we noticed that the lobby area was always busy with the comings and goings of hotel guests and staff. We didn't mind this, however, since we didn't plan on staying at the lobby too much. At the front desk, we were greeted by the front desk officer, who happened to be a fellow Filipino. After verifying our reservation, he checked their system and found an available room for us. We were hoping to get a city view room but given that an early check-in was more important for us than a good view, we agreed to an inner view room instead. An inner view room (I'm not sure what they call it exactly) doesn't have much a view as all you would see would be the other half of the hotel (with the swimming pool between the two halves several floors below). Since we didn't have much luggage, we took care of bringing our stuff up to the room ourselves. The room itself was very small - there was just enough space to fit the queen-sized bed, a small working table with the LCD-TV beside it. The bathroom was very tight, with the shower cubicle just big enough to accomplish its purpose. Despite these shortcomings, the room was very clean, the airconditioner was extremely quiet, and the overall design of the room was space-efficient for its size. The hotel did not provide free wifi internet access. Instead, they charge 10 Singapore dollars per day. Alternatively, to if you just plan to shoot out an email and not stay connected for long, there are three or four desktops in the small business center at the lobby where you get charged 4 Singapore dollars for every 30 minutes of use. We just got a room-only accommodation so we didn't get the chance to sample the food in the hotel. Besides, we wanted to try our luck at the local hawker centre that we read about here in Trip Advisor. Right beside the hotel was a Kopi Tiam, or a foodcourt, where we found a great variety of dishes to try. We ate lunch and dinner here that day. There is also a Wendy's beside the Kopi Tiam for those with burger cravings. Also right next to the hotel is the Lavender MRT Station, which can take you virtually anywhere in Singapore - very convenient! One other item that might be beneficial to future travellers to Singapore - we wanted to call home from the hotel (since the roaming functions of our cellphones didn't work for the first day) and upon advice from the front desk, we purchased an international call card for 10 Singapore dollars. With this card, we could call any international number from any phone and based on my computation, the card had about 60 minutes worth of call time. Not bad at all! We checked out early the next day because we expected to be out all day and wouldn't be able to go back at lunchtime to check-out. We also had a previous reservation for our next two nights in Singapore at the Mandarin Oriental.

We stayed in hotels from 3 star through to 5 star. We were not sure what to expect after reading the previous reviews but thought being so new and for 3 nights it should be fine. Check-in was quick, luggage at our room before we were. No problems getting the lift with-in a few minutes during our whole stay. First impression of the room was good, we knew it would be small but the bathroom is smaller than small. Ok for us as we were both able to fit through the tiny shower doorway, but if you are a larger person you wouldn't have a hope. Good blockout on the curtains. Good quality linens, and there was all the normal bathroom toiletries right down to a toothbrush. But that's where the good ended. We were not told where the breakfast room was, and there was no compendium to tell you anything about the hotel. Apparently, according to their website, there is a restaurant and room service.???? We found the restauant, only from the writting next to button 4 in the lift, but it was never open when ever we tried to go to it. Our room was serviced at 4.30pm on the first day, on the second day they came to do it at 7pm, we opted to just take the two new waters and two new teabags & fresh towels and left it at that. BUT he very worst thing is there is absolutlely NO sound-proofing at all. There is a doorbell on everey door which I have never encountered before. The hotel has 880 rooms, when we were there (last week July), we think 800 of them were full of children & teenagers. The noise was incredible, running up and down the halls, yelling out to each other, ringing of doorbells & the noise from the rooms either side of you. We had no sleep at all on the first night dispite resorting to sleeping tablets. We returned to the hotel for our second night in the late afternoon and by 9pm we could not stand the noise any longer and went to reception to see if we could request a room change. The young gentleman at reception was lovely, and did not even hesitate to change us to a hopefully quieter floor. We were moved to the eighth floor where there was carpeting in the hallways which did help to muffle some of the noise. Our safe didn't work and emitted a continual beep, the staff came promptly to see if they could fix it, but they were not able to, so the batteries had to be removed so we didn't have to listen to it beep all night. Not having the safe wasn't a huge drama as we don't travel with many valuables and reception looked after these while we were out of a day. It was quieter & we got some sleep on the second night though again had to resort to sleeping tablets. The third night was just a repeat of the first. There are bus load after bus load of groups being dropped off, nearly every time we went through reception another lot were arriving or leaving. We found the staff at the reception desk to be helpfull and they were handling a lot of complaints, which they did very well. The porter did try and charge us for bringing our luggage down, but we were not advised there was a charge nor as I said is it written anywhere. We were given a slightly extended checkout till 2pm as we had a late night flight. We left our luggage and went out for a while as our flight wasn't until 9pm. When we returned we asked where we could change clothing for our return to our cold home and were told we could use the facilities on the fourth floor at the gym & pool. These \"facilities\" were a disabled toilet which was locked. 6 toilets, 4 of which were locked and the one that was vacant was small and not clean. We opted to take turns to, use one of the two shower stalls that was not being used to change in. Fortunatley it was dry and sllightly bigger than the toilets. The chef was chaning in the toilets too, so they obviously don't have rooms for staff to use either. The gym is tiny with no change rooms at all. The hotel is very convieniently located as has been said before, and yes there is a food court underneath, but it is exactly that, not a restaurant, food was tastey, but not hot unless you got one of the soups that were constantly boiling, and it is very noisey in side. There is no restaurant nearby that we could find, nor could the staff tell us of any. So to sum it up we won't be back. If they had sound proofed to some degree it may have been a good place, so it's a pity really. Sorry but I can only say if you've booked & want to chance it, go armed with plenty of sleeping pills & earplugs!

So convenient whether you are using the MRT or taxiing as all taxi drivers know where hotel is. Location is also close to Clark Quay, Orchard Road, Bugis etc so taxi fare is usually around $5 - $8SG. Hotel room is modern and new, everything was cleaned daily for us and amenities replaced. Hotel gives body wash, moisturiser, shampoo, toothbrushes and sanitary stuff but no SOAP which is weird because you can't even wash your hands. Bathroom is very small but functional. Shower is good but small also. House keeping took one of our key cards because we left it in the slot to keep the air con going. We only found this out when we went to reception to ask about our lost key. Apparently this is standard so dont leave your spare key card in the slot. House keeping also took our tv remote away for some reason and we had to go to reception and get a new \" universal \" remote which didnt work. we had to turn tv on/off manually. We stayed in rm 1201. Would not recommend you stay in any rooms ending with 01 because these rooms have a window facing a concrete wall which seems literally about 50cms away. So there was no view, nothing. Bascially a window facing a cement wall. may as well as not had a window at all. Not good. Lifts - omg. there are 6 lifts at the hotel and during the morning, you have to wait a long time for the lifts beacuse so many people going up and down. as well as this, lifts stop on each level if button is pushed regardless of whether lift is jam packed or not. So catching the lift takes ages. Internet - our deal came with free wifi for the duration of our stay. when we checked in the lady gave us a voucher and said it was only valid for 24hrs from first use which we thought was a bit misleading. after complaining a few days later we were informed this was not the case and that vouchers were issued daily (ie: we had to go and collect a new voucher each day) because staff were concerned that people would sell off vouchers(??). Pool - we used once, quite cold I thought but it was fine. gym is bascially a tiny room with about 6 pieces of equipment so didn't both with that. Everyday there are bus loads of people who arrive so the morning is the busiest time. the lobby is always full of new people and peoples bags are always stacked around the lobby. Overall, location makes this hotel worth it because it is just so convenient. you can get anywhere around singapore from this hotel because the location is central and because the mrt is right underneath. despite all the negatives, if you want a functional, clean, modern convenient, basic hotel, stay here.

Our first impression was actually quite good. The location of the hotel is excellent as mentioned by many people - the MRT and buses are very convenient, the food court is good, the view from our room on the 12th floor is great, and there is even a free shuttle bus to the City Mall every half hour (whether you would want to go there or not is a different story though). The room itself is not that bad a size for a short stay (we were in a superior room) and everything was still relatively new. The fridge was empty which we really appreciated as we like being able to stock our own drinks and food for the late night snack. Then the bad parts started to emerge: 1. Electrical wiring was extremely poorly done! The light switches for the bed were next to the cupboard rather than the bed, the switch for the bathroom is outside of the room and is on the opposite side of the door handle, and there is no power point in the bathroom at all (you can forget about using your electric shaver or hairdryer there). The lights also flashed occasionally during the night as if there were short-circuit issues. 2. The elevator was very slow and random floor numbers light up by themselves, again as if due to short-circuit issues. Elevator that signalled going down ended up going up instead. It is usually very full and struggled to cope with the number of guests in the hotel. 3. There was only one toilet roll in the holder and no spare at all. This is the first hotel that we have ever stayed at with this issue. They did provide toothbrushes and tooth paste, but it would have been better to provide soap (there was none at all) and spare toilet rolls in our opinion. 4.

After coming from Malaysia, Singapore accomodation prices were a big jump. So we found this place for around $S120 per night. Our first impressions were great - it is almost brand new and looks like a 5-star hotel. It is also locately very convientley above the Lavender MRT station, which is on the airport line. The check in staff were also friendly, and the room has lovely new decor. However, when we got to the room (around 6pm) it hadn't been made up property and was missing things like towels, toilet paper etc. Also the shower head was broken. These were probably just one-off things, so we weren't too worried. The major issue we had was noise. Despite being right at the end of the hall, away from the lifts, we always got woken up at night or early morning by other guests (or their children) in the corridor. The airconditioning was also freezing (although that is a general Singapore thing). We didn't use the pool at all but it had one. I am not sure if we would stay there again. The biggest advantage was its location above the MRT (it is also above a great coffee shop - Kopitam) and it was a reasonable price compared to similar hotels. My advice would be to ask for a quiet room on a floor away from 'package travel groups'.", "Date": "July 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lawrenceville, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cGood location, not quite there yet with service/amenities\u201d", "Author": "skipitgood", "ReviewID": "UR115624730", "Content": "I think this must be a very new hotel, which would explain why the rates were fairly low for the area and time of year.

The V Lavender is nice enough if you are looking for a place to sleep and shower, and it is a very convenient location, but it is certainly not anywhere I want to spend any time lounging around. The rooms, as described by others, is ridiculously small. I'd say overall it's smaller than a cruise ship stateroom, with two small beds, a closet/desk console, an LCD TV and not much more. The huge windows faced the rooms in the opposite wing (AWKWARD) and no shade curtains. The bathroom is tiny, with a poorly designed shower stall, two total towels and no trash bin. The beds were very comfortable, though, and with a room near the wing's end we didn't hear too much hallway noise. The elevators are a nightmare: 5 for the entire complex. Going up to our room on the 15th floor entailed 6, 7, 8 stops. Overall it just felt the place was not designed for the number of guestrooms. During the day there are bags piled on carts lining the entire lobby and people are standing about because there is no place to sit. Tried calling the front desk and room service a couple of times: no answer. Now the good, the location above the MRT is fantastic, making everything in SIN easily accessible and convenient. The food just outside the hotel is wonderful and cheap, so I can't imagine wasting a cent in the hotel's restaurant. There's a Cheers convenience store on the ground floor as well. Overall, I agree with the other poster who said that as long as this hotel is new it will be a nice play to stay. Once its age starts to show, I see it catering to nothing but tour groups with minimal expectations.

Check in was fast, not super friendly staff but ok. Wifi is not included and it costs $10 a day. You are given small piece of paper for each day of your stay (i'll get to this later). I requested a high floor when I reserved and was given floor 6 out of 15. We checked into a triple room (as we were traveling with our 3 year old son). The room is WAY WAY WAY smaller than the photos on the website make it look but this is typical for Singapore. The bathroom is very small but adequate with good shower pressure. The first problem we encountered was a disgusting stain on one of the throw pillows on the bed, it looked like someone had been sick on it!! It was a massive stain! The next issue was there was a small pipe coming out of the wall beside the toilet that started flowing water onto our bathroom floor then draining into the shower??? Where the heck was this water coming from??!!! On our way out for the night I told the desk about the water, they offered to send someone right away but we were going out and I didn't want anyone in my room when we were gone. By the time we got back I had forgotten and it wasn't doing it anymore. I logged onto the internet using the code they gave me and kept on getting kicked off every few min. I went to the desk and told them the problem and it turns out that as my husband and I each had out own laptop only 1 person could use the code at one time. So we had to each get our own codes. Every time your computer \"goes to sleep\" or my iphone self locks after a few min the internet cuts off and you have to log in again. VERY annoying when you have to use your laptop for business and are on and off it all day!!! For a brand new hotel one would think wifi would be included and not have a daily/per person code system that logs you off all the time. There were only 2 pillows on the double bed so I called down and asked for 2 more (my husband and I like 2 each), about 30min later they brought 1 up. The bed was one of the most uncomfortable beds I have ever slept on! Not to mention the sheets were so scratchy and itchy. Im not sure if its because they are new but I found the bed and sheets horrible! The hallway is tile and so noise travels very easily. You can hear EVERYTHING from the hallway, people walking up and down, people opening and closing their doors, waiting for the elevator!! It was awful. All night long I could hear people talking in the hallway. When we left the room the next morning I left the disgusting stained pillow (stain facing up) on the floor by the door and when we came home it was back on the bed!!!! Also, the water started pouring out of the bathroom wall again!! This time way worse and it didnt stop, it looked like clean water but it wasn't ok! It was wetting half the bathroom floor. We had had enough!!! My husband went to the front desk and told them all of our issues and asked for a new room and with no issues at all they gave us a new one. This time we were one floor up and the hallway had carpet!!! Well that solved the noise problem instantly!! There was the same drain coming out of the wall in the bathroom but it didnt leak or pour water once. I did use the in room coffee and tea maker once and housekeeping did not clean the cup or sppon when they serviced the room. The fire alarm went off in the middle of the night for about 40min on and off but it was a false alarm. Other things to note: - Not many tv channels and only a few in english - no face wash cloths given in the bathroom - no pens or note pads in the room - 2 bottles of water provided each day PROS - Great price for Singapore - Located right above MRT station - Food court directly downstairs (mainly local food but a Wendy's) - New hotel - Triple room available CONS - Wifi is not free and you have to log on with a code each time and a new code every 24 hours, also each person with a laptop needs their own code - Uncomfortable beds and sheets - Very noisy", "Date": "July 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jurong, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cBrand new Hotel in Singapore and Location is accessible to MRT\u201d", "Author": "Flipzter", "ReviewID": "UR115111459", "Content": "Brand new Hotel in Singapore and Location is accessible to everything Booked a room here last 10-13 June, 2011 with a Premium Room and we booked another stay here last 25-27 June, 2011 for a Superior Room.

The worst part is that they do not do house cleaning 3 days in a row. What happened was, after I returned to hotel on the second day at around 9pm, the room was not cleaned. I complained to the reception and asked for clean towers (it's too late and I just wanted to rest).

Also there were very noisy groups of guests on the same floor shouting in the corridor all night long. The next day I asked for another room on another floor and was given a room on the 10th floor. This time it was better: the room had a in-room safe, a fridge, a working A/C and the floor was quieter. Had a good stayed for the 2 next days. The rooms are clean. They are also small but as I spent most of the time outside it was not an issue. The rooms are not well soundproof and noise from the corridor can be easily heard. The bathroom has no bathtub only a shower cabin. The water floods slightly from under the door of the cabin shower making the floor a bit slippery. Shampoo, shower gel, hair dryer are provided. A kettle, some tea and coffee are available. In-room wireless internet is chargeable. Internet stations are available at the lobby and are also chargeable. There is a long outdoor swimming pool.

After arrival, a door man helped us carry our luggage in, but when i asked him some questions, he told me \"no english\" (found out that he only speaks chinese). Hmm...i wonder if i am in the right country ;) Lobby/Receptionist - the lobby was a little small and was crowded that time, was even more surprised that the counter was also crowded, counted 8 receptionist, no one checking in but they seems all busy. When i checked in, the receptionist was very business like, give him ur confirmation slip, he'll ask for ur credit card (they only accept visa or mastercard), sign it, give you ur key and that's it. NO hello, hi, thank u. no greetings at all. Same as when we checked out. Tell them ur checking out, give them ur keys and then that's it. It didnt infom me that they are done doing the check out, until i ask. Noticed that more groups were checking in as the days goes by. They also have a free internet at the lobby. Around 3 computers. Sometimes you have to queue to use it. Lift - they have a security card for every level. just need to tap ur card key and press your floors. Rooms - very basic, Flat screen tv, 2 complimentary bottle water, pot, coffee and tea sachet. no safetey deposit box, no fridge. We booked the superior room, the rooms is small (i think our cruise cabin in royal caribbean is bigger) there's no space for extra bed at all. So there's the queen size bed, 1 side table, a ledge besides the window where u can put ur luggage there or a sitting area. The room is clean (not carpeted). Toilet is very basic too. Shower room is very small. Location - no complains. Exactly above the Lavender MRT station. Beside the hotel there's Wendy's and 24 hours Kopitiam (food court) and a lot of small snacks shop. Across the hotel, there are some neighbor hood shops. The hotel is a very basic, if your purpose is to sleep and as long as it's clean attitude, then this hotel is for you.
