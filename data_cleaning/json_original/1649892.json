The hotel was clean and very modern. The room had hardwood floors throughout and included all the amenities that I wanted: from a large flat screen, wireless and wired internet, a minibar, iron and ironing board, hair dryer and clock radio with an Ipod connection. I don't speak very much Spanish, but the hotel staff spoke English and they were very friendly. The staff were always available and eager to help. I was very concerned with safety and I felt extremely safe in this hotel. The room included a safe large enough for all of my valuables, including my laptop, which was very appreciated. The bed was comfortable, but the pillows were not as firm as I am used to, so this may be an issue for some people. I also appreciated that the TV included English channels, so I could get the news and some entertainment in English without having to focus solely on the internet. I also liked that the shower had a \"telephone\" showerhead so that I could avoid having the water in my face, since I was concerned about drinking the Mexican tap water and getting sick. I thought that the A/C was a bit noisy, but it was efficient and I started to get used to it after a few days there. I did not use the pool, but I had colleagues who did and they said it was great, although it was a bit cold. The restaurant also offered a breakfast buffet that could be included in the daily rate at a discount: $17.00 dollars/day added to your bill in advance vs. $25.00/day \"pay as you go\". Although I didn't eat breakfast at the hotel, I saw a lot of people doing so and the food looked and smelled good to me. The hotel bar was very nice and offers a outside patio complete with potted palm trees. I saw a lot of airline staff from various airlines using this hotel, so that is always a good sign that it is clean, safe and well run. In terms of cost, I paid $6,636.00 Mexican Pesos for 4 nights, which works out to $129.40 Canadian Dollars/night, an excellent deal in my opinion.", "Date": "March 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "East Anglia", "Title": "\u201cYou\u2019re probably not coming back anyway, and they couldn\u2019t care less if you don\u2019t...\u201d", "Author": "Michael424", "ReviewID": "UR125503955", "Content": "The only reason to stay in this hideously expensive, if brand-new, hotel might be the convenience of an elevator ride from the heart of Terminal 2, but the Camino Real or Hilton may have been just as handy and have provided a better experience after a long and tiring flight. Of course the rooms are nicely equipped, large, super-modern, super-quiet and clean (though we had a drainy smell in the high-tec bathroom) but why do these soulless places make no effort whatsoever to provide a welcome or any of the basics you\u2019d find in any backpacker hotel? Like, for example, a bottle or two of free water (only available in the minibar which you have to activate when registering); or free wi-fi (at an outrageous US$20), again pre-purchase-only. Even the coffee for the coffee-machine is safely locked up in the fridge! And we were unable to charge dinner in the restaurant to the room, but had to pay there and then. This lack of service mentality or respect for their guests extends to the bored, uninterested, totally unengaged and glacially slow reception staff, as so many others have commented. We were just abandoned when a ten-person flight crew arrived (after us) to check in. It is, by any standards, a disgrace to the NH name; all the problems reflect lack of management, particularly the check-in.

Mexico city int'l has 3 such hotels: The Camino Real, the Hilton and the NH. The Hilton has great service but the hotel is in serious need of a renovation and I've had a number of run ins with Bed Bugs theres which has forced me to steer clear. I haven't stayed at the Camino, but friends have said that for the price it is very tired and in need of a face-lift and some deep cleaning. This leaves the NH in terminal 2. My summary: The NH is new, clean and the rooms are very comfortable. The service is extremely poor. I had to wait from 9:30PM until 10:15PM in to check in. It would be one thing if the lines were long, but there were only 3 people in front of me. The amount of time it took to get people checked in was baffling. Suffice to say those of us waiting were tired and less than pleased. The room service was similar - the staff at the front desk informed me that they would have timely room service in them morning as the restaurant did not open until 6AM (IE when everyone's early flights leave). I put in my request for an early coffee and breakfast. When it did not arrive the next morning on time, I figured they'd just be a bit late. A few minutes before I left the room to make my flight, I got a call asking if I still wanted the room service I'd ordered. I kindly stated no and took the time to have it removed from my bill. No one was rude and the rooms again, were very clean and comfortable. I guess I was just disappointed that such a decent operation had such poor service.

At final out flight was cancelled and we stayed there for 2 nights, so I could comment a bit more deeply. The hotel is new and modern and it is very nice. It is a big hotel (287 rooms) with a perfect noise isolation, so very good quality sleep. Room are modern and very clean. It is a bit pricy but it is perfect to stay onenight before taking a flight. The problem is the service, very far from professional and good level. The swimming pool, on every advertising of the hotel are closed. Breakfast is until 12 but on our first day at 11.20 it was closed because they had a lunch... Business center close at 9 p.m.and open at 9 a.m., not so udeful for a hotel where often people stay for one night. You have to pay for everything even it is yet pricy. They charge you for internet connection (in Mexico always it is free), for coffee maker in the room, for bottle of water (always complimentary). They blocked 180 euros on my credit card as a grant for minibar etcetera and they didn't gave me minibar key (yes, it has a key...) As a resume I say it is very good for one night because you can find a very good and quite room, but don't expect a high level service. I don't recommend their restaurant, go down on arrival level and have a wonderful dinner at \"La Mansion\"!", "Date": "January 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cIdeal hotel for early flight from T2 : superior to Camino Real and Fiesta Americana.

Having read the bad reviews on this site I was dreading staying here but since we had an early flight from Terminal 2 we didn't want to waste 20 mins getting there from the other hotels. I cannot understand the bad reviews. The hotel is lovely, check-in staff were charming, the room was large, clean, and modern, the beds were very comfortable. Good bathroom. Good working air-conditioning. Lovely open-air pool and 24hr gym. We arrived mid- evening and had eaten on the plane and had an early morning flight so we didn't need the restaurant so I can't comment on the food. The checkout was speedy and efficient, and complimentary coffee in the lobby was available. The Camino Real is horrible - rooms are tired and drab in comparison, and staff charge huge corkage if you want to open your own bottle of wine. The pool is pathetic and indoors, which is awful on a lovely day. I would not stay there again unless I had very early T1 flight. The Fiesta Americana is offsite with outdoor pool and decent restaurant with decent rooms and I would rather stay there than Camino Real if leaving at a reasonable hour from Terminal 1.", "Date": "January 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brussels, Belgium", "Title": "\u201cNice but with some problems\u201d", "Author": "Pysiu", "ReviewID": "UR92066182", "Content": "The only reason I stayed in this hotel was because I had an early layover the following day.

I had previously stayed at the Hilton hotel in Terminal 1 and found it to be noisy, smelly and old, like the other reviews for it I had seen on TripAdvisor. So, I booked my room for the week at the NH Hotel T2 and secured a junior suite for $190 a night (same price as Hilton's normal rooms). The suite consisted of 2 rooms, with beautiful hardwood floors, a living room, a bedroom, 1 full bathroom with shower AND bath and toilet and 1 other bathroom off the living room. In other words, there was PLENTY of space for me and my things. The king bed was very comfortable and the Euro-styling of the rooms is great - very minimalist design. For $190 a night, I found this room to be a great deal. And contrary to the previous reviews I saw on this hotel, the service was VERY good and everyone was extremely attentive to my requests and needs. I think that they have cleaned up their act in this area... To be balanced in this review - some downsides to mention were: 1) poorly lit gym (it is lit mostly by the natural skylight so if you go before the sun comes up, you can't see what you are doing very well 2) restaurant only offers \"Americanized\" food - I wanted to have some Mexican food in Mexico and the restaurant was very short on such offerings. 3) They have a mini-fridge in the room with drinks in it (a \"mini-bar\" of sorts) but it wasn't plugged in! I had to lift the heavy minifridge out of the cabinet, move it across the living room and plug it in! Further, when you take your key out of the Euro-style lighting activator when you leave for the day, the mini-fridge turns off beceause the power to the room is deactivated without the room key stuck in the \"slot\" by the door. 4) The coffee maker in the room was very plain and there was no sugar or milk to put in the coffee. I don't need much when I stay in a hotel and so if you are a self sufficient traveler who just wants a stylish, clean, tidy and spacious room to stay in, then I fully recommend this hotel vs. the Hilton. I am not going to compare this hotel to other hotels IN Mexico City, as that is not fair. I am only comparing this hotel to the Hilton in T1 of the airport as that is apples to apples comparison.
