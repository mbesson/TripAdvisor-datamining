Worst hotel I ever stayed at and DEFINATELY not worth 4 stars, at the most 1 star although I hesitate if they even deserve a star. Rooms are dirty, once we arrived, after checking in we had to go downstairs to ask if they could clean our room. Hairs of the people before us in the bed and bathroom, mould everywhere in the bathroom, shower was to discusting to shower in, television didn't work, toilet leaked, everything was old and it seemed as if they had not cleaned the room for the last year. Unfortunately we booked for 5 days and in these 5 days they did make up the bed (if you leave your room before 09.30) but never cleaned the bed so we were lying underneath the same sheets for 5 days, and that for a 4 star hotel?!? Bed's are as hard as the floor and all exist out of 1-person beds so you can hardly call it a double bed. If you have any issues with your back I would definately not advise this hotel eather. Breakfast was terrible too and service? I think they have never heard of the word service before. Regarding the location, it isn't nearby the city at all, the hotel isn't even on the tourist map that's how far away it is from the city center. At least 45min. to the center and there is only 1 bus going there a few times per hour. The hotel is in the middel of a neighbourhood where there is nothing to do at all. We will NEVER EVER stay there again and advise anyone NOT to eather. It's a shame that this website represents this hotel, the foto's aren't even like the hotel looks at all.

The most important thing lacking was a safe. I repeat, there is NO SAFE in any of the rooms in the hotel. The rude desk staff informed me that it was 5 Euros a day to place something in their safety deposit box. I will also mention here that my bag, on the first day, was moved, opened, and looked though by the cleaning staff. I had read a review from another guest who stated that his bags were also given a once over. The rooms were not filthy, but not a standard of clean that I find acceptable. The glasses in the room were dirty, as was the shower, and just about everything in the bathroom. My balcony consisted of stained outdoor carpeting, and a broken table with no chairs, and a perfect view of the hotel next door. There were no windows in the room, only the door to the balcony (which could not be fully opened.) The breakfast consisted of cold hardboiled eggs, coffee, some hams and yogurts. It was not good, but other than the eggs, not terrible, except for the fact that every piece of silverware was dirty, as were the glasses and most of the plates. The hotel is in a suburb of Rome, and is miles away from any attraction. Again, do not believe their website. I was lucky enough to be with a tour group who bussed us into the city.

The only transport out of this hotel into the heart of Rome is either a taxi or a bus stop up the road. The problem is that the bus system is erratic and inconsistent. You may get to Rome via the bus, but good luck getting back to the Hotel. The return bus is lost in space somewhere and no one knows why. Getting back may cost you about 20-30 euros via cab. The room itself was cramped, cluttered, smelly, and quite uncomfortable. The beds were like brick cushions, the sheets were paper thin, and the pillows were weak. Carpets in the room were peeling and the wallpaper was laughable. The bathroom was deplorable. There is no normal shower with curtains, as you have to hold the detachable showerhead with one hand and wash your body with the other in this small 2x2 tub as if you were in a third world country. Obviously since there is no shower curtain, water gets spilled all over the floor. Not my problem, since the Hotel wasn't smart enough or were too cheap to put a basic curtain above the tub. To top it off, the radiator was broken which left the room scorching hot. The knob to turn it off was broken of course, and no one from the staff was willing to come up and fix it -- so we were stuck with leaving the window open all night which didn't help much.

The older gentleman who was cleaning in the lobby was a nice exception, always smiling and a polite difference to the rest of the very self-important receptionist.

In both cases; be there before 20.30 to be sure you get a table. Its also a nice area to come \"home\" to after the busy city center, and the air is somewhat better. The Bus 360 is freqent from morning to midnight and a weekly travel card which also covers the underground is only E 16 for seven days. To sum it up - if you can stand the rather sad, dull and unhelpfull personel the hotel can be an alternative. If so, look out for discount prices.

Some rooms are smelly with cockroaches. We arrived to the hotel just after midnight. The scene at the reception counter was simptomatic of our stay: an enraged man banging his fists on the counter, demanding a different room. I thought that this guest was about to have a stroke, and the meek boy behind the counter probably thought the same and gave this man a key to a different room. When the man stomped away and we had a chance to present ourselves in front of the boy, he said that he realised his mistake because he gave the man a key to our room and the hotel is fully booked. So we got the room about which the man complained earlier. Before we went to the room, another guest has arrived at the desk, asking to change the room. This time, the lady said that the room is so smelly, she is affraid she could pass out. The boy said that she already changed the room once, to which she replied that she had to, when cockroaches started crawling all over her as she went to bed. With this introduction we went to see our room. Around 1am, with the only room available at this hotel we did not have much choice. Needless to say, the room did not look like any of the 4 stars we have stayed at previously. Two tiny beds, leaking shower. At least it did not smell and we did not see any roaches. The problems restarted in the morning. At around 6am, a large group of hotel guests was gathering to leave for some organised tour. Although they spoke in hushed tones, I could hear every word, until they left at around 7am. After that the cleaning ladies arrived, who never shut up, so we just go up and went to have breakfast. Since many people were checking out that day, we were given a different room, which on the face of it, looked a lot better than the first. Unfortunately, the quality of the walls was the same, and some nice Japanese ladies in the next room, probably suffering from a jet lag kept talking through the night and did not react to the requests to keep quiet (it was 3am) passed on to them through the reception and my personal request - I also think that the problem was that they could not speak any of the languages I tried with them other than Japanese (which I do not speak) and since they were talking quietly, they probably could not understand what the problem was. At the end, my wife just started banging on the wall with her shoes at around 4.30am and it surprisingly worked. So we got some good sleep for about 2.5 hours, until the cleaning ladies arrived.

After reading the reviews on this site I tried to change my booking but should not have been put off. The hotel was in a quiet area out of the city, there was a regular bus service into town and we bought a 16euro weekly ticket which does the metro too. The staff in the hotel were always very pleasant and helpful and the rooms were lovely and very clean. There were some lovely restraunts within walking distance which had excellant food at very good prices. All in all we had a great holiday and would definately return to this hotel again.", "Date": "February 1, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cambridgeshire, England", "Title": "\u201cNever again!!!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1439095", "Content": "The worst hotel I have ever stayed in, in my entire life.
