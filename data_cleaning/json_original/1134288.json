At chek in I was informed that rooms didn't have bathroom inside but only one bathroom for floor (always occupied). This is not written in expedia site. When I arrived in my room I found a lady eating curry chiken inside, she went away immediately leaving horrible smell for all the day. Finally I found another hotel and I went away.

This is a budget hotel and the room and bathrooms were clean and sufficient. However a window fell out of the room and it took two hours to get a response from the hotel staff to get something down about repairs.They said the housemaid would sit in the room to look after my gear, as I had already missed one appointment while I waited for maintainance staff. I returned to my room to pick up something I needed to find the maid gone, the room not secure and still not repairs being done.Eventually the window was repaired but still not lockable.. and this was not a neighbourhood where I wanted to stay without security.The issue of security left a bad taste, as I was aware this was a budget hotel and given that was delighted with everything else.If you dop stay here.... check that the windows do lock!", "Date": "Aug 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR270489058", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "AnnieNZ"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60713-d1134288-r19364263-Encore_Express-San_Francisco_California.html", "HotelID": "1134288", "Price": "$104"}}
