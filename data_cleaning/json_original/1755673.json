I know what superb service looks like--and this unpretentious and inexpensive little hotel in the shadow of Seattle's Space Needle has it in spades. My husband had to attend a conference and this was the only place that had room on short notice. I decided to hitch along but wasn't expecting much--I thought, \"Oh, here we go. Another eminently forgettable cookie-cutter hotel for middle managers on the road.\" This was anything but. The location in Belltown is terrific--easy walking distance to downtown Seattle and Pike Place Market; next door to the Space Needle and monorail; and close to some of Seattle's best new restaurants (try Black Bottle and Serious Pie. Yum.) From the moment we crossed the threshold--and we were pretty frazzled after a stressful drive down the I-5 in an unexpected snowstorm--we felt genuinely welcomed. And that attitude continued throughout our stay--the front desk staff made eye contact and greeted us warmly every single time we came within range. Our room (#811) was large, well-designed and tastefully decorated. A bar-fridge and coffeemaker is always a bonus. In fact, we joked that with the addition of a hot-plate, we could move right in and live there! I sleep with earplugs, so the traffic noise didn't bother me at night, but my husband remarked on it being the only downside of the place. The included breakfast was also unexpectedly good--the breakfast room is large and bright and the quality of the offerings--ham-and-eggers, fresh fruit, bagels, choice of juices etc.--sure beat the danish-wrapped-in-cellophane you usually get at these sort of business-friendly hotels. Because I hadn't booked the place, I made an extra effort to find out how much our room cost. I was staggered by how low the price was for what we got and even sought out the manager to tell him how impressed I was by everything we'd experienced and that I wish he would give lessons to every other hotel brand out there in how to do it right! We will definitely be back--and not just for business. An all-round jewel of a hotel!", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cVery enjoyable stay, lots of helpful staff\u201d", "Author": "lanid", "ReviewID": "UR126427031", "Content": "My son and I stayed here for one night on a quick getaway.

The Hyatt Place was a great location to walk to the Center and avoid the traffic and parking hassles in this busy, urban area. The Hyatt Place lobby and public spaces are very attractive and inviting. The front desk staff were friendly and accommodating. There are no bell staff, however, to help with luggage. There are luggage carts parked near the front door that you can use to cart your own bags to your room. There only seem to be two, however, and they disappear quickly on check out mornings. The hotel parking garage is pricey ($20 a day) and involves a complicated system of key cards and gates. But it beats paying to park near Seattle Center. The room was very attractive and included a refrigerator but no microwave. There was no in room safe. We had one King Bed that is separated from the sitting area. There was one large, HD television with state of the art AV connections if you have a portable DVD player. The wireless Internet was free and fairly fast. The bath room only had a shower. They only provided three towels for a family of four, so we had to stop at the front desk to ask for more. The shower also ran out of hot water with minutes the first night we were there. One of the reasons my wife selected the Hyatt was that it was one of the only ones in the downtown area that had a pool. The pool and exercise room are located on the main floor. The pool is fairly large, but shallow. It was three feet 10 inches at it's deepest end. It was also wasn't very warm although the front desk assured us that it was kept at 81 degrees. There is no hot tub/spa. The Hyatt does offer a free breakfast with breakfast sandwiches, cereals, pancakes, waffles, fresh fruit and yogurt. Be warned that it is a free for all on weekends and seating space can be a premium. Although the Hyatt is located near the Seattle Center, the restaurant choices located within walking distance are pretty limited. Five of the six listed on their Web site are actually out of business. So plan on driving if you want to have dining choices.

Everything about it. This was my second time there. Both times with my family. (2 kids 4 and 6 years old). Good service, the front desk called me in the first 30 minutes to make sure I liked my room. I also liked the security in the elevator where you need a room key to operate it. Breakfast is included and is sooo convenient, and if you have small kids you appreciate the variety and convenience. We took advantage of the complimentary shuttle bus which drove us to Pike Place Market and picked us up from Pacific Place Mall downtown. The hotel is short walking distance to the Pacific Science Museum, Space Needle and EMP. The Walgreen's across the street is convenient and the surrounding neighborhood has a variety of restaurants to choose from. Just ask the front desk to recommend something. If there is nothing you like within walking distance, they will recommend a place where the shuttle bus can take you. I didn't visit the pool this trip, but I did use the fitness gym on 2 occasions. The equipment is great, very modern and very clean. Even the gym towels they have there are very soft and of good quality. The room was clean and spacious, the large tv was great, but if I had to complain about anything, it's the size of the bathroom.

We simply got it to take us to our downtown destinations (or as close as it would & walked the rest of the way). Then when we were ready to go back to the hotel we just call the front desk and request the shuttle pick us up. We never waited more than 5 -10mins for the shuttle at to pick us up at any destination. Location- Some people criticize that the hotel is not located close enough to downtown, but I think the location worked out great. It is a block away from the Space Needle, Seattle Center, and Experience Music Project museum (in this area is station for the monorail too which will drop you off downtown). Plus, there is a Walgreen located across the street in case you forgot to bring anything in your suitcase. Room & Parking- We stayed in a King room that came with a pullout sofa bed and had a view of the Space Needle. The room was clean, the bed was nice, the t.v was big and swiveled to either side of the room so you could watch it from the bed or the couch. As for parking, this is what sold us on this hotel. They use a parking garage and allow you to park your own car, you are not required to use valet like a lot of the hotels in the area (its $15 a night here verses $30-35 a night at the valet only hotels). The garage seemed really safe, you have to use your room key to open the gate to enter and exit the garage. Also, you cannot access the stairs or floors above the lobby via the elevator without swiping your room key which is a neat safety feature--just make sure to ask for two room keys when you check in if you plan on separating(don't want to be stuck without one).", "Date": "December 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Yakima, Washington", "Title": "\u201cExceeded Expectations\u201d", "Author": "jblizard", "ReviewID": "UR121707963", "Content": "King room with a pull out couch.

The room had a good working desk & chair, excellent lighting, ample outlets and connections, good wireless and a huge TV. The bed is comfortable and they use pretty good linens for a hotel in this range. I also like the big sectional sofa. Unlike many hotels where you just have a yucky chair, the sofa is actually pretty inviting. Bathroom was the usual, nice shower, good amenities. Love that Hyatt always provides toothpaste. Much better amenity than a shower cap! Continental breakfast was ok, the usual stuff. Hyatt Place lets you order hot items from a computer kiosk. The quality of the eggs I ordered was pretty bad - overcooked with congealed cheese. Ew. (I complained and it was taken off my bill.) The free coffee was fine; I think you can order Starbucks, although in Seattle, why would you get it at a hotel. There is coffee everywhere. My one issue with this hotel is that it's pretty far from downtown and the neighborhood felt a little transitional. Hotel has a shuttle which will take you within a 1 mile radius which is a nice service. It is right across from the Space Needle (which I could see from my room, very cool!) so if you're there for vacation, this will not be a worry. All in all, a nice stay and a pleasant hotel.

PROS: *Location: Close to water front, downtown, Seattle Center. Also the hotel shuttle operates 24 hours a day and will take you within a 1 mile radius anywhere you want to go (which actually gives you lots of options if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to walk, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rainy, etc.). In the immediate area are grocery store, restaurants, drug store, etc. *Very clean property. *Staff was helpful. *Gym was not bad (small but new equipment and very clean). Wish they had a hot tub or spa as well since it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s often cold and wet in Seattle. *Breakfast: Decent continental selection. Personally I would like if they would start earlier on weekdays (say 6am) but at least they have coffee out earlier so a plus there. Some Hyatt places I have been to offer one or two hot things complimentary (like an egg sandwich) but not all: this one does not but you can pay for hot food at a reasonable cost. *Parking \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I think $15 is reasonable for the location and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very secure and easy in/out. Just know the spaces are small so big SUVs will take some maneuvering to park. *Rooms: Very spacious for an in-city hotel and the separate sitting area is nice. Nice flat screen with lots of channels that can be turned towards sitting area or bed. Good work desk, big shower. I also have a few considerations for this (see section below) *Business Center: A couple pc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s you can use and a printer for boarding passes, etc. No charge for that or the secure wireless internet in your room. CONS/CONSIDERATIONS: *Neighborhood: As in any big city, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a mixed bag. Immediate area is fine (in fact revitalized) however, you can walk a couple blocks and it be in a more seedy area. *Noisy Location: Agree with other reviewers, you will hear traffic, party goers (in a nightlife and apartment area) so bring ear plugs if that bothers you. *Rooms: Kind of a strange layout (not a big deal just some personal preferences). Work desk does not have a way to look at the tv (not that I should watch tv when at desk but I like to). The mini fridge and drawers are by the work desk. Closet is very small and tight next to the sink and hard to squeeze your suit case in there but the plus is, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a nice big space for a city room. *Climate Control: Wow, it is quite fancy and updated electronic unit and I figured mine out (with the instructions they provide and some trial and error) but I know several folks struggled with it. Sometimes I think simple can be better. BOTTOM LINE: I would possibly stay here again if wanting to be in the general downtown area. The price is reasonable compared to other hotels in the area of the same caliber. You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get high end amenities but you also don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay high-end prices.", "Date": "November 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cHotel has huge noise problems\u201d", "Author": "salanator", "ReviewID": "UR120250647", "Content": "The rooms are comfortable and the staff are nice.

Upon check in i asked for a room facing the Space Needle as I had read to do from the recommendations on trip advisor. The lady informed me that if i wanted to be on the space needle side i would have to pay $25 for an upgrade for anything on the fourth floor and up. A room was available on the second floor but she warned me the traffic noise from Denny Way might be audible as it was close to the corner. I asked for a free upgrade but she said that wasn't possible. From what i understood the only thing better about the rooms on the higher floors is that they were higher up and may have had a better view. In years and years of checking into hotels I've never had a hotel deny a free upgrade if a room was available. I said i would sign up for the rewards program etc but there was no changing her mind. The room was nice although you could hear some traffic noise. The rooms have a functional layout aside from the sink being outside of the bathroom area. Normally that wouldn't be a bad thing but the sink is at the foot of the bed so it is loud if someone else is sleeping. We found the room to be very large and the TV was a nice 42 inch flat screen. The shower unfortunately, was not clean and neither was the floor of the bathroom. Little curly hairs were all over the shower and bathroom floor. We reported this to the front desk and they said they could send someone to clean it but we decided we were too tired at that point to wait around for that to happen. The other downer about the room was the bed. The beds are very soft and if you are not used to that you will not sleep well. Both my girlfriend and i woke up feeling sore. The last thing which was more of an annoyance than anything was the bathroom door. It squeaked and creaked like crazy. It was SO LOUD it was almost funny. We told the front desk about it and they said they would have someone look at it but upon returning to our room a few hours later it still sounded like a rusty dungeon gate. It was halloween so didn't bother asking it again...it suited the time of year. The hotel offers a nice pool and work out gym but no hot tub our sauna. Continental breakfast is served free every morning but if you are not there for business you will probably miss it as we were told it's only available from 6 to 9am. If you are there to rest and relax like we were, you won't get to taste it. Food is available for sale in the lobby area but there is no room service. Thankfully there are some nice restaurants in the area. The hotel charges $15 dollars per night for parking and although it's not a bad price, it's not a great price either. Other hotels like the Holiday Inn a block away charge only $10 for the same type of underground parking. There are many cheaper parking options around the hotel all within a two block radius. In general the Hyatt Place Seattle is a nice hotel but a lot of little things started adding up.

We bought some cheese and wine from a winery tour, and as we had some left it was great to put it away for later. There was also a lounge area that was spacious and nice to relax in instead of having to sit just on the bed. The huge flat screen TV was also a bonus. I had requested a view of the Needle and I got just that - what a view at night! The bed was very comfortable and the pillows were just right and I slept very well. Loved the shower, huge shower head and nice hot water!! I enjoyed this hotel, nothing seemed to be a problem, the free 24 hour shuttle service was really good, as the main center of town was quite a walk. The shuttle drivers were very good, dropping you within a mile anywhere from the hotel. They even came to collect you later when you call them. Another bonus is the free internet access in your room and free local calls. This made it easy to book things for me as I did not have a mobile phone in the US. Breakfast was fine, fresh fruit and yoghurts, cereals, bagels, muffins and juices - all fresh. Coffee was available offered by the way of help yourself in the mornings and you could even take one with you. You could order a hot breakfast for a small fee if you wanted to. There was a small bar area where you could order a drink or a coffee and a samll selection of food and soft drinks that you could purchase. The staff were very attentive and polite, helping you with anything you required. I loved this hotel and would recommend it to all and also happy to stay there again. Well done Hyatt Place, we had a lovely stay in your city.", "Date": "September 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dixon CA", "Title": "\u201cSpotless and Great Service\u201d", "Author": "travelresearcher22", "ReviewID": "UR118214403", "Content": "Our son just moved to Seattle and lives in the Belltown area so we were looking for a place near the Seattle Space Needle to be walking distance from his apartment.

Check in was fast and efficient. One of the workers took the TONS of baggage to our rooms. Not only did he unload it, but he also took 5 minutes to tell us everything about our room. (Including how to work the heat/AC.) He was extremely nice. (We ended up giving him a $20 tip because of how great he was!!) ROOMS: Our king bed rooms were FABULOUS! They were very large with a large sofa, desk and chair. The area where the small refrigerator was had a granite counter top with coffee maker, tea, etc. The bathroom was very small and a little awkward when using the toilet facilities, but the shower was soooo roomy that I didn't care about the awkward set-up. The vanity was outside of the bathroom and large enough for 2 people to use at one time. The room was extremely clean. Nice t.v., VERY, VERY comfortable bed. We were on the 8th floor, so it was pretty quiet with an occasional siren or 2. BREAKFAST: The breakfast area put my kitchen to shame! There was plenty of delicious food (fruit, yogurt, cereal, oj, etc.) with the option of buying a hot breakfast if you wanted. Plenty of room to sit down and enjoy breakfast. Very clean and items were continuously stocked. FOOD BAR: One evening, we didn't feel like going to a restuarant to eat dinner, so we ate at the little \"bar\" they had by the front desk. We ordered hamburgers and breakfast items. We were shocked at the reasonable cost and thought for sure the food wouldn't be that tasty. We were stunned to discover that the food was made right there by the front desk staff and IT WAS QUITE GOOD. STAFF: This is an area where the hotel SHINES! Everyone here went out of their way to be friendly and helpful. We did not talk to one unhappy employee. The staff even took time to have personal conversations with us during our \"bar\" meal and the other guests who were there. No question went unanswered and always with a smile. FREE SHUTTLE: This is another HUGE plus for the hotel. They will take you anywhere within 1 mile of the hotel, which is very liberal. We were taken to the Space Needle and Pikes Market. We NEVER had to wait for the shuttle, even when we called from the Space Needle to be picked up. They were always there within minutes. The shuttle drivers were friendly and always went out of their way to answer questions. Marina in particular was AMAZING! She gave us FABULOUS tips on where to go and how to get there when we were dropped off. She was friendly and kind, going out of her way to accomodate us as much as possible. CHECK OUT: A breeze!

The location of the hotel is OK, it's on the edge of Belltown which has nice tree-lined streets and many shops; but 6th Ave NE and Denny appears to be roughly the border to a much grittier part of town. It is walking distance to nearly all important tourist attractions with particular proximity to the Space Needle. They also have a shuttle available to take you to sites within 1 mile (we did not use this). The staff was excellent; friendly and responsive although I felt bad for them as the desk staff also appears to man the adjacent breakfast bar and can be observed racing from latte preparation to checkout. They did it with a smile -- great for them; but not great staff planning. Basic breakfast items are free and they have a separate breakfast nook which seemed busy each morning. One of the mornings we took in breakfast they ran out of clean spoons, cups and bowls. Also during our stay one of the elevators malfunctioned and was out of service for a time.

The chain is more like a Hyatt Junior, which is perfectly fine. We don't need all the fancy extras a normal Hyatt would have had. The location is great, just 3 blocks or so from the Space Needle. If you want to go anywhere else downtown they provide a free shuttle service that will take you anywhere within a mile 24 hours a day. We used it many times and never had to wait more than 10 minutes to be picked up. Great if you want to do all the tourist stuff downtown without having to worry about parking. The room was very spacious, clean, and comfortable. There's a great 42-inch TV in the room with HD programming, which was great. Usually when I'm at a hotel with a flat-screen TV there's not HD service, so it sort of defeats the purpose. The beds were VERY comfortable. Free Wi-Fi and printing. Awesome. There's free breakfast in the morning with the usual items (cereal, oatmeal, fruit, yogurt, bagels, etc.) and the option to buy hot foods as well. There's no room service, but food is available to buy 24 hours a day in the lobby. We ordered dinner there one night and, though it took too long (20+ minutes) it was worth it. And they offered free drinks for the delay. Overall, one of the best hotels I've stayed at in this star range. Especially for the price.

Upon check-in, we were greeted very warmly by the front desk staff. Shinobu was exceptionally courteous and attentive. She gave us a map of the area and information on how to use the hotel's free shuttle (but tip the drivers, please), the monorail, and the light rail system. Our room was located just off the elevator area, but we did not have any trouble with noise while we were sleeping. We had a clean, well-appointed room with 2 queen beds and a sofabed (used all three). The sofabed was a comfortable one. It was easy to adjust the temperature in the room. Hyatt Place has the right idea in designing a room that is both comfortable and user-friendly. Our only concern was that there were no treads in the bathtub and all three of us slipped in the shower. We ended up purchasing a bath mat from the Walgreen's across the street. Oh, yes, having the Walgreen's across the street was extremely helpful for getting those few items we forgot from home. The complimentary breakfast at this Hyatt Place was continental in nature... mostly starches. Fruit and yogurt were also available. There was also a self-serve kiosk where you could order a hot meal that would be ready within several minutes. Several spaces for seating were available in both the kitchen area and the lobby area. The location of the hotel was convenient enough. It's just a few city blocks to the Space Needle and the EMP. We made use of the hotel's shuttle to get as close to Pike Place market and the Washington State Ferry Terminal as possible. We took the monorail from the Space Needle to Westlake Station and then got on the light rail system to get to the Seattle Mariners game. Easy to navigate the public transportation we made use of.

The rooms are spacious with a large seating area and a wall mounted flat screen television that can be swung to allow viewing from the bed. The bed is behind a partition which gives the illusion of a separated bed/living space even though it is technically still one room. Free wifi which I expect now in every hotel I stay in was indeed available and was pretty reliable. There was the typical desk and small coffee/fridge station available which is handy for storing snacks, water and in our case some nice PNW wines. The bathroom consisted of a sink and mirror in the bedroom with a separate toilet/shower room. I am not a big fan of this kind of layout as it makes the shower/WC seem very dark and claustrophobic to me, but it was clean. The walls do appear to be a bit thin. We did hear noise from an adjoining room and from the hallway, but nothing that lasted into the night or disturbed our sleep. We were also on one of the higher floors so we were not disturbed by any street noise. We tend to ask for higher rooms whenever we book hotels, view or no view, for that reason alone. The Space Needle is an easy walk away, we bought a pass that would allow us access the the viewing deck twice within a 24 hour period. This location allowed us to easily take advantage of seeing the view from the Needle in both daylight and at night (highly recommend, the city is beautiful at night). There is a continental breakfast available with a limited dining area or other grouped seating areas in the lobby, for extra $ there are some hot food choices. I personally am not a big fan of continental breakfasts or limited breakfast choices in the expanded menu (I like to choose how my eggs are cooked) but for those who want the convenience it is available. We chose to walk to CJ's Eatery a great breakfast place in Belltown on our way to explore the waterfront. We did a lot of walking while in town, Pike Place Market and the downtown shopping are a bit of a walk away, there is a shuttle service or you can walk a couple of blocks and take the monorail into downtown. A tip for the first time visitor, a great alternative to the harbour cruises is a return trip to Bainbridge Island, less than $7.00 per person for a walk-on return ferry ride with those amazing views of the city is a steal. The area around the hotel seemed safe enough, even when we walked around in the evening (dark) but like any city there are sketchy areas where you may not feel comfortable. Our only real issue was the size of the hotel parking spaces. The parking is underground and shared with another building (you must look for the spots designated as hotel spots on each level) and the spots are VERY narrow. We were driving a mid-sized car and even parking that when the lot was fuller could be a challenge. We saw many SUVs taking up more than one spot in the parking lot or dangerously close to a concrete pole and the car next to it.

Parking is nextdoor in a parking garage which connects to the hotel underground and is shared by a condo complex. It cost us $10 per day, which is actually much cheaper than other hotels in the area.

Speaking of food, the frontdesk maintains a small snack area with desserts, drinks, and the like, which are nice but somewhat costly. A cheaper alternative is to walk across the street to the new Walgreens and buy something there. Speaking of savings, on the day of checkout, I drove 5 miles to a Costco and purchased three $100 Hyatt gift certificates for only $79.95 each. This saved us over $60 off the final bill at checkout. Ask the front desk staff if you have a rate that allows for such gift certificates to be used however before you do this. When we asked we were told that our room was fine for this type of transaction but that rooms booked through Priceline, Hotwire, and other \"brokers\" do not allow for this because the funds are apparenlty not paid directly to Hyatt.

Self service check in kiosks, make your own breakfast bar, modern, hip, cool lobby areas, etc. The main thing I would say they need to improve upon is the breakfast. The included breakfast was basically an option of fruit and bread. (bagels, cereal, muffins, toast) It would be nice to have some eggs, turkey, bacon, etc as an option without having to pay more.

I would stay here again if I could get a good rate.", "Date": "July 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cNew and quiet place to stay next to Seattle Center\u201d", "Author": "Louise55555", "ReviewID": "UR67137988", "Content": "We stayed in a mini suite with a sitting area and view of Puget Sound and the Space Needle that was tastefully decorated with a good choice of colors.

The downsides are that the staff are still learning about the hotel, the windows don't open, the free breakfast is nothing special, and the location is a bit far from downtown cultural attractions and sport stadiums.
