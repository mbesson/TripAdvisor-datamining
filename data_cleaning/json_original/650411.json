It was very clean, though the room was a bit hot and the air con didn't seem to work, so we had the windows open all the time. similar to a travelodge but a bit better. Very helpful staff and very comprehensive breakfast. We couldn't get hold of the email or phone number to pre book the shuttle and as arrived lat, about midnight we got a taxi. After that we bought a 72 hour travel ticket from the hotel. This allows you on buses, underground and trains and also took us to the airport from the hotel on the 171 bus. It is about 40mins out of the city, but easy traveling on bus and Ubahn. I'd definitely recommend this hotel.", "Date": "March 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Preston", "Title": "\u201cClean and Friendly\u201d", "Author": "Mark87008", "ReviewID": "UR126532211", "Content": "Stopped at the Azimut whilst on a 4 day break in Berlin - was a bit worried at first as it seemed a bit out of the centre. This however is not the case and the fantastic transport system enables easy travel. On arrival at the airport there is a bus that stops right outside the hotel on the other side and leaves from right outside the terminal literally 2 minutes walk from arrivals. The stop is Storchenweg ( every stop is advertised on a display inside the bus ). It is about 17 stops from the airport and took us about 20 mins. The bus number is 171. I would recommend buying a welcome/travelcard before travel as this makes it so easy on arrival!!!! you can order and have it delivered to UK, this then only needs validating on arrival and is something you do need for travel on any public transport! The hotel itself in my opinion was clean and the staff very helpful, the rooms are clean and very much to the standard of a Travelodge. We booked bed and breakfast. The breakfast has a decent selection \u2013 cereal, yoghurts,fruit,plenty of cheeses and cooked meat, a decent selection of breads.Hot food wise its limited to sausage,mini type burgers,beans and scrambled egg but I found it very adequate before a day out and about. Never went into the bar but it has free wi-fi, pool table and Sky. I believe free wi-fi is provided on level 2&3.The hotel is literally 1 minutes walk from a McDonalds and a couple of minutes from an Aldi.To the other side is a pizza and pasta restaurant but did not try it. I found the surrounding area to be decent. It will take about 15 mins to walk to the nearest U-Bahn station which is Johannisthaler Chausee, this is right next to a big shopping centre. The other option is catch a bus and get off at another U-Bahn but I didnt do this. The walk is all on the main road and while the area near the station may seem dodgy I dont believe this to be the case. It takes about 30-40 mins to get into the centre obviously depending where you are going. I can recommend the Berlin Subway I-phone app which is a great help. We found a few good restaurants in the Hackescher Market area selling German fare. Make sure you try a currywurst at some point!!! We also went to watch Hertha BSC v Bayern Munich and if you are a football fan its well worth the visit!!!", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madrid, Spain", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "LauE", "ReviewID": "UR120410242", "Content": "I stayed here for 3 nights and had a very pleasant experience. I share some details here: - Transportation: Bus 171 leaves every 10-20 minutes or so depending on the weekday and time of the day. The station is about 100-200 meters from the hotel, across the street. You get off at any of the metro stations along the route (Grenzallee, Neukolln, Hermannplatz). It takes about 40 minutes to get to the center, but if you'll be out of the hotel for the whole day, it doesn't hurt to be that far way. There're a metro station like 20 minutes away, but I never tried it. - Iron/ironing board: they won't provide one in your room, but the have an ironing room close to the reception. - Wi-fi: I used it once, it worked prefectly, although only in the lobby. Price was fair: 2\u20ac for 30 minutes, 3\u20ac for 1 hour and I think 7,50\u20ac for a day. - Airport Shuttle: I had to call and email the hotel a couple of times to arrange our shuttle, but they finally confirmed a couple of days before my flight. I was worried they wouldn't provide it, since our flight arrive almost at midnight. The driver was there on-time, he was very nice and helpful, and speaks perfect english. It was a short ride to the hotel. - Neighborhood: it seems to be a residential area, but the street is quite commercial (in a good way). McDonalds is next door, so we had breakfast there everyday. If you have a german phone #, you can use their wi-fi for free (you receive the network password via SMS). There's also plenty of restaurants around, and from others reviews I read, they seem to be pretty good. - Bedoom: Bedroom was small, but had everything one could need: small closet, huge mirror (besides the one in the bathroom), desk, chair, small sofa, a place to put your lugagge... I'd say it was \"smart-small\" :P. Bathroom was really clean. I would definitely stay here again!", "Date": "November 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cgreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "occupyfrugality", "ReviewID": "UR119883573", "Content": "i stayed here a year ago, and i really liked it, i felt the price was good, and the room was very nice. if you can go to the one in Kurfuerstendamm which is in the center of Berlin. Because you have to take a bus to go to the train station in order to go to the city, which used to take about 30 to 40 minutes each way. Anyways, if you still stay there, when you take the bus to Neuk\u00f6lln, there are several small stores to get things like vegetables and fruits.. there is also an aldi near the hotel, and guess what, there is a mcdonalds right next to it, which i went a few times when i was very hungry late at night. :) The hotel has no breakfast, and you have to buy a wifi internet card. They have a safe box at the desk for your money and documents. All the drinks they have in their small room refrigerator you have to pay for, if you open one.

After looking about online, we realised that this hotel was going to be the cheapest option. Even cheaper than booking into a private double in a hostel! There wasn't a lot of information about the hotel on the internet so we were not sure what to expect, but as it was working out cheaper than a hostel we didn't really expect much! Although the building isn't too asthetically pleasing from the outside, when you walk into reception you feel like you are at a far more upmarket hotel. The staff are all very polite and smartly dressed and the place is immaculate. There is a small bar downstairs as well. The room was of a Travelodge standard, if not nicer. Clean and very comfortable. Only downside was that there was no kettle! Next to the hotel is a late night McDonalds which is handy, if like us, you arrive late and have nothing to eat! I would recommend this hotel only for a one night stay for being near the airport...due to the location I would not recommend it for your whole stay. For 7 euros you can have a buffet breakfast which was on between 6.30am and 11am. We had it and it was worth the money I'd say. There was bread, various spreads etc, teas, coffee, sausages, eggs, various meats, cheese, fruit, etc etc. As for getting to the airport, they arranged a taxi for us and it cost 15 euros which isn't bad.
