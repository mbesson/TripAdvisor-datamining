I was forced out of my apt in la due to toxic mold, and was put up here. First of all, at check in the guy asked me for a credit card and I handed over my debit card. He immediately swiped it without asking me or telling me he was charging $100 for each night of my reservation, $500. This put a hold on my card. He then tried for 250, 150, then finally told me what was happening and tried again for $100. I settled the issue with my insurance company who covered that tab for 'incidentals.'. My 2nd night I got room service, milk an cookies for a whopping $15, no big deal right? The next day at lunch I came back to the hotel to walk my dog, and when I came back my key didnt work. The lady at the front desk, supposedly the guest services supervisor Emily, told me she needed to talk to me. They then asked for my debit card again, and I told them they couldn't use it, and that my insurance company had already faxed over another cc authorization for my incidentals. She then asked me to settle my tab for $15 even though I checked out the next day. Horrible customer service, which left me feeling like they thought I we a broke thief that would run out on my milk and cookies tab, give me a break. My apt renovation took longer, so ins. Company extended my reservation. When I got to the hotel the next day at noon to walk my dog, they denied any knowledge of my reservation and made me checkout. This put myself and my dog on the streets, made me late for my work that afternoon, and they knew full well what my situation was. My ins rep later told me that they blatently lied about not having my reservation, and it seems they wanted me out bc I did not provide my own 'incidentals' payment. They were rude, never apologized, and tried to run my debit card a total of 7 times throughout my stay. Stay away from these phonies, it seems like a nice place but if one thing goes wrong you'll soon realize that these ppl care about nothing but taking your money.", "Date": "May 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chesterland, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cI Love This Hotel - You Should, Too\u201d", "Author": "ElaineAndGreg", "ReviewID": "UR129272250", "Content": "If you've never stayed at a Kimpton Hotel, you should. They are funky, comfortable, welcoming and . . . well . . . fun. This hotel is one of their best and by far the best hotel I have stayed at in the Los Angeles area. The Palomar is in Wilshire Blvd. along a series of apartment buildings right next to a residential neighborhood. While the exterior fits in well with the area (i.e. unexceptional), once you step inside you know you're in for a treat. The lobby is wonderfully decorated in kind of a funky art deco style. It's well-appointed, but has personality and pizzazz. They were playing European swing music when I arrived. The rooms are also decorated with style. It is not a bland \"this looks nice for everyone\" look, but off beat and yet in excellent taste. While in sort of an art-Deco style, the room was very modern, including a large flat-panel TV, a clock radio with an input for your iPhone, etc.. There is no coffee maker in the room, but they have wonderful free coffee in the lobby, which tasted great and was and not much less convenient than if it were in my room. There are lots off unusual amenities. When I was there, there was a \"wine hour\" with complimentary wine served between 5 and 6. They allegedly welcome pets, with kind of a station for dogs in front. At another Kimpton hotel I stayed at, they had dog biscuits in the mini bar. At this hotel, they had two bicycles in the lobby available to borrow to ride around the neighborhood. Incidentally, this hotel is about two blocks from the cemetery housing Marilyn Monroe, Jack Lemmon, Billy Wilder, George C. Scott, and other celebrities. It is also a short walk (or bike ride) from Westwood Village (with many shops and restaurants) and the Armand Hammer Museum, as well as UCLA. It is not far from Beverly Hills on one side, and freeway access on the other. It was only about 20 minutes from LAX in moderate traffic. The staff was genuinely nice and helpful. I had the sense they were delighted to see me and to make sure my stay was as nice as possible. This included not only the reception area, but also the cleaning staff and valet parking out front. There is free internet access if you are a Kimpton member. This isn't difficult and doesn't require some sort of elite status. The internet access was fast, easy, and seemed to work all over the hotel. I am generally not a fan of hotel restaurants, but I have had dinner here twice and both times it was very good. I travel a lot on business and generally the best hotels can do is to make my stay not only bearable but comfortable.

The real bad: We valeted, our iPad was 100% stolen from our van. We know you aren't supposed to leave things, but we never in our life had a problem. My wife mentioned it in the hotel and I told her it would be fine. Weak. The hotel still charged us for valet (I am out $700 on this already right?) and then ignored my request to have the valet company and/or hotel manager contact me (neither bothered). The valet workers weren't the friendliest by any means, and at least one was apparently a thief. Again, I understand it's my job to not leave it, but when I hand you the keys I should still count on you to not steal from me, and when I let you know someone did have the courtesy to follow up. The hotel is making the first and last impression a less than stellar one in my opinion, by having this company represent them.

Room Type/Class: Deluxe King Room Date: August 3-4, 2011 Overall Rating: 4/5 With this stay, I was looking to stay somewhere newer, clean, and contemporary, that was within reasonable walking distance to UCLA for a concert and not too far from Beverly Hills (via car) where I also had a meeting scheduled. Based on reviews on Trip Advisor, I selected Hotel Palomar, as it seemed to fit my criteria. The property is easy enough to find, and they offer valet parking. Check-in was smooth. The hotel is very hip and modern in appearance. The room had more style than most hotels (how many places have you stayed that try to pull off some leopard print?). The room was of a decent size with bed, dresser, and desk, and the bathroom was consistent with the decor throughout. My room faced out toward UCLA with related views. UCLA is walking distance, but it is quite a walk - probably better served driving. It was a short stay, so I don't really have any additional thoughts to share.

Even though I grew up there - and visit frequently - its easy to get turned around in terms of neighborhoods and desitinations. Which is why I LOVE staying at the Palomar... With its central, and enviable, location just off the 405 on Wilshire Blvd in Westwood, the hotel allows easy access to LAX, Santa Monica, Beverly Hills and, really, just about anywhere I've ever wanted to get to. You can even walk a few blocks to restaurants, movie theaters, shopping, and supermarkets. But even better, the Palomar chain prides itself in friendliness, with a touch of quirl: wine in the lobby at sundown, coffee in the lobby in the AM, dogs encouraged, movies outdoors by the pool on warm summer nights. I LOVE IT! Canyou imagine this sort of joie-de-vivre at the Four Seasons or Peninsula? On the \"this is fantastic\" list: the Palomar rates can be incredibly good, and the reservation staff has already helped me find the very best deal available. I've had to stay for a week at a time with my son and best of all are the Spa Suites: complete with a sleeper sofa in an adjoining living room that can be closed off with sliding doors. Very cosy. each room has its own huge flat-screen TV, with a shared (enormous) bathroom: it doesn't get any better than this for the price! Be sure to sign up for the free rewards program which allows you to \"Raid the Minbar\" for $10-worth of goodies - always a treat - and be amazed by the genial friendliness of the staff.

The amenities were, as for all Kimpton hotels, very nice, but the prices of the minibar were exceptionally high. A Luna Bar for $6.00, really?? Location is very handy to UCLA and Westwood Village. You could walk there if you don't mind a fairly long walk. However, no one in LA walks, of course. Valet parking at $33 was another big ticket item. There is some street parking but it's a ways away. And the parking patrol is very active - we missed our meter while shopping at Westwood Village - missed it by 90 seconds and they'd already ticketed us! Yikes. We didn't feel quite as warmly welcomed as at other Kimptons - the valets and doormen sort of ignored us going in and out, no offer of help, so that was odd.

Nice restaurant and bar area located in lobby area. The pool is heated, but a jucuzzi would be nice on a cold day (which it was).

When i told her about the problem she apologized and said that she would take care of it.

I really liked this hotel a lot for the money. I did a lot of research first and was pleasantly surprised. We were very well received by the front desk and car valet service and that made us feel welcome right away. The lobby and hotel overall were very well appointed. It is very much a chic, boutique hotel. Sleek and yet comfortable. Our room was a type of suite. You enter into the living room suite with fold out double sleeper sofa, large flatscreen tv and desk and there are two sliding heavy doors which lead to the master bedroom which has its own flatscreen tv and king sized bed. The bathroom is accessible from the bedroom. It is a huge bathroom, and has an oversized bathtub as well as sleek shower stall. The only slightly odd thing was that there are these sliding frosted glass windows from the master into the bathroom, which we kept shut. If you are enjoying a romantic vacation for two, this might (and I stress \"might\") be enjoyable, but ....or maybe you want to watch the tv from the bathroom toilet. Hmmm....we all thought the window was a little weird, and even when closed, it does have some gaps which don't really afford you full privacy in there. Otherwise, believe me, the suite and bathroom were spacious and amazing. The windows are floor to ceiling glass and the view was very open and lovely. The sheets were a nice high thread count - which matters to a lot of us- and were very clean. Some of the furniture surfaces in the rest of the room, such as the desk, looked like they could have been more thoroughly cleaned, but the bathroom was very clean. It was great to be able to have our tv in the bedroom, and our teen daughters with their own tv in the LR. Now for just a few other negatives....The valet parking, which is $30 a day, got lax about giving us a ticket when they took our car, and on the day we had to leave, they couldn't find our car and acted like a bunch of clowns. Victor at the Front Desk is very in the know about everything in LA and Hollywood, and so was one of the women at the front desk, but there was another one who was kind of clueless and had absolutely nothing to recommend to us as an activity on a rainy day. (Yes, it does rain in LA!! And it was 47 degrees - totally flukey) So when it came to Universal Studios, the lady at the front desk told us to avoid it, but later on I overheard someone else saying that they went to Universal Studios that day in the rain when we skipped it and \"They were totally set up to handle the rain and take care of customers in the rain.\" Fortunately, they did all agree that the place for us to go for breakfast was the Griddle (Cafe?) restaurant, and though there were a lot of people waiting, we were able to get a table really quickly and were thrilled. There was also a bit of confusion when we first got to the hotel and asked if they were still serving dinner anywhere in the hotel. The guy at the desk told us we could get light fare/snacks in the bar and then another person at the hotel said they had changed the menu in the bar, and ran off to get the new menu which was identical to the menu which was in the bar in the first place....and then guess what? They had already stopped serving food a half hour before anyway. That's okay though cause the bar smelled like a frat house though the decor was super cool and the couches and chairs were set up in a really well thought out way. We ended up going up to our room and ordering club sandwiches from room service, which, as with most hotels, took a half an hour as they warned it would. So just a little Snafu there.

We had not stayed at a Kimpton property before. Chose this as a nice hotel near UCLA in the Westwood area. It is a boutique hotel on Wilshire Blvd in the neighborhood of Westwood. The hotel is comfortable and I thought the room was reasonable size and well appointed. The bath was small but not so small as to be cramped.(Word of caution-the tub is slippery because there is nothing on the bottom to prevent slips which my husband had. Ask for a rubber tub mat!) The room and hotel were very clean and well maintained. They have a pool and a nice but small pool lounge area with comfortable chaises and fireplace though it was never going which was a shame since it was cool enough and the fireplace in the lobby was going. I never figured out why the pool one wasn't fired up. Staff was very helpful and had genuine smiles. The hostess in the restaurant, Raquel, was extremely nice and when we told her at breakfast that we were a bit pushed for time, she gladly just took our order and made sure everyhting was brought to us ASAP. A rare treat to meet her. Everyone else also nice (except maybe the hostess on Saturday-not very friendly but oh well). When I asked the front desk man where to go to print my boarding passes he said just tell him and he would do it and he did while I stood there. When was the last time that happened to you?? I think this is a good choice if you are needing to be in the UCLA area. Also, the hotel is just a straight cab ride down Wilshire to Santa Monica and the beach.

The bed was comfortable with very smooth soft sheets, and the TV was large. Being a refurbished older hotel (a Doubletree in its former existence), the bathrooms are not luxe but the fixtures and lighting were fine and I appreciated the powerful Speakman shower head - much better than rainshowers IMO - and the curved tub/shower curtain rod which made the shower more spacious. They provide funky zebra print cotton robes and newspaper during your stay. It was very quiet for the most part except for Friday night when I could hear a group of people next door chatting and playing music. Apparently the pool is not bad but I didn't have a chance to use it. Valet/bellhop service was great and the front desk was efficient. There's a nice circular driveway for valet parking drop-off (the only option), and just outside the front door is a sign welcoming guests' dogs along with doggie water bowls. I didn't see any dogs while I was there though, and didn't detect any indication of a pet having been in my room. I ended up not eating there since I didn't have time for a sit-down breakfast in the restaurant and I felt the room service was expensive even before the 20% PLUS $3 charge. They didn't have any gluten-free bread or cereal options even though I asked ahead, so I ended up buying my own breakfast at Whole Foods in Westwood. Had they been more helpful in the food department I would have been really impressed. Parking is $30 a day, but I didn't have any other choice.

It was perfect portion size but large enough to hold me over for the morning. I felt it was worth the expense as well. Also had a meal in the hotel restaurant, BLVD 16, which was delicious too. The service is really top notch. I wanted to sit in the sunshine for a bit and asked directions to the pool from one young man at the front desk; he walked me to it, didn't just tell me where to find it. Overall, I had a great experience and also have to say, wonderful follow-up post trip. The hotel sent a survey, which I completed and I received a personal email with incentive to visit again. I will actually be visiting again but that decision was made before the incentives!", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cWonderful service\u201d", "Author": "Mantraveler", "ReviewID": "UR123800962", "Content": "The staff are wonderful.

I cannot blame the hotel for its location since we wanted to go to universal studios and I misjudged how far the hotel actually was from it. We asked the front desk staff for info on the best way to get to universal studios. They suggested we take a taxi or that we take their VIP hotel taxi service. An ordinary taxi wouldve cost us $50-60 one way and the VIP service in a private SUV was $80 one way. They did not recommend we take the public transport and didn't really help us in that matter at all so my wife did some research on the net and found rapid buses that takes you to universal studios for 3 dollars p person one way. It would've been good had the hotel staff been more knowledgable in that area. The rooms are modern and clean. The concierge wasn't available on the first two days of our stay (hence our reliance on front desk for info) but he gave us useful information for Beverly hills on our last day which is only a $10 taxi ride from the hotel. Make sure you ask for a room with a view as well. It was our 1st wedding anniversary and I had made a note of that in my reservation but front desk didn't take any initiative by giving us a room with a view.

I would recommend this hotel if you are wanting to do Beverly hills but I would probably stay closer to Hollywood or universal city if you are after universal studios or Hollywood walk of fame etc. The staff could be a bit friendlier.

The Kimpton Hotel group transformed the old Doubletree on Wilshire from chabby to Tres Chic. From the moment we pulled up in my friend's Prius, we were treated like royalty. The very friendly valet made our day by letting us know that hybrid cars receive half-price parking in the hotel garage! Steven at the front desk couldn't have been more professional or efficient\u2014 we were checked in and in our room within 3 minutes. Our room was beautiful and on one of the highest floors, but facing Wilshire, so I called down and asked if they had anything that wasn't on the main drag. He immediately offered to move us, and sent the bellhop up within 5 minutes. We were taken to a new room on the 14th floor which had a lovely view of the valley, and no street noise\u2014 perfect! I had asked about good lunch spots nearby, and Steven sent a map and copy of the menu for the place he had suggested with the bellhop. Such attention to detail\u2014impressive! We attended the free wine tasting (from 5-6 every day at all Kimpton properties!) and met a lovely elder gent from the neighborhood. It was clear he wasn't staying at the hotel, but the staff graciously permitted him to attend the tasting. How refreshing\u2014looking out for the local community! We were really touched by the gesture. Throughout our stay, the staff could not have been nicer. Because I am in Kimpton's \"frequent flier\" program, I got a free $10 coupon for the mini bar- nice touch! Also, the Kimpton hotels are pet-friendly. How cool is that? Our room had gorgeous contemporary decor, was of good size, and the bathroom was nicely done as well. We had a hard time getting a cab from the event we tended about 2 miles away from the hotel, so we called the front desk for help. They not only had a cab there within 5 minutes of our call, the front desk attendant even called back to make sure they had come. She said she was going to come get us herself if the cab hadn't shown up yet. Overall, this was an outstanding experience\u2014 one of my best hotel stays ever, and I have been badly spoiled as I worked for MeriStar Hotels & Resorts and got the best rooms, best service, etc. due to my position.

Within 10 minutes of arrival, 3 nice things happened : 1 ) It was the hour of complimentary wine in the lobby, and I was served a glass of chardonnay as I checked in....much appreciated! 2) As I'd told my sad story to the reservation person, the manager made sure to have a small amenity, and a handwritten note waiting for us, acknowledging our trouble and assuring us the hotel would take care of us. 3) Our bellman thanked my husband so sincerely for the tip we handed him, it was incredible. That has not happened in a while, I can tell you -- certainly not at the W, just up the street. Our stay continued with us finding the regular room quite small, but no suites available, so we were able to negotiate a reasonable rate for 2 regular rooms, which was ideal for our teenagers and my husband and me. I look forward to experiencing a spa suite or other in the future. We took advantage of hanging out at the pool that night, to watch \"Rebel Without A Cause\" and drink more nice wine. We had gone to the nearby Trader Joe's for snacks and that was all we needed, no expensive dinner. Met some nice guests. I was concerned about the \"Dogs Welcome\" policy which attracts many dog owners, which we are not. In fact, our kids are allergic to pet dander. However, the hotel is truly impeccable and the pet owners were very courteous so this was not a problem at all. Running map was great -- took a nice 5 mile run around UCLA.

I am a very picky traveler and am sensitive to just about anything that can make a hotel awful (specifically, noise, pets and light). The Palomar allowed me to have a well-rested vacation and provided many perks! I was nervous about being next to a loud dog or a room that had residual pet hair from past visitors, so I requested a pet-free floor. I did so upon making the reservation and called to make sure it was received. I think this was crucial since, as noted by other reviewers, ther are indeed a lot of dogs in this hotel. I was put in a room near the elevator and the housekeeping closet, so assumed it would be noisy and I'd have to request a room change. I'm happy to report it wasn't loud at all! The housekeeping staff was super aware of not blocking the walkway, always greeted me with a smile and obviously made an effort to not make a lot of noise opening/closing the supply closet. The valet staff was exceptional. They were quick, friendly and had a great memory about what/where I said I was going. They always asked if I needed directions and knew how to make me feel welcome without being overbearing. The front desk staff was great as well, always quick to help and spent a lot of time helping me figure out the LA bus system. The location is nice -- right on the bus line to Santa Monica and the shopping area in Beverly Hills, plus walking distance to UCLA and Westwood Village, so I was able to leave my car at the hotel a few times.

One of the valets brought our bags up with us and took a few minutes to explain the basic features of the room and the hotel itself. The hotel has a ton of special little features like coffee hour in the morning, wine tasting at night, and a movie in the pool (I'm not sure if the movies are every day, but there was one on the weekend that we were there). We asked the concierge about restaurants and activities in the area and she was more than willing to help. She provided us with tips and maps of the area, and even asked how our day was and if we found everything okay when we returned later that day. Any staff members we passed in the hallways or elevator also were friendly and always said hello. The room itself was very stylish and large. Beds were comfortable and we had a nice view looking out over LA. They do have the high-power flush toilets though and heavy doors, so you can hear those during the night, but it wasn't that bad and there's really not much anyone can do about that! Most importantly in any hotel room though, it was CLEAN. The hotel pool area seemed well decorated and maintained (as did the rest of the hotel), but a bit small. The fitness center was also on the smaller side, but it had enough equipment in it and was perfectly adequate for a few nights stay. We didn't try the restaurant, so I can't comment on that. The hotel is in a pretty central location to a lot of the attractions in and around Los Angeles and is easily accessible on Wilshire Blvd. Westwood Village is a short walk down the street and has a lot of cafes and restaurants.

And the property is comfortable, inviting, and edgy. On the weekend it shows great oldie movies on a big screen near the pool, while serving wine. What fun, and a terrific way to meet other guests. I was working, so missed the 5-6 p.m. wine hour most nights, but met so many interesting guests when I could be there. The restaurant food truly is better than most hotel food (moules & frites is as good as any in Paris). The morning coffee bar offers excellent coffee to go. I had a few bumps (bathroom wasn't cleaned or replenished one day, but within 5 minutes of my call, it was fixed). And tonight, guests moved into room adjoining mine via a shared door, and their kid was screaming. I must be at work tomorrow very early. On my second call (kid screeching) the hotel sent a young man up to help move me ( I did not want to have to pick up all my stuff and move, but I need to sleep). I am in a very quiet, upgraded space. The rooms are spacious and clean with attractive furnishings. The bed is very comfortable with high-quality linens and luxurious feather pillows. Bath linens are thick and high quality. I bring my own cleansers, but they offer Etro in colorful tubes. Lighting is better than average. Lots of electrical outlets for guests' electronics, a real plus. Very good set-up for business travelers in the rooms. I cannot understand the negative reviews. I judge any business by how it handles glitches, because things happen. There are a lot of rooms to clean, and housekeepers may forget to check this or that. I care more about the resolution than the complaint. This property demonstrates an amazing commitment to guest satisfaction. I'd love to be a fly on the wall listening to the challenges the cute young staff is trained to handle.

The rooms are small compared to other hotels of the same price, although this is marketed as a 5* hotel i would rate it no more than your average 3*. The room was however clean and tidy. The swimming pool isn't great and not an area where you can go to relax, surrounded by walls and trees. I made the mistake of ordering room service on two occasions. I can best describe the quality as poor for the price. The final straw was when calling to enquire about a late room checkout the next day, it was clear the staff member was less than interested in entertaining my request and whilst i was still speaking they hung up the phone. This i find to be the height of bad manners and was certainly enough to dissuade me from using this hotel again. The friend i was travelling with checked out the next day, when asked how the stay had been he advised the staff it had been poor. No apology, no questions, just a simple goodbye after that.

The property is in good shape, very clean and somewhat more modern and larger than other Kimpton hotels I've stayed in. Check-in was efficient and I was in my room on the 16th floor only a few minutes after pulling up out front. Valet is the only parking option here ($30/day) but the valet staff are on the ball and very helpful. Rooms are nice sized; I had a great view looking northwest over Wilshire blvd with only minimal traffic noise. The bathroom is larger than average, spacious really, and well lit. My only complaint is that the shower had a handheld spray head that wouldn't stay in place on its vertical bar and was placed too low for anyone over, say, 5'5\" in height. Amenities included a flat screen digital tv, minibar, ipod docking clock radio, and a large safe. The closet includes a full size umbrella for guest use, and the infamous leopard-skin pattern robes. There are no coffee makers in the room, but complimentary coffee is available in the lobby each morning (though you do have to get dressed to go down and get some...maybe wearing one of those robes). Wireless internet access was fast and reliable. For loyalty program members, internet is free, and you also get a $10 coupon per stay to \"raid the minibar\" -- a nice touch and appreciated, though of course $10 won't get you much! An evening wine reception is also offered for all guests. I had breakfast at the in-house restaurant , which was very good but expensive, even for the setting. Service was prompt at first but refills on coffee lagged. I didn't visit the bar/lounge but it looked like a fun place to hang out. There is a small pool out back; it's very private but in shade much of the day. Probably perfect for those hot days but too cool for the moderate temps on my trip. Finally, they do have a useful service I've not seen before, which is to have your airline boarding pass printed out and delivered to your room with breakfast in the morning if you order it the night before, or you can pick it up at the front desk when you check out.

Beware \u2013 you can make a reservation, but you may be left without a room or help: I recently had an experience at The Palomar in Westwood, which may interest you. By way of background, I am married and have 2 children\u2026. I travel often. Our family is financially comfortable. My wife and I are both professional people. We do not look for problems or inconveniences in our lives. We are patient, understanding and well mannered. My family has stayed at The Palomar in Westwood a number of times. We stayed there on December 18 and 19. We had a reservation to stay there on December 31\u2026. We had booked our room well in advance. On December 27 Caitlin Ross of Kimpton emailed my wife to confirm our reservation, which we did promptly - the same day. Ms. Ross responded the same day indicating that she looked forward to welcoming us back soon. We were looking forward to it as well. The Hotel had my wife's email and phone contact information. We arrived early on December 31 - around 1:30 pm. We intended to drop off our luggage and spend some time in LA. When we arrived on December 31, we were told by Danielle DeHostos, apparently the Manager on duty, that there was no room for us at The Palomar at all that day. There was a reservation, but the hotel was overbooked. We were told that, instead, a reservation had been made for us at the Sportsmen's Lodge in Studio City. We were told that the room had been \"comp'd\". The letter / voucher that we were given for presentation to the Sportsmen's Lodge indicated that The Palomar was prepared to pay $159 for our stay at the Sprtsmen's. We went to the Sportsmen's Lodge in Studio City (a 45 minute drive with traffic), and were not prepared to stay at that hotel or in that part of LA - not even for free. It is not a comparable hotel by any stretch. The Sportsmen is \u2026. [not to our standards, with] no valet, no doorman, no secure parking, and our room was on a smoking floor that smelled like 20 years of smoking. My son has respiratory issues, so the heavy smoke smell alone made the Sportsmen unsatisfactory. There was no elevator in the building that we were apparently to stay in. We had lot of luggage that we would not have been prepared to leave in the car. The broken street sign and the falling down front entrance at the Sportsmen were indicators that the Palomar didn't think much of us or our standards. I can spare you the balance of the details, but the Sportsmen does not meet our travel requirements. Let me know if any of Kimpton's executives would ever stay at the Sportsmen's Lodge with their family - I doubt it. I can't even understand why that was presented as an option for us, or why were not asked in advance whether that would work for us. We phoned Danielle at The Palomar a couple of times over a few hours to get help making alternative arrangements. My wife left a message for her. Danielle was on the phone. Danielle did not return the call. My wife later left a voice message for Danielle. The voice message indicated that we would not be staying at the Sportsmen, expressed our disappointment, and requested a return call. Danielle never returned our calls - still to this day. This level of neglect in all of the circumstances is shocking. After finding a Starbucks where we could look up other hotels that might have a room on New Year's Eve, we eventually found a Marriott in Long Beach (an hour drive with traffic). These events wasted over 4 hours of our time between driving and searching. Our plans for a day in LA were substantially changed by these events. We still haven't received a return call from Danielle. We don't need one now. To be clear, we were always prepared to pay to stay at a reasonably nice hotel - that should have been obvious from the fact that we were prepared to pay to stay at The Palomar. Given that we were in our car with nowhere to stay on New Year's Eve by no fault of our own, we were only looking for help in finding a satisfactory hotel to stay in - we were looking to get that help from the people who would know the hotels in the area and who had put us in the sorry position that we found ourselves in. If we had had any advance notice of the problem, as opposed to a confirmation of our reservation, we would not have needed that help at all. We are quite capable of booking a hotel room. I can't fathom how you could make a reservation, and confirm it, but not honour it. I can't imagine that the problem was only discovered on our arrival, in part because there was a letter personally addressed to my wife ready on our arrival. I can't understand how we could not be alerted in advance to the problem so that we could participate in a solution at our leisure by looking for other accommodations, rather than finding out on New Year's Eve on our arrival. We had responded to your December 27 email promptly, and our reservation had been re-confirmed. We had been staying in Palm Springs, and could have easily stayed there another night and avoided so much worry and inconvenience. Instead, you opted to wait until we arrived (surely earlier than most guests) on New Year's Eve, and then left us with a ridiculous \"take it or leave it\" option, which included ignoring our calls. In the circumstances, being abandoned on New Year's Eve in LA when travelling with children was completely unsatisfactory, uncaring, callous, and far below anything that we could reasonably expect. We paid for our stay in Long Beach - it was not \"comp'd\", as Danielle would not even return our calls. Ironically, it cost us $139 per room - less than the Sportsmen's. We booked two rooms to ensure our comfort. Frankly, we were not looking for a \"comp\" anywhere. I can pay for my hotel stays without any difficulty. We were looking for help in making things right after your apparent error in making and confirming our reservation, but then finding yourselves unable to honour your commitments and unwilling to provide us with sufficient advance notice of your error. Instead, we were ignored and left to our own devices in the grossly inconvenient circumstances of finding ourselves travelling with children on New Year's Eve with nowhere to stay and trying to fix the problem while operating out of our car. There are very few things that annoy me. These events annoy me from beginning to end. It is not the failure to honour the reservation (which is bad enough) so much as the absolute neglect that ensued. You put my family to inconvenience in the worst way that you could in the circumstances, and then treated us like trash thereafter. Shame on you. If I had any notion that this was the level of customer service that you would offer when dealing with an error that was entirely yours, I would have never, ever taken the risk of doing any business with you - especially not when traveling with my children. Being ignored is never an acceptable option for me. The fact that the incident is over now does not change the fact that we were ignored in circumstances that called for your attention - it remains unacceptable. To be clear, I don't need your attention now as it will do nothing for me other than take up more of my time. Please do not send me a sincere, heartfelt apology or a token of your after the fact remorse. I have no need for platitudes or charity. I do not need to know about any remedial actions that you have taken. An acknowledgement that you have read this note would be a nice touch. The purpose of sending you this note is solely to be fair to you by letting you know what happened. I do not want anything from you. My intention is to communicate with others who might be interested in how you treat your guests, as I'm more inclined towards making the world a better place. I enjoy that luxury. I wanted you to know in advance why that was going to happen and the source of it. I would not hide behind anonymity in doing so. I won't stay at your hotels in the future.

Brought it to the MOD's (manager on duty) attention and it was resolved IMMEDIATELY. With that being said, I was in Los Angeles for a short turn around trip and didn't get to the hotel until after 8:30 pm.

Simply put this is a great hotel if your travels take you to LA. The hotel is located on Wilshire Blvd. in Westwood which is a location that is quite central to most of LA. The 405 Freeway is just a few blocks down the street. The first thing you notice upon your arrival is the wonderful service. The valet was helpful and very friendly, in fact 2 valets got together to empty the car within a couple of minutes. Check in was immediate and smooth. The hotel itself is well decorated and spotlessly clean. The lobby is small but has a very homey and welcoming feeling. The rooms are very nice with stylish furnishings. They are a good size. It struck me that the rooms look brand new, there was not so much as 1 nick even on the furniture which is quite odd for a hotel that has been open for a little while. It is obvious that this property is extremely well cared for. The bed is one of the most comfortable I have ever slept on with great linens. I travel over 400,000 miles a year and spend roughly 200 room nights a year in hotels and this bed rates as one of the best. The bathroom is a nice size and looks brand new. They have great towels that are soft and thick, hard to find even in some of the best hotels nowadays. The shower has great pressure which is a welcome change for a hotel shower. The amenities are terrific (Aveda). Another great touch is that there is a list of available toiletry items in the bathroom just in case you forget something. As it turned out I forgot my deodorant and called down to the desk. A new deodorant was brought to my room within 5 minutes at a cost of $3 which is a normal cost. I hate when hotels take advantage and rip you off. The housekeeping is second to none as well. My room was cleaned by 10 o'clock every morning which is simply outstanding. I have been to so many hotels in which you walk into your room at 2PM and it has yet to be done which is terrible. The housekeepers were very attentive as well realizing that I liked the bed without the decorative pillows on it and doing that every day. It is that attention to detail that makes this a great property. There are also small touches that mean a great deal. There is a welcome back greeting every time you return to the hotel from a member of the staff. They make you feel very at home. There is very cold water with fruit in it set up all day in the lobby, nice touch. If that wasn't enough they serve hot chocolate towards the end of the day, given that it was so cold in LA for the 5 days I was here that was a welcome treat. Last but not least they have a free wine reception from 4 - 6 every day in the lobby. I did not use the pool but went to see it and although it is small looks quite nice and the water was very warm. I am Kimpton in touch member and received free wireless internet for my whole stay, it is probably the fastest and best hotel internet speed I have ever had in a hotel. They also game me a voucher for $10 for the mini bar. Another great value touch. The Valet parking is $30 per day but this is normal for any big city. It is just the way it is at city hotels. Given the great value they give you with everything else it is a small price to pay. It is important to keep the free internet and $10 voucher for mini bar in mind when calculating the actual cost of valet parking. The final piece of the puzzle that makes this a great property is the cost vs value. Their rates are very reasonable while providing you with a great deal of value. It is obvious that this hotel is extremely well managed. All the little touches and details are looked after with great care and attention. Both Albert and Caroline along with their staff do a great job of making this property truly great.

We had three rooms and they were able to accommodate us side by side. We really liked the location, the wine hour, and the stylish rooms. Check in was efficient and the woman at the front desk was very nice. We checked out the cocktails at the bar and they were inventive and delicious. Although the hotel is stylish, it is in no way snobby- I was expecting a bit of a cold shoulder, as we were a group with 4 children, but the welcome was warm. The kids (they are 16, 11, 10, and 8) loved the print bathrobes and the fruit infused water in the lobby. My only issue, and it did kind of put a damper on the night, was an issue that happened when the kids were in the pool. It was very cold (only about 15 C) but it is colder in Canada where we were coming from, so the kids went for a swim at around 5 pm They were having a great time playing \"shark\"- with lots of squealing, splashing and laughing that goes along with fun in a pool. (I should add that we were the only people in the beautiful pool area, as it was cold). The adults were sitting and talking around the outdoor fire and the kids were in the pool playing. It was 6 pm. Suddenly, a neighbour (the hotels pool area butts up against a residential neighbourhood, but due to a high wall and clever landscaping, you don't really notice) started screaming over the wall for our kids to shut up or she would call the police. Yep, at 6 pm on a friday night, the sound of children having fun..call the police. She yelled at us a few times. A few minutes later, a Kimpton employee comes out and tells up that they had a complaint, could we keep it down. We pointed out the time, and the employee agreed but still asked us to be quiet, which kind of put us off. We left the area soon after, the fun having been sucked out of that experience. I think if you live next door to a very large hotel, and about 100 feet off Wilshire in LA, you are used to a little noise...no? I guess it was the sound of children's laughter that was the problem...I can't imagine the neighbour was sitting outside, as it was chilly. Not the hotels fault, but a drag nonetheless. Needless to say, the kids didn't want to swim again in the remaining days we were there. A good hotel, clean, stylish, and in a great location.

First impressions do count. After conducting major research, I had very high expectations of this hotel. I was under the impression that I would be given first-class service. Boy, was I wrong. I am a faithful Yelper - I review everything. I myself own a service-based business, so I always go where other travelers rave about the service. My personal pet peeve is inflexibility in service. When we checked in at noon, the girl at the front desk was pleasant. But she wasn't overly enthusiastic, nor was she particularly nice. I requested a complimentary upgrade based on availability. Before she even checked, she said, \"We can put you on the south side where it's quieter, but that's about it.\" I told her we lived in the local area, and just visiting Westwood for a short stay. No response. I told her I am a Bruin and just coming back to visit! No response. I told her that I had high expectations of this hotel, based on the reviews I read on TripAdvisor, and that I am a faithful reviewer. NO RESPONSE. (Um, isn't \"charisma\" part of the front desk job descrip?) Anyway, I finally asked if there were \"suites\" available. She said, \"Yes, but there is a upgrade fee of $99, but we can give it to you for $40\". I said ok. 5 minutes later, the upgrade fee became $ 49. (how did it go up 20% in 5 minutes?) Since I was tired, I didn't argue. I read about the $1 upgrade for all these amenities. I asked her about it. She snidely told me that that was for customers that paid online their best available rate. Then she added, \"You definitely didn't pay what the room is worth\". Ok. I admit, I booked on Priceline. But 1) So what? and 2) How does she know how much I paid? For all she knows, I overbid and am paying more! Mentioning this gave me a bad taste in my mouth. Ready to jet to my room, I asked her for my child's gift. The Palomar website touted that all kids get free \"kid gifts\". She said that they \"ran out\" of these gift packages and then gave us a basket full of dinosaurs and bracelets. My husband took a dinosaur, and I reached for a bracelet, and she gave me a look like, \"No, you can't take both\". Finally, I asked for a crib and a high chair. (The website said that you can deliver a high chair to the room for in-room dining). She said no, we don't do that. I said, \"It says you can.\" She said, \"No.\". Then this other lady said, \"Only in our restaurant\". HOW HARD IS IT TO GET A HIGH CHAIR TO A ROOM? Especially since you say you do that on your website??!? They DID later deliver the high chair, but it was like pulling teeth. The hotel is pet-friendly, which is very nice. However, a pet-friendly hotel has consequences. There is an \"animal\" smell in the halls and carpets, and there is hair in the carpets. Our room - a spa suite - was pretty spacious. The set-up was nice, but personally, I thought there was too much clunky furniture. Also, I am not particularly fond of snakeskin (the cabinets have them). The decor is definitely very modern, and I realized I prefer traditional. I am not fond of red doors and such. The bed was comfy and it was pretty clean. The location was very close to UCLA - walkable, and overall, the hotel is very nice. We paid approximately $250 with taxes for the spa suite, and I thought the value was worth it, especially in this area. $33 for parking sucks. Internet is not free. The rest of the staff that we encountered seemed very helpful and genuinely nice. I guess we just had bad luck at check-in. I don't know. I think overall, it is a nice hotel. I was overly excited to stay here after the rave reviews on service. I think my expectations were probably a bit skewed because of the reviews. Since we are local, I don't think we would stay here again.

Before I could pay the taxi driver, our bags were already out of the cab and in the lobby. We had requested an early check-in and the request was cheerfully honored. The bellman accompanied us to our room and was full of information about the hotel, the room and the surrounding area of Westwood. The room was stylish and sparkling clean, with the largest flat screen T.V. we've experienced yet in a hotel. The large window let in plenty of light and sun with a beautiful view of Westwood and the Mormon Temple, which is lit up at night and provides a beautiful backdrop to the room. The beds are super comfortable and the hotel is quiet. The public areas are also pristine and nicely appointed. We were given access to the courtsey car and the wine hour is one of the most generous features we have yet experienced at a hotel. BLVD 16, the hotel restaurant provided an amazing dinner (which we've reviewed in the restaurant section of Tripadvisor). Alas we had to leave the hotel at 7AM next morning to catch an early flight, the bellman was at our door within 5 minutes of our call, and even arranged a car service for us to LAX.

Lots of very trendy restaurants, bars and shopping within easy driving distance, as well as some of the most exclusive neighborhoods. It's near the 405, so although it was a 30 minute drive or so to Malibu and those beaches, it was very easy to get to and not really that far for LA. Only about 20 minutes from LAX (without traffic). Only downside is that there aren't cafes or bars immediately adjacent to the hotel, but the area around UCLA is packed with these and is only a few blocks away. As for the hotel itself, I really have no complaints. We got a good deal to begin with, and upon arrival they offered to upgrade us to a suite for just $38/night, which we accepted. The suite was great - quiet, roomy, trendy and modern (like the rest of the hotel), but tastefully decorated (not obnoxious as sometimes occurs when hotels try too hard).

Valets suggest that there is street parking, but not many spaces and not really convenient. Most hotels that we looked at had similar parking fees.

Every single person on the staff we encountered were always smiling and making sure we were taken care of. The location is right on the edge of Westwood. If I was traveling alone, it would be walkable to the heart of Westwood, but with young children, that just wouldn't happen. The rooms were very modern. Clean bathrooms with plush towels and nice fixtures. Not your standard drab hotel room. The only thing was the room felt a little on the small side, maybe it was our specific room, it was on a corner and just felt tight. Nice extras, not sure if these were seasonal, but complimentary coffee/tea in the morning, iced tea/lemonade in the afternoon, and a wine hour in the evening. Nice touch, although we didn't have a chance to make ti back for any of the wine hours, so I can't say much about it. The $33 valet parking is a little steep. We tried to look for street parking, but didn't have any luck. I would have preferred self parking, as we were in and out quite often, and when I add the tipping to that $33 per day price, it ends up being over $40 per day in reality. The one disappointment I had with the hotel was the pool. It wasn't heated, and although it was a nice mid-70's day in Los Angles in June, how the shade moves the pool was completely in the shade in the afternoon and it was just plain freezing. No hot tub. However, the chaises loungers were comfortable to relax in, and there was a fireplace. I'm not sure how old this hotel is, but I get the feeling that this was a bit of an afterthought, and they are probably doing the best they could with the space. It's just hard with such a tall building blocking the sun. So as long as you aren't looking for a nice pool vacation, this is a great little hotel.

The woman who checked us in gave us several options to make sure that we got an upper room with the view we wanted. We had no complaints on the room or the service. The only small downside was that the parking options are to park on the street (Wilshire Blvd) or to do valet parking at $33/day.

One glaring omission was the condition of our toilet. When Eric the bellhop took us to our room he noted the toilet was making a strange noise and suggested we call the hotel engineer to have a look at it. I told him we would when we left for dinner since before that we would use the bathroom to get ready. This was the first opportunity for your hotel staff to rectify the situation. Eric could have moved us to a new room immediately since we hadn't unpacked yet. He did not make the offer. We subsequently discovered that the toilet was not working at all. When we returned to the room (after the engineer supposedly fixed the toilet) that night with two friends the toilet worked sporadically, but at least after several attempts the toilet always flushed. The next morning the toilet broke again this time permanently and AFTER I had already used it. My girlfriend and I had to use the shower with the toilet smelling and the toilets in the lobby downstairs before going out for the day. The front desk said they would send up the engineer again to fix it this time. I inquired about packing up our stuff and moving to another room but the person at the front desk insisted we try fixing it again. This was the second opportunity for someone at the hotel to adequately deal with the problem. When my girlfriend and I came back to the room again that afternoon I tested the toilet one time before using it so I would not be subjected to the humiliation of using the toilet only to have it not work for a second time. It only flushed once and then stopped working. This was the THIRD time that our toilet had broken after being looked at by the engineer TWICE. I spoke to the manager on duty and requested a room change which at that point was granted. It was the THIRD time before my request to change room was granted. We had already been in the room 24 hrs and had to re-pack our things that by this time were in various places around the room.

The Palomar ended up being a great choice for us - as far as LA goes, it's a fairly central location. You still need a car (but you would no matter where you stay in LA) and it's a bit pricey to park ($30/night) - waived if you have a hybrid, but the rental company had none left. We found it took no more than 20 minutes to get anywhere in LA that we wanted to go - that's pretty good for LA. Staying in Santa Monica (our original first choice) would have been a mistake - it's nice there, but puts you far from everything. Room was a fine size (average to a bit smaller than average), but very comfortable as it was laid out well. The bed was super comfortable and we were surprised about how quiet the room was. Dining in the hotel adds up quickly - we like the convenience of having breakfast in the hotel, had 1 dinner and had room service one night when not feeling well. To be fair, the food was on par with other restaurants we went to in the same price bracket (which is to say it was very good, but no bargain ... but in fairness again, not overpriced compared to similar restaurants we went to - we actually found LA fairly pricey overall even compared to NYC). The concierge was very helpful but he seemed to disappear halfway through our stay - not sure if he was off or out sick or what. Also, we had a giggle about the Hotel's description in it's in room materials - about chocolates being bedside and evening turn down service - we never experienced either and we weren't missing these things until we read about them. We did enjoy the complementary NY Times and Wall St Journal every day. Housekeeping did a great job cleaning and straightening the room and the bathroom - but a mediocre job of replacing the little complementary items (body lotion, shower cap, q-tips - very generous with the shampoo and soaps though). Of course, I always noticed this well after it was too late to call anyone about it and then would forget again the next morning until too late once again. I'm sure if I had asked, they would have provided as they did with the body lotion the one time I remembered and mentioned it to housekeeping in the hallway. The business center's printer was out of paper and the front desk staff happily offered to print what we needed at no charge - I'd say this is generally descriptive of the staff there - very nice and eager to please. One thing that I'll add - I'm happy to be green and re-use my towels for a few days BUT to do this I need hooks! When there's no where to hang a towel other than in the shower where it gets wet, it ends up on the floor needing replacement. Maybe take down the art in the bathroom and put in a few hooks/a towel rack? I'm a big fan of the Kimpton chain and the Palomar met my expectations in every way.

The hotel has a small fitness facility equipped with good treadmills, ellipticals and a recumbent bike and handweights and mats. It is clean and bright. We also swam laps in the rooftop pool, which is small but clean and adequate.

As many have said on here, the room was very nice - well decorated in a nice modern, contemporary style which is refreshing for a hotel chain in the US (most of which tend to be a bit boring!). Nicely cleaned and well maintaned, although slightly dusty (I've noted the comment about the slightly dated A/C, which may have been a factor). That said, when the room was cleaned on the first day, all sorted. Good quality bed linens, and nice bed. Bathroom nice size - could be bigger, but couldn't they always, eh?!? Comms provisions were very good also - free wireless internet (if you sign up as an In-Touch member, which was free!), and a 42\" TV with HD broadcasts, so you can watch TV in crystal clear quality. The only downside to this was that the HD signal kept cutting out on numerous days, which I queried at the time with housekeeping, and was told it was the inclement weather causing it. Funny how it worked fine in the bar area though! (A footnote to this - I raised this issue with the staff on my return to the UK, and had a very nice response from the Hotel Manager offering his apologies and a free upgrade next time, which seems very fair). All the staff at the hotel were very friendly and assisted where possible - happily lent us umbrellas to use during our stay, as we had 5 days of torrential rainstorms! We didn't eat in the restaurant here, so cannot comment on the quality of the food, but had a drink in the bar, where the staff were attentive and professional. The location of the hotel is great - if you're not hiring a car, it's a 5-minute walk from Westwood village, with an abundance of decent restaurants, diners, bars and a couple of great cinemas. All close to UCLA, so a nice crowd and a great vibe wandering around in the evening. Not too \"manic\" as you would expect in LA, but still very pleasant. Getting around was also easy - close to the 405 if you drive, and not far from I-10 also. If you're on foot, the 720 Metro Rapid bus stop is only 5 mins walk also, which takes you all the way along Wilshire Blvd (Eastbound) for $1.25 - a bargain, and very quick. In the 4 days we didn't have a car (we had one for the final 2 days), getting about was much easier than we expected, so save some money, give the legs a workout and get the bus!

So, we traipsed from room-to-room, floor-to-floor, with several phone calls to the front desk in between, before we got to the correct room!

After a total of three calls, we finally got our order, but only 3/4 of it was correct! So, we had to wait again, while the staff member went downstairs to retrieve the rest of our order. The elevators are not the fastest of hotel elevators and the cabs are done-up in \"mod\" nightclub fashion, dark, back-lit a deep red (day and night!) so that once the elevator door closes, one can hardly see anything inside the cab.

I believe our room was handicapped accessible, so that may account for the larger bathroom. If that is correct, our difficulties with the shower may not be present in all guest rooms. The shower head was situated on the long wall of the step-in shower instead of the narrow wall. This placement caused us to essentially flood the bathroom floor each morning.

Excellent service everywhere from reception through to housekeeping. Should especially mention the restaurant and bar staff who played Wi games with my 10 year old for an hour without complaint. We hired a car and parked 2 streets back which is a short walk from the hotel - just watch out, you have to move your car by 9 am! We received our first parking infringement within 48 hours of arrival. Westwood is a lovely area, plenty of restaurants and shops nearby, and a short walk from UCLA!! Had a great time at both Universal Studios and Disney Land! Also well located for the beaches and Getty Museum.

I have rarely seen a hotel with staff so happy and fun! I know this sounds strange in a review but it is the truth! The valet are all smiles and jocularity and the front desk check in..esp Brandon..I may have this name wrong if so sorry..the tall very handsome African American with a smile for miles, obviously very proud of the hotel, always has something entertaining to say that makes me feel very welcome... sort of like like being at a good friend's weekend condo instead of a hotel. Check in has always been a breeze and there is just something about this place that does not feel like a hotel. I have stayed in both a suite as well as a regular guest room. The beds are extra comfy with their piles of pillows,duvets, high thread count linens, and lux bed throws. There are animal print robes [free to wear during your stay] hanging in the closet as well as socks and pjs for those who want to start their shopping early! [you can purchase everything]. Each time I have requested a room on a higher floor overlooking the more peacefull neighborhood of Westwood rather than the busier side which looks out onto Wilshire. I have always been accommodated. The views are wonderful! Now, if you have the extra cash to stay in one of their suites , it is well worth the splurge. Two nice sized rooms, flat screen tvs in both, a wet bar,stocked mini fridge, with a gigantic bathroom replete with huge soaking tub,double vanities, and a spacious walk in shower for two. It is as nice a bathroom as I have had in a hotel. As for the regular guest rooms, they are a bit on the smallish side, but that doesnt dampen the experience of their uber elegant/hip feeling of style. I also like their pool area, which, like the hotel, has a cozy feel to it with a large privacy wall,lush greenery, and a wonderful wrap around sofa that stretches out along the shaded wall. There are also abundant chaises available for those who wish to soak up the California sun. There is nothing pretentious about this place, which I really like! The location is nice. You are away from the typical touristy hustle bustle of Hollywood Blvd.and the fussy 'hoi paloi' of the Rodeo BH area. [yet you are not far if you wish to venture that way] There is the great Westwood area about three to four easy walking blocks from the hotel. It is a wonderful mix of upscale eateries,sidewalk bistros and cafes, trendy clothing stores, as well as an Urban Outfitter,a Whole Foods,movie theatres and of course the beautiful UCLA campus. I understand it is an area that has recently been refurbished. Indeed, you will still see some of the signs of the older neighborhood, a scruffy street person or two, but it has a vibrancy to it reminiscent of smaller university towns all over the country. About 2 short blocks from the hotel..hang a left as you leave the lobby, there is a great coffee shop with killer breakfasts and good lunch fare, also a good place to purchase soft drinks and snacks at far more reasonable prices than the mini bar or hotel restaurant. If there was one thing negative about this hotel, it is the restaurant,which is also where the room service food comes from. Not so great and exhorbitantly..I mean off the wall expensive!!! I dont mind paying if the quality is there but sadly they do need to revamp both their menu and prices. They were about the same as the Beverly Wislhire Four Seasons..need I say more? The hotel is such a great experience and so well run it is ashame to have to give it a low mark for the food. I will have to say that the last time we stayed there, I called for reservations thru Kimpton In Touch of which I am a member [it is free and worth joining bc you earn points with each stay that allows you to build up enough for free stays and exclusive offers], and I was given an absolutely fantastic rate [better than any other hotel chain I called like Marriott and Hilton both of which I am an honor awards point member]. Along with the reduced summer rate, we were given four free beers a night,[we stayed three nights this trip, a week last time] which we could also order from room service at no additional charge. Pretty nice even though I am a wino! They also have an afternoon wine reception in the lobby as well as coffee and tea in the mornings.[I actually saw a lady in her leopard bathrobe getting her coffee..she too must feel comfy here at this hotel!]. As we checked out, our car was brought to us right away with the usual happy nods and greetings. One of the valets noticed that my daughter's car had a white scrape on the side, which she promptly told the concerned valet, she had done herself in her apartment garage. He actually took the time to bring out a special polishing cream that immediately made the scratch disappaear..wiping at it and polishing it to a shiny new sheen! Now that is service..and as always, at the Palomar, with a smile!", "Date": "September 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cGood overall, but staff needs training\u201d", "Author": "NewYorkLu", "ReviewID": "UR39384286", "Content": "My husband and I have stayed at many Kimptons, but this was our first time at the Palomar. Our first impression was quite negative due to the front desk staff. They seemed stressed and overwhelmed, and were borderline rude to guests. One of the receptionists, Autumn, was particularly huffy and spoke to us loudly, in very condescending tones. When we checked out, the situation was similar -- not a smile, not a \"how was your stay?\", nothing. They need better training in guest relations. Luckily our room was very nice. It was on the small side, but nicely appointed. We especially liked the chaise by the window. The bathroom clearly hadn't gotten much attention from housekeeping; there was a curly hair next to the sink and we were only given one bar of soap, presumably to share between the sink and the shower/tub. The drains in both the tub and sink were clogged, so we had to call maintenance to fix the issue (which they did quickly, although with no apologies from management). Some previous reviews had mentioned that the air conditioning is loud, which is true. But that actually worked in our favor. It created \"white noise\", masking any kind of noise from the other guests. While it's common at hotels to hear doors opening/closing, TVs, people talking in the halls, etc. -- we heard absolutely nothing and slept really well at the Palomar. Oh, and the bed was extremely comfortable, too. We got a great night's sleep. Unlike other Kimptons, they do their wine hour in the hotel bar. There's a very reasonably priced appetizer happy hour menu (in the $3-$5 range) to go along with the free wine, which is generously poured. The pool is small but has a nice decor and good music playing (not too loud). However, in the time we were there, no staff came by to pick up the towels/glasses that had been left by previous guests.

I've called desk services twice and, although the young man there has tried to move these people along, they are still playing out their dramas in the hallway. Hold on . . . My next door neighbor has just reminded these fine young folks that they're in a hallway at 3 a.m. and the rest of us have more to do in the morning than survive a hangover. He appears to have gotten them to move into their rooms where now their dramas are muffled exchanges of stupidity rather than the blaring honks of melodrama we all had to listen to moments ago.

Let me start writing by listing some of the pros and then cons. Pros: clean room, comfortable bed, good parking valets, free internet for intouch members, nice towels, coffee in lobby in the early AM (on the con side, maybe they could serve it later on weekends). Free wine hour (too bad it was Fetzer) Cons: ( all of which combined, make this hotel a 3 star) 1. Upon check-in, the valet took my bag, but not wife's. This shouldn't happen in a 4 star. 2. We reserved a vista deluxe room but were given a room with a view of another building (not a vista). When I asked for what I reserved, the helpful valet (not the one who took our bags) made a call and had us moved to the type of room we reserved. This shouldn't happen in a 4 star. 3. Looked for the concierge on 3 separate occasions, but he or she was never at their desk. This shouldn't happen in a 4 star. 4. Asked the front desk clerk for an LA Weekly to see what was going on in town, Her response \"we don't carry it because it would be too hard to keep in stock.\" It is a free paper, had come out that morning, should be available for guests in a 4 star hotel. The person who made the decision to not have it available to guests seems to have missed the point that it is hard to keep in stack because guests want to use it. Also asked for a Sunday paper at 10:00 AM and desk clerk seemed to be annoyed that I didn't get my butt up at 8:00 AM so that I could ensure I got one. Gruffly went to the back office and got me a copy. This shouldn't happen in a 4 star. 5. Free internet for intouch members was spotty and hotel was less than helpful in troubleshooting. This could easily happen in a 4 star. 6. Location sucks if one wants to walk to breakfast. I know it is LA and everyone drives, but it would be nice to walk to coffee in the morning. In all honesty, I grew up in LA and knew the location before booking, but think that others that are not familiar should have this info. 7. No and/or poor food or drink service at the pool. Went to the pool thinking there would be poolside service. After about 20 minutes of hanging out I went to the front desk to ask about food and drink service and to ask that the used towels in the pool area be cleaned up. I was informed that there is no regular drink service at the pool, but that I could order room service and have it delivered to the pool. I asked them to send a waiter. 20 minutes later the waiter arrived. I tried to order a margarita with a specific kind of tequila, but the waiter wasn't sure if they had it. I offered him three different options and asked him to bring me one of the 3 options. 15 minutes later he arrived not with my drink, but with a list of the tequilas they did have and then asked me what kind I wanted in my \"mojito\" At that point I cut my losses, informing the waiter that mojitos are not made with tequila, that I had wanted a margarita, and that it I no longer wanted anything because I had little faith that my drink would be correct or in my hand in any reasonable amount of time. This shouldn't happen in a 4 star. 8. Upon check out, valet once again took my bag but not my wife's. I am 6'4\" and 230 pounds, my wife is 5'7 and 135 pounds. Who do you think needed help with their bag? This shouldn't happen in a 4 star. All in all, this hotel looks like a 4 star, but IMO the difference between a 3 and 4 star hotel are in the details, which the staff and management of the Palomar have neglected.

Yes, the pool area is small and shady, but truthfully I found it relaxing and cozy.

The seating is in the sun for part of the afternoon, but it was hard to find a seat and the pool was cold - had it been in the sun it might have been warmer.

This is a big thing for us as we have a Temperpedic bed at home & always miss our bed when staying away. Not here! Big, flat screen t.v.'s. (2 in a suite) Room Service that was faster than the time quoted. Lots of little details that make a hotel with a difference such as; everything that you forgot they have it, at Guest Services. For instance: I cut myself & they sent a bandaid & antiseptic ointment on the double! Suites have awesome spa tubs big enough for two & great bathrooms! The Minuses: Room service Breakfast: it was quick but was not prepared as we had asked it to be (plus it was $77.00) & was just ok. We travel allot & find most hotels have this problem. So, it was no different here. Great chefs refuse to cook room service breakfast or any other kind of breakfast it seems. Your better off eating downstairs, where you can ask for something you didn't get etc, or out. On our second nights stay we were upgraded to a suite, as the hotel was almost fully booked. Zero complaint there! The bathroom was huge with a spa tub. I loved it!! But, the air conditioning didn't work in either in the sitting room or bedroom, so we had to call the hotel \"engineer.\" That's a minor complaint as it was fixed quickly & efficiently. But, like most who travel, we appreciate a super clean room with everything in working order before we arrive. No one wants a service person in their room when they are relaxing & a hotel, that's on the ball, should routinely check all the room equipment, plumbing etc. before the room is \"turned over\" I feel.

Hotel Palomar is a great hotel and a great base for a stay in LA. To the reviewers who said that it was so far away from everything - what do you mean by everything? It is very close to the airport, a short drive to Hollywood/Beverly Hills etc., a slightly longer drive to the beaches - where else do you want to go? We walked everyday into the Westwood neighbourhood for great food/drinks and we also saw the opening of the Transformers movie and a concert by Lincoln Park all walking distance from our hotel. To the reviewers who complained about parking costs - this is LA - it costs money to park at every hotel, restaurant etc. - just get used to it. We also got a discount on the valet parking because we hired a Prius which was nice. To the reviewers who complained about the service - maybe you were rude and did not get the best service possible as we did, especially the lovely smiley valet parking attendants - they were so friendly and helpful and very sweet with our children. Our kids loved the pool and we had a quiet room with a great view.

We chose this hotel for its location close to Westwood, the UCLA campus and Beverly Hills and also because of the glowing reviews on Trip Advisor. This property is located on Wilshire Blvd. and sits among several high-rise residential properties. However, once you enter into the lobby, you would never know that you are on such a busy thoroughfare. During our stay, there were a few hiccups with the valet parking because we had to wait in line for the valet to take our car whenever we returned from our daily excursions. But even so, I must say that this is one of the few hotels (outside of NYC) that I have visited that seem to have a sufficient valet staff; our car was always waiting for us when we called down before heading downstairs. Our room was somewhat on the small size, but it was nicely decorated and was equipped with an acceptable flat panel HD TV, and an AC unit that kept the room cool during the heat of the day \u2013 that was a first for us. Other than that, the room was clean, comfortable and the housekeeping staff was superb. We initially had a few problems with the free wireless but that problem was quickly solved. I booked our room through Expedia and got a very nice rate for this grade of hotel, and I am glad to say that this hotel greatly exceeded my expectations. Sadly, we were never able to take advantage of the complimentary wine in the hotel bar nor did we check out the pool. Every member of the staff was professional and gracious and made us feel so welcome. We did have a rental car and if you stay at this hotel, you must have one if you plan on seeing the sights in L.A.

We had some wine and sangria and played Wii bowling while munching on cheese and olives.

A Continental breakfast was included each day that consisted of juice, coffee, tea, a choice of bread and a pastry item. This was served at their onsite restaurant, which we did not have time to visit during lunch or dinner service. My only problem came with some missing cash that I had left in my luggage in the closet. I reported this to the front desk and mentioned to them that my door also had a problem with not shutting tightly and it required some extra tugging and jiggling. I doubt that the staff had anything to do with this, and most likely, after it had been cleaned the door probably hadn\u2019t shut tightly and someone had taken advantage of that. They assured me they had never had this happen before and would have someone look at the door the next day. In retrospect, I should have placed my cash in the safe, but in all of my years of travel this was a first. I was grateful it was a small amount. I checked out the next morning, but hopefully, the door was indeed fixed. Also, I checked the credit card account I had used for this hotel a few days later and found a charge on it. When I called I was told it was for an item from the mini-bar. I informed them I hadn\u2019t even received the key for the mini-bar and they told me it would be removed and it was. They were very gracious and apologetic. I mention this only so that you check your account after you leave to make sure you haven\u2019t been mistakenly charged for something as well. Overall, I would stay here again. I have to give the hotel a four only because of the incidents I encountered, but it is a wonderful property otherwise.

The location is pretty good. Westwood is central to a lot of LA places that many visitors want to see--Santa Monica, Sunset Strip, Beverly Hills. I found that worked even without a car, as I was on this trip. There's a lot of bus service on Wilshire Boulevard and into Westwood Village and UCLA. The hotel is also a short walk from the hotel to Westwood Village, the commercial district that adjoins UCLA. Unfortunately, the immediate setting for the hotel is Wilshire Boulevard, which in this section is a 6-8 lane high speed road, lined by high rise apartment buildings and nothing else. It's safe to walk along and cross--there are signals--but it's very noisy and not very pleasant. Even in my 18th floor room at the window (with the window closed) I could hear traffic noise, though not enough to disturb me at night. The hotel and room were pretty--in the Kimpton mold--as a previous reviewer said. I recently stayed in a Kimpton Hotel in Washington and was beginning to recognize it. The red lit elevator and dark lobby hallways were interesting. The room wasn't huge but it was big enough for one or two and had pretty much the most view that the surrounding highrises would allow. They had a very good last minute rate--$109 for a \"Vista\" view room, way below rack rates. No complaints on the money side. Where I saw favoritism had to do with a late checkout. They had accommodated an early check in with no problem. I asked for a late checkout to fit my bus schedule to the airport. The desk staff told me that they couldn't have any late checkouts that day. OK, no biggie, late checkout isn't a right, I stored my suitcase with them and ran an errand. When I came back to retrieve my suitcase I saw that someone else was checking out late.

Twice while we were there and asked questions regarding a charge on your room that we were unaware of, we got the \"well this is a 4 star hotel and this kind of charge is quite normal for this type of a hotel.\" I thought that kind of attitude was unneccsary, as we stay in 4 and 5 star resorts frequently and it had nothing do do with the unauthorized charge on our card. They finally rectified the unauthorized charge (with an attitude), but this kind of behavior was constant throughout the staff, and was just unnecessary. Also, I'm not sure if it was just an issue when we were staying there, but the TV's had very limited channels. Some of the few channels that actually worked had signal problems and very bad reception. We found this annoying when you just wanted to watch TV before bed and relax. They mention how amazing their hotel is constantly while you're there, one would think that having basic, working TV channels would be standard. As previous review have mentioned there is a coffee and tea bar in the mornings from 6am-9am. We would have preferred to have a coffee maker in the room or in addition to the bar in the lobby (standard for all levels of hotels now). There were times when I was working from my room and wanted a cup of coffee in the middle of the day, but had no access to it since the coffee/tea bar was long gone and there was no way to make coffee or hot water in my room. Parking is steep at $30 a day, but the valets are attentive and bring your car around promptly. These are all small details, but things that the we thought The Palomar truly overlooked.

Overall we enjoyed our time here and it offered good value, but we would not want to stay at this hotel for more then a night or two. If you have stayed at a Kimpton hotel, you know the room d\u00e9cor is always unique and a little different. At this location, we did not love the look of the room. The colors were mostly black and brown, with some splashes of brighter colors thrown in. There were too many patterns in the room including a snake skin pattern on the face of the dresser. The room came across as too dark and busy, and not very relaxing. As others have mentioned, the room was a little small as was the bathroom. South facing rooms have nice views, North facing rooms overlook busy Wilshire Boulevard and condos. I believe the hotel used to be a Doubletree before Kimpton took over, and was not built from the ground up as a new hotel. The rest of the hotel is pretty nice with a good boutique hotel feel with a little clublike atmosphere thrown in. We did not use the restaurant but we did check out the pool. The pool is decent size but the pool area is long, narrow, and lined up very close to the building. There are two attractive conversation areas but only five or six oversized lounge chairs for sitting in the sun at a hotel with over 200 rooms. We were at the pool late in the afternoon so some were available, but this is not a hotel for very many people to hang out by the pool. Overall The Palomar is a nice hotel with a central location. The staff was also very friendly and the happy hour is a nice touch rarely found at big city hotels. But not everyone will like the rooms and in a great weather city like LA, the pool setup is not large enough for a hotel this size.", "Date": "November 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "LA,Dalllas,Tampa,Miami", "Title": "\u201cSimply the Best!!!\u201d", "Author": "yuh8n", "ReviewID": "UR21805908", "Content": "This is a world class property.

The lobby has a nice sophisticated-but-comfortable vibe and there are all types who stay here - couples, families, business travellers, and those on trips with friends. And there are also pets - we were startled by a beautiful golden retriever when we got off the elevator one morning! Service is very good overall - attentive, friendly and very helpful. The concierge, Paul, made some great recommendations for a Saturday night out including AOC, which we didn't realize until afterwards was such a highly-regarded restaurant. He also gave tips on when to arrive at Bar Marmont so that we could be sure to enjoy the Saturday night vibe and miss the line! A few small things. Room service, although 24 hour, is expensive and the restaurant closes around 10 or 11, so come prepared if you get in on a late flight! There is also a very limited night menu (from 11 PM or 12 to 6 AM). Also seems that there are a fair number of new staff right now. They are all trying hard and doing a great job but some of them don't yet have a good knowledge of the area/sights and some processes - like an early morning check-out - were a little slow. But everyone is keen and friendly - the most important thing. This hotel is in a nice area but you do have to walk a bit to get to shopping, etc. But it's LA so to be expected - just about anyone visiting the city should be prepared to rent a car. Valet parking is $30/day. A little pricey but definitely cheaper than the downtown areas of a lot of major cities - San Fran, NY.

From front office, to bell and valet everybody gives you that warm welcome feeling like you are at home and will do almost everything to make your stay as pleasant as possible. I cannot remember any other hotel on the many trips I've made to the USA where I found a similar experience. They even offer a complimentary wine hour, but we were to busy exploring LA to join ! Only thing missing was a balcony to enjoy the streetlife or hotel view and the WiFi reception was unfortunality rather bad. But nevertheless this hotel would be my choice again next time (hopefully again with a good Expedia offer 'cause their rack rates are kinda pricy for me, though worth the money). Final remark is that the hotel parking is also pricy (USD 30 overnight) and they only offer valet service. As an European I'd prefer to do the parking myself (although the valets are most attentive) but I simply find self parking more comfortable.

As a frequent visitor to L.A. I was even more interested to see their entry to the market, and so I booked a stay here in July. When pulling up to the building (in a great block of Wilshire close to UCLA and Westwood,) I remembered it to be a former Doubletree, where I had also stayed in the past and not had great experiences. On the whole--what a difference Kimpton makes! However, for the price paid--$359 per night at the time--I have some quibbles. The staff, as pointed out elsewhere, ranges from \"overly familiar\" to \"downright snotty,\" depending upon where they are stationed. (Those behind the desk need to loosen up a bit, and those attending to baggage and parking could be a bit more polished. On the whole though, not bad--particularly for L.A, and management seems to be trying to strike the right tone.) The lobby is minimalist in style, while still managing to be warm and inviting due to the earthy color scheme and furniture. However, the double-sided glass and marble fireplace, a nice touch, was a bit TOO warm for July. It heated the lobby area to an unacceptable level, making it somewhat uncomfortable to linger over the generous and complimentary evening wine reception. Some advice--either turn off the gas in the summer or crank up the air conditioning! As is the usual with Kimpton Hotels, the common areas are really nice, and this is especially true of the workout room. It has card access, individually controlled AC, and lots of top-notch elliptical and treadmill equipment. A bar cooler with complimentary bottled water and chilled towels is a nice touch. Now to the rooms: I'm afraid no amount of offbeat animal-print furnishings, black brocade headboards, turquoise bolster pillows and wooden sliding bathroom doors can disguise this building's more proletariat origins. The rooms are narrow and fairly small, with a very conventional hotel layout. So while this is a nice decorating effort, the room layout leaves a lot to be desired. In fact, with the scale of furnishings used, the rooms border on \"cramped\"...largely because they are so narrow. The bathrooms are reworked but still not what I would call luxurious, with a small (5ft.) conventional tub and shower combination. Tip: the so-called \"Vista\" rooms have a truly unexceptional \"view\" of the UCLA area and are not worth the extra bucks in my opinion. The upcharge for them is almost insulting. I suggest a standard Wilshire-view room; in these you may at least spot something \"interesting\" going on in one of the many highrise condos across the street!! More than anything, it's the conventional layout of this non-descript 80's hotel building which lets down the Palomar. The decor and everything that goes into running a fine hotel is in place. The problem for Kimpton here will be the rates. Once crossing the $350 mark, there are many other nicer choices in better locations, as far as I am concerned. This hotel competes with others such as Joie de Vivre's \"Angeleno\", but not with the true four or five star hotels in the area--which, these days, are often running specials too. Do I recommend the Hotel Palomar and would I go back? That depends. Actually, I am doing so in August for two nights for a special rate of $179 per night. At that price it's a steal...and HIGHLY recommended. But when the rates go back up to the mid $300s or more, I am likely to stay elsewhere...", "Date": "August 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "minneapolis", "Title": "\u201cShagadellic\u201d", "Author": "travellingchef81", "ReviewID": "UR19072600", "Content": "Best place to stay in LA.

The Westwood-area hotel is easily accessed on Wilshire Blvd., which is good, since most area restaurants and shops will require a drive (or at least a very long walk). Everything looked new, which makes sense as the hotel was extensively renovated and has only been open as a Palomar for three months. The staff seemed friendly and eager, but unpolished (I generally don't expect to hear the terms 'cool' and 'awesome' being used by the staff during check-in). The rooms seemed somewhat smaller than usual, but were clean, and included both very nice details (42\" flat panel television, chaise lounge, ample lighting with touch controls) and disappointing shortcuts (no HD on the TV, cheapish furniture). During my stay I was able to enjoy a dinner at BLVD 16, the combination restaurant/lounge just off the lobby. The food was good, the service was very attentive and the atmosphere was festive--the restaurant was still quite busy at 10 at night.

I've stayed at most of the $400+ per night L.A. hotels, and for less than half of the price, the Palomar was exceptional. To echo bocafive's experience, we enjoyed the convenience of the location, fantastic value, quality and style of the renovations given it's an older hotel, the friendly and efficient staff, and free wireless access. The a/c might be a little loud as others have said, and the walls are on the thin side, but neither of those issues did anything to diminish the quality of our stay. The one thing I wasn't expecting was the huge wine reception crowd in the lobby when we arrived, which made it very loud and chaotic, but it was much more peaceful and quite attractive environment later in the evening when we returned from dinner. This location is fantastic for anyone visiting UCLA or Beverly Hills businesses, as the BH border is just a couple of minutes up Wilshire. Kimpton seems to be pretty generous with perks for its repeat guests --- I got a ridiculously low rate with free parking via an email offer as a prior Palomar San Francisco guest. I'd suggest that anyone considering a stay here (or at any Kimpton) sign up for their special offer email in case something like this is offered again. Overall --- sure, I'd rather stay at the Peninsula or the Beverly Wilshire, but I can only swallow their big rates on more special occasions.
