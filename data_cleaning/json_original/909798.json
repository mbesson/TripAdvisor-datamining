{"Reviews": [{"Content": "It Sucks!! I just got back from New Year's holiday in Bali, which unfortunately the New Year plan was made in such a sudden.That's why I was stuck at this hotel.We paid IDR 120000/day for nothing! It was filthy!The bed was smelly, the sheet has stained, the person who mopped the floor was too lazy to realize that after he mopped the floor, it's even more dirty than it (might) was!The floor was sticky and dusty (mix between dust and water and whatever chemical he used to mopped the floor).The bathroom was flooded (the drain stuck with hair! Long black hair!)Addition to that, the ceiling leaks when heavy rain! (It was raining every night, the 2nd night we stayed there, when we got back home from New Year party, the bed was wet!)I trully trully dissapointed and think IDR 120000/day was totally not worth it!I must say this is a five-star UNRECOMMENDED place to stay", "Date": "Jan 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR595919444", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "gmy11"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297697-d909798-r12283528-LA_Inn-Kuta_Bali.html", "HotelID": "909798", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
