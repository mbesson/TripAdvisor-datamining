It will save you dragging you luggage over bridges all around Venice and arriving exhausted. The owners Sandro and Iris were so helpful. They welcomed us as if we were family and assured us that even though the other hotel left us without a room, they would would fix everything. And they did. They helped us even taking our luggage up and when we left, Sandro even helped us bringing our luggage down. Breakfast was acceptable with good coffee. The room has no tv or barfridge but it is not needed for a few days stay and this is what keeps their price down.

The Rialto vaporetti stop is a much quicker way to get to and from the train station, but more difficult to find the hotel... so I'd recommend starting from San Marco the first time because from there it's a simple walk with two turns and one bridge crossing. Also, there is a Gondola parked right outside the hotel, which is much nicer and more relaxing than taking a Gondola ride right next to 20 other tourists on Gondolas near the Hard Rock or Grand Canal.

The second day into the trip I returned from an afternoon of sightseeing. My room was on the second floor at the end of a very hall. The stairway leading up to the second floor was pitch black, and the lights did not go on when motion was detected. I attempted to locate the light switch at the top of the stairs, but in doing so I fell down four of the marble stairs and landed in the doorway of another guest's room. The owner, a purported medical doctor, and two employees came running. I told the owner that I had broken my wrist as it was positioned at an odd angle. He asked if I could move my fingers, and when I said I could, he proceeded to take my wrist and shake it and tell me that it was not broken. He was in a hurry to get me to stand up and go to my room and get out of the hallway. I told him that I was not ready to get up as I was quite shaken by the experience. Someone brought me some ice, and that was the last I saw or heard from anyone. He didn't offer any type of medical assistance. When we left the next day, the owner didn't even inquire as to how I was feeling. You could tell he just wanted to get rid of us. This was quite distressing as I was in a lot of pain and, as it turns out, I had to cut my trip short and return home as my wrist was broken in four places and required surgery which I am still recovering from. This negligence and callous disregard for their guests is something people should keep in mind when considering a stay at the Hotel Riva.

Bear in mind that the corner rooms have no air conditioning, but if you are there after late August and before summer then you should be fine. In early September we had crisp cool breezes and needed a light cover up during the days so no A/C was not a problem at all. What the hotel lacks in size it more than makes up for in charm. Our room was tiny and the bathroom even tinier (although I know from a friend that not all rooms are the same size) but it was very charming and we were pleased with it. Plus the minute you open up the windows and see the gondolas glide lazily by you are in love. This hotel is a walk-up. So when I called to ask for corner room availability I was told I had an option for which floor I wanted it on - First, second, third or fourth. Since we had a small child with us we opted for the first floor corner room. Soon after our trip, my colleague stayed at the hotel and she had a fourth floor corner room. We exchanged notes and found that her corner room on the fourth floor was very large and was the one that Rick had stayed in! It is true that the breakfast here is very skimpy. We only had bread, butter, jam, nutella, orange juice, milk and coffee as options. However, this did not matter to us as we needed the bare minimum to start the day and would pick up other goodies once outside. We had friends who were staying at a very expensive chain hotel who complained they had no breakfast included and were charged for even bottled water! So, in comparison I have no complaints. It was a tad annoying that on a couple of nights when we returned late (I think it was around 11 or 11:30) the door to the little hotel was locked and we had to ring a bell and wait for the sleepy night manager to open the door to us. But on the plus side, the small size of the hotel meant that when we needed cold milk for our daughter at night when we returned my husband just had to ask the night manager for it or he just made his way to the fridge in the dining area and poured it out himself - and again, the hotel did not charge us for this.
