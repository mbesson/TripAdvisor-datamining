The location is very central, withing walking distance to all the major attractions and shops. If you'd rather get the train there are several metro stations close by as well. The room was clean and bright, the bathroom was big and housekeeping did a great job everyday. The standout was definitely Alex, one of the staff members. He was friendly, always willing to suggest things to do and answer any questions. He also helped us purchase football tickets online as the page was in Spanish and we couldn't understand a word! If you are traveling alone, be warned: there is no common room or kitchen so it is extremely hard to meet other travellers. Also, breakfast is pre-packaged sugary snacks but there are so many good places to eat in Madrid that it wasn't a big issue.

We were not impressed with the front door, intercom system nor the lift but when we arrived on level 2 it was a different matter. The hostal is nicely decorated and very welcoming. The room contained all the expected necessities and its size was good and very well kept and clean. A rather small bathroom but the shower was brilliant. We had two balconies and one window and we were worried that the noise from traffic and nightlife outside would not allow us to sleep. This was note the case, each of the exterior apertures are equipped with very good quality double glazing. They are not 100% sound proof but we were not disturbed during our sleep.The walls between the rooms are paper thin and this was more of a concern! It was very hot during our stay and the room temperature was always comfortable so no complaints regarding air-conditioning either. In terms of facilities, the rooms do not have a fridge or a microwave but receptionist offered to keep our items in their fridge whenever required. They also confirmed that they could heat our items using their microwave whenever we needed. They were also kind enough to provide us with an electric kettle so that we could prepare some tea in our room, in the morning. Other members mentioned the coffee machine and cold water/soft drinks vending machines in the hallway. We also found these to be very convenient. Hotel also provides some free supermarket type , plastic wrapped cakes, pastries on the high table for guests every morning, which is a nice gesture, we thought. WIFI worked well from our room. The staff at Hostal Gala are very friendly and english speaking. Always willingly helping us out and recommending some very good places to visit. They provided us with accurate directions and some good ideas and tips to make our holiday a memorable one. The location of this little gem is probably the main key advantage. It is conveniently located in the very centre close to all the main attractions as well as the Callao, Santo Domingo and Opera Metro stations. We used to walk Puerto Del Sol square and get there within 5 minutes and Plaza Mayor within 10 minutes. There are some decent restaurants in the vicinity too. We are not fans of the 'all you can eat' type but there is a restaurant called Topolino just across the road offering good all you can eat menus, at just Eur 8.95 per person during weekdays. Kids loved it because they could have both Pizza and Paella! We were very happy with our choice of accommodation in Madrid. Hostal Gala satisfied our requirement and we highly recommend it!

The reviews were very helpful and when we got to the hotel I actually thought that the reviews did not do it justice as far as the location goes. This hotel is within walking distance of everything we wanted to see during our short stay! Not only could we walk to see the Royal Palace, but we could walk to the Prado Museum and to the Reina Sophia Museum that houses Picasso's \"Guernica.\" It's also a short walk to Plaza Major and La Puerta del Sol. The staff were always friendly and smiling eager to help if we needed anything. The rooms don't come with a hairdryer but we asked for one and got it promptly. They also offered us a laptop to use in our room - along with free Wifi access so we could check our emails. A special bonus in the opinions of my husband and myself was the location of a great grocery store in the lower level of the El Cortes Ingles department store just one block away. We like to stock up on beverages, fruit, cheese, etc. for picnic-style meals that allow us more time for sight-seeing and less time spent sitting in restaurants waiting for service. One final note - if you do use the metro use the Santo Domingo stop for this hotel as it is literally across the street and down the hil about 2 buildings. We took the bus from the airport to the Atocha train station where we got on the metro to head to the hotel. The train station is within walking distance but we didn't want to lug our bags that distance so we hopped on the metro and just couldn'd believe how close the hotel was to the stop when we got off.

Plenty of restaurants/cafes in the area and less than five minutes from Gran Via. I highly recommend the hop on/hop off bus (tickets can be purchased at the hostal) if only for transportation. I love walking but it's a big city. I did the whole bus tour once to get the narration and a feel for the city. Then I went to areas I wanted to see again or eat near and travelled via the bus.

As other reviews state, this is a hostal, not a hotel. The rooms are wonderfully, but basically decorated. Saying this, I had the BEST shower I've ever had in a hotel here - it was wonderful.

The downside is that as every other review has mentioned, the walls are thin and it can get noisy - especially on Saturday night when the nearby club rocks on until dawn. I had room 221 jsut behind reception and could hear most things easily through the walls. Though not a place for light sleepers, I had no trouble (and had earplugs just in case).
