Then they proceeded to ask what my interest were while staying in Rome, and helped me perfect my itinerary to get the most out of my stay. As for the accommodations, I had everything I needed and more. The rooms was spotless, and apparently they recently renovated the location, so everything had a fresh clean appearance. A hearty breakfast was provided each morning, with complimentary Italian pastries, deli choices, fruits, and juices. And internet access and laundry services were all easily accessible. The location was perfect, literally right across the street from Termini station, with all the major sites within walking distance.

First, there were a lot of youths sitting and lying on the floor of the 2 or 3 steps entrance of the old building that looks like a tenement to me. Went up the 2 flight of stairs. The asian staff were friendly, though there's a lady who I've heard wants to cancel her reservation talking to the receptionist. I immediately got my key to the room before I hear discouraging stuff, it's on the second floor by stairs. The corridor was clean and then the room - very small as in really small maybe 2 meters X 2.5 meters or less, juz enough to fit in a single bed and a cabinet. The tv up on the wall, below it is a small table and a chair juz at the back of the door. The small toilet/shower inside the room is connected without door nor curtain so everytime I sleep I could see it from my bed. And if I take a shower I have to be extra careful that the water may not spill all over the room. Fixtures are somewhat old-style or juz old. The room has a window overlooking the inside of the building laundry hanging from some windows, unpleasant view so it's better to close the curtains. IIn fairness, the nice asian staff at the hotel are super friendly and tried hard to make the place clean and pleasant. Though coming from other european cities and stayed at budget hotels - this is by far the worst and the most expensive, ok the hotel that I've stayed in Amsterdam is EUR5 more expensive than this one, BUT that one was a 000 miles better, in fact I love that place. Plus I've got feasted by mosquitoes prompting me to choose between moving to another hotel and forget about the non-refundable prepayment and spend some more on another? OR my wiser decision since I only have 1 night left in the city - bought a body spray mosquito repellant that I never stopped spraying every 2 hours waking up. The room rate was EUR50/night including a small breakfast, booked through Booking.com I think this is how it goes in this area - an amazing place that makes up for the expensive accommodation. Will I recommend Luciani Hotel? For the location yes, for the room NO. For a night Yes if no choice, more NO. For the facilities NO - for the extra-caring staff YES.

I didn't sleep well, but my husband and daughter slept OK. The room was clean, but the reading lights next to the bed didn't work, which was inconvenient. Towels were thin.

The hotel offers breakfast, but we did not partake as we were out very early both mornings we were here in order to take full advantage of our time. There are a lot of good restaurants very close to the hotel, as well as hole-in-the-wall coffee shops and bars that are a gathering place for locals and tourists alike.

Incredibly Raymond at Hotel Luciani recognised the description, contacted the restaurant owner for us to confirm they still had the camera and emailed back. He got the camera and stored it safely at the hotel for us. None of the other hotels even bothered to email us back to say that they couldn't help.

The people at the desk, especially Veronica were fantastic to say the least. Hotel is very conveniently situated right next to the train and bus station. The area was no problem at all. The superior room included air conditioning which was necessary at this time of year (otherwise 10 euro a day!). Breakfast was very simple but a reasonable start to the day. Staff reliable, friendly and honest. The rooms were simple but comfortable for the price paid. It is NOT a rundown place with a few beds and chairs. I had the feeling that they wanted to please so that word of mouth would spread the news of a good place at a very reasonable price with a decent service, which is not the rip off that much of Rome is. Be sure to book ahead for some of the major sites like the Vatican Museum, Borghese Gallery and the Coloseum if you can. In Trastevere there are good meals to be had at reasonable prices. Go to the Piazza Sante Maria in Trastevere and walk upwards through the small alley about 50m to the right of the church. Dont eat or drink (a beer can be 8 euros!) in the square. Carry on for about 600m round a slight bend and then a turn to the left to Taverna della Scala (Piazza della Scala). A litre house wine 8 euros, a menu for 15 euros (4 courses with choices for the two main courses-good Italian cuisine and quality) and an excellent staff. Veronica at the hotel has excellent ideas for walks, visits and ideas of how to do things. There is internet access in the Hotel. Will definitely stay there again and recommend it with 5 stars as an overall fair priced and good package.

We were 2 couples traveling with a total of 6 pieces of luggage and when we arrived at the hotel we were greeted with 2 flights of stairs and no elevator! After we dragged our luggage up the stairs we were greeted by a not so friendly staff. She gave us our room, which was #20, and it was up another flight of stairs with all the pieces of luggage. We booked a quad and once we opened the door we were surprised by 1 full bed, 1 twin and 1 bunk bed, very odd combination. Upon further investigation we notice that the room was dirty, the multi-colored floor hid most of the dirt but trust me it was there. The walls were white with various black marks all over them, the electric sockets were UNCOVERED which was a definite safety risk, and then there was the bathroom! The shower curtain was ripped, how much is a new shower curtain! And the ceiling in the bathroom was made out of some metal mesh material with a huge collection of dust bunnies on it. We all laughed and said to each other, it is only for one night! The only good thing about the room was the streets were clean and it was located directly across the street from the train station. It was rather hot that night so we noticed that there was an air conditioner, however there was no controller. We asked at the front desk and were told that there would be a $10.00 charge? How ever heard of such a thing? After we got the remote for the ac we went up and tried to watch some TV, but the TV didn't work and we didn't bother asking as that was probably another $10.00 charge. The next day we went down for our breakfast with consisted of Cafe, juice, for food there was croissants, hard toast w/Nutella and some cereal which looked like it had been in the serving jars for about a year. Upon check out we gave the front desk staff our key and never received a thank you or come again....don't worry we wont! Before we booked the hotel we did look at pictures on the internet,,,,not sure where the pictures were taken but definitely were not in room #20.
