My base was the Imperial Hotel. As has become my m.o. when posting reviews here, I have broken this review down into the Great, the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. I will then offer some bottom line / recommendations and answer THE reviewer question (would I do it again?) GREAT # 1 - While there is nothing particularly great about this tourist class hotel, I really love the rate I got two weekend nights at: $69 USD (about E 46 at the time) per night! They have a graduating rate scale at this hotel - whereby the lesser price you choose, the less flexibility and ammenities you get. That WAS great. GOOD # 1 - I really love where the hotel is located - just a few minutes off the Ku'Damm in the very nice Charlottenberg (sp?) area. # 2 - While this is a tourist-class hotel, a business traveler would not be out of place. The staff are professional & friendly and the bar & restaurant area are very nice. # 3 - There is a nice little in-house sauna that is included with your stay (be familiar with attire norms) # 4 - They do a great breakfast buffet that goes a bit over & above most tourist Euro hotels, but . . . it is not included with the room in every price bracket and it is not cheap (E 14) BAD (room for improvement) # 1 - The rooms are typical Euro-small and not very modern. I didn't have a problem (how could I at E 46 / nite?) with this as they are well-cleaned, but be warned if you are picky. I was fine as I was traveling solo, but if you are not, you may feel a little squeezed. UGLY # 1 - The door locking procedure is a potential fire safety hazard and not secure. You get a metal key (that you have to leave at the front desk) that you use to unlock your door, but . . . unless you use the key to lock the door from the inside it stays unlocked! Likewise, if you leave your room you have to lock your door from the outside - just closing it will not lock it. I'm sure people miss that all of the time and I'd bet if you went down a hall and tried doors at random A LOT of them would be unlocked. Worse yet, if you do use your key to lock the door from the inside and can't quickly find your key you could be in effect 'locked IN' - a real fire hazard. BOTTOM LINE / RECOMMENDATIONS # 1 - I feel like this little tourist-class hotel is a good find. Compare similar priced hotels and you will struggle to top it. But . . . come with accurately calibrated expectations (that applies anywhere, really) # 2 - Take at least one night and eat close to the hotel - there are a number of great restauarants between the hotel on Uhlandstrasse and the Uhlandstrasse U-Bahn station (the closest U-bahn stop) A good hotel and solid value - a good base for exploring a great funky, vibey city! e-mail me at jefnac@hotmail.com", "Date": "October 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cheltenham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat Experience\u201d", "Author": "jeakel", "ReviewID": "UR5513848", "Content": "We have just returned from a one week stay at the Hotel Imperial Berlin and would comment as follows: The staff were always polite and smiling on the reception desk.

I found it almost funny that their welcome card suggests to use the safe, making me assume that there was one in each room. To be fair I've to mention that after having left Berlin they informed me that a safe was available at the desk, but you can guess how useful that info was to me at that point. The worst part anyway, was the lack of air-conditioning in the room, I'm still extremely surprised that a 3-star hotel might have rooms without it.
